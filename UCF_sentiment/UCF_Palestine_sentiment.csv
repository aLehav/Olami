The two female victims were sisters. Barakat and Yusor Mohammad were newly weds.\nNational media reported they were university students, Muslims of Arab descent and regularly volunteered in the area. Chapel Hill police arrested and charged their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, with three counts of murder after he turned himself in for the slayings. Police say the dispute was over parking spaces in their apartment complex.\nHicks described himself as an atheist on his Facebook page, criticizing religion and denouncing religious groups. After attention was drawn to Hicks’ Facebook page, civil rights advocates from the Muslim community declared it a hate crime, accusing Hicks of targeting the students for their Muslim faith. \nThe killings have sparked debate and controversy among the public, including students.\nUCF alumnus Rasha Mubarak, 29, and her husband planned the vigil as soon as they learned of the killings. Mubarak is Palestine American Muslim who serves as a board director at the Arab American Community Center and is newlywed herself.\n“I think what happened to three young American heroes, it shakes the core of the Muslim community and across the country,” Mubarak said. “This is very disturbing for many of us.”\nUCF alumnus and social worker, Drionne Arney, 24, sat on the grass waiting for the vigil to begin.\n“I feel sad,” Arney said. “As a black American woman, after everything that’s been happening in the news, I feel like we’re going through another civil rights movement that’s bigger than the one we know of.”\nThe vigil began at 6:50 p.m. While facing the guest speakers, children huddled together holding a banner with the victims faces, the trending Twitter hashtag, #MuslimLivesMatter, and a sign that read, “End Hate Speech, End Hate Crime #ChapelShooting.” \nTen representatives from various on-campus organizations introduced themselves in front of the crowd. Mia Warshofsky, a sophomore majoring in international relations and Spanish, was one of those representing her organization, Students For Justice In Palestine at UCF.\nAlthough she’s not part of the Muslim community, Warshofsky said she’s Jewish and felt “as a religious minority” she had to come out and show her solidarity.\n“It’s so sad,” Warshofsky said. “We like to think of America as tolerate, so accepting and to have three people killed like this… I want [the Muslim community] to not feel alone. Hatred will not win.”\nSeven speakers spoke at the vigil about the victims, including UCF alumnus Arthur Richards from ICNA Relief USA and David Williamson of Central Florida Freethought Community (CFFC). \nJillian Emily Pikora, a freelance writer, attended the University of North Carolina with two of the victims.\nPikora held back tears as she talked of the two sisters and how she broke Ramadan fast with a dinner at the Barakat’s home. After speaking, she broke down, wiping tears away as Mubarak took the megaphone.\nMubarak asked the police to investigate the killings as a hate crime. She also asked the attendees to email the local media in covering the Muslim community stating, “It took 10 hours for some media coverage.”\nVigils were held nationwide for the victims, including in downtown Miami and at the University of South Florida.\nThe three students, all shot in the head, were killed Tuesday.\n“It was over a parking spot. That’s questionable itself,” Mubarak said of the killings. “This vigil here is something [the three victims] would have planned. They would have been behind this mic.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2015/02/ucf-community-holds-vigil-for-three-muslim-students-killed-in-nc-shooting/'],0.7053455114364624,0.7415105700492859,0.5608978867530823

Weil said the trip also had a variety of religious denominations such as Greek Orthodox, Baptist, and Catholics. Weil said he plans on offering this trip every year.\n\n“The idea of the trip is to provide a three-dimensional experience in Israel for senior student leaders,” Weil said. “We don’t want to just show a Disney World version of all the things that make Israel wonderful. We also want to have the conversations on the challenges that Israel faces.”\nGray said he came to the trip with an open mind and just wanted to learn and experience as much as he could.\n“We were at the Golan Heights, which at one point was ISIS [Islamic State] controlled territory, and IDF [Israeli Defense Force] soldiers at the border of Israel and Lebanon and would allow ISIS soldiers who were injured in the country and give them free medical care,” Gray said.  “It was the beauty of the humanity in it; that these people can be at war in one minute and helping each other the next.”\nGray said the trip allowed them to hear both voices at the table firsthand without the media. A moment that came as a surprise to them was when they were able to speak to the Deputy Prime Minister of Palestine Ziad Abu Amr and hear his perspective.\n“Just having that discussion with him and talking about their view of America, because of America’s support for Israel, and of how America has interjected was very eye opening,” Gray said.\nMills shared a memorable moment when they had listened to a speaker from the Southern District in Israel.\n“She talked about how she had grown up in a very high missile territory, and there were bomb shelters within every 60 seconds that you could run too,” Mills said. “She talked about her house getting bombed in the middle of the night. In some moments when you are sitting there, you think what if the sirens go off right now?” Mills said.\nMills said seeing schools where both Jewish and Muslim students went was highly uncommon, despite this they had the opportunity to see one.\n“Despite this conflict, we saw peace and unity at a preschool where an Arab man married a Jewish woman and they started this preschool,” Mills said. “They have Jewish and Muslim students that all get taught at the same school and they now have five schools.”\n\nMills said the trip offered the ability to converse with politicians from Israel and Palestine.  She said the takeaway for her was even though there are vast differences between the two sides this as a major step forward for community growth and unity.\n “Schools are at the true core, and it’s how you change the conflict,” Mills said. “Because not only are the parents interacting the children are as well. It’s how you change the interaction, and it’s how you say why are we actually fighting? Where is the unity?”']",['https://knightnews.com/2019/06/sga-president-and-vice-president-ventured-to-israel-and-palestine-with-central-florida-hillel/'],0.9673141241073608,0.7041458487510681,0.4161204993724823
2689,UCF,2020-03-02,journal_data/txt/UCF/2020_03_02.txt,"['When a Palestinian-American activist heard that the UCF Student Government was introducing a resolution to prevent the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, she assembled a group to oppose it.\nIt is a predominantly Palestinian human rights movement aimed at pressuring the country of Israel to comply with international law and end its occupation of Palestine, according to the Palestinian BDS National Committee’s website.\nRasha Mubarak, a national political strategist and local activist, mobilized a team comprised of Jewish allies, UCF students and alumni, and black and brown immigration groups to appear at back-to-back senate meetings to make their voices heard.\xa0\nMubarak said an anti-BDS resolution would unfairly curb Muslim and other immigrant students’ rights to free speech, and that it goes against the spirit of UCF.\n“For a student governing body — whose peers include Palestinian students, people of color, and black and brown activists who are part of the voting block that helped them get elected and trusted them to not only represent them but to protect them — to present a resolution that would suppress and suffocate these communities’ rights to boycott and further marginalize them is the complete opposite of the golden rule that exists at UCF,” said UCF alumna Mubarak.\nSG Government Affairs Coordinator Zak Myers said a resolution, unlike a bill, does not change statutes or allocate funds. Instead, it serves to reflect a sentiment shared by the governing body of an institution — in this case, UCF’s.\nAt a time where universities around the U.S. are taking pro and anti-BDS stances, UCF SG held first reading to pass Resolution 52-05, which is “opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement at the University of Central Florida.”\nSG proposed the resolution under the same breath that it proposed, and later passed, the controversial Fiscal Bill 52-60, which voted to allocate $17,875 of student money to fund the right-wing political commentator Ben Shapiro to speak at the main campus and six UCF Police Department officers.\xa0\nMubarak and her group showed up to protest the resolution at the senate committee meeting on Feb. 6, the same night that another group of demonstrators also showed up to protest against the Ben Shapiro bill.\nThe proposer of the bill, Sen. Ben Rembaum, said amid so much controversy, he and the senate decided to postpone the anti-BDS resolution indefinitely — also known as “PPI” or “kill” the resolution — before the senate committee meeting even took place.\nAlthough Myers has said that SG is meant to be a strictly nonpartisan entity, some students said they feel like SG is leaning in a clear direction.\n“At this point, every time SG makes a ‘tough decision’ that ends up being contrary to our ‘core beliefs,’ I’m disappointed but not surprised,” said Shahaan Khan, director of political affairs for College Democrats at UCF. “The recent direction SG has taken with the bills they’ve been processing has been worrying.”\xa0\nSG supporters of the resolution said it was intended to be a stand against discrimination as a whole on campus.\nRembaum, a 20-year-old sophomore economics major, said the resolution was proposed in response to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks around college campuses in the U.S., though not specifically at UCF.\xa0\n“Even though this resolution says ‘Anti-BDS,’ it also targeted all forms of discrimination that go on in college campuses,” Rembaum said. “In my eyes and other people’s eyes, the people within the [BDS] movement at certain campuses caused discrimination and sometimes it caused violence, and I did not want that to happen to UCF.”\nOn the night of the resolution’s first hearing, Rembaum presented a slide show with images of an anti-Semitic white supremacist display that was reported on campus. The image showed the words, “LOVE not HATE,” with a swastika in place of the “O” for “LOVE,” and a Star of David in place of the “A” for “HATE.”\xa0\nThis confused Seema Azim, a UCF alumna of Afghan descent who attended the second hearing with Mubarak’s group. \nShe said the BDS Movement stands against the country of Israel’s politics to deny Palestinians their right to exist, not against the people of Israel or of the Jewish faith. Unlike white supremacy, which does.\n“It was kind of clear that people of the senate did not really understand what BDS was,” Azim said. “There were no Palestinian voices being considered, so all in all, it was a very one-sided approach. One-sided being that they believe BDS to be a discriminatory movement, which it is not.”\xa0\nRembaum, who said he joined UCF SG to serve as a voice for students, said he had not considered the other side of the argument when he’d presented the resolution. \nHe said that when he realized the resolution would do more harm than good, he began to change his mind.\n“I wasn’t able to talk to them about it beforehand because I don’t know many people in that community, and it’s hard for me to reach out to people I don’t know,” Rembaum said. “After hearing their concerns on the senate floor, after talking to them, after senate meetings and hearing their voices, I decided to kill the resolution.”\nMyers, who cosponsored the resolution, said it was meant to be preventative.\n“Not so much on UCF’s campus, but in a lot of other campuses around the country, we have seen a spike in the boycott divestment and sanctions of Israel, and just because a problem hasn’t been super present on our campus, that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening in other places or that it can’t happen at UCF,” Myers said.\xa0\nMyers also said the stance was supposed to be a pro-peace and pro-Israel act of support for the UCF Jewish community, and should not be seen as anti-Muslim.\xa0\n“BDS is almost inherently discriminatory, so I think that a lot of times there’s a lot of confusion with people who are pro-BDS,” Myers said. “Just because we’re doing something for the Jewish community does not mean the exact counter to that is something that is negative toward the Muslim community.”\nBut Grayson Lanza, a UCF alumnus of Jewish descent who attended the meetings as part of Mubarak’s group, said that standing for Israel does not necessarily mean standing for such a diverse community as the whole Jewish population.\xa0\nHe said anti-BDS resolutions and laws purposely weaponize Jewish identity in order to push a separate agenda.\xa0\n“Israel is often improperly associated, either in bad faith or by genuine misunderstanding, as representative and associative with all Jews,” Lanza said. “But not all Jews are Israeli, and historically, we were not for the most part, either. [They] claim it is to fight anti-Semitism; however, it is honestly anti-Semitic to conflate Israel with all Jews.”\nIn the end, when the demonstrators spoke at the committee, the senate assured them that they had already decided to kill the resolution and there was no need for further concern.\nMubarak, Azim and Lanza all said they still felt uneasy. Azim said she felt it would undermine first amendment rights to free speech for some students, in contrast to the Ben Shapiro bill, which passed namely on the arguments from supporters that it protects conservatives’ rights to free speech.\xa0\xa0\n“It’s scary because it kind of makes students — including me — feel like your entire school stands against your rights to express your concerns with human rights violations, and that’s not a nice feeling,” Azim said. “Standing up for oppressed populations already is isolating enough, and it can be marginalizing with a resolution like this on top of it. It would likely push students to not even talk about these things.”\xa0\nThat was Lanza’s main point at the committee meeting that evening. \nWhen he spoke, he made sure to stress the importance of SG including the entirety of the UCF community into these decisions — not just the few closest to them.\xa0\n“One of the most significant issues with the resolution was that there was zero effort from proponents of the resolution to discuss the matter with the UCF Palestinian community or the Orlando Palestinian community as a whole,” Lanza said. “These conversations so, so often erase Palestinians, and there is absolutely no denying that. Regardless of your opinions, Palestinians are the ones who suffer from the conflict the most.”\xa0\nMubarak recognized not adopting the resolution was good news but addressed the heavy responsibility of setting a premise on such dangerous rhetoric, arguing that it promotes xenophobia among students.\nShe said she fears for the future of UCF under divisive management and said she exhorts the student governing body to take accountability to heart.\xa0\n“When you introduce language like that, it takes seconds to further disenfranchise these communities,” Mubarak said. “As leaders, yes, you have power, but it is within you to decide if you want to divide or unify. And you have taken a stance to send a message of division, and within that division comes hate and violence against these communities.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2020/03/ucf-sg-kills-anti-bds-resolution-students-voice-concerns-of-sg-taking-a-right-wing-approach/'],0.017614834010601044,0.6205384135246277,0.026539763435721397
