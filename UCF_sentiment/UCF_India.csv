Beta denies its members committed any sexual misconduct, and has followed through on its promise to fight UCF’s decision in court.\nA Beta representative confirmed the official appeal will now move through Florida’s Fifth District Court of Appeals, where a final decision in the case will be made.\nCheck back for continuous updates in this case, and refer to our previous article below to see why the court rejected one of UCF’s arguments in the case recently.\nA decision about whether Beta Theta Pi will be allowed to recruit pledges at UCF — even though UCF found the fraternity in violation of sexual misconduct — could come down at any time now.\nKnightNews.com confirmed exclusively today that a judge with Florida’s Fifth District Court of Appeals ordered UCF to explain why the fraternity should not be allowed to recruit and operate normally until the court’s final decision on Beta’s appeal of its two year suspension is reached.\nBeta filed an appeal with the court to overturn UCF’s finding that the fraternity committed sexual misconduct. Along with the appeal, Beta filed a motion to stay, which asked the court to lift Beta’s suspension while the appeal is pending — in essense allowing the fraternity to operate like any other in good standing at UCF until the appeal is over.\nAccording to court records, UCF refused to file a “meaningful and substantive” response to Beta’s motion to stay and “show cause why stay should not be granted.” Instead, UCF filed a response arguing that the court didn’t have the authority to even consider Beta’s 50 page motion.\nThe court rejected UCF’s argument and ordered the university to file a meaningful response by noon today at the latest.\nKnightNews.com has confirmed that a UCF attorney delivered a response today and will continue closely monitoring this historic legal battle and the implications it may have on Beta’s fall rush and the future of the UCF student conduct process as a whole.\nView the related posts on the top right to get caught up on the history\xa0of\xa0this case.\nCheck back for updates — and be sure to be our fan on facebook to stay connected with the latest breaking UCF news.', 'Pegasus Palooza’s Monday event was a huge hit, as hundreds of students gathered at the UCF Venue to enjoy a very amusing show. \nThis comedy event began with an opening act from two of the guys of College Humor, Streeter Seidell and Jeff Rubin. They showed a few of their favorite pictures and videos that fans have submitted to their Web site, collegehumor.com, and even got interactive with the audience.  \nThree volunteers went on stage to participate in a little trivia game to win a $25 Apple gift card. \nThe first contestant was asked to name five Weird Al songs, which he was able to do with some help from the audience. \nThe second was a girl so she was given the only “girl question,” which was to sing a Hannah Montana song.\nShe ended up singing a few lines from about three different songs, but managed to get the prize. \nThe last contestant was asked what seemed to be the easiest question, but he still struggled with it for a bit. He had to say where the latest season of The Real World was taking place. After a few moments, and some shouting from the audience, he was finally able to say “Cancun.”  \nAfter the audience was all warmed up, the guys from Broken Lizard came out. With their ample use of profanity and obscenity, they kept the audience laughing from beginning to end. \nTheir entire show was composed of various smaller skits, which altogether lasted well over an hour. Their skits ranged from topics including masturbation, sex, drinking, drugs, parodies of the ancient Greeks and of computer help hotlines operated by people in India. \nSome of their humor was offensive, but that didn’t seem to bother anyone too much.  \nThe guys from Broken Lizard also had three volunteers go up to stage to help out. These had to read a short phrase with the best German accent they could do. After this, they participated in a small drinking competition against three of the guys of Broken Lizard. \nThe first participant had to empty his entire cup — of non-alcoholic beer of course — and then place his cup upside-down on his head before the next person in his team could do the same.

Abdul Kalam, the former president of India and an aeronautical engineer, gave a presentation entitled “World Space Vision 2050” to UCF students on October, 22 in the Pegasus Ballroom of the Student Union.\nAfter a brief introduction from President Hitt, Kalam asked what UCF students would be remembered for. He said that it would be something different; some out of the box missions, but that there were many possibilities as to what it could specifically be.\nThe list on his slide was as follows:\n-Visionary action for the nation\n-Creating an aerospace system for exploring Mars\n-Making solar energy from space possible and safely transmittable to Earth\n-Creating a lunar or Mars penetrator to find water\n-Unifying Earth, the moon, and Mars\n-Making Earth better with space technology\n-Utilizing valuable resources in our solar system\n-Becoming entrepreneurs of space technology\n-Conducting basic scientific research in space\n-Protecting space assets\n-Establishing competence in space human resources\n-Bringing down the cost of access to space\nHe then asserted the importance of viewing the globe as a single entity and establishing a world community. Kalam stated that the future of space travel lies in cooperation between the nations with space programs.\nThe next argument was that the Earth had two needs: Protection of the environment for living and energy.\nHe showed graphs detailing how the stratosphere is cooling and the troposphere was warming, and claimed that burning fossil fuels leads to 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. Though frightening figures, Kalam proposed that improved space technology can actually help the crisis, such as by helping us settle on Mars. In order for this space travel to improve, however, we need a dramatic reduction of cost, which he elaborated on later in the presentation.\nKalam then revealed his actual initiative, World Space Vision 2050, a three-part proposal to improve space travel and international relations.\nThe three facets were:\n-Large scale societal missions and low cost access to space\n-Comprehensive space security\n-Space exploration and current application missions\nKalam argued that the cost of access to space would be lessened over time by new advances, but also by introducing reusable launch vehicles (RLV), that can be launched more than once, thus reducing the number of space vehicles that need to be produced.\nThe RLVs would be able to lift off, like conventional airplanes, on runways and explore energy sources in space. Another cost-saving aspect of the RLVs is their ability to collect and liquefy oxygen in space, negating the necessity of returning to Earth for more oxygen.\nSpace satellite service stations would be created for all satellites in the GEO as a permanent international facility. These stations would extend the life of satellites by providing in-orbit maintenance such as diagnosis, replacement, recharging, powering, refueling, and de-boosting after use.\nHis next point was comprehensive space security.\nKalam made the distinction between “defense” and “security” by elaborating on his plan’s goal of protecting the Earth, not engaging in military competition. The proposed security involved averting dangers that arise, protecting space and global assets, prevent militarization of space, performing necessary space rescues, managing space debris, and monitoring and defending against asteroids.\nKalam then explained that steps can be taken now to ensure make these plans a reality. The first step is to use our current capabilities to undertake interplanetary missions. The second is to develop more international cooperation, especially on projects that go beyond a global scale. The third step is to continue exploring space, and trying to provide current applications to the missions that we undertake.\nIf these steps are taken, Kalam believes that, in addition to scientific knowledge and advances, space travel can bring peace.\nThere was still some time after his presentation ended, so Kalam answered a few questions from the audience.\nThe first question dealt with concerns over the history of mankind, such as wondering if colonies in space would ever fight for independence. Kalam responded by saying that we need to work closely with those who are both developing the colonies and working on the science behind it to make sure that it is not an issue.\nThe second questioner asked if “space law” would become clearer in the future. Kalam responded positively, claiming that enhanced communications through satellites would make developing the laws much easier than earlier laws, which did not have the advantage of satellite communications.\nThe third questioner asked how we should go about getting politicians involved, especially those who do not believe that space travel is a big issue. Kalam responded by saying that democracies just need to make sure that their officials back them on these issues, especially because space travel can help solve other issues, such as energy sources.\nThe fourth questioner asked if there was Indian Astronauts were being actively pursued, to which Kalam suggested that Moon and Mars landings would be a great possibility. More so than nationality, he claimed, people needed to view “Earth, Moon, Mars as a single complex,” as opposed to worrying about nationality.\nThe fifth questioner asked if it was justifiable to spend so much money on space programs if the nation is in poverty. Kalam responded by saying that the space program, such as the case in India, can actually improve poverty, by creating jobs and increasing communication to impoverished parts.\nThe sixth questioner asked if future space endeavors would be funded by the private or public sectors. Kalam responded by saying that a World Space Council would control the funding, which consists of many governments.\nThe seventh questioner asked how space traffic would be dealt with, citing the example of hundreds of satellites, to which Kalam responded by proposing bringing nations together to make sure that it is not an issue.\nThe eighth questioner asked if humans would be able to survive the travel to places such as Mars. Kalam responded by claiming the colonization to be a long-term venture, and that with proper training it would be possible.\nThe ninth questioner asked if students were contributing to the future of space travel, to which Kalam responded that they are.\nThe tenth questioner asked if any large Indian companies, such as Tata Consistency, were contributing to space travel. Kalam responded by saying 500 industries have.\nThe final questioner asked how space could be protected, considering many major space companies have ties to the military. Kalam responded by saying that there would be a multinational defense force in space, to prevent any one country’s dominance.', 'While sideline reporting for the UCF vs. Miami Football game, Knightnews.com had a chance to get a few questions in with UCF Director of Athletics Keith Tribble, and freshmen guard for the Knight’s Basketball team, Marcus Jordan. \nTribble expressed how important it was for the Knights to come out strong when playing against a ranked opponent on the national stage. \nUCF lost 27-7, but was still in the game right up to the fourth quarter, when the Hurricanes frankly just became too much to handle. When asked whether or not UCF was looking into switching over from Conference USA into the Big East, Tribble simply replied that our main goal as a program right now is to win Conference USA.\n\nMarcus Jordan was taking in the sights and sounds of Bright House Stadium before kickoff and confessed to knightnews.com that the weather was a little chilly for him. Jordan, a Chicago native, answered questions about adjusting to UCF, basketball practice, and his teammates. \nThe freshmen guard exclaimed the Knights’ objective this season is to take Conference USA. It won’t be an easy task though, the team is coming off a rough 09 season in which the Knights were 17-14 with a 6th place finish in Conference USA play. \nLast year, the Knights were the 4th youngest NCAA Division I Basketball team in the country, and now with no Jermaine Taylor on the team, the Knights will look for a more collective effort when looking to score. Players to look out for this season include freshmen Keith Clanton, junior A.J. Tyler, sophomore AJ Rompza, junior Taylor Young, and redshirt freshmen Dave Diakite. \nThe Knights open the season at home on Friday, November 13 versus University of Massachusetts.', 'UPDATE: 1:23 AM\nUCF released a statement saying “It is important to state that UCF Athletics did make adidas aware of Marcus’ recruitment and was led to believe that there would be a workable solution to a unique situation. We will continue to proceed with this understanding and the overall best interests of UCF Athletics and its student-athletes”.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nA few short months after UCF slashed programs and laid off faculty to save $4.6 million, it may lose nearly $3 million over Marcus Jordan’s shoes.\nUCF has a reported $3 million dollar deal with adidas requiring all UCF athletes wear adidas shoes and apparel.\nWhen Marcus Jordan was recruited, UCF promised the son of NBA legend Michael Jordan he could wear his dad’s Air Jordan brand by Nike, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\n“We talked about it,” Marcus Jordan told the Orlando Sentinel. “They said they had talked to the adidas people, and it wasn’t going to be a problem. I think everybody understands how big of a deal it is for my family.”\nThe big deal for Jordan has become a big problem for UCF. It was the front page, top story in today’s Orlando Sentinel. The paper reported adidas and UCF are at an impasse, and the shoe fight is hurting the contract renewal process for one UCF’s most important business partners.\n“There is no compromise, and the contract is currently under review,” adidas spokeswoman Andrea Corso told the Sentinel. “We are in negotiations for a future relationship regarding the broader UCF athletic program. What I can say is that these relationships are based upon agreed deliverables for both parties.”\nA UCF Athletics statement stated the school respects the adidas brand, and hoped to work through this “unique” circumstance and extend the deal.\nJordan told the Sentinel he has no disrespect for adidas and he’s fine with wearing the adidas uniform, and using all of the other adidas UCF gear, but when it comes to his shoes, “it’s a level of importance with the Jordan brand and my family” that’s making him stand firm.\nIf a compromise can’t be reached, UCF could end up having to pay for all of its clothing, shoes and equipment for all 15 Knights sports, according to the paper.\nWhat do you think should happen?\nSpeak out below:']",['https://knightnews.com/2009/10/former-indian-president-speaks-on-campus/'],"['Dr. A.P.J.

Glover was 35 at the time.\nAs part of a plea deal, Glover pled guilty to aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony against the 17-year-old, and prosecutors did not file the additional unlawful sexual activity charges, according to court records.\nPart of the plea deal required Glover to have “no unsupervised contact with any female under the age of 18. He had his ajudication withheld, and was then sentenced to 5 years of probation.\nGlovers’ arrest on Saturday, on charges of aggravated battery with great bodily harm, violated his probation, according to jail records. As a result, he’s being held without bond, so it appears the the Vortex Amazing may not be making its planned trip to Panama City for Spring Break anymore.\nEven though the Vortex facebook page claimed its last night in the UCF area would be spent at the Kappa Sigma house during fraternity rush, Glover ended up sticking around the UCF area over the weekend. And early Saturday morning, Robert Dean said he saw a side of Glover that will likely shock many UCF students — especially those who invited him on their front lawn.

We will let you know if and when these tickets are officially approved.\nDaniel Seeff and Kevin Wolkenfield were spotted outside of the UCF Student Union late Thursday afternoon, racing to get the required 500 signatures needed to declare candidacy before today’s deadline.\nIt’s still not clear which spot on the ticket — president or vice president —  Seeff or Wolkenfield will go for. KnightNews.com is working to get this information and will be there for the official declarations filings, which is expected at 5 p.m.\nWe will have much more on this major story as it develops.', 'For most of us the movies are a part of our lives. We watch them, we talk about them, we love them, but how many of us have dreamed of making our own?\nIf you’re like me then that thought has crossed your mind more than once. I see films and I think, “Hey, I could think of something like that,” or, “If I had the chance I could write something to make people die laughing.”\nWell that day is coming.\nThe Campus Movie Fest is going to be coming to UCF February 17th , with kick off starting at noon in the Student Union courtyard. The CMF is the worlds largest student film festival and was created with the purpose of giving students a way of realizing their goals and trying their hand at being a director. It was originally created by four Emory University students in 2000 but has since spread to schools across the nation.\nThe festival’s success lies in the way it deals with one of the main problems facing would-be filmmakers: equipment. CMF provides teams of students with an HD video camera, an apple laptop for editing, as well as the training needed to utilize them. All for free to any student at a participating university.\nFilms must be under five minutes and stay within the terms of use set forth by the competition but by and large teams can make whatever vision they have a reality. Steven Pfleegor, a UCF student participation in the event had this to say, “I’m really excited to be part of the festival. When I first found out about it I was a little skeptical but I looked into it and found out that it really is what it claims. I think it will be an amazing time and I’m hoping the film I make will live up to the idea I have in my head. I can’t wait to work my magic.”\nFilms will be entered to win in the categories of Best Drama, Best Comedy, and Best Picture. The top films from all categories will be showcased in a red carpet event in front of crowds of students. Winning teams will move on to regionals and nationals being eligible to win thousands of dollars worth in prizes and the chance to be seen by people all over the country. Everything entered will be put up on line for friends and families to see as well. Now only those entered on the website as part of the team may work on the editing phase but anyone is welcome to appear in your movie.\nNot only is this a tremendous opportunity for the next Spielberg but promising actors can show off their talent in front of the camera too.\n“I’m curious to creatively experiment with acting on camera. I’ll enjoy the opportunity to view the day’s film making in order to improve and perfect the desired message and effect.” said Zach Gossett, another student participating in the CMF. Many of us talk about how films out today are sub par and that given the chance they would be able to make something with a lot more potential.\nWell this is your chance and now is your time. Got an idea for a real sweet story that will make the judges tear up? Maybe you are more into slapstick humor that will have them falling out of their chairs laughing. Either way February 17th is fast approaching so get a move on and sign up at www.CampusMovieFest.com or you might be sitting there watching the next Internet hit thinking, “I could have done that!”']",['https://knightnews.com/2010/02/ucf-football-recruiting-class-signing-day-knights-orlando/'],"['It’s being billed as the best recruiting class in program history.\nWith 23 signees from three states among the 2010 recruiting class, the UCF Knights football program is hoping this crop of student-athletes will help raise the bar for years to come.\nAmong those becoming Knights under head coach George O’Leary during Wednesday’s National Signing Day were nine from Miami-Dade County; including five from Class 6A state runner-up Miami Central High School.\nThere were 18 signings in all that took place on Wednesday as five student-athletes had already enrolled at the school in January for the current semester.\nCommitments from the Central Florida area included quarterback Blake Bortles (Oviedo High School), defensive tackle E.J.

Mix will also be hosting a Halloween Party on Sunday Oct 31st from 12pm-4pm, and 20% of the proceeds will go towards the cause. \nThe party will include Halloween-themed festivities such as face-painting, as well as a special appearance from Mix’s mascot, Yo-man.  \nMix Frozen Yogurt opened in April, and is eager to get involved in the UCF area. “We like to give back- we want to be a positive force in the community. It’s not just about selling yogurt.”  Ricky Ly said, marketing director of Mix. \nKnight-Thon student director, Christina Vicari, says that Knight Thon jumped at the opportunity to partner with Mix when Ly contacted the organization and offered to host the fundraiser.\n“It’s a really great way to combine grabbing some FroYo with your friends and raising money for the kids.” Vicari said.\nChildren’s Miracle Network raises funds and awareness for children’s hospital throughout North America. According to their website, Children’s Miracle Network saves approximately 17 million lives per year through charitable care to children of various ages and backgrounds.  This is made possible due to donations by organizations such as Knight Thon.\nKnight Thon’s primary fundraiser is their annual 15 hour dancing marathon, also benefiting Children’s Miracle Network. Up until the marathon, which is scheduled for this upcoming February, Knight Thon will continue to raise funds by partnering with businesses like Mix.\n“We are hoping to continue on the growing path and raise $80,000 for the kids. Two years ago we jumped from $20,000 to $52,000 and last year we raised $65,000.” Vicari said. “I know we can continue on this path.”\nCome out to Mix Frozen Yogurt this Wednesday, located on the corner of Alafaya Trail and Colonial Drive, to support Knight Thon and Children’s Miracle network.

According to a press release sent out by SGA, individuals in the under-20 age group had the highest proportion of distracted drivers. \n“It is important that students become educated on the dangers of distracted driving,” said vice president Taylor Lochrane, who launched the campaign. “I hope this campaign prevents accidents caused as a result of distracted driving, and makes the university a safer driving environment.” \nLauren Rowe, of WKMG Local 6, was the moderator of the event, and the guest speakers included UCF Provost Dr. Waldrop, State Senator Constantine, a former Orlando Magic player, and a victim of an accident cause by a driver on the phone.\nPower 95.3 also participated in the event by playing music, while Lochrane and SGA officials handed out t-shirts, sunglasses, and other promotional items. \nLochrane’s “Put Down Ur Cell Fone” campaign is collecting petition signatures for the rest of the week.

The event is […] has been a center point of UCF philanthropy for the past six years. Rock the Wreath has grown from a small battle of the bands, to a concert hosting nationally touring acts.”\nRock the Wreath has hosted acts such as Hawthorne Heights, Mayday Parade, Between the Trees, Gym Class Heroes and We the Kings,” according to the site. Although it has traditionally been rock music, this year the fraternity decided to branch out to get more students involved, and brought out Big Sean, who is a nationally known artist. They even brought out opening act, Bezz Believe, one of Orlando’s up-and-coming rap stars and freestyle battlers.\nWith more than $60,000 donated to charities in Orlando since its inception, it’s clear that Rock the Wreath has a promising future, and has certainly earned a place at UCF as being one of the top philanthropies in terms of dollars raised.', 'PHOTOS BY KURT RIVERS\nLast night, veteran comedian Charlie Murphy, brother of legendary comic Eddie Murphy, brought his stand-up routine to the UCF Venue. UCF’s Campus Activities Board (CAB) hosted the event and tickets were free to UCF students. \nMurphy is probably best known for his legendary “Charlie Murphy’s True Hollywood Stories” sketches on Chappelle’s Show. \n\nYesterday’s performance was his first since his recent infamous performance at Grambling State University, in which the crowd in the middle of his performance booed Murphy. Murphy responded to response when he had his manager bring him the $22,000 check Murphy was paid with, only for Murphy to  “give it back” to the students by dropping the check on the stage and storming off.  \nMurphy seemed in better spirits during his act at the UCF Venue, which was nearly filled with UCF students. He started off his show by addressing his incident at Grambling State, explaining earnestly that his angry reaction came as a result of his own disappointment with not being able to please a college crowd. \n\nBut this time around, Murphy’s act was met with a warm reception, as he cracked the crowd up with the raunchiness he is known for. Most of his jokes were R-Rated, with topics of his humor ranging from sex to race to politics.  \n\nMurphy’s opening act, a longtime friend of Murphy’s named Freeze Love also delivered a crowd-pleasing set. His jokes poked fun at the differences between whites, blacks, and Latinos. Love’s performance was complemented by his impressions of each race, making each punch line that much more effective. \nThanks to Murphy and Freeze Love’s one-two punch of humor, CAB planned another successful comedy night. But if last night’s success could be pinned down to a single reason, it’s because Charlie Murphy redeemed himself as a comic, receiving a check well-earned from UCF. Thankfully, it stayed with his manager. \nSEE MORE PICTURES ON THE NEXT PAGE.']",['https://knightnews.com/2010/11/president-bush-sr-others-to-be-honored-by-obama-next-year/'],"['President Obama will be handing out the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a diverse group of 15.

Not because of intense studying, but because of intense pollution – the smog-filled air even had her coughing up black soot. Returning home, she was grateful for the clean air and water, and glad to be out of the heavily polluted environment of New Delhi, India. \n“When I returned, I felt that I had to try to do something in my little corner of the world to try and raise awareness about the importance of being conscious of our devastating impacts on the environment as a human species,” she said.\nAllen, a 22-year-old senior political science major, has since founded and now presides over the University of Central Florida’s Green Team. Starting with a goal to help the Political Science Department become more eco-friendly, Green Team has grown to take on the task of helping “UCF reach its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050” by partnering with the university’s Department of Sustainability & Energy Management (SEM).\n“When she came to the Department, Julie’s initial goal was to develop a program of energy efficiency, water conservation and recycling geared towards the faculty and staff members of the Political Science Department,” Alexandra Kennedy, SEM’s student outreach coordinator, said.\n“At the time, SEM was coincidentally working toward Energy Star Certification for our buildings, a prerequisite for LEED Certification,” Kennedy continued. “Energy Star Certification then became the central mission of the Green Team.”\nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification “provides independent, third-party verification that a building project is environmentally responsible, profitable and a healthy place to live and work,” according to the U.S. Green Building Council.\nAllen has helped SEM’s endeavors by forming a “student corps which accelerates the goals of the department by providing ideas, manpower and energy.” Green Team’s work towards achieving Energy Star Certification involves “measuring buildings, computing gross square footage, completing light and internal space audits, and encouraging behavioral change to save energy.”\nAllen has recruited fellow students to rally behind her mission. Her job as a resident advisor in Libra community’s Green Building helps her find other like-minded students.\nFreshman civil engineering major, Justin Kingsley is one of Green Building’s residents who joined Green Team after meeting Allen on move-in day. Kingsley is now the club’s secretary and is currently working on Green Room Certification for students’ residences.\n“Green Room Certification is basically when two or three people will come into a person’s dorm room and then survey the room for green appliances and things of that nature,” explained Kingsley.\nThe certification is currently only available for Green Building residences, but Allen hopes to offer it to “all on-campus residents in the spring in conjunction with SEM’s Kill-a-Watt initiative.” Her work in this area is bolstered by her position on the Housing Sustainability Taskforce.\nGreen Team’s historian, freshman nursing major Karina Grubbs, also met Allen as a Libra resident. The two developed a close relationship because of the similar goals they shared to make the university “a more environmentally friendly place.” Grubbs is specifically concerned with the harmful effects Styrofoam has on the environment and its use in campus cafeterias.\n“We’re in the process of planning a ban Styrofoam week,” Grubbs said.\nA recent move by UCF’s administration to attempt to relocate the Arboretum is also occupying Green Team’s man-hours.

She was recently accepted to become part of the Teach for America corps where she will begin teaching at an elementary school in Atlanta, GA next fall. \n“I hope to be able to work with my school district to help them save money through energy efficiency and maybe even develop some curriculum to teach my students about environmental stewardship,” Allen said. “The sky’s the limit!”', 'President Barack Obama’s effort to change the face of healthcare into what many have dubbed “Obamacare” faced a major defeat in court Monday when a federal judge in Virgina ruled the new law unconstitutional. \nU.S. District Judge Henry Hudson, who was appointed by George W. Bush, is the first to rule against the law, which other judges have upheld. So far, judges appointed by Republican presidents have ruled consistently against Obamacare while Democratic appointees have ruled in favor of it, according to the New York Times.\nBarack Obama\nThe major portion of the law Judge Hudson took issue with was the “individual mandate” requiring most Americans purchase health insurance by 2014. Insurance companies have said the only way they could afford giving extra care to additional people, including those previously turned away for expensive pre-existing conditions, was to force healthy people, like college students and recent grads, into buying healthcare they are less likely to use or need while being young and healthy. \nFlorida Attorney General Bill McCollum is also suing to stop the rollout of Obamacare. His successor, Pam Bondi, reportedly plans to continue fighting the law as well. \nThough Hudson’s ruling is a victory for those fighting the expanded healthcare, the judge declined the plaintiff’s request to freeze implementation of Obamacare until the appeals are finished. That means the ruling shouldn’t cause an immediate stop to the law’s rollout process, according to the Times. \nEarlier this year, some UCF student government officials found themselves fighting off efforts from UCF administrators to push for mandatory health insurance for UCF students. SGA members opposed to it argued it wasn’t fair to mandate an additional cost to students.\nKnightNews.com will continue following this major breaking news and update you with the latest developments.

Vote now!', 'The Campus Activities Board gave UCF students a great night of comedy on Thursday. Students ignored the terrible rainy weather, which had struck all day, and lined outside the UCF arena for national renowned standup comedian, Nick Swardson. Once the doors opened, students piled in making the arena a near full house. \nThe show started with opening act, Jay Larson. He was able to warm up the crowd with his jokes about being in the marching band and how there was a huge difference between being in “the band” and being in “a band” when it comes to impressing the ladies. He also went on to tell how he enjoys sneaking food into a movie theater and is able to get away with it by telling the employees he has diabetes. Finally he ended his half hour set with an amusing story of a group of business executives who had the wrong number and called him, and how we was able to convince them that he was one of their employees. \nThe next comedian to take the stage was Tommy Ryman, who was even funnier than the opener. He got the crowd laughing immediately after talking about his favorite show “The Deadliest Catch” and how it’s about a bunch of guys who catch crabs. He goes on to tell of how sometimes he likes to go down to the humane society and drop off stuffed animals, claiming they don’t love him like they used to and they should be put down. He ended his set strong, explaining how he enjoys making a bowl of soup with classical music in the background because it makes the process more epic and intense. \nFinally the moment everyone in the arena had been waiting for. Students yelled and cheered as Nick Swardson took the stage, making this his fifth appearance at UCF. Nick made quite the entrance as he jumped off the stage and proceeded to high five students in the first couple of rows.  He then went on to open up his set and goes on to praise the “gorgeous” Florida weather that he got to experience that day. Nick then goes on to talk about his amazement with how big of a school we are, boasting over 50,000 students. With such a large student body he jokingly asks why UCF students don’t gather together in a massive army like “Braveheart” and attack Disney World. He also explains how he wants to go to Epcot with everyone in the audience, each with a joint in hand, and smoke out the giant sphere in the park then push it down and roll it through Orlando. Nick also proclaimed his love for basketball and that he is a Magic fan because their name isn’t an animal like everyone else, but it’s something you can’t even see. \nThe audience cheered even louder when Nick claimed Florida as his number 1 party state. According to him, everyone in Florida loves to party, whether they are a baby doing a Jägerbomb or the old retired folks who just spend all their retirement money on booze. Then he describes his amazement with how many different kind of shots girls order at the bar. They are never regular shots he says, but rather something crazy like a “peanut butter burrito” shot.  \nStaying true to his love for partying, he explains his new fascination with day drinking. Just get really drunk by noon, he says, and then go about your regular errands throughout the day. Nick also touches on a topic that most college students have probably experienced once in their life. Waking up and receiving the “Are you alive?” text. He also points out an ad for Jack Daniels whiskey that he saw which read “Jack Daniels. Be Responsible.” Everyone in the audience agreed when he explains how being responsible in the last thing he can be on a Jack Daniels infused night. He goes on to say that the ad should be changed to “Jack Daniels. Good luck.” Nick also talks about a movie idea he wants to pitch that is based off of the blockbuster hit “Inception.” His version however is about invading wet dreams and it is called “Insertion.” He also describes his crazy life, living out in Los Angeles. The people there are different, he says. Some people are hardcore vegans and won’t even drink milk, but will more than happy do a line of cocaine. \nOverall Nick put on a stellar performance and certainly did not disappoint. He stayed true to his roots in potty humor, and entertained everyone with his crazy party stories. Students were treated to a lot of new material along with some of his classic jokes sprinkled in as well.

Miami and Rollins college were both in the 2010 rankings.\nThe playboy website wrote this when describing why UCF was ranked No. 9: “When you put 56,000 college students 20 minutes from downtown Orlando, you end up with an explosive mix of sun, sand and girls. UCF’s campus is well appointed (the dorms are akin to hotels), and though the school’s football team is unexceptional, prodigious tailgating makes up for any lack of athletic prowess. UCF students even get a discount on Universal Studios tickets. Sage advice from one student: ‘Never ride the Hulk drunk.’ Duly noted.”\nAccording to a playboy press release, the rankings were put together by Playboy’s editors with input from students, alumni and Playboy campus representatives.\n\nThe rankings and reference to great tailgate parties come after KnightNews.com started covering tailgates with our “Tailgate Fan Cam.”\nThe release also says the rankings additional factors like “male-female ratios, academics, and the winning percentage of their sports teams, as well as their proximity to beaches, ski slopes and lively music scenes,” were taken into account.\nThe University of Colorado at Boulder topped the list at No. 1. A big reason why, according to Playboy, is because half the students participate in a giant 4/20 smoke out day. See video of that event below:\nhttpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ9gwROSuGU\nHere’s the full top 10 Playboy party schools list:\n1.      University of Colorado at Boulder\n2.

But this wasn’t a setup for UCF alumni getting married on campus; it’s a lavish goodbye party embattled SGA President Michael Kilbride is throwing himself — courtesy of student activity and service fees.\nThe delay in producing requested records comes after UCF has so far refused to release an official copy of the scathing impeachment affidavit filed against Kilbride last week, alleging he should be kicked out of office for wasteful spending and questionable ethics. UCF may be breaking Florida Public Record law with this delay, if the delay is interpreted as illegal for taking longer than reasonably necessary to retrieve the records, redact and release them. \nThe alleged ethics violations in the impeachment charges centered around how Kilbride’s SGA did $50,000 in business — often without getting bids –with a company Kilbride admitted gave him a $2 per shirt deal for his campaign shirts. When KnightNews.com exposed the situation around the time of the SGA presidential elections, Kilbride issued a statement to KnightNews.com saying he does not condone pay for play activities and made it clear it would be his “final statement” on that matter. \nHe has released no further statement to KnightNews.com regarding the impeachment. KnightNews.com will work to find out more about the ceremony tonight, what’s on the menu and will try and track down Kilbride to interview him and ask why his SGA decided to spend money this way.\nSee a slideshow of the pictures below, just click Next Page on the bottom right to see the next one.

She has served as president of the Society for the Advancement of the History of South Asia. Currently, Rao is working on a project titled Dalit Bombay, which focuses on the relationship between caste, political culture and everyday life in colonial and postcolonial Bombay.\nRao said she tells her students that India’s affirmative action regime, dating back to the 1880s, in which “princely states in southern India used the argument that proportionally representation to provide jobs and education to lower castes had been excluded by the British Bureaucracy”.\nIndia tried different methods to manage the country’s complex and repeating forms of diversity by presenting the idea of equality through multifaceted multi-religious, multi-ethnic and deeply hierarchical social order. In other words, producing social revolution through legal means.\nIndia has a large demographic of lower castes and dalits, or ex untouchables in which they have been challenging the control of schools, jobs, government and representation of media by the social elite and upper caste.\n“In order to understand Indian democracy, you have to understand the caste. The caste has been central to the way that Indian democracy has worked, caste has been central to the way that people have tried to produce democracy in India,” Rao said.\nGhandi believed reform required the repent of Hindus against such caste systems, not through political solutions, stating that the practice of untouchability dehumanizes those who practice it, not the individual who endures it. .\n“Effort to give the untouchables separate representation in 1932, failed because of the spectacular fast into death undertaken by Ghandi which became a global issue, and everyone, of course, wanted to make sure that Ghandi does not die,” Rao said.\nThis was opposite to B.R. Ambedkar, one of India’s most radical thinkers, and also an ex untouchable, or dalit, India’s first law minister and chairman of drafting committee of India’s consitution. Anti-caste radicals, the tradition that Ambadker came from, were inspired from new world struggles against racial servitudes.\n“Anti-caste radicals draw typologies of race, and argue that the relation between upper castes and lower castes was like a racial conflict between black and white,” Rao said\nThe language of slavery was also used to describe sexual subjugation, and Ambadker compared life on African American plantations to the caste system. History of emancipation in the Americas gave multi-caste and anti-caste radicals a different approach to the Hindu upper caste cultural nationalism.\n“These were global thinkers and global people who may have not traveled physically but they did indeed travel in their thought very widely,” Rao said.\nThe dalit approach was to take the practice of untouchability outside of religion and into social and political inequality.

This in a sense has been the history of the relationship between caste and democracy”', 'Coming off a a 16-31 loss to the #12 Ohio State Buckeyes(2-0), the Knights(1-1) are looking to shake off the early season loss, and win their first home game of the season against FIU(1-1) which will be played at Brighthouse Stadium at 4pm on Saturday.\nLast season, the Knights were caught off guard by the FIU Panthers in Miami, where two costly fumbles put the dagger in the Knights promising season.\nThis season, however, the Knights have an entirely new look. The man who was once behind center, Jeff Godfrey, is now lining up in a wide receiver slot, as Blake Bortles has taken the reigns at quarterback. Bortles, who threw three costly interceptions that seemed to change the momentum in the Ohio State, will need to move forward as he gets to start for the first time at Brighthouse Networks Stadium.\nThe Knights have had lots hype surrounding their program this season, as they were picked as the favorites to win the C-USA\xa0East Division receiving 13 out of 15 votes for first place. This game is no exception, UCF fans are looking for a big win tomorrow.\nScouting Report UCF:\nBortles will need to regain his swagger against FIU if the Knights want to win this one. After throwing three interceptions and being noticeably shaken up about it after the Ohio State game, Bortles is in a great position to restore his confidence. A solid first quarter touchdown pass in front of a huge cheering crowd and against a defense that has given up over 600 pass yards in two games should have Bortles back into prime form.\nUCF star running back Latavius Murray will be inactive for his second straight game. Coach George O’Leary told the Orlando Sentinel, ”\xa0“He’s out…He’s not in this game plan and is week-to-week.”\nThe loss of Murray is substantial, but from a glass half-full perspective, running back is the Knight’s deepest position. Miami transfer Storm Johnson has transitioned nicely putting up quality numbers in both the Akron and Ohio State game. Behind Johnson, veteran running back Brynn Harvey will provide stability to the rushing attack with freshman Cedric Thompson rounding out the rotation. Look for Johnson and Harvey to share carries, with Harvey used primarily as a short yardage back.\nThe Knights defense shouldn’t be anything to be worried about, but if they can stay level-headed and not allow the Panthers to capitalize on mistakes, they should have no problem containing the FIU offense.\nScouting Report FIU:\nMiami Herald sources report that senior linebacker Alex Robinson could be out for the game. This could be big, a defensive leader for the Panthers out of the game could open up lots of opportunities for UCF to score.\nRedshirt sophomore quarterback Jake Medlock will start for the Panthers as they hope for the spread offense to work against the UCF defense. Medlock has been quite impressive this season, as he has thrown for 557 yard and three touchdowns(0 INTS) in two games.\nThe FIU defense gave up 46 points against Duke and 38 points against Akron. The FIU defense will need to improve exponentially in order to keep in close with UCF.\nFinal thoughts:\n-Some would consider the Ohio State game a “moral victory”, but moral victories are still loses. UCF needs to set the tone early in order to keep this season’s high expectations alive.\n-If Bortles can shake off the interceptions from the Ohio State loss, look for him to have a career day against the sub-par FIU defense.\n-The student ticket demand was near an all-time high for this game, look for the FIU offense struggle to hear play calls. The FIU stadium had a home attendance of roughly 15,000 versus Akron. A 50,000 person Brighthouse Stadium with aluminum bleachers will sure to cause trouble for the FIU offense.\nFinal score:\nDespite the Ohio State loss, overall the Knights have looked poised for a great season in their two away games. A struggling FIU defense, the first home game of the season, and FIU missing a piece of their defense will allow UCF to dominate the game. The UCF Knights will win this one with ease. UCF Knights 42, FIU Panthers 14.\xa0\n\xa0', 'UCF is on alert this afternoon following threats to threats at two university campuses in other parts of the country, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\nThe Sentinel reports that bomb threats at universities in Texas and in North Dakota prompted evacuations.

It was later brought to Japan by Dr. Kombu to treat the Japanese emperor, Inkyo, for digestive problems, and it later spread to Russia, India and Europe. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel far to achieve immortality; Central Florida based Farm Boy Produce brews and sells it locally.\nEssentially, kombucha is fermented green or black tea comprised of a sea of health giving organic acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and nutrients. It also contains healthy bacteria in the form of Lactobacillus Acidophilus, as well as a dozen other probiotic strains. Kombucha carbonates naturally once bottled because it continues to ferment and release carbon dioxide that becomes trapped.\n“One of the byproducts is cellulose, as the stuff ferments, you have this production of the cellulose which ultimately accumulates on the surface layer and actually forms like a gasket on the surface, which is almost completely impervious, even with a really sharp knife its tough to slice through it, and its just the cellulose network that people refer to as the kombucha, mushroom,” said Mark Bevilaqua, founder of Farm Boy Produce, and producer of kombucha.\nSome of the benefits to drinking kombucha are that it improves digestion, boosts energy, improves circulation, prevents acid reflux, improves sleep, and it boosts the immune system.\nAccording to Food Research International, Russia conducted a series of studies in the 1900s and mid 1900s .One study was based on a remote area of Russia that was poverty-stricken, therefore had shortages of food, but the people were big consumers of kombucha. Scientists found that the people consuming kombucha in this area had no instances of cancer, and had healthy immune systems. During World War I, Russia’s secret home remedy was referred to as the “Wonderdrink” because it helped treat headaches, gastric illnesses, and regulated intestinal activity.\n“Ultimately the results of these studies were released and then they were tested and actually proven, in Netherlands, Germany, Poland, the news or the knowledge that kombucha, that fermented tea ultimately cures, prevents, cells from mutating, increases immune system function, all this stuff that has been proven by multiple scientific groups for almost half a century, basically the knowledge has been there,” said Bevilaqua.\nHowever, not all kombucha is made the same. The benefit of buying locally brewed kombucha is that it is not pasteurized. Mainstream kombucha available on store shelves are all pasteurized, therefore killing off all the beneficial bacteria. According to Bevilaqua, it’s like drinking soda with b vitamins.\nFarm Boy Produce uses reverse osmosis system, filtered water with the lowest dissolved solids, organic tea and sugar bought directly from producer or distributor. Their kombucha is available on draft or bottled in the following flavors: ginger soda, honey ginger, honey mate, yerba mate, spiralina, grape and apple cinnamon. You can find it on draft at Drunken Monkey or Redlight Redlight Beer Parlour. Bottled kombucha is available at Audubon Park Farmer’s Market, Hoover’s Market and Homegrown Co-op.', 'The current process of removing a tattoo is painful and time-consuming, typically requiring 10 sessions or more of laser treatment.\nSize, color, and location matter when it comes to wishing to remove a tattoo quickly and, most importantly, successfully. About 22 percent of U.S. college students have at least one tattoo. With the traditional laser treatment, it could take years to entirely remove tattoos, according to recent research from Italy and the U.S.\nSpecifically, yellow and blue pigments are immensely difficult to remove, and smoking actually makes complete removal almost impossible. The latter is due to it affecting certain cells of which ink in the body is dependent upon for removal.\nHowever, a new laser device is being tested by U.S. Researchers, and offers shorter pulses lasting about a picosecond rather than a nanosecond, the traditional amount of time—meaning it can cut down the amount of sessions required to remove a tattoo. Students involved in a Massachusetts research study using the laser were immensely satisfied by the results. The researchers are anxiously awaiting the Food and Drug Administration to approve the new device.\nAlyssa Syme, a Junior majoring in literature and binary education at the University of Central Florida, said she doesn’t care about the frequent, continuous treatments removing a tattoo would require. She is in the process of removing one, and it is fading but she said she may have to have four more sessions of laser treatment.\n“It’s painful but [each session] just takes 10 minutes,” Syme said. “Where skin peels, it’s harder to remove.”\nRossi Kostova, a Junior majoring in forensic science at UCF, doesn’t intend to remove her tattoos and feels that no one should. Her view is that, in one point in time, one liked the tattoo enough to get it and should therefore keep it.\n“I think if you want it, you won’t regret it, and I don’t think you should remove it,” Kostova said. “If you were to hate a tattoo, get a cover up—it’s not as ugly as scars. Removing tattoos is expensive.”\nTod Foster, a Junior majoring in political science, doesn’t intend on getting his tattoos removed either, so the long, painful process it takes to do so doesn’t change his opinion in the slightest way.\n“I wouldn’t get a tattoo if I didn’t want one,” Foster said.']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/10/kombucha-your-way-to-better-health/'],"['It seems like a lot of us are grasping for the next big health kick, whether it’s embracing a new exercise routine, or opting for organic produce.\nYou can now add kombucha to the list, a naturally carbonated tea that is a smarter and healthier option to carbonated sugar water.\nKombucha has been around for thousands of years, dating back to 221 B.C during the Chinese empire of the Tsin-Dynasty, and they called it “the remedy for immortality” or “the divine tische”.

It’s a weaker group against bigger group- the government,” Matusitz said.\nMatusitz uses his text Terrorism and Communication: A Critical Introduction to teach a terrorism and communication course at the University of Central Florida, which is one of the few classes offered across the nation. He is originally from Belgium, and moved to the United States in 2000, and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Oklahoma in 2006. He has 95 academic publications, has done over 100 conference presentations, and taught at a NATO-affiliated military base in Belgium in 2010.\nTerrorism, he said, “is all about communication, you’re just making a statement, right? This is who we are.”\nThe practice of terrorism is 3000 years old; originally it was called regicide, referring to the assassination of kings. However, the very first terrorist groups based on the Quran were called assassins, derived from the Arabic word Hashishin or users of hashish.\nOld terrorism, he said, was very discriminate, they believed no innocent civilian should die, like the IRA, Irish Republican Army. But new terrorism is indiscriminate, and Al Qaeda is the epitome of new terrorism.\nMatusitz defined four waves of terrorism: first wave took place before the 1920s consisting of dynamite assassinations; the second wave was from the 1920s to the 1960s, the third wave is from the 1960s to 2000 when hijacking began to occur, and the fourth wave propelled by Al Qaeda.\n“The $64 question: what causes terrorism,” Matusitz asked.\nReligion, he said, is the number one cause, “the leader of the 9/11 hijackers was Egyptian, and he had the Quran in his suitcase that they found in the debris. Suicide bombers read versus from the Quran before going on a killing spree.”\nOther causes he listed are: oppression and humiliation, historical grievances, violation of international law, relative deprivation, hatred of global empowerment—“in Pakistan KFC gets blown up everywhere” — financial gain, racism, supporting sympathizers, narcissm, sensation seeking, failure of conventional channels of communication, communication and publicity.\nTerrorism, he said, as a communication process is achieved through social noise, signature method and as a conduit metaphor.\n“Every terrorist group has its own way of communication, their operation, so that you can recognize it, and they like it,” Matusitz said.\nAn example of the signature method was the beheading of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by Al Qaeda, he said, it is based on the Quran chapter 47 verse four.\nA conduit metaphor is the use of media as “a channel to air grievances”.\nMatusitz said, the Tehran Embassy hostage crisis in 1979 gave birth to CNN with Night Life, because they talked about it 50 percent of the time, it was free publicity for Shiite Muslims.\nOn September 11, 2001, three billion people were watching, he said, “ it was the most watched incident in world history, more than the world soccer cup, and the Olympic games combined.”\nMatusitz addressed new media, and how terrorist groups “exploit Internet and social networking sites to publicize their goals and objectives.”\nHe showed visuals from Al Qaeda online magazines catered to men who speak English to inspire how to make a bomb.\n“It’s almost like the 12 steps of weight loss of south beach, but you have the 12 steps of how to make a bomb in your kitchen, apparently its very easy,” Matusitz said.\nAnother visual was catered toward women, “how to marry a suicide bomber”.\nMatusitz also described the concept of understanding symbolism.\n“Unless you know your enemy, you won’t get it, principle of warfare ‘know thy enemy’,” Matusitz said.\nHe counted the 911 days from March 11, 2004, an attack by Al Qaeda from Morocco in Madrid, Spain, and September 11, 2001.', 'UPDATE The project now has all the team members necessary.\nUCF students take great pride in their community service work, whether it is providing food for the homeless, giving gifts to underprivileged families during the holidays or even playing a game of bingo with the local shelter.\nSo it comes to no surprise that one UCF student has plans to open the transparency of charitable donations and provide students with an easier access to donate.\nErica Tuttle, a UCF student, has been collaborating on a project she envisioned being brought to UCF’s student union. Named the “Donation Station,” the idea is simple: an interactive kiosk where students and faculty can donate to established charities around the world. \nThe donation station will provide an easy to use system where people can make a  $5+ donation (which will be tax deductible) to a charity of their choice. After donating, a photo of an individual that has been helped by the selected charity will be printed out. The photos will be taken by social workers affiliated with each cause  and will portray the beneficiaries smiling or making goofy faces. After receiving their print out donators will be able to take an optional photo and write an encouraging message back to the individuals being helped. \nThe project is hoping to reach out to students looking to help in order to make it happen. \n“The machine has yet to be built and is still in its infancy so any students willing to join the team will have a major impact in its creation,” Tuttle says. The project is on hold until $2900 can be raised, which pays for the cost of the machine and shipping to Florida. \nPlease contact Erica Tuttle at Ericatuttle428@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or would like to get involved.']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/10/student-opera-club-surprises-with-flash-mob-in-union/'],"['Students enjoying “Music Monday” in the Student Union heard more than the familiar sounds of the Union’s piano, thanks to the Student Opera Club.\nAbout 15 members of the club surprised unsuspecting students with a flash mob, performing their rendition of “Libiamo ne’ lieti calici”, from the opera “La Traviata.”\n“The Student Opera Club has always kind of existed but no one has ever done anything with it,” President of the Student Opera Club Daniel Johanson said.

Hitt. Reports put President Hitt at 9th among highest paid university presidents in the nation. A vote to increase his salary would likely give his base pay an extra $26,000 annually. Hitt also reportedly enjoys other incentives included in his total compensation package.\nPresident Hitt did not answer questions regarding UCF’s plans to give him a raise at the open forum, but Vice President Bill Merck stated that President Hitt deserves the salary increase because of his great efforts at UCF.\n“You’ve got one of the top presidents in the country here at UCF, Dr. Hitt, I’ve not seen anybody that’s done a better job for their university than he has,” said Merck.\nMerck also discussed the need for a tuition hike amid budget cuts, essentially concluding that in order to sustain quality education among state budget reductions, tuition needs to be increased.\n“You come here for a quality experience, we want to make sure you get it; we cant do it without raising tuition if the state continues to decrease the funding,” Merck said.\nSGA President Cortez Whatley serves on the UCF Board of Trustees and will be one of the voting members on President Hitt’s salary increase at the upcoming meeting.\nCurtis Hierro, a graduate student at UCF, went to the forum to discuss his disdain for what he considers the lack of true representation of the student body by school leaders. He also believes Whatley should vote against the salary increase, especially after having voted to raise student tuition only the maximum 15% possible.\n“If he is going to sit there and vote to increase President Hitt’s salary that would be a slap in the face to the entire student body,” he says.\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott is scheduled to meet Wednesday, November 7, in Sarasota with the Florida Board of Governors who oversee Florida universities to discuss his stance against tuition hikes.\nWe will have more on this meeting later this week.

Hawker’s Asian Street Fare is a palatial monument among these other restaurants and I mean this literally.  The outside of the restaurant and entrance give off the feel of entering an ancient Chinese palace.  Luckily, the architecture was not the only impressive feature here; the food was nothing short of off the chain.\nThe shear breadth of the menu covers a variety of Asian culinary styles including Malaysian, Thai, Japanese, and Chinese.  This means that you can find everything on the menu from noodle bowls to curries to skewered meats.  On top of this the restaurant also has some impressive fusion elements like their tacos and bánh mì sliders.  With all of these different items to look through you can only imagine how long it took me to place an order.  After completing my meal though it was readily apparent that anything I would have ordered would have made this a memorable, delicious meal.\nAfter much internal debate, I decided to begin with chilled tofu and roast duck tacos.  I normally am not the biggest tofu fan; however, this tofu dish had a sweet soy sauce, fried garlic, and cilantro that when mixed together truly showed me what a great flavor sponge tofu is and how enjoyable its silky texture can be with an open mind.  Now let me preface this and say that I am a believer that a tortilla shell is the perfect vehicle for any meal, so you can only imagine my bubbling excitement as I moved on to the roast duck tacos.  The duck was undeniably tender, the vegetables were crisp and added a welcomed textural contrast, and the hoisin dipping sauce really rounded out the dish.  Needless to say, I had the biggest smile on my face after each and every bite of that magnificent taco. \nYou might be asking yourself at this point, “How do you top a taco like this?” The answer lies with Malaysian prawn mee.  For all of you familiar with ramen, this is essentially a Malaysian version of that.  It was filled with egg noodles, jumbo shrimp, chicken, a boiled egg, bean sprouts, and yow choy (a green similar to bok choy).   All of these components on their own were cooked to perfection, but the real star of that bowl was the spicy prawn broth.  I can barely put in to words the depth of flavor they achieved in this chili oil laced liquid.  The only possible explanation is that they kidnapped a master broth maker from Malaysia and he stands in the kitchen all day making and keeping a watchful eye on this concoction.  At least that is my best guess.    \nFor the grand finale of this already exceptional meal, I decided to go with a dessert I had seen on multiple food and travel shows that I had been itching to get my hands on.  This mixture of powdered ice, pineapple, red bean mix, lychee, grass jellies, taro, sweet condensed milk, and different sweet syrups is known as ice kachang and it is one of the oddest dishes I have ever seen or eaten.  Honestly, it resembled something from a Candy Land board game, but for all of its oddities it is absolutely addictive!  The key is getting the perfect mix of each component to create the perfect bite and then one can understand why it is so popular Far East.\nDo you want to hear the best part about this meal?  It only cost me around $23.00 (not counting tip) for all four dishes!  Hawker’s gives you the opportunity to eat delicious, well prepared food for a price nothing sort of affordable.  Not only this, but their menu is friendly towards all culinary walks of life ranging from meat-centric individuals to those who fancy the greener, vegetarian options out there.  I for one will be going back in the very near future to start my pilgrimage across the menu in its entirety.  So head over to Hawker’s with your friends, have some drinks, some laughs, and enjoy the food they have to offer!\nAddress: 1103 North Mills Avenue Orlando, FL 32803\u200e, Phone #: (407) 237-0606.

The site aims at  helping “sugar daddies” meet “sugar babies.” Originally aimed at putting local college students in touch with “sugar daddies” and “sugar mammas,” SeekingArrangements.com now works on a national level with hundreds of postings in both parties.\nThe site provides in-depth information on how exactly it works.\n“Because of how our society works, it is awkward for someone to walk up to another to ask them if they would like to get involved in a Mutually Beneficial Relationship. That is where SeekingArrangement.com comes in. Our website provides a secure place for like-minded Sugar Daddies, Mommies and Sugar Babies to meet each other,” the website states.\nA sugar baby is a young female or male who is financially pampered/cared for by a sugar daddy or sugar mama in exchange for companionship. A “sugar daddy” or “sugar momma” is a professional businessman or businesswoman who serves as a “mentor, sponsor or benefactor” to that younger man or woman.\nThe top ten sugar baby universities in the country are:\n1. Georgia State University\n2. New York University\n3. Temple University\n4. University of Central Florida\n5. University of South Florida\n6. Arizona State University\n7. Florida International University\n8. University of Georgia\n9. Indiana University\n10.

I’m not necessarily saying these are the best movies 2012 gave us, or that my number one should win best picture. These are just the five movies that stuck out to me the most, and the top movies that made me immediately want to watch it again.\n5. Safety Not Guaranteed Not many have heard of this film, but it is one that I believe the average movie viewer would really enjoy. It follows the story of a journalist intern, played by Aubrey Plaza, who is  investigating a story of a man looking for a partner to time travel with, played by Mark Duplass. It was nice to see Mark Duplass, best known for The League, on the big screen and I hope he is in more feature films to come. It’s a lighthearted, entertaining, and ultimately uplifting story with one of my favorite endings of the year. It’s funny, emotional, and I walked away feeling something. And that is what is ultimately important.\n4. The Hobbit\nBeing blown away by almost every aspect of the movie, I had to put the Hobbit on my\nlist. It being the first in a trilogy, the only reason it isn’t higher on my list is because the movie was mostly exposition and explaining what was yet to come. Now that’s not to say it didn’t have its fair share of action and story. The set designs, costumes, and special effects were breathtaking, and you could really tell all the hard work and appreciation that Peter Jackson put into it. Many felt it was boring comparing it to Lord of the Rings, but you have to remember it’s the first in a trilogy, and looking back Fellowship of the Ring was very slow compared to the next two. It was a visual masterpiece, great storytelling, and left me really excited for the next two parts to come out.\n3. Django Unchained\nIt’s always a special experience seeing a Quentin Tarantino film on the big screen. Like I said with Peter Jackson and The Hobbit, when watching a Tarantino movie, you can tell all the love that went into making it. All the performances were great, like all his other movies. This is probably his most action packed film since Kill Bill vol. 1, and it may have, if not more, blood than that movie. Some scenes are definitely not for the squeamish, and Tarantino held no bars with gore and the depiction of slavery. As long as you take it for what it is, you will have a great time with Django Unchained, seeing some of the best performances of the year, complimented by one of the year’s best scripts.\n2. Zero Dark Thirty\nI can’t remember the last time I was so on the edge of my seat in a movie theater. This\nmovie was one of the best executed I’ve ever seen, showing an obvious technical proficiency in film. Politics aside, it’s hard to deny that Zero Dark Thirty was a sight to see. The torture scenes may be hard to watch for some, but I don’t think they are anything too extreme. My jaw was dropped the whole third act and the intensity was something only one could experience. It is definitely one you don’t want to miss on the screen.\n1. Cabin in the Woods\nThis was easily the most original film I saw all year, possibly in the last five. If there is any movie advice I can give you, it is go see this movie, and don’t do any research on it. It is one that you do not want to spoil for yourself. I’m not even that big a fan of the horror movie genre, but Cabin in the Woods will easily go down as one of my favorite movies of all time. I was so pleasantly surprised with what the movie became, and its bold filmmaking that is lacking in Hollywood today. If I had to choose one Oscar snub of the year, it would be the screenplay of Cabin in the Woods.']",['https://knightnews.com/2013/01/ncaa-to-hear-ucf-appeal-of-football-postseason-ban-thursday/'],"['UPDATE\nUCF’s appeal hearing before the NCAA is complete.

A bright spot for the Knights is the improved attendance they’ve had for the series, 4,602 fans is the ninth-highest weekend attendance rate in school history.\nThe Knights have plenty of new faces and breakout players on the roster for this season. Senior Chris Taladay got off to a hot start this season, batting 7-8 in the first two games. Danny Davis, a right-handed pitcher out of Pensacola State College, had a stellar debut for the Knights, going seven innings and only allowing one unearned run in Sunday’s 8-2 decision versus Siena.\nCoach Terry Rooney told UCFAthletics.com, “He was in that starting rotation today for a variety of reasons, but because he had dominated the strike zone all preseason. I thought Danny did a fantastic job.”\nComing off of the series win against Siena, the Knights will need all of the momentum they can get. On Tuesday, the No.15 Florida Gators will travel to Orlando to play in the Knights in a winner take all, one-game series.\nFans are urged to purchase tickets ahead of time through UCFAthletics.com, or calling by 407-823-1000. The last time the Florida Gators traveled to Orlando, the single game attendance record was shattered. As always, student seating is on a first come, first serve basis. ', 'Recently I’ve come to a realization; Mills Avenue is a culinary gem within the city of Orlando. Most of its restaurants specialize in the Asian culinary spectrum with a few exceptions here and there, but wherever the food is being braised, roasted, cured, pickled, etc. it’s always memorable. Hell, there is even a grassroots organization known as Mills 50 comprised of local business owners aimed at preserving the unique urban flavor of this area. When you talk to anyone about the restaurants on Mills though, there is always one that people told me I absolutely have to try; Tako Cheena. This Asian-Latin fusion hot spot has won rave reviews around these parts and it is also the brainchild of the owner of another local favorite, Pom Pom’s Teahouse. So after a couple of years of blowing off going, I decided it was time for me to get off my lazy butt and get my taco fix.\nPulling up to the restaurant, I could not help but chuckle inside a bit. The outside resembles a tattoo shop with its bright red paint and font selection for their sign and beneath the sign it reads, “Dim Sum Good Takos.” Honestly, with a quirky play on words like this on the window, how could you not already like this place? Luckily the quirky, artsy theme does not end with the exterior of the building. The interior is lined with beautiful art that can be purchased as well as a colorful chalkboard menu (always a plus in my book). Even the staff looks like they should be sitting behind a canvas creating masterpieces rather than serving food or cooking and I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them did this in their spare time. Like any restaurant worth its salt though, the real star of the show is the food.\nFor starters, the menu is not an extensive one which generally for me is a plus. I find that big menus sometimes cause the quality of certain dishes to decline and a smaller menu makes it easier to maintain quality throughout a service. The selection offered consists of tacos, hot dogs, burritos, an empanada that changes on a weekly basis, and a couple of desserts. The most extensive part of the menu was the impressive sauce selection. I decided to go with panko crusted cod tacos, a Korean hot dog, and an Indian butter chicken burrito. Needless to say, the waitress was perplexed as to how my one hundred and forty pound frame would survive this eating event.\nThe fish tacos (my favorite part of the meal) were clean and simple. There were no twenty-six ingredients covering a piece of fish that required a microscope to know it was even there. The fish was crispy and seasoned well, the cabbage added extra crunch, and the sweet and sour onion sauce had a nice creaminess and tang about it that the fried fish needed. Their play on a hot dog was one of the quirkier things on the menu that was far different from what we ate as kids but still somehow brought back a sense of childhood nostalgia. In place of a traditional hot dog they used a Chinese sweet sausage that on its own was a little too sweet for my taste but when eaten with the other components of the dish I enjoyed. There was a bit of cabbage, spicy mayo, sesame seeds, cilantro, and the always delicious mix of fermented vegetables and spices, kimchi.\nNext up was the burrito, which if I’m being completely honest was not my favorite. The slightly spicy curry and Mexican crema coating everything was delicious, but the ratio of grain to meat and vegetables was way, way off. The tortilla was filled with chicken, chickpeas, cilantro, and sweet potato but if you wanted to get a nice, uniform bite you had to make your way over a mountain of jasmine rice. I was hoping that maybe it was just my burrito but my friend who tagged along had the same problem with the burrito he ordered. This was disappointing for the both of us since each part of the burrito was actually really tasty and well-made; it was just the construction of the dish that was off.\nOverall, I would definitely say I understand why people flock to this Mills Avenue hot spot. The food is cheap (dishes range from around $3.00-$8.00), tasty, and for the most part well executed.

Most of its restaurants specialize in the Asian culinary spectrum with a few exceptions here and there, but wherever the food is being braised, roasted, cured, pickled, etc. it’s always memorable. Hell, there is even a grassroots organization known as Mills 50 comprised of local business owners aimed at preserving the unique urban flavor of this area. When you talk to anyone about the restaurants on Mills though, there is always one that people told me I absolutely have to try; Tako Cheena. This Asian-Latin fusion hot spot has won rave reviews around these parts and it is also the brainchild of the owner of another local favorite, Pom Pom’s Teahouse. So after a couple of years of blowing off going, I decided it was time for me to get off my lazy butt and get my taco fix.\nPulling up to the restaurant, I could not help but chuckle inside a bit. The outside resembles a tattoo shop with its bright red paint and font selection for their sign and beneath the sign it reads, “Dim Sum Good Takos.” Honestly, with a quirky play on words like this on the window, how could you not already like this place? Luckily the quirky, artsy theme does not end with the exterior of the building. The interior is lined with beautiful art that can be purchased as well as a colorful chalkboard menu (always a plus in my book). Even the staff looks like they should be sitting behind a canvas creating masterpieces rather than serving food or cooking and I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them did this in their spare time. Like any restaurant worth its salt though, the real star of the show is the food.\nFor starters, the menu is not an extensive one which generally for me is a plus. I find that big menus sometimes cause the quality of certain dishes to decline and a smaller menu makes it easier to maintain quality throughout a service. The selection offered consists of tacos, hot dogs, burritos, an empanada that changes on a weekly basis, and a couple of desserts. The most extensive part of the menu was the impressive sauce selection. I decided to go with panko crusted cod tacos, a Korean hot dog, and an Indian butter chicken burrito. Needless to say, the waitress was perplexed as to how my one hundred and forty pound frame would survive this eating event.\nThe fish tacos (my favorite part of the meal) were clean and simple. There were no twenty-six ingredients covering a piece of fish that required a microscope to know it was even there. The fish was crispy and seasoned well, the cabbage added extra crunch, and the sweet and sour onion sauce had a nice creaminess and tang about it that the fried fish needed. Their play on a hot dog was one of the quirkier things on the menu that was far different from what we ate as kids but still somehow brought back a sense of childhood nostalgia. In place of a traditional hot dog they used a Chinese sweet sausage that on its own was a little too sweet for my taste but when eaten with the other components of the dish I enjoyed. There was a bit of cabbage, spicy mayo, sesame seeds, cilantro, and the always delicious mix of fermented vegetables and spices, kimchi.\nNext up was the burrito, which if I’m being completely honest was not my favorite. The slightly spicy curry and Mexican crema coating everything was delicious, but the ratio of grain to meat and vegetables was way, way off. The tortilla was filled with chicken, chickpeas, cilantro, and sweet potato but if you wanted to get a nice, uniform bite you had to make your way over a mountain of jasmine rice. I was hoping that maybe it was just my burrito but my friend who tagged along had the same problem with the burrito he ordered. This was disappointing for the both of us since each part of the burrito was actually really tasty and well-made; it was just the construction of the dish that was off.\nOverall, I would definitely say I understand why people flock to this Mills Avenue hot spot. The food is cheap (dishes range from around $3.00-$8.00), tasty, and for the most part well executed. They have an understanding of the importance of ambience in a restaurant as well and their artsy décor is welcoming and makes you feel pretty damn cool and hip while dining. So if you are looking for a different kind of quick bite, Tako Cheena’s blend of Asian and Latin cuisine through the use of familiar, everyday foods will certainly do the trick.\nWebsite: http://www.takocheena.com/\nMenu: http://www.allmenus.com/fl/orlando/310707-tako-cheena/menu/\n\xa0']"

The group planned to move the resolution through two readings in the same night since the deadline for Congress to act is only days away. If action isn’t taken by Congress, rates will double from 3.4% to 6.8%.\nThe resolution sparked debate among the senators with some arguing that they had not had sufficient time to review the resolution and that rushing it through three readings was not necessary, despite the body doing so earlier during the same meeting on a different bill.\n“It’s not really a surprise that Congress failed us as students,” Chelsea Aldrich, Vice President of the College Democrats at UCF, said. “We just didn’t expect SGA to.”\nThe College Democrats conducted the research for the resolution and not the responsible SGA Senate committee, which was another issue brought up during debate. Some senators argued that the committee responsible for this type of action should have monitored an important student issue such as the spike in subsidized student loan interest rates, and praised the College Democrats for taking the initiative.\nThe resolution was ultimately passed back to the Governmental Affairs Committee, where it will be reviewed and voted on again—ten days after the Congressional deadline.', 'Just days after the Supreme Court handed a major victory over to those fighting for gay marriage, a gay marriage public records fueled lawsuit filed against UCF is heating up.\nA hearing for the lawsuit was cancelled Thursday following an emergency motion\xa0after UCF released approximately 15,000 e-mails and accidentally released some that UCF’s lawyer admitted are private, including at least one student’s confidential education record protected by the FERPA privacy law. UCF is now backtracking, and according to documents uncovered by KnightNews.com, they are asking the plaintiff to destroy all copies of the protected records and hand back the 4GB flash drive of e-mails to UCF.\n“Dear all, until we are able to discuss, Work through and hopefully\xa0resolve this issue, We respectfully request that you refrain from producing or\xa0publishing any of these documents to anyone else. Thank you for your professional\xa0courtesy here,” UCF’s counsel, Rick Mitchell of the GrayRobinson law firm, sent to the petitioner’s legal team.\n\nIn a response to UCF’s request to return the records, the plaintiff denied any of the records were private and simply asked the court to deny the motion to return the records. Even then, the plaintiff cited\xa0Downs v. Austin, “once the State has gone public with information which could have previously\xa0been protected from disclosure under the Act’s exemptions, no further purpose is served by\xa0preventing full access to the desired documents or information.”\nJohn Becker filed the lawsuit against UCF seeking access to public records relating to a research paper by professor Mark Regnerus. Some are saying that the research paper suggests\xa0gay marriage could have negative effects towards children. Becker, who said the paper has been criticized for conflicts of interest, had his public records request denied on April 1, 2013.\nUCF declined to comment on the situation because of the ongoing legal action.\n\xa0', 'Five University of Central Florida leaders have been named in Orlando Magazine’s 2013 list of the region’s 50 most powerful people.\nThe list compiled top leaders in Orlando, ranging from political leaders, university presidents, community activists, business owners, legal minds, philanthropists. \n“They are movers and shakers, who also possess the power to move and inspire others,” the magazine stated. \nPresident John C.

The University of Florida just missed the list, ranking 21st nationally.\nA sugar baby is a young female or male who is financially pampered/cared for by a sugar daddy or sugar mama in exchange for companionship.

Police responding.\nStay clear of the area,” UCF said in a campus alert message.\nThis is a breaking story, check back for updates.', 'The women of Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma attended a self awareness familiarization exchange (SAFE) class hosted at the Kappa Kappa Gamma house Monday afternoon. \nThe two hour basic self-defense class was led by Officer Peter Stephens of the University of Central Florida Police Department. Stephens taught the women basic moves to defend themselves from an attacker in the case of an emergency.\n“If I could tell women only one thing about self defense, it would be to be very vocal and assertive,” said Stephens.\nThroughout the class, Stephens gave real-life examples of things that he’s seen on the job and taught the women moves that were simple, yet effective. \nThe following is just one way that Stephens showed the women how they could effectively defend themselves in a dangerous situation. These steps will usually make 60 percent of the attackers become scared and back off. \nFor all types of attacks, the victim should first blade her stance. This can be done by bending the knees and shifting the body stance slightly at an angle in order to lower her center of gravity. This simple change in stance can make it nearly impossible to be picked up by the attacker.\nNext, the victim should raise her non-dominant hand in front of her face. This gives her the opportunity to block herself if needed. She now has her dominant hand available for hitting or scratching. \nFinally, she should yell, “Get back!” loudly to draw attention from bystanders and strike the attacker’s face with the bottom of her open palm. Many have the natural urge to punch with a closed first, but this can be ineffective because of the wrist’s weakness. \nWhen the victim strikes the face, she should try aiming for the nose. This will hopefully draw blood and will make it harder for the attacker to breathe. \nIf yelling is the only thing the victim is capable of doing to defend herself, she should yell “fire” because people are more likely to come to the scene if they hear that as opposed to “stop” or “help.”\nStephens was able to make the class fun, yet still kept the message serious. He directly related tips to women, like utilizing the heel of a stiletto shoe to drive into the attacker’s foot. Stomping the stiletto into the attacker’s foot can cause upwards of 500 pounds of pressure per square inch, which gives the victim a chance to run away.\n“I feel like I’m much more capable of defending myself than I was before the class. The instructor made the situations realistic and taught us in a way that would be easier to remember in a threatening situation,” said Jennifer Bayes. \nStephens gave defense moves names that mimicked its actions in reality. For example, the “lawn mower” is used when the victim is attacked from behind. The victim is to grab behind them to the male’s groin or crotch region, then grab, twist and pull, similar to how you would start an actual lawn mower. \nFor more protection on campus, students are legally allowed to carry pepper spray. When selecting a pepper spray, the higher the scoville scale, the better. Try to find one that has around a 2 million scoville rating. \nThe Safe Escort Patrol Service (SEPS), blue light phones and UCFPD are also resources that students can rely on when they feel uncomfortable on campus. \n“If your spidey sense is tingling, you’re generally right. It’s better to be safe than sorry,” said Stephens, referring to your gut instincts. \nStudents can attend one of the SAFE classes provided by UCFPD at no cost. ', 'Imagine an active young adult, a country boy who is used to being outside, stuck in a small hotel-like room. Imagine this is an intensive care unit room in the Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point. Now imagine he is paralyzed from the diaphragm down.\nThis has been life for 21-year-old Aaron Lopez, along with other obstacles he’s had to overcome along the way for the past 46 days.\nOn Jan. 10 around 3:30 p.m. UCF student Brittany Bolin, Lopez’s girlfriend of almost three years, received a phone call from one of Lopez’s former friends. They were riding their motorcycles southbound on Ehren Cutoff in Land O’ Lakes when something went very wrong. A Mercedes, going the opposite direction of Lopez, made a left-hand turn into a driveway and stopped, completely blocking Lopez’s lane.\n“I never imagined a phone call changing my entire life. Hearing those few words was my worst nightmare,” Bolin said.\nLopez hit the car broadside at 50 mph and bounced off, falling to the floor. As he was lying on the ground, unable to move, neither his former friend nor the driver of the Mercedes did much to help him. While the other driver stayed in his vehicle, the other rider moved Lopez out of the street and called Bolin before taking off on his own bike, leaving Lopez by himself. Thankfully an off-duty paramedic witnessed the accident and pulled over to help Lopez.\n“I knew I was paralyzed ten minutes after I wrecked. An off duty paramedic stopped and when I couldn’t wiggle my toes or feel anything I pretty much knew,” Lopez said.\nLopez’s accident is one of many that has left families in the wake of tragedy due to the careless driving of a person behind another vehicle. American Bikers Aimed Towards Education of Florida is just one organization that urges non-riders to be conscious of their surroundings.\nABATE of Florida is a non-profit organization dedicated to informing non-riders about motorcycle awareness and teaching them how to share the roads with motorcycles. The organization has 30 chapters throughout Florida, including one in Orange County. Rhonda Griffis, ABATE’s state public relations trustee, explained how they track accidents that involve motorcyclists through the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.\n“Currently the number one cause of a motorcycle fatality is an illegal left turn,” Griffis said. “Once a person makes a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic, causing an accident, it then becomes an illegal left hand turn, putting that person at fault for the accident, by not yielding the right away.”\nOver the past 46 days, Lopez had back surgery and was heavily sedated for his first two weeks in the hospital. He also had pneumonia, blood clots in his lungs and his legs and a pneumothorax. He’s had three chest tubes, one for the left and one for the right lung, which were taken out on Feb. 17. None of this even begins to cover the mental struggles, such as anxiety, that Aaron has dealt with.\n“I stay positive because it’s all I know,” Lopez said. “I was a mechanic for several years so I learned getting mad at things you can’t control or change doesn’t make sense. Put all that anger, frustration and everything else into an emotion that helps you get past that bump in the road.”\nAs strong and positive as Lopez is, he said he could not do it without his support system. Lopez’s parents, Peggy and Bruce Lopez, are at the hospital with Lopez all day, every day. Bolin said that Lopez’s parents have been his biggest support system so far. His brothers, Christian Lopez, 28, and Randy Lopez 39, have also been a big part of his support system. The two brothers bought him an iPad, which, according to his mom, is his most valuable personal possession at this point.\n“It’s his lifeline to the outside world,” Peggy said\nLopez also uses his iPad to communicate with Bolin throughout the week while she’s at school. Bolin drives to the hospital every Friday to spend the weekend by Lopez’s side.\n“We talk about the latest news and his progress,” Bolin said. “We catch up on things and I try to keep him occupied. Sometimes I even bring him his favorite foods so he can have something to look forward to.”\nAlong with Lopez’s family and friends being more than just a helpful hand, the hospital staff and the community have also been very supportive.\n“My family, friends, community and the staff at this hospital have had a profound effect on us since Jan. 10,” Peggy said. “I have been supported, enveloped and comforted in every way imaginable, and it continues.”\nThe Stonegrey, a band whose lead singer has been friends with Lopez since middle school, hosted a concert benefit to raise money for the Lopez family. The benefit had multiple raffle prizes, including a tandem skydive with video, and a ten pack of jump tickets for the experienced jumpers. There was plenty of food and drinks, and three band performances.\nThe Aaron Lopez Recovery Fund, on the Give Forward website, is another way the family is trying to raise money. The funds will all go towards Lopez’s recovery process, which will include a rehabilitation center. Most of the recommended centers are far from the Lopez home and will cost a great deal of money. The family will also have to make modifications to their home for when Lopez returns from rehab.\n“Neither of our bathrooms will accommodate him now,” Peggy said. “We can picture what we need to do but it will take money to reconfigure our home to make it functional for him, and we want him as independent as he can be.”\nLopez’s positive attitude and his support system have been the guiding forces paving his way to recovery. Recently he has even begun to have tingles in his legs, which for someone in Lopez’s condition is amazing.\n“My mom was playing with my toes one day and caused muscle twitches not only in my legs but all the way up my side to the point where I’m paralyzed,” Lopez said. “It went from my toes, to my legs, to my hips, to my side, to my chest. The rehab guy was so happy when he heard.”\nJust like every little step is a huge leap towards recovery for Lopez, every day in that small ICU room is another step closer to a rehabilitation center. Every day that Lopez gets closer to rehab is a reminder that driving is a privilege and doing it safely is something that needs to be taken seriously.\nLopez is more than determined when it comes to his recovery process and if you ask him, he will tell you, “I will walk again.”\nTo help Lopez during his recovery process, donations can be made at: https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/9nv3/aaron-lopez-recovery-fund?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=fb_share_stream.share&utm_campaign=BA_FBshare&fb_ref=1804152', 'Studying.\nWe all have to do it and at times it can be really dreadful.

It is music that keeps you from getting distracted because of boredom and helps you focus on studying and getting work done.\nSome people have a hard time focusing in a silent environment and either fall asleep or find another mind-simulating activity to do which keeps them from studying. So what exactly counts as good music that you can study to? Usually, music that does not have lyrics in it and is mostly instrumental classifies as the best music to study with. \nIn fact, studies have shown that classical music (such as Mozart’s) can improve mental performance.\nHowever, some people do not enjoy classical music like Beethoven’s or Vivaldi’s. Luckily for them, there are bands that do covers of famous songs like the ones heard on the radio. \nOne of the most renowned cover bands in the world that is great to study along to is Vitamin String Quartet. They have a wide spectrum of music that they play including tributes to movies, bands and even music festivals like Coachella. It is music that you already know but with the sung parts replaced by instrumentals. No matter what genre you like, they have it covered.\nBesides classical music, there is also another genre of music which is great for studying: Chillwave. It is relaxing indie electronic music that does not distract but will keep you entertained and relaxed enough to study long hours. Some bands that are great to study with for this genre include: Neon Indian, Pretty Lights, Washed Out, and Toro y Moi.\nBefore you study, make a playlist with the songs you already know and love so that you waste no time picking and choosing. Another tip is to not crank the music all the way or else it will distract you from what your main focus is.

Usually, music that does not have lyrics in it and is mostly instrumental classifies as the best music to study with. \nIn fact, studies have shown that classical music (such as Mozart’s) can improve mental performance.\nHowever, some people do not enjoy classical music like Beethoven’s or Vivaldi’s. Luckily for them, there are bands that do covers of famous songs like the ones heard on the radio. \nOne of the most renowned cover bands in the world that is great to study along to is Vitamin String Quartet. They have a wide spectrum of music that they play including tributes to movies, bands and even music festivals like Coachella. It is music that you already know but with the sung parts replaced by instrumentals. No matter what genre you like, they have it covered.\nBesides classical music, there is also another genre of music which is great for studying: Chillwave. It is relaxing indie electronic music that does not distract but will keep you entertained and relaxed enough to study long hours. Some bands that are great to study with for this genre include: Neon Indian, Pretty Lights, Washed Out, and Toro y Moi.\nBefore you study, make a playlist with the songs you already know and love so that you waste no time picking and choosing. Another tip is to not crank the music all the way or else it will distract you from what your main focus is. Studying is undoubtedly hard but can be made bearable if you make a great playlist to keep you entertained!\nHere is a link to a VSQ playlist to help you study and conquer those tests!']"

The Knights offense outshot The Beach 12-6, giving LBS goalkeeper Ashton McKeown a career high in saves but ultimately letting one slip through for a Knight’s victory.\n“I would say fierce is a really good word to describe the team today,” said head coach Tiffany Roberts Sahaydak. “I really think we stepped it up in the physical area, we were winning balls in the air, 50-50 balls even on the ground, we were doing whatever it takes. I thought it was a real inspiring performance from our team.”\nIn addition to the triumph against Long Beach, UCF delivered a crushing 4-0 win against Ole Miss (6-2-2), putting an end their six match victory streak.\nWith a second goal coming just minutes after the first, the Knights used their momentum to connect two more goals before closing out the non-conference match.\n“I think once we got that goal it kind of changed the momentum of the game, that just kind of ignited us,” said Sahaydak. “We knew that they’d have some momentum, but we talked about playing our style, playing our game, being physical and having a lot of respect. Credit to our team, they really respected Ole Miss tonight. And I think when you respect a team you can have results like this tonight.”\nUM fell behind early in the game and could not regroup for a win. The Knight’s defense held tight and limited the opportunities for a goal by the Rebels.\n“It was a tough one down here where we didn’t get off to a great start,” said Ole Miss head coach Matthew Mott. “UCF scored a couple of good goals and put us behind. We have to learn from it and be better.”\nThe focused gameplay by the women’s team earned their players three out of the four league honors Monday, with Tatiana Coleman winning for offense, Connie Organ winning as goalkeeper, and Sophie Howard winning for defense.\nUCF will begin conference play at Memphis on Thursday at 8pm ET.\nMen’s Soccer\nThe\xa0men’s soccer team\xa0fell to North Florida 0-1 last Wednesday, unable to connect any of the five shots made in the first half. A goal opportunity came early in the game for sophomore Javier Clavijo but Osprey’s goalkeeper Kyle Nasta denied the shot as well as one made on a rebound.\nA goal in the 75th minute broke the stalemate, giving UNF the win while dropping the Knights to a 1-4-1 record.\nUCF owns a 7-3 all-time record when facing UNF (3-3-0) but has lost the past two years to the in-state opponent.\n“Our players learned a hard lesson that everybody is going to come into games ready to fight and ready to work hard,” head coach Bryan Cunningham said. “We have to be ready to not only match that, but try and get above it. A pretty low moment in UCF soccer, no discredit to UNF, which did a fantastic job tonight managing the game. This is more an indication that our team has a long way to go.”\nThe men’s team next faces Indiana at Indiana on Wednesday at 7:30pm ET.']"

And yet, like a moth to the flame, students are drawn to the scattered tables and chairs surrounding the whirlpool that is the Student Union — creating a society of chair-stalkers the likes of which rival Steve Irwin’s skills in the Amazon.\nWhy anybody would bother is beyond me, but for students like Hannah Schepler, a 19-year-old Writing and Rhetoric major, the hunt for a seat is worth prize.\n“It’s the center of the campus,” she said during a recent interview. “I don’t want to miss anything.”\nThat’s not to say it’s easy. Schepler has had trouble finding a seat on the quieter third deck of the Union, but there is a secret to finding an open chair.\n“Generally,” she said, “if you stalk around enough, you can get a seat. It’s like a race – I’ve lost a chair to someone crossing around the other side.”\nThe Library\nThe loudest library this side of the Mississippi.\nTrying to find an open computer on the Library’s ground floor is worse than stalking an open table in the Student Union. You grumble as you peer over the walls of yet another computer pod, cursing the day you decided to add another class instead of investing in a laptop.\nAnd when you actually find a seat with a computer, there’s going to be some group of yahoos that will forget that the library is synonymous with quiet and have a nice loud conversation about how difficult this assignment is. And you forgot your earphones in your gym-bag.\nThe chamber of secrets within the library.\nFortunately, those who don’t know how to use their inside-voice also don’t know that there are different levels in the library — making the chairs, desks and cubicles on every floor but the second easy pickings.\nIf still you’re having difficulty finding a chair you can always find an abandoned book aisle to study in. This is also a nice, if uncomfortable, place to take a nap — just make sure your bookbag is padded.\nIt’s easier to find a place to sit on the fourth and fifth levels as these are the absolute quiet zones of the library and for some, the idea of putting their cellphone on no ring and no vibrate is just to much.\nHowever, the low chatter from the third floor echoes right on up the stairwell and into the fourth floor. So, if you’re looking for an uncomfortably quiet place to study, skip right on up to the fifth floor.\nWhile the fourth floor easily has the best view of every roof on campus, there is a row of chairs and tables on the fifth floor that boasts a view of the very top of Millican Hall and the enthusiastic top of the Reflecting Pond’s water fountain.\nThis can all be seen from between the prisonesque columns that surround the now closed-off balcony. There truly is nothing like thick bars of cement brick blocking the sunlight to make you realize that you’ve been paying to be institutionalized and that you really do need to get back to studying rather than look outside.\nWithin the entire library there is one seat, just one, that is the holy grail of all study spots, and it’s on the fifth floor between the west stairs and the elevator. It’s a nook, with two windows and an electrical outlet, and is far, far away from every other studying brain on the floor. Bring a bribe because you’ll be hard pressed to find this seat empty.\nThe best seats you didn’t know about because you never go in that building.\nSometimes you want a view of the outdoors with the comfort of stale conditioned air and fluorescent lighting. The Health & Public Affairs I building is that place. With window-facing swivel chairs and desks just wide enough for your laptop and half your notebook, you can people-watch french café style.\nThe worst seats you didn’t know about because you never go in that building.\nYou should know that the worst building to find a seat in is the Visual Arts building.\nMainly this is because there are no seats on the first floor. If you’re stuck waiting for a classroom to open up, you can stand around shuffling your feet or you can sit on the floor and try not to trip up the herd of students thundering down this narrow hallway.\nOn a breezy, sunshine-y day it’s nice to sit outside within the UCF campus grounds. There’s plenty of shade to go around, and if you’ve had the foresight to bring a picnic blanket with you, every lawn is your resting area. But if you’re looking for a bench, the following is a list of the best outdoor places on campus to relax.\nBelow is a breakdown of some other places to chill and hang on campus:', 'UCF students can grab a free cup of coffee today on their way to class in celebration of National Coffee Day.\nMultiple businesses are holding the deals today:\nDunkin’ Donuts\nDunkin’ Donuts is offering a free cup of dark roast medium coffee all day. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts located on campus in the Knights Plaza and a Dunkin’ Donuts just off campus on University Boulevard.\nMcDonalds\nMcDonalds has been offering a free small coffee with breakfast since Sept. 16. Today is the last day to capitalize on that offer, there is a McDonalds on Alafaya Trail right by the Plaza at University.\nKangaroo Express\nKangaroo Express is offering a small cup of Bean Street Coffee for a penny from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for National Coffee Day. There is multiple Kangaroo Express’s in the UCF-area. One is located on East Colonial Drive near Woodbury Road and one on the corner of Lake Underhill and North Dean Road.

They also made auditions available to students online as well. Performers were given the opportunity to send in a short clip of their performance, according to Ila.\nAfter the show a full course Indian meal was provided by Aashirwaad, a local Indian restaurant. According to Vyas, the crowds favorite dishes were Paneer Masala, which is a curry based dish, and Naan. Other traditional dishes included Samosa, Malai Fogta and Daal.\nKhusbu Patel, Sangam’s Events Director, helped arrange the decorations for the event. According to Vyas, their goal was to create a simple but yet elegant reflection of Diwali by using vibrant colors.\n“The decorations on stage used brightly colored fabric to decorate the backdrop with a Sangam banner in the center of the stage,” Ila said.\nOverall Ila thought this year’s event was a huge success.\n“It was an amazing turnout from the UCF and Indian community, and it was great to see everyone celebrate the culture and festival together.”', 'UCF Volleyball will be playing a pair of conference matches this weekend against Houston and Tulane this Friday and Sunday.\nThe Knights (15-8, 8-0 AAC) jumped four spots in this week’s NCAA rankings after sitting in 27th last week.

Although UCF is projected to bring out the win, the Knights will still need to come into this matchup with aggressiveness. The Cougars team snapped its four-game skid with a 3-2 win over UConn this past Sunday afternoon. UCF will then go on to play the Tulane Green Wave (5-15, 3-5 AAC) early Sunday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. ET.\nThe Knights volleyball team brought in great strength and endurance in matches like Cincinnati and Memphis to bring out the win. UCF improves their offensive performance, hitting .423 as a team, with 50 kills, 48 assists, and 43 digs to sweep the Bearcats in last week’s matchup. The Knights have now won 8 consecutive back-to-back wins so far this season and hope to bring that same adrenaline this weekend as they take on Houston and Tulane in the comfort of their own stadium.\nUCF can also expect a good fight against Tulane, as the Green Wave volleyball’s offense performed extraordinarily well on Sunday against Temple, hitting .378 on 82 swings with 40 kills. Tulane, posting a team season-high 20.0 blocks in a win over UConn on Friday night, only managed 3.0 team blocks at the net on Sunday, tying a season low.\nDespite tough competition, the knights have great players leading this team to victories. Senior DeLaina Sarden finished with 16 kills on 19 swings. Her .789 hitting percentage is the sixth-best percentage in a match in UCF history. Sophomore Kia Bright joined Sarden with double-figure kills, finishing with 13 while hitting .440 and recorded five blocks. Junior Dana Faught has posted 13 assists and five digs as the starting setter in the season opener against Eastern Kentucky and tallied 23 assists against Middle Tennessee early on in the season.\nThe Knights finished last weekend’s matches against Cincinnati with 50 kills, 43 digs and 7.0 blocks and plan on bringing that same heat into this Friday night’s game against the Houston Cougars.\nUCF will then face rival USF, October 29, at The Venue at UCF.']",['https://knightnews.com/2014/10/sangams-2014-diwali-show-has-best-turnout-yet/'],"['Sangam’s 2014 Diwali Show attracted 450 students to the UCF Pegasus Ballroom on Sunday evening.\nSangam, the Indian Student Association at UCF, hosted the yearly event in celebration of the upcoming holiday, Diwali (The Festival of Lights). The organization expected 230 to 275 students to attend the event, but was surprised with a much larger turnout, according to Snigdha Ila, Sangam’s volunteer director.\n“I believe this is the biggest Diwali Show success in Sangam’s history,” said Sangam’s President Shivan Vyas.\nThe event was held for a total of five hours, included various performances and a traditional Indian dinner. Entry to this event was free for UCF students.\nAccording to Vyas, there were performers from all across the university reflecting the various cultures found within India.\n“We had eight performances during the event and more than 50 people performing within these performances. We had classical dances such as Garva Raas, modern Bollywood, fusion dances with a mixture of classical and modern, along with dances in peoples’ specific sublanguages such as Punjabi or Telugu,” said Vyas.\nSangam held two days of auditions prior to the event. They also made auditions available to students online as well. Performers were given the opportunity to send in a short clip of their performance, according to Ila.\nAfter the show a full course Indian meal was provided by Aashirwaad, a local Indian restaurant. According to Vyas, the crowds favorite dishes were Paneer Masala, which is a curry based dish, and Naan. Other traditional dishes included Samosa, Malai Fogta and Daal.\nKhusbu Patel, Sangam’s Events Director, helped arrange the decorations for the event. According to Vyas, their goal was to create a simple but yet elegant reflection of Diwali by using vibrant colors.\n“The decorations on stage used brightly colored fabric to decorate the backdrop with a Sangam banner in the center of the stage,” Ila said.\nOverall Ila thought this year’s event was a huge success.\n“It was an amazing turnout from the UCF and Indian community, and it was great to see everyone celebrate the culture and festival together.”']"

Now an advocate for the cause, Hixon helped to personally raise over $1,500 for Knight-Thon over the span of two years.\n“As someone who survived cancer at an early age, I think it’s awesome to see my fraternity give back to a cause that impacts so many children every day,” said Chris Hixon, senior at the University of Central Florida.\nFrom Nov. 17 to 20, members of the Greek community had the opportunity to participate in Christmas activities, earning points toward their chapter and spreading the holiday spirit to all of UCF. Each day consisted of a different activity, from decorating the Theta Chi house on Greek Park, to wrapping presents for the Miracle children. Competition soon ensued, with more points being awarded to the organization that best decorated during each exercise.\nThe brothers of Theta Chi fraternity are continuing to raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network as the academic year progresses. On Monday, they held their 4th Annual Ricky Bobby Thanksgiving Dinner, a play on the popular Talladega Nights movie to raise more money for Knight-Thon.\n“I participate in Knight-Thon because it unites college students to not only make an impact in the lives of sick children everywhere, but also because of the opportunities it may give them–to grow up outside of the walls of a hospital, to graduate high school and go to college, and to follow their dreams without worrying about how close they are to a hospital,” Hixon said.', 'One of the first rules parents teach their kids: don’t talk to strangers — let alone get into their cars.\nBut a Local 6 special investigation showed that some students at the University of Central Florida hadn’t quite learned that lesson, after nine of 13 students willingly got into an unmarked van, filled out personal information sheets and handed over their cellphones to someone claiming to be a reality TV show talent scout.\nvideo platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player\nLuckily for them, it was only Local 6 special projects producer Allison McGinley and not someone with more nefarious plans. However, it was still a concern for UCF Police Chief Richard Beary. \n“The reality is there is always somebody out there trying to scam you, whether you are here at UCF, at the mall or at home,” Beary told Local 6.\nMcGinley handed students an application form that asked for a name, cellphone number, email address, Instagram and Twitter accounts, home town and even popular hangout spots, according to Local 6. According to Local 6, most of the students that were approached filled out the bogus application before investigative reporter Mike Holfeld came over to tell them what was really happening.\nNot all the students were willing comply, however. According to the Local 6 video, one student refused to get into the van and stopped his girlfriend from getting in either. According to Local 6, when they were asked to hand over their cellphones, they said they couldn’t stay and left.\n“They have to protect their information at all times and they have to be aware of their surroundings and understand that there’s always somebody out there that’s going to be trying to work a scam,” Beary told Local 6.', 'After what appeared to be a strong start for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Miami Dolphins, and Jacksonville Jaguars, all three teams found a way to let a win slip out of their hands this past week. \nIt may not be surprising for the Jaguars or Buccaneers anymore, but it’s disappointing for the Dolphins, considering how much potential they have shown this season.\nThe Buccaneers showed a lot of promise in the first two quarters of Sunday’s game, heading into the half with a 10-0 lead over the Chicago Bears, but problems were already clearly present. Once each team reappeared on the field, these problems only appeared more exaggerated. \nAfter a stellar performance from Josh McCown last week, the Buccaneer’s veteran quarterback managed to do little more than sabotage any of their hopes for victory. Throwing two interceptions and managing to gain little momentum from their three scoring drives, McCown’s performance really called into question Lovie Smith’s offensive strategy, once again. The game ended, with a Bear’s triumph of 21-13. Next week, the Buccaneers host the Cincinnati Bengals for a 1:00 P.M. game.\nTurning attention to the one Florida team with playoff hopes, the Miami Dolphins faced the Denver Broncos, in what became a nail-biter of a game, ending with the Bronco’s victory of 36-39. After three quarters of Dolphins domination, their defense seemed to give up altogether, allowing their opponent to score 22 points in the final quarter. While they may remain second in their division, even with this loss, their chances of making it to the playoffs are becoming slimmer and slimmer. They play the New York Jets, next Monday, at 8:30 P.M.\nFinally, we have to discuss one of the only teams worse than the Buccaneers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, who have again demonstrated their inability to do anything on either side of the ball, with a 23-3 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts prevented anything more than a single field goal from being scored against them, as well as intercepting the ball once and recovering a fumble. Blake Bortles has been struggling this season to live up the life of his college career, and his performance this past week was one of his most abysmal, ending the game with a passer rating of 55.5. Hopefully next week he can manage to get something going, as the team hosts the New York Giants for a 1:00 P.M. game.', 'Sexual assault is a serious matter and no stranger to college campuses. In an effort to educate the student body on what to do when witnessing an assault, UCF has joined the It’s On Us campaign.\nThe It’s On Us campaign was an initiative started in The White House through President Obama. According to The White House Blog, it is “an awareness campaign to help put an end to sexual assault on college campuses.”\nThis campaign launched on Sept. 19, 2014.\nAt the official White House launch, the President said that “an estimated one in five women has been sexually assaulted during her college years. Of those assaults, only twelve percent of those are reported and of those reported assaults, only a fraction of the offenders are punished.”\nThe official It’s On Us website stated that the goals for this initiative are “to recognize that non-consensual sex is sexual assault, to identify situations in which sexual assault may occur, to intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given. and to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.”\n\nThe campaign centers itself around pledges made by the student body to be active bystanders.\nA bystander is a person who is present at an event or incident but does not take part. To be an active bystander, one must not be a mere witness to an assault; they must step in and do all they can to prevent it.\n“This pledge is a personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault. It is a promise not to be a bystander to the problem, but to be a part of the solution,” says the It’s On Us official website.\nUCF has decided to take a stand and join this movement. This semester, It’s On Us has been spotted around campus and in the union asking students to take a picture and sign the pledge.\nKnightNews.com spoke to Maureen Hawkins, the UCF Director of Wellness and Health Promotion Services.\nAccording to Hawkins, the main purpose of this campaign is “awareness building and starting the conversation to educate people and our campus/community on what they could do and step in to be an active bystander.”\nHawkins said that this movement is going to impact the UCF community because this movement is an ”umbrella awareness piece of getting students aware of the issue in general.” This campaign educates and “leads into other info on mentors and violence prevention programs. “\nHawkins also wants the student body to know that It’s On Us is not a curriculum but that UCF offers a full on bystander prevention program for those interested.\nThis campaign has been campus wide. SDES, UCF Health and Wellness, UCF Cares, and many other partners have helped this initiative take off and raise awareness.\n6,938 UCF students have signed the pledge since the last count on Nov. 12.\n“We are closing out our semester before exams with one final push for students to take the pledge and allow students to come get their photos we took at the first event. We’re trying to continue that message during winter break and into spring; this is an ongoing effort,” said Hawkins. “Taking the pledge isn’t just signing your name and taking the photo, it’s helping someone that may need assistance.”\nIf you have been a victim of sexual assault, visit notalone.gov for resources or call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE.\nIf you wish to get involved in this campaign, email Maureen Hawkins at Maureen.Hawkins@ucf.edu or contact UCF Cares. Mentor’s In Violence Prevention training is also available for those interested.\nFor more information on It’s On Us, visit their official website and take the pledge to be more than a bystander and help end sexual assault.\nIt’s On Us, the Knight community, to take the role of active bystanders. If you haven’t already, sign the pledge and educate yourself to make a difference.', 'We all know Snapchat lets you send quick photos to your friends, but what if you could be sending or receiving cash instead of selfies?\nThis is now possible, thanks to Snapchat’s newest update. Users can now send their contacts money, just as they would a typical picture.\nSnapcash, the name they have coined for the service, allows users to link their debit cards to their account to send and receive money from other users.\nThe service was created through a partnership between Snapchat and Square, a payment processing company. Currently, there is no fee to use the service.\nUCF Senior accounting major Terence Holiday is not impressed with the new service.\n“I wouldn’t use it,” Holiday said. “There are already established apps for transferring money, like Venmo. The majority of larger banks have a way of transferring money via app,” Holiday added.\nWhile convenience is nice, security should be a focus when dealing with bank accounts or debit cards. Considering Snapchat’s recent history of hackers downloading countless photos, many are worried about the safety of their account numbers.\nIt turns out that Snapchat will not be handling any of the payments, or even account information. While still done through the app, all financial related information is processed by Square.\nAccording to Square, all payment is passed through Square, encrypted and submitted to their servers securely.\nAdditionally, Snapcash can be set up to prompt the user for a security code for each transaction.\nTo use Snapcash, users must be at least 18, and register a debit card with the service. Credit cards cannot be used with the service.\nWill Snapcash be able to grow? Will security concerns prevent the app from becoming mainstream? Only time will tell.\nOne thing’s for sure; With this new update, it finally pays to Snap.', 'UPDATE: Tornado warning cancelled, heavy rain still persists. \nUCF sent out an alert Tuesday morning warning students to be aware of possible tornados in the area and to seek shelter immediately.\n“Tornado Warning UCF Main Campus! Seek shelter immediately. Monitor local media for details,” the UCF alert read. The warning will last until 10:30 a.m.\nThe same alert was also sent out for the Lake Nona Medical City Campus.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the wet weather is expected to last through Wednesday.

Hitt in a release. “He was an astute academic leader with a keen vision. As president, I greatly valued his advice and contributions to our university.”\nKnown as the “Scholar President,” Colbourn held degrees from the University of London, the College of William and Mary, and Johns Hopkins University. \nIn 2001, the Humanities and Fine Arts Building was renamed Colbourn Hall in honor of Trevor Colbourn. ', 'In a post-season filled with questionable rulings, narrow victories and underdog comebacks, we now have only the conference championships to look forward to before Super Bowl Sunday is upon us once more. \nThis weekend featured two of the closest games of the season along with a surprise upset, as the Indianapolis Colts prevented the Denver Broncos from another Super Bowl appearance, and a last minute slaughter when the Seattle Seahawks put the Carolina Panthers back in their place.\nThe weekend began with the Baltimore Ravens heading to Foxboro to face the New England Patriots in a game that was decided by an interception thrown by Joe Flacco in the last two minutes of the game, cinching the Patriots’ advancement, with a final score of 31-35.\nThe second game of the night featured a team no one expected to make it past the first round, the Carolina Panthers, who took on last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Seattle Seahawks. Considering the fact that the Panthers were unable to even break the .500 barrier during the regular season, it was a shock to see them attain any success in the post-season. Unfortunately, it was impossible for them to keep that momentum going, as the Seahawks managed to dominate in the final, for a game ending score of 31-17.\nSunday began with a game that made up for last week’s highly questionable calls. \nWhen the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, many cried foul over some of the referees’ rulings. Well after the Cowboys loss to the Green Bay Packers, it seems balance has been restored to the universe. Green Bay’s victory was heavily dependent on a few decisions by the officials, which many saw as debatable.  One skeptical call would have placed the Cowboys on the Packers’ 1-yard line, but instead led to a change of possession and the Packers’ victory.\nThe final game of the week featured one of professional football’s most impressive quarterbacks once again deteriorate under pressure. Hoping to make it back to the Super Bowl once more, the Denver Broncos hosted the Indianapolis Colts, ending the game with a discouraging loss of 24-13. \nAfter last year’s abysmal Super Bowl appearance, some feared that Broncos’ quarterback Peyton Manning might prove unable to lead the team when it really counts. Sadly, those fears came to fruition, as Manning was unable to put up more than one touchdown and 211 yards, making it one of his most disappointing games given the stakes.\nNext Sunday, the Seattle

A little over a month later, Wolfe placed second in Blackstone’s  first LaunchPad Demo Day in New York City, winning $15,000.\n“UCF has done so much for us,” Wolfe said. “From the start, the one thing everyone needs to know that Blackstone Launchpad isn’t out to steal your ideas or take part of your company. In return, the school gets huge recognition. Four teams out of 20 were from UCF.”\nThe Blackstone Launchpad is a student-serving organization that is supported by The Blackstone Charitable Foundation, which seeks to support innovative projects and catalytic ideas that can accelerate start-ups, job growth and economic activity.\n“I would say I received $150,000, if I had to put a price on it, in help with free legal advice, referrals, and countless introductions to important, crucial people,” Wolfe said. “When it came to my accounting needs, they referred me to someone. They don’t take any of your patent. It’s literally an incubator to help you. From the moment you walk in, you time stamp your idea. Everything is confidential.”\nWolfe was also featured twice on Fox35’s Good Morning Orlando. While on the show, Wolfe met the owner of The Meat House in Winter Park. Just a few months later, the product now sits on the shelves at The Meat House with the new labels his team created.\n“You set yourself up three to five years [for your business plan]. Our year one is out the window. We’ve grown much faster than we projected. We are past the introductory phase we planned for Jan. 1,” Wolfe said.\nWhen asked about the future plans for O’Dang Hummus being in other stores, Wolfe said he couldn’t reveal the names of the stores because the contracts still have to be finalized, but he discussed his plan to dominate the hummus industry of Orlando.\n“We have one of our final meetings next Wednesday. We are waiting to finalize, but we have interest in three, large national chains. All we really need is one of those. If all goes through, it would be located in the Dr. Phillips area.  The next chain will put us in all of Orlando,” Wolfe said.\nHe doesn’t want to stop there.\n“Our business plan isn’t to build a giant facility, instead utilize smaller facilities across the country. It would be easier for us to allow Amazon to fulfill it. We want to be the first hummus business through Amazon,” Wolfe said.\nHe still plans to launch his to-go pack and a website, which he says will be ready in a couple of months. He also says that his crazy flavors have no end.\n“We have a bacon hummus and garlic-Parmesan flavor. Brownie batter dip, which is a black bean dip that taste like brownie batter. We beta tested it two weeks ago and it went very well.”\nAs Wolfe’s business plan and flavors are growing, he still plans to be a contestant on ABC’s “Shark Tank” in the near future.', 'UCF All-American Second Team cornerback Jacoby Glenn will enter the 2015 NFL Draft, Glenn announced on his Instagram Tuesday morning.\n“I want to take the time to thank George O’Leary and tell my UCF Knight’s family that I enjoyed my time at the school and especially enjoyed playing for you guys,” Glenn posted. “I wish everybody the best on success, but it’s time to take my talent to the next level.”\nGlenn, a redshirt sophomore, is coming off of one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a UCF cornerback. This past season he ranked third in the nation with seven interceptions and third with 18 passes defended. He was one of 50 student-athletes to be named to either the AP All-American First or Second teams and was just one of 13 underclassmen named to the list. \nUCF has seen turbulent coaching changes so far this off-season, former DB coach Kirk Callahan left for Florida, former offensive coordinator Charlie Taaffe retired and former defensive coordinator Tyson Summers left for Colorado State.\nJunior wide receiver Breshad Perriman also declared early for the NFL draft. \nGlenn finishes his UCF career sixth in program history with nine interceptions.']",['https://knightnews.com/2015/01/nfl-round-up-four-teams-remain-before-superbowl/'],"['In a post-season filled with questionable rulings, narrow victories and underdog comebacks, we now have only the conference championships to look forward to before Super Bowl Sunday is upon us once more. \nThis weekend featured two of the closest games of the season along with a surprise upset, as the Indianapolis Colts prevented the Denver Broncos from another Super Bowl appearance, and a last minute slaughter when the Seattle Seahawks put the Carolina Panthers back in their place.\nThe weekend began with the Baltimore Ravens heading to Foxboro to face the New England Patriots in a game that was decided by an interception thrown by Joe Flacco in the last two minutes of the game, cinching the Patriots’ advancement, with a final score of 31-35.\nThe second game of the night featured a team no one expected to make it past the first round, the Carolina Panthers, who took on last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Seattle Seahawks. Considering the fact that the Panthers were unable to even break the .500 barrier during the regular season, it was a shock to see them attain any success in the post-season. Unfortunately, it was impossible for them to keep that momentum going, as the Seahawks managed to dominate in the final, for a game ending score of 31-17.\nSunday began with a game that made up for last week’s highly questionable calls. \nWhen the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, many cried foul over some of the referees’ rulings. Well after the Cowboys loss to the Green Bay Packers, it seems balance has been restored to the universe. Green Bay’s victory was heavily dependent on a few decisions by the officials, which many saw as debatable.  One skeptical call would have placed the Cowboys on the Packers’ 1-yard line, but instead led to a change of possession and the Packers’ victory.\nThe final game of the week featured one of professional football’s most impressive quarterbacks once again deteriorate under pressure. Hoping to make it back to the Super Bowl once more, the Denver Broncos hosted the Indianapolis Colts, ending the game with a discouraging loss of 24-13. \nAfter last year’s abysmal Super Bowl appearance, some feared that Broncos’ quarterback Peyton Manning might prove unable to lead the team when it really counts. Sadly, those fears came to fruition, as Manning was unable to put up more than one touchdown and 211 yards, making it one of his most disappointing games given the stakes.\nNext Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks will host the Green Bay Packers at 3:05 P.M., while the Indianapolis Colts will head to New England to face the Patriots at 6:40 P.M.']"

Police said they ran his license plate number and saw he had a suspended license. \nDavis told police he didn’t have his license and confirmed to police he knew his license was suspended, but needed to go to basketball practice, according to the report.\nPolice said that Davis was cited one day prior, on Jan. 11, for knowingly driving with a suspended license, but was not arrested. Police said that due to Davis having prior knowledge of his driving privileges being suspended, and his total disregard for the citation he received a day earlier, he was arrested. \nDavis’s license was suspended for failure to pay two citations in Brevard County on Jan. 16 2014 and Feb. 12 2014.

Abu-Jubara said that since our bodies are gifts from God we should take care of them and simultaneously end the rising obesity issue by helping to feed the hungry.\nProject Downtown: Orlando, a branch from the original in Miami, is a non-profit focusing on the needs of the homeless in Orlando. On the third Sunday of every month, volunteers of all different ethnic and religious backgrounds come together to serve hot meals to the homeless. But for them, it is much more than a bite to eat. Mahnoor Ashraf, co-director of Project Downtown, said that it is all about the interactions and conversations that are started.\n“Part of the Project Downtown project is not just to hand them a meal and be on our way, but to stop and listen and get to know their situation, greeting them with a smile because that is it’s own form of charity,” Ashraf said.\nArthur Richards, Hunger Prevention Director at ICNA, inspired students to pledge to fast, and raise awareness for the 3,000 children in Orange County alone who do not know where their next meal is coming from on a daily basis. He challenged MSA to start a food drive benefiting the homeless in Orlando and to check out nation-wide campaigns happening at feedtheirlegacy.org.\n“We would like UCF and specifically MSA, to organize a campus-wide food drive, so that when [the homeless] see and feel the love that you have for them maybe, just maybe it will be enough for them to become the presidents and leaders of tomorrow,” Richards said. “I offer you an opportunity to be the crutches that our broken members of our community need and allow them to go and help others in need.”', 'UCF repeated its final second victory against Houston Sunday afternoon when freshman B.J.

Although he did not create the Orlando filter, SnapChat has approved his filters for Daytona Beach, New Smyrna Beach and St. Augustine. \n“Because of UCF’s prominence in the Central Florida community, I figured it was only natural for them to have their own filter,” Huggins said. “I also knew the student population would appreciate having something they could use to show school spirit via social media, which is why I chose the phrase ‘Knight Nation.’”\nHe also said he believes the filter will get great usage on game days. \n“SnapChat is incredibly personable, and that’s what makes it unique,” Huggins said. “And they’ve only reinforced this further with the creation of geofilters.” \nThe first draft for the Knight Nation filter was submitted back in November and had Knightro in the place where the horse currently stands. It was rejected due to the UCF representation. After a few more rejected filters, Huggins finally had one approved. The current geofilter was approved because there are no distinct school-affiliated images. \n“I like it and think it’s cool that we’re one of the first to get one,” UCF student Clayton Cuteri said. “It’d be nice to have more options.”\nAlthough SnapChat Geofilter Submission Guidelines clearly state, “Absolutely no logos or trademarks, including school crests and similar marks,” geofilters are still being created with a geofence exclusive to specific college campuses. \nA geofence is the location specific boundaries in which the SnapChat filter can be accessed on SnapChat. The Knight Nation filter is only accessible on the UCF main campus. \nBeing the only school in Florida with a geofilter may make UCF unique in the SnapChat world for now, but other schools will have their own soon enough. \nFlorida State University might be the next university in Florida to have a school-spirited SnapChat filter.

On September 2, 2014, a video surfaced of Islamic State showing Steven’s beheading at the hands of ‘Jihadi John.’ He was only 31.\nSteven attended UCF for two years and was a senior staff writer for the Central Florida Future. \nAfter a trip to Israel in his second year, he realized he wanted to cover the Middle East. His parents were proud but concerned for his safety.\n“I would tell him, ‘Steven, you’re walking around with a target on your back,’” said Arthur. “But he wasn’t worried – he said had to do what he had to do.”\nSteven often became known for his want to provide a “voice to the voiceless,” later travelling regularly to the Middle East to cover unfolding events as a freelance journalist, making little money, although eager to continue pursuing his dreams.', 'Places like Syria drew his attention, where people had no way of sharing their accounts.\n“He never wanted to go for the big stories – it was always about the common people,” Arthur said. “It was about the voiceless, the people standing in the breadlines and the hospitals, the people that were suffering.”\nArthur and Shirley\xa0opened a panel to students and described the journey taken by their son at UCF and through his career.\nUCF sophomore journalism student Gianna Doxey was honored to have been able to hear the Sotloffs speak.\n“We all needed to hear this extra push and inspiration, especially after the recent Paris attacks,” she said. “Last week, the whole country was concerned by the red cups at Starbucks, and then a real story happened. Now we’re here tonight, and I think it was meant to be.”\nTo honor Sotloff and continue his legacy, the Sotloffs created the 2LIVES: Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial Foundation to provide scholarships for journalism students.\n“The scholarship not only memorializes our son, but also contributes to the future in a way that lives on for future journalists,” Shirley said.\nThe Foundation will soon award its first scholarship to a University of Miami journalism student. The first Steven Sotloff endowed scholarship will be presented on December 6 at 1 p.m. at the Miami Dolphins vs. Baltimore Ravens game.\n“Knowing that our son lives on, and the endowment will touch the lives of students with similar interests truly touches our entire family,” Shirley said.\nThough the Sotloffs have made strides in their acceptance of Steven’s death, they are still devastated.\n“My son was murdered in front of the entire world,” said Arthur. “I still can’t put my feelings into words.”\nPhoto Credit: Aileen Perilla', 'Where the tents sprout like mushroom caps and dangling lights illuminate the night sky, individuals from all walks of life joined together this past week at Tent City: Rising, an event of unity.\nBiannually, the Campus Peace Action club illustrates an ideal, peaceful community that befalls within the tranquil surroundings of the UCF Arboretum. For seven days and six nights from November 9th through 14th, familiar and unfamiliar faces are invited to come together and coexist through music, art, and a whole lotta love. All workshops are hosted and executed by members of the CPA club and shared with the community.\n“Tent City started back in 2003 as a response to the wars in Iraq. The event has moved around campus from the free speech zone, to memory mall, and now the arboretum. Over the years, the event became less politically fueled, evolving into a place for peaceful gathering and self-expression.” Said Jaimie Lanning, host of Tent City: Rising. “It’s the first place I felt at home at UCF.

It was impossible for one’s attention to stray away from the sounds and the enthusiastic energy at which these performers demonstrated an age old craft; it was captivating to both sight and sound.\nThe enchantment continued as the C-Melody dancers representing Vietnam told their stories “through the eyes.” The rendition used the manipulation of fans and flowing silk fabrics to kept the focus on the dancer’s upper body movements. \nThis beautifully synchronized dance used the richness of the flowing fabrics to portray a classic tale of young love with a “demonic” twist. The majestic colors and graceful movements of the dancers truly did tell the tale to the fullest. The seemingly effortless dance charmed the audience as the young women evoked the passion and conflict existing between two lovers.\nThe non-stop sensory explosion continued with a duo known as “Philipinese” further as they further immersed everyone in the romantic mood by serenading them with unique acoustic sounds. The pair blended pop culture top hits with Studio Ghibli (animation film producers) music strung in between; stimulated by the sounds, the audience accompanied the music with rhythmic strikes of the palms.\nAfter intermission, a one-man show brought out the child in everyone with the Chinese interpretation of “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” from Disney’s animated motion picture, Mulan. Shuyu Liu’s performance proved that, despite our cultural differences, we all share an emotional connection; it was the perfect segway in appeasing the audience’s thirst for more entertainment as the dance troupe followed suit with legendary dances from the Philippines. \nThe dancers engaged the audience with their face-paced footwork. This performance included wooden beams strategically laid out on the stage where the dancers demonstrated their technical skills as they rhythmically moved to the essence of the music. Different members of the same dance group then stirred the rhythmic juices as they engulfed the stage with their synchronized gesticulations of “punches” in combination with the powerful artist skill of tumbling, somersaults and once again, amazing footwork that captivated the audience throughout the performance.\nThe culminated feature was Knights Kangna, representing India whose agility and graceful gestures brought out the rich culture of their country’s dance as the artists incorporated modern movements. Modernizing the typical hand gestures or “mudra,” the dances combined the upbeat music of Bollywood and popular western hits as they told the story of two sisters whose family was tragically separated and eventually brought together.

Chandler denied wrongdoing, telling UCF there were delays but not a “purposeful fraudulent intent.”\nMichael Johnson, the UCF dean of Sciences, wrote a letter in response to Chandler’s explanation shortly after, saying “It is impossible for me to accept an explanation of ‘sloppiness’ on your part.

This performance included wooden beams strategically laid out on the stage where the dancers demonstrated their technical skills as they rhythmically moved to the essence of the music. Different members of the same dance group then stirred the rhythmic juices as they engulfed the stage with their synchronized gesticulations of “punches” in combination with the powerful artist skill of tumbling, somersaults and once again, amazing footwork that captivated the audience throughout the performance.\nThe culminated feature was Knights Kangna, representing India whose agility and graceful gestures brought out the rich culture of their country’s dance as the artists incorporated modern movements. Modernizing the typical hand gestures or “mudra,” the dances combined the upbeat music of Bollywood and popular western hits as they told the story of two sisters whose family was tragically separated and eventually brought together. The visual narrative was a perfect ending to both the show and the emotionally moving evening.']"

This would change several minutes later on a fast break to Bendik where the outstretched goalkeeper couldn’t deflect the path of the ball, evening the score to 1-1.\nAnother fifteen minutes passed to see the Fire strike the goalpost with a shot, nearly seizing the lead.\nOrlando City’s Cyle Larin walked off due to a minor medical issue that involved Chicago goalkeeper Matt Lampson mistakenly knee-ing Larin in the arm on a jump.\nWinter earned the closest shot on goal in the second half, rushing from midfield through defenders and firing to Lampson, who caught the ball for a no-goal.\nAntonio Nocerino subbed out for Pedro Ribiero in the 63rd minute, Nocerino’s first sixty-three in MLS, following a penalty break against the Lions’ Cristian Higuita.\nKevin Molino tripped on a surefire chance on goal, soon\xa0named a penalty against Chicago while giving Orlando a free kick led by Brek Shea.

Molino came back in the 80th minute to feed Hadji Barry on a one-on-one with Lampson, with the latter diving down to disrupt Barry from completing a kick.\nHead coach Adrian Heath expressed his thoughts on the match, citing a disappointment in the outcome.\nThe Lions travel to New York City to play rival NYCFC at Yankee Stadium on March 18th.\n\xa0', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – A miracle heave from freshman Jalen Adams to send the game into quadruple overtime gave the UConn Huskies just enough time to top the Cincinnati Bearcats 104-97 on Friday afternoon.\nAdams, a freshman guard, scored 15 of his 22 points in the four overtime periods which included the shocking 3-pointer with .8 seconds left on the clock.\nSophomore guard/forward Daniel Hamilton was a standout performer throughout the game, finishing with 32 points, 12 rebounds and 8 assists. Hamilton repeatedly found himself at the free throw line towards the end of the game and he knocked down 12 of 14 free throws.\nThe first half started slowly as both teams had trouble finding clean looks and seemingly had to shake off some rust from their layover heading into the tournament. However, it would be Cincinnati that found their shot first with the Bearcats dynamic backcourt of senior Farad Cobb and junior Troy Caupain doing most of the damage.\nCaupain, named first team all-conference in the American on Mar. 10, put up a phenomenal effort with 37 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in the game.\nCobb was deadly from beyond the arc early on with all eight of his shots in the first half from long range and connecting on three of them. UConn did not have nearly the same fortune as the Bearcats from the 3-point line in the first half, shooting an anemic 27.3 percent.\nThe Huskies were forced to rely on junior guard Rodney Purvis for much of the game with the rest of the team struggling to find the bottom of the net. Cincinnati’s zone defense started to shift its focus towards stopping Purvis, forcing UConn to look for scoring production elsewhere.\nGraduate student and guard Sterling Gibbs answered the call for the Huskies with back-to-back makes from long range to cut the lead to 3 early in the second half. Those makes sparked the entire team as UConn went on a 14-2 run to snatch the lead.\nBut the Bearcats were not finished as they rallied in the final three minutes and went on a 7-0 run to tie up the game and send it to the first of four overtime periods.\nAt that point, both Cincinnati and UConn traded shots back and forth until towards the end of the third overtime. The Bearcats’ Kevin Johnson stunned the Huskies with a huge 3-pointer which left the now infamous .8 seconds on the clock.\nUConn reversed their shooting woes of the first half as they knocked down 48 percent of their shots from the field in the rest of the game.

Tow trucks arrived at the scene to assist\xa0emergency vehicles in the retrieval\xa0but were unable to recover the car in time.\nTaking charge of the proposal is Clarissa Lindsey, Arenas’ best friend since they were two years old.\nThe Arenas family held a memorial service for their loved one on Friday, July 3 where\xa0family and close friends honored Chloe’s life. At the service, Lindsey and the Arenas family made public their journey to proposing a law in tribute to their Knight – Chloe’s Law.\n“Chloe’s law aims to require the implementation of guard rails along dangerous bodies of water that accompany road ways in Florida,” Lindsey said.\xa0“This is an ongoing issue in Florida, being that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that Florida is the most dangerous place in the nation regarding victims who drown in submerged vehicles.”\nIn 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reviewed crash data and death records from 2004 to 2007 and concluded that Florida averaged 57 deaths by drownings in those years, with 384 deaths occurring nationwide.\nThe Orlando Sentinel continued a review of the federal crash data, surveying records from 2008 to 2012, finding that Florida again topped the nation with 49 drownings inside vehicles during the five-year period. Texas came in a distant second with 18 deaths followed by Indiana with 14 deaths, and Louisiana and Arizona with 10 deaths in each state, the Orlando Sentinel\xa0reported.\nArenas began classes at UCF in the summer of 2012 and enrolled in courses at Valencia College on a path of becoming a veterinarian.\nDriven by a passion for zoo and domestic animals,\xa0she could be seen caring for many, including her bearded dragon, dog and a cat that she found alongside a road, with dreams of one day treating elephants in Africa.\n“Though I am confident that this law will save many lives, it will be a success if we are able to save only one,” Lindsey said.\n“The next step in the process is to finish the research and completion of the first draft of the policy proposal. I plan to seek out House representatives and senators in support of this beneficial and necessary bill.”\nA Change.org\xa0petition\xa0has been made in support of the proposed bill.', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – The #1 seed Temple Owls had no trouble in dispatching the #9 seed USF Bulls as they advanced to the AAC Tournament semi-final with a 79-62 victory on Friday afternoon.\n“Very good win for us. And happy to be here sitting here after a good first round victory,” Temple head coach Fran Dunphy said. “I thought we played fairly well throughout. I think McMurray’s a really hard guy to guard and I thought Josh Brown did a terrific job on him.”\nTemple came out shooting 3-pointers to great success early on and did an excellent job of spreading the ball around. Four different players had makes from beyond the arc for the Owls before the 10 minute mark of the first half.\nThe Bulls were a bit sluggish to start the game, but a 9-0 run late in the first half helped get the game back within range. Junior Chris Perry followed up his strong performance against the East Carolina Pirates with 19 points and 8 rebounds.\n“We held with [Temple], but on the offensive glass, that’s where they got us,” Perry said. “Big bodies versus big bodies, there’s going to be physicality. We matched it, but not on the offensive boards.”\nTemple obliterated the Bulls on the glass with 15 offensive rebounds in the game which resulted in the Owls scoring 19 second chance points.\nSenior forward Jaylen Bond for the Owls found space to shoot all over the floor in the first half and eventually finishing with 17 points while creating defensive mismatches all game against the Bulls. Bond’s 6-foot-8 presence on the wing cut into the Bulls’ zone with ease which eventually opened up space for their 3-point shooters in the second half.\n“I know my time here is winding down, so I’m trying to give them 100 percent effort to finish out my season strong for me and my teammates,” Bond said.\nThe game really got out of hand when Temple went on a 12-2 run midway through the second half which extended their lead to 20 points. Sophomore Obi Enechionyia, despite being in foul trouble for most of the game, maximized his limited minutes with 13 points and 5 rebounds.\n“I think we have a lot of fight,” Enechionyia said. “In the regular season we would have games where we would be down 10, 12, 15 in the second half and we would be able to come back and win that game.”\nTemple will move on to face the winner of the Cincinnati/UConn game in the American Athletic Conference tournament semifinal tomorrow at 3 p.m.\nPhoto by Edward Fabara/The Skyboat', 'Knight News has learned from an email released by the University of Central Florida that the Student Government Election Commission will be holding a secret hearing Wednesday that could decide if a candidate will be thrown off the ballot. \nClosing these hearings is unprecedented — these election hearings have always been open in the past. \nThe hearing comes as a result of candidate Jacob Milich saying he would run before SGA allowed him to say so. This comes after Milich told SGA he would sue it for violating his first amendment rights.\nKnight News emailed David Oglethorpe, UCF’s record custodian and communication coordinator and asked for any emails that may have been sent regarding the closure of the violation hearing.\nOglethorpe sent an email chain to Knight News that was exchanged by the candidate and Katie Marshall, SGA’s Election Commission Advisor. In that email, Marshall told the candidate that the meeting would be closed to the public, which according to Knight News’ attorney, would violate the Sunshine Law.\nAfter sending the email, Oglethorpe was quick to realize he had made a mistake and sent another email to Knight News stating, “This previous email was inadvertently sent and its attachment is unreleasable as per FERPA restrictions.

Squirrels! \nThat’s what students shared as they gathered Monday, April 4 at the Student Union (SU), to share their favorite stories about the notorious (or infamous) UCF squirrels.\nThe annual Nuts about UCF event put on by SGA is a favorite amongst students. \nSGA scattered funny signs all around the SU, set up a photo booth, as well a place for students to share their dramatic squirrel stories that will later be made into a video. \nA contest to win a shirt is available for students on Instagram: all you have to do is share your story about why you are nuts about UCF using the #NutsAboutUCF. \nPhoto Credit: Aileen Perilla ', 'By: Rachel Dececco\nA buck plopped down on a table outside the Student Union. To buy a cupcake. It’s a donation. But where does that one dollar go? Who’s on the other end of it? Who does it help? In this case, it helps pay for a young girl’s last dance, a child’s last Christmas and someone to hold a hand.\nCupcakes for a Cure, a University of Central Florida student organization, tables twice a month outside the union. According to club President Hansee Karamchandani, all of the proceeds from the cupcakes go to an organization called BASE Camp, an Orlando-based children’s cancer foundation that provides year round support for children suffering from cancer and other life threatening illnesses. \nThe foundation puts on events throughout the year, and collects donations for their members. Karamchandani said the best part of the club is “forming the relationships” that help “fuel her drive” to raise money for the children and families supported by BASE Camp.\nJackie Ellis is the director of development for the facility. She heard about BASE Camp through its prom event. \nJackie’s daughter, Simone Ellis, had been diagnosed with aggressive fibromatosis. The disease is marked by the slow growth of tumors in cells that are meant to protect vital organs such as the lungs and liver. \nAccording to Jackie, when she was 17 years old, her daughter received an invitation from BASE Camp to attend their annual prom. \n“We thought she would be shuffled into a room with younger kids, bad music, and cheap decorations,” Jackie said. “She did the typical teenager thing, complained and rolled her eyes. I told her she should go, and if she didn’t like it, I would pick her up.” \nSimone went. At midnight, Jackie did get a call, just not the one she expected. Her daughter called to say she was “having a blast.” \nJackie said she was shocked. She “never heard her, [Simone,] sound so excited and happy.” \nEventually Simone started going to more events and her mom started to volunteer. Jackie ended up becoming executive director for eight years.\n“BASE Camp is there to hold your hand,” Jackie said. “It’s not just a slogan.” \nWhen 26-year-old Simone was suddenly hospitalized, Jackie knew this was her daughter’s last hospital visit. \nThat night Jackie said she made two phone calls. One was to BASE Camp founder Terri Jones-Robbins. The other was to director of programs, Cindy Whitaker. Jackie said both Whitaker and Robbins rushed to the hospital. “That night inside the hospital room, they held Simone’s hand with me as she died,” Jackie said. \n“BASE Camp is smaller than similar organizations, but we have twice the heart,” Jackie said. \nBASE Camp offers an enormous amount of services and holds events throughout the year for the families associated with them. By doing this, the foundation is constantly involved in the lives of the families involved. Dinner and movie nights are planned for kids who are in the hospital and want a taste of the outside world. \nA food pantry is also filled for families who have had to give up their jobs to look after their sick kids. Another event is an annual Christmas party held in December and July. BASE Camp grants wishes for kids who have overcome cancer and second wishes for kids who have relapsed. The list is immense.\nRick and Diana Barnum have only one word to describe their experience at BASE Camp: “amazing,” 61-year-old Diana said. She and her husband Rick, 65, have been volunteering for about eight months. \nJessie Kendrick, 32, started volunteering around the same time as the Barnum family. She describes her experience as “something out of this world.”\nAfter Kendrick’s first night she stated she was “energized by how playful, and funny he kids were.” \nTthere was a little boy who was leaving, and as he was walking out the door he turned to me and said BYE Felisha! After that I was hooked,” Kendrick recalled.', 'By: Claudia Gesiotto\nIt was a perfectly sunny day with a slight breeze at Lake Claire. A multitude of people started to arrive, including children, college students and parents. Some wore blank white t-shirts in anticipation for the bags of paint that would end up plastered to them by the end of the day, while others bought T-shirts that were available for a $5 donation to Sangam, UCF’s Indian Student Association.\nHoli, the Hindu Festival of Colors, is a famous holiday in India that marks the advent of spring.\nThe joyful celebrations traditionally include people throwing colored powder and water balloons at each other, as well as singing and dancing. This year, India celebrated Holi on Thursday, March 24.\nAt UCF, Sangam hosted their very own Holi celebration from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on April 3. The event was free to all UCF students and faculty. People from the community paid a small fee of $5 for paint bags, water balloons and food.\nThe festivities commenced with DJ Keshav Nelavai, a sophomore at UCF, playing catchy Bollywood songs with the occasional addition of E.D.M and pop music while the President of Sangam Chirag Bhandari gave instructions to form two lines facing each other.\n“We try to have everyone clash in the middle so there is an explosion of color,” Bhandari said. “This way, it looks cool and you get a feel for what it is actually like in India.”\nThe walls of people rushed forward as a brilliant haze from all the colors rose up to the sky.\n“Holi is a huge community thing. Neighbors, family and people from out of town all come together and have fun,” Bhandari said.\nSince it became a registered student organization on campus in 1983, Sangham has been hosting the festival. Bandar said they do it ever year.\nUCF junior Adrian Del Toro said he would definitely come next year.\n“It has been a lot of fun throwing paint on each other and just acting like fools,” Del Toro said.\nThe color wars were temporarily halted for a lunch break. The rainbow colored line of people twisted around the Lake Claire pavilion. The Indian cuisine from Aashirwad included chicken biryani.\nCaelin Linaja, one of the most vividly painted participants, said he enjoyed his first Holi celebration.\n“The highlight of today was the connections I made,” Linaja said. “You can do things you normally wouldn’t do in a group like dance crazy and throw water on random strangers.”\nThe day concluded with water gun and water balloon fights. Despite water being squirted everywhere, the bodies and faces of many remained painted with the beautiful colors of Holi.', 'By: Brianna Jones\nImagine throwing a Project X type of party every other weekend; with an outgoing personality and drive, one University of Central Florida student made that possible.\nFabian Rene, a junior marketing major, saw an untapped world and decided to conquer it. Commonly known as “Faybo,” he is a major party promoter at UCF. He went from having no social life in high school to being the go-to party guru for the black community his freshman year at UCF.\n“I basically went to school, I went to football practice and after football practice I went home and then do it all over again,” Rene said.\nOriginally planned to go to Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University (FAMU), Rene was discouraged because he knew he could be something greater at UCF. After getting accepted for summer semester at UCF, he was driven to make the most out of his experience.\n“At that point, I [swore] to God I’m going to take advantage of this opportunity that he gave me,” said Rene.\nAs a freshman, he was approached through Twitter by older UCF promoters — because of his magnetic personality — to join their promoting team. At first party promoting was just a pastime on social media, until he made $600 off of his first party. Using the skills that he learned in his marketing classes sophomore year, he created his own party-promoting company, FayboEra.\nRene’s first solo party, Who Is Who, was the event that made him known not only to UCF students, but also to local club owners and promoters. Who Is Who was a party where students on Twitter got to finally meet face-to-face with other students who they have been interacting with on social media. The end results were a success, with a turnout of over 500 people maxing out the local King Tut’s Lounge and a total revenue of $8,000.\n“I was on a success high, it felt like nothing was going to stop me,” Rene said.\nAs his parties became more popular, Rene’s business began to expand. At the start, Rene did everything by himself; he was his own accountant and marketer, anything that needed to be done was done by him. \nRealizing other ways to become more marketable, he joined a joint venture with his friend, Matthew Fontil. \nDropping the name FayboEra and picking up Fontil’s name, TMRWCO became a hit. Rene runs the company while Fontil, an up-and-coming rapper, focuses more on his music.\nTMRWCO not only plans events but also handles artists like a record label, market and brand. \nThe company tries to reach all avenues of entertainment. Legitimizing his business even further, Rene hand-selected a team, choosing students from UCF, Valencia and Fullsail.\nHis go-to team consists of two of his closest friends, Kevin Louidor and Darius McFadden. They have weekly meetings to keep him updated on progress. Since these are paid positions, Rene is looking to start filing taxes.\n“I’m just taking this company to a whole other level,” Rene said.\nMaking business relations with local club owners was a breeze because “money talks,” Rene said. \nAs the owners began to see his work ethic, they began to respect him.\n“He’s the guy to go for college students,” said Tony Khuu, co-owner of Uno Night Club.\nNow that he is a well-respected promoter, club owners don’t charge him a fee upfront as they would others. At the age of 20, Rene was able to host parties at local and downtown clubs. \nOf course there are always hurdles in life; some downtown clubs treat him like the average college student and not like the well-rounded businessman that he is. This has caused him to shy away from downtown for a while.\n“I want to be treated like a business partner not like some promoter you just hired,” Rene said.\nCompetition isn’t something Rene feeds into. Having a humble mindset, he isn’t looking to monopolize the industry.\n“Some days I wake up feeling like Kanye and other days I’m like ‘it’s not mine it’s all of ours.’”\nMajority of those in the same line of business as him are his friends, so instead of tearing each other down they collectively build on each other—having joint parties and being courteous when choosing party dates. Respect is a key component when business and friendships are involved.\n“He stays positive regardless of the outcome… he’s resilient,” stated the Young Trend Setter CEO, Dimitri Jean- Pierre about Rene.\nIn addition to his business, Rene also maintains his grades and leadership roles. Freshman year he was a part of SB PAC, Sophomore year he was the CAB Marketing Director and is currently a member of Progressive Black Men.\nHis dreams exceed local UCF. After college he wants to continue to prosper with TMWRCO and move to Germany to work for BMW. Having been uncharacteristically quiet for the last few months, Rene is definitely up to something.\n“I’m silent right now but, the moves are being made behind the scene.”', 'Ticket distribution has started for one of the most anticipated events at the University of Central Florida…\nUniversal Knights ticket distribution kicks off Monday, April 4.

At the service, Lindsey and the Arenas family made public their journey to proposing a law in tribute to their Knight – Chloe’s Law.\n“Chloe’s law aims to require the implementation of guard rails along dangerous bodies of water that accompany road ways in Florida,” Lindsey said. “This is an ongoing issue in Florida, being that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that Florida is the most dangerous place in the nation regarding victims who drown in submerged vehicles.”\nIn 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reviewed crash data and death records from 2004 to 2007 and concluded that Florida averaged 57 deaths by drownings in those years, with 384 deaths occurring nationwide.\nThe Orlando Sentinel continued a review of the federal crash data, surveying records from 2008 to 2012, finding that Florida again topped the nation with 49 drownings inside vehicles during the five-year period. Texas came in a distant second with 18 deaths followed by Indiana with 14 deaths, and Louisiana and Arizona with 10 deaths in each state, the Orlando Sentinel reported.\nArenas began classes at UCF in the summer of 2012 and enrolled in courses at Valencia College on a path of becoming a veterinarian.\nDriven by a passion for zoo and domestic animals, she could be seen caring for many, including her bearded dragon, dog and a cat that she found alongside a road, with dreams of one day treating elephants in Africa.\n“Though I am confident that this law will save many lives, it will be a success if we are able to save only one,” Lindsey said.\n“The next step in the process is to finish the research and completion of the first draft of the policy proposal. I plan to seek out House representatives and senators in support of this beneficial and necessary bill.”\nA Change.org petition has been made in support of the proposed bill.\nPhoto courtesy of Clarissa Lindsey\n\xa0']"

The speakers promoted millennials within the party, and claimed the Republican Party to be the party of youth and Diversity. \nThe most exciting part of the day however came after, where several GOP delegates declared a motion for a roll call vote, which would require each and every delegate to verbally declare who they were voting for.\nThis was done in an attempt to contest Trump as the GOP nominee after the committee tried to pass a motion that would forego such a vote, and grant Trump with the nomination uncontested. \nNine states originally backed the motion for the voice vote, which would surpass the 7 state requirement to pass such a motion. But after short deliberation, 3 states removed their support for the motion and the Committee was able to quell the rebellion.\nIn the second half of day one several notable speakers such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Melania Trump made speeches before the Cleveland congregation.

Hitt Library was for more than checking out books and study sessions. The building hung up the secrets of eleven members of the UCF faculty and staff. Their secret? Art. One might have never suspected that a professor or someone working in one of the many offices on campus was a “Hidden Artist,” as the exhibit was rightfully named. It was the third year that this event has taken place to spotlight the talents of UCF’s staff. \nImmediately, one could be drawn in to the crystal-clear photographs by Gina Clifton, an Admissions Specialist. Clifton’s photos included a dazzling golden sunset, few of colorful birds and an obvious love for art.\n“My passion for photography comes from a love of nature, people, places, and life. I enjoy capturing that moment in time and sharing it with other people. The gallery exhibit gave me another outlet for sharing my photographs,” Clifton shared. \nAmong the most heartfelt pieces was the very first on display, titled “We Are…” by IT Business Analyst Senior Dawn Herrod which was a collection of photographs taken in wake of the tragedy at the Pulse Nightclub and displayed how the community came together to show their support for Orlando. \n“I spent several days visiting the memorials, often just sitting on the hot sidewalk reading the signs and notes, watching other visitors, and even taking water to the homeless man who watched over the site at Dr. Phillips. I think I took literally hundreds of photos of the memorials, visitors, and even one of the victims who was wheeled out of the hospital by his nurses to visit his friends’ crosses,” Herrod said.\n“For the first time in my life, I saw a local and national outpouring of support for the LGBTQ community. It is unfortunate that sometimes it takes a tragic loss to soften people’s hearts, but somehow it did just that for many. Even if it was only for a short time, people were reminded that we are all just people trying to find our place in this world, trying to find love, joy, and safety. Taking the photos was therapeutic for me, helping me to process what happened. Putting the piece in the exhibit was my way of holding onto the support of the community just a little while longer.”\nThese artists don’t just sell copies of their artwork, they give back in ways that benefit the community. IT Department Manager Russell Muller, whose artwork features that of a dog sticking its head out of a window on a car ride, does just that. \n“I donate a percentage of all of my art sales to Halifax Humane Society, and they are my charity of choice when I make donations,” Muller said.\nThe focus of most of his images were classic cars. \nOther artists featured in this exhibit were Meredith Malkin, Pamela Williams Gruen, Simona Loh, Fiona Murphy, Judy Bragg Pardo, Brian Pate, and M.C Santana. The exhibit showed UCF’s community that staff members are much more than just staff members. They have incredible talents and are people with passions, just like students.\nLibrary image a rendering of a reading room a few years way from construction.', 'Three chariots carrying the gods pulled through the campus for the Ratha Yatra celebration on Wednesday.\nThe annual Festival of the Chariots, as it’s called, opened as volunteers carried bright and lavish chariots in a large parade from Pegasus Circle to the Student Union at UCF, before hosting a multicultural celebration in the Pegasus ballroom encouraging tolerance of other faiths.\nThe ceremony represents the humanization of God according to Professor Deepa Nair, a Faculty Advisor for the Indian Student Association.\n“It is an opportunity to see God and for him to see us,” Nair said.\nRatha Yatra honors Lord Krishna’s return to Vrindaban and originated over 5,000 years ago in India, in a city called Jagannatha Puri. The three wooden chariots are present for the three deities, Lord Balarama and Lady Subhadra, and namely the “Lord of the Universe,” Jagannatha.\nHigh energy dances and drums filled the ballroom echoing the same chants that accompanied the Chariot parade which circled the Student Union in the afternoon.\nEnthusiasts joyously dancing and chanting the “Lord’s Holy Names” remind those in attendance just how universal religious traditions are:\nHare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare\nHare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.\nNot unlike Allah or Yahweh, Jehovah or Jesus Christ, the supreme deity at the center of the Hindu occasion is the source of dutiful pride for those in attendance but people involved insist the festival is anything but religious.\nShraddhanjali Devidasi of the Hare Krishna Society described it as “a cultural outreach.” Similarly, Dvaipayana Das of UCF’s Sangam Club said: “this is about spirituality and self-realization, not religion.”\nThe chariot procession and wellness festival is part of a larger effort to tell people about the ancient civilization of India in colleges around the U.S. by groups like the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) who organized the event and performs around the world.\nSeveral hundreds of students and enthusiasts from all backgrounds partook in the diverse celebration ranging from a Bhakti Yoga session, vegetarian Indian foods, sacred dance, and a lengthy musical performance from The Mayapuris and lasted nearly nine hours.\nThe diversity of the crowd even surprised Das who glanced into the ballroom at those enjoying the art of a Hindu sculptor. “We do not consider any boundaries, anybody comes.”\nUndoubtedly, the sight of an open and embracing Hindu tradition greeting new faces with Kirtan world music and what they called prasadam (free food) is more than welcome.\nFor leaders like Nair the spiritual passion of the festival is crucial. “The times that we are living in, we need to be aware of the different cultures and be respectful of different cultural ideas and identities.”\n\xa0', 'A young woman attends a sexual morality conference at the Student Union, listening intently.\nIn front of her, a panel of religious leaders discusses their views on gender equality, homosexuality, and transgender visibility. It’s an odd topic, to be sure, but one that she said she finds fascinating. She studiously takes notes throughout.\nWhen asked why she was personally invested in the conference, her answer was simple.\n“I’m gay and I want to be a rabbi,” she said. “So I want to promote a better cultural understanding within religion.”\nKayla Symonds, a sophomore religion and cultural studies major at UCF, is the president of BAGELS+, a club for Jewish members of the LGBTQ+ community. BAGELS+ (an acronym for Bisexual, Asexual, Gay, Exploring and Lesbian Students) is a part of Central Florida Hillel, a Jewish cultural center for college students in the Central Florida area. As president of BAGELS+, Symonds plans events such as celebrations of Jewish holidays and scriptural readings.\n“There’s a lot more of us than you’d think,” Symonds said.\nAccording to Central Florida Hillel’s mission page, UCF has the third largest Jewish student population outside of Israel, with an estimated 6,000 Jewish students attending. UCF is also well-known for its LGBTQ+ inclusive\xa0environment – it’s the only Florida school to make Campus Pride’s Top 50 LGBT-Friendly List as of 2014. The combined support from the Jewish and LGBTQ+ community made UCF the perfect environment for BAGELS+ to flourish.\nSymonds began working at Central Florida Hillel as a community engagement intern. She found her niche in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community after recognizing the need for more involvement.\n“I’ve always found the struggles of the Jewish community and the LGBTQ+ community linked,” Symonds said. “Anti-Semitism and homophobia are two issues we still face today. And being a member of both communities means being a minority within a minority.”\nSam Friedman, director of community relations at Central Florida Hillel, also recognized the importance of BAGELS+.\n“One of the things we’re most proud of is forming BAGELS+,” Friedman said. “We pride ourselves on being a center for the community, and the community means everybody.\nFor Symonds, Judaism is the foundation of her identity. She keeps her diet kosher, has a mezuzah (a scroll with Hebrew verses from the Torah) on her door, and observes Shabbat. A common misconception, she said, is believing that her religion conflicts with her sexuality.\n“When people find out that I’m gay and Jewish, they ask, ‘do you really believe in it [Judaism]?’, and the answer is yes. Yes, I am gay. Yes, I am religious. And yes, I am observant.”\nHomosexuality is a divisive issue within the Jewish community. The more conservative Orthodox Judaism generally disapproves of homosexuality, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism are more tolerant. Central Florida Hillel is firmly LGBTQ+ friendly.\n“Some Jewish organizations say that homosexuality is expressly forbidden in the book of Leviticus,” Friedman said. “But Abraham, the first Jew, was known for welcoming every guest that came to his tent. You can’t be like Abraham if you’re not going to welcome everybody.”\n“In Judaism, we have an expression: two Jews, three opinions. So a lot of different people will say a lot of different things,” Symonds said. “I firmly believe that it is up to you to interpret the text, and for me, the text embraces my identity.”\nAfter graduating UCF, Symonds said she plans to spend a year in Jerusalem before attending Hebrew Union College to continue her rabbinical studies. The college has campuses in Cincinnati, Jerusalem, Los Angeles and New York, but Symonds said she’s not sure where she wants to study just yet.\n“It depends on how things go with my girlfriend. We’re looking at schools near her,” Symonds said.\nSymonds said her faith in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community was reaffirmed in February.\nSymonds is active on Tumblr, and read the story of a German transgender woman who wanted to convert to Judaism. Her rabbi warned her that the beit din (a group of rabbis that oversee the conversion process) might require her to compromise her gender identity.\n“I thought that I might be able to help, so I emailed a friend who works with French Jewish LGBTQ+ organizations,” Symonds said. “My friend ended up forwarding the email to Frank Giaoui, the president of the World Congress of GLBT Jews. And he emailed the former president. One thing led to another, and they found a beit din that would help her convert.”\n“Seeing so many people respond was affirming,” Symonds said. “We have another expression: he who saves one life saves the world entire. I truly believe that.”', 'If you are looking to tailgate UCF’s first game for cheap, you’re in luck.\nThe free beer on game days is continuing downtown at The Basement until UCF football wins their first game of the season. \nThe free beer deal came about last year in the middle of UCF’s winless season. \nThe Basement posted on its Facebook page, “One last chance for free beer!

It is in this spirit that I encourage you to actively listen, engage in scholarly dialogue and demonstrate our shared commitment to respect for all Knights. I challenge you to demonstrate civility.

In the more tense moments of the protest, police officers have subjected the demonstrators to tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, and blasts from water cannons in subfreezing temperatures. Now, with winter approaching and no sign that either side will back down, the situation seems to have reached a stalemate.\nTwo UCF alumni who have spent time protesting at the Standing Rock Reservation were among those rallying around Lake Eola Sunday.\nEmily Ruff, a 2005 graduate, described the harmonious atmosphere of Standing Rock when she first visited in September.\n“Hundreds of tribes that previously had experienced years of intertribal conflict were setting aside their baggage to stand united in solidarity for a single mission: to protect the water and the environment,” she said.\n“It was really beautiful and moving to see both indigenous tribes and non-indigenous allies standing together in incredible solidarity and bringing our power together to support the Earth and all that’s sacred.”\nThe group was also assembled to protest the construction of the Sabal Trail Pipeline, a $3 billion natural gas pipe that will run under portions of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia.\nSunday’s demonstration opened with a prayer ritual performed by Joey Karei, a Taino Indian. Karei, along with the rest of those assembled, prayed for open-mindedness, understanding, and the forgiveness of police officers and Dakota Access workers.\nThe group then marched to the Orlando offices of Senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio and the SunTrust building. SunTrust is one of several banks partially funding the Dakota Access Pipeline, according to Food & Water Watch.\nAlthough the march was peaceful and occurred largely without incident, there was at least one instance of a truck driver, angered that the protestors were marching in the street, accelerating suddenly toward the back of the group before slamming on his brakes.\nAlthough students may feel compelled to travel to North Dakota to protest the pipeline in person, doing so is not necessarily the best way to show support, said Matt De Vlieger, a 2007 UCF graduate.\nDe Vlieger had just returned from North Dakota. He had originally intended to only stay for 5 days, but lengthened his stay to nearly two weeks after seeing a rubber bullet break his friend’s arm.\nThe best way for people to support the water protectors in North Dakota, he said, is to simply start a conversation about the project and identify the “pillars of support” funding the project. From there, he encourages students to do their part to non-violently oppose the construction project.\n“We need to commit ourselves to nonviolence. We need to commit ourselves to nonviolent direct action.

He had originally intended to only stay for 5 days, but lengthened his stay to nearly two weeks after seeing a rubber bullet break his friend’s arm.\nThe best way for people to support the water protectors in North Dakota, he said, is to simply start a conversation about the project and identify the “pillars of support” funding the project. From there, he encourages students to do their part to non-violently oppose the construction project.\n“We need to commit ourselves to nonviolence. We need to commit ourselves to nonviolent direct action. That means not just sitting on Facebook and clicking,” he said.']"

A Chili’s representative was on hand for students in line to answer questions and explain menu options on opening day.\n@UCFKnightNews Good things are worth waiting for!\n— Chili's Grill & Bar (@Chilis) January 4, 2017\n\nAlthough divisive, due to the permanent closing of the long-time, alumni-owned Wackadoo’s in the same Student Union location, Chili’s may overshadow the memory of Wackadoo’s as the next generation of students enroll at UCF.\nHours and a menu for the Spring semester are below. No ‘Two for Twenty’ deal will be run as of now.\nAlcohol will be served to students 21 and older – the same practice of Wackadoo’s and their legal sale of alcoholic beverages to students 21 and older. A permitting issue that took place Monday has since been resolved and the beverages will be sold under the permit, UCF officials stated."", 'Original Story (January):\nStudents at the University of Central Florida can expect two new dining options to open this Spring 2017 – Chili’s in the Student Union and Pollo Tropical near the Recreation and Wellness Center and RWC Pool.\nKnight News communicated with UCF News and Information Senior Communications Coordinator Mark Schlueb on the opening of the two new restaurants. Schlueb indicated that, while there is no hard opening date set for Chili’s, the ‘Grill & Bar’ hopes to be opened in January – possibly in time for the start of the Spring semester.\nAs for Pollo Tropical, university officials ‘expect substantial completion by the end of January,’ Schlueb said.\nThis window will depend on the timely arrival and installation of an outdoor canopy to be set over a patio for students to eat, according to the most recent renderings of the building.\nOn current timetables, employee training will take place in February 2017 and a potential opening could take place in March. No official opening date has been set thus far.\nStay tuned for announcements of UCF student dining options and opening dates.\n–\nPollo Tropical story (July):\nTo meet the needs of additional food service options on the south side of campus, the University of Central Florida and construction crews have begun work on a standalone restaurant adjacent to the Leisure Pool and Recreation and Wellness Center.\nThe 3,200 square-foot building, to host Pollo Tropical, will aim for a LEED Silver certification for sustainability and appears to take a different look than the Caribbean-style food chain’s\xa0traditional restaurant exterior.\nIn 2013, the Neptune housing community opened and expanded to include\xa0650 additional beds\xa0in the Nike and Hercules complexes. Over time, the need for food options available to students south of Gemini Blvd. grew, with Subway in the RWC as the current closest choice, aside from ’63 South.\nThe building will be located near the UCF main campus south housing communities and will also hold a Café Bustello, with Pollo Tropical holding the majority of the 3,200 square-feet of space.\nAramark will contribute $2.5 million to the $3.3 million project and completion of the restaurant\xa0will be near the end of January 2017, according to UCF officials.\nKnight’s Plaza reopens in August to the campus after renovation began in late May. The project enhances beautification on the north side of campus.\n– See more at: http://knightnews.com/2017/01/ucf-hopeful-to-open-student-union-chilis-january-pollo-tropical-in-march/#sthash.XdeRFasn.dpuf', 'Business Administration 1 will see new renovations over the majority of the inside of the building during the Spring semester.\nWalls, stairways, and floors have been stripped to make way for the next generation of learning environments at the University of Central Florida.\nAccording to UCF, this remodeling will update common spaces in BA-1 on the first and second floors. This will include a cleaner-looking, “more engaging culture in a flexible learning environment that supports innovation and collaboration,” Director of Communications and Marketing Erika Hodges says.\nClasses and activities will not be impacted this semester due to construction although certain pathways may be affected. Much of the work will take place after-hours and on the weekend. Periphery stairways and elevators should be used to access second-floor classrooms during business hours.\nSeveral ‘Pardon Our Dust’ signs have been placed throughout the building to provide students with project information and second-floor access points.\n\nConstruction began at the end of the Fall semester and continued over Winter break.

Two Knights earned all-conference accolades by the end of the season.\nPhoto: UCF Athletics Communications.', 'University of Central Florida Vice President and Director of Athletics Danny White signed a contract amendment that will keep White “in his current position for the foreseeable future,” said UCF.\n“I hired Danny two years ago because he understood that success starts with winning with integrity and student-athletes thriving in the classroom, and because he had a strong history of hiring successful coaches,” said UCF President John C.

During White’s tenure, UCF Athletics was the beneficiary of the largest cash pledge ever committed to the university by an individual alumnus and has seen more than $13 million committed toward UCF Athletics’ $25 million athletics village vision. Kenneth G. Dixon committed more than $5 million to establish the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village. Tony and Sonja Nicholson recently donated $2 million to support the Athletics Village vision.

Behind the scenes, White was responsible for the introduction of the Rise and Conquer Initiative, which will help UCF Athletics enhance funding for athletic scholarships and grow its operating budget through ticket sales, annual giving and corporate revenue.

Assistant coach Tyrone Corbin has since replaced Clifford as the acting head coach going forward going into Monday’s matchup.\xa0\nIt was a dismal start for the Magic trailing 28-16 after the first quarter which saw the team shoot a woeful 27% from the court going 6-22.\xa0\xa0\nThings quickly started to heat up though as the Magic went on a tear in the second quarter outscoring the Lakers 40 to 22 to jump out the lead the Lakers 56-50 by the end of the first half.\xa0\nMagic forward Chuma Okeke said he believed his dunk over Lakers center Andre Drummond in the first couple minutes of the second quarter ignited the run they went on.\xa0\n“I feel that gave us a boost for everybody on the team,” Okeke said. “That gave us a boost to play harder than we were playing.
