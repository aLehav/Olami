They showed a few of their favorite pictures and videos that fans have submitted to their Web site, collegehumor.com, and even got interactive with the audience.  \nThree volunteers went on stage to participate in a little trivia game to win a $25 Apple gift card. \nThe first contestant was asked to name five Weird Al songs, which he was able to do with some help from the audience. \nThe second was a girl so she was given the only “girl question,” which was to sing a Hannah Montana song.\nShe ended up singing a few lines from about three different songs, but managed to get the prize. \nThe last contestant was asked what seemed to be the easiest question, but he still struggled with it for a bit. He had to say where the latest season of The Real World was taking place. After a few moments, and some shouting from the audience, he was finally able to say “Cancun.”  \nAfter the audience was all warmed up, the guys from Broken Lizard came out. With their ample use of profanity and obscenity, they kept the audience laughing from beginning to end. \nTheir entire show was composed of various smaller skits, which altogether lasted well over an hour. Their skits ranged from topics including masturbation, sex, drinking, drugs, parodies of the ancient Greeks and of computer help hotlines operated by people in India. \nSome of their humor was offensive, but that didn’t seem to bother anyone too much.  \nThe guys from Broken Lizard also had three volunteers go up to stage to help out. These had to read a short phrase with the best German accent they could do. After this, they participated in a small drinking competition against three of the guys of Broken Lizard. \nThe first participant had to empty his entire cup — of non-alcoholic beer of course — and then place his cup upside-down on his head before the next person in his team could do the same. The first team to go through all three members would win. \nUnfortunately, the students lost.  \nThe entire event was a success and everyone was making positive comments about it, and about how glad they were to have gone. Many were already fans of Broken Lizard, so to them it was a great experience to have seen them live. And those who hadn’t heard of the group are now their newest fans.\nBroken Lizard consists of five members: Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske. They began as a student sketch comedy group at Colgate University and have continued to be very successful in what they do. \nThe group has created some hysterical films such as Puddle Cruiser, Super Troopers, and Beerfest. They are currently working on their latest film, The Slammin’ Salmon, which comes out sometime this year.']",['https://knightnews.com/2009/08/broken-lizard-brings-big-laughs-to-ucf/'],0.233385369181633,0.26013267040252686,0.09646404534578323

Abdul Kalam, the former president of India and an aeronautical engineer, gave a presentation entitled “World Space Vision 2050” to UCF students on October, 22 in the Pegasus Ballroom of the Student Union.\nAfter a brief introduction from President Hitt, Kalam asked what UCF students would be remembered for. He said that it would be something different; some out of the box missions, but that there were many possibilities as to what it could specifically be.\nThe list on his slide was as follows:\n-Visionary action for the nation\n-Creating an aerospace system for exploring Mars\n-Making solar energy from space possible and safely transmittable to Earth\n-Creating a lunar or Mars penetrator to find water\n-Unifying Earth, the moon, and Mars\n-Making Earth better with space technology\n-Utilizing valuable resources in our solar system\n-Becoming entrepreneurs of space technology\n-Conducting basic scientific research in space\n-Protecting space assets\n-Establishing competence in space human resources\n-Bringing down the cost of access to space\nHe then asserted the importance of viewing the globe as a single entity and establishing a world community. Kalam stated that the future of space travel lies in cooperation between the nations with space programs.\nThe next argument was that the Earth had two needs: Protection of the environment for living and energy.\nHe showed graphs detailing how the stratosphere is cooling and the troposphere was warming, and claimed that burning fossil fuels leads to 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. Though frightening figures, Kalam proposed that improved space technology can actually help the crisis, such as by helping us settle on Mars. In order for this space travel to improve, however, we need a dramatic reduction of cost, which he elaborated on later in the presentation.\nKalam then revealed his actual initiative, World Space Vision 2050, a three-part proposal to improve space travel and international relations.\nThe three facets were:\n-Large scale societal missions and low cost access to space\n-Comprehensive space security\n-Space exploration and current application missions\nKalam argued that the cost of access to space would be lessened over time by new advances, but also by introducing reusable launch vehicles (RLV), that can be launched more than once, thus reducing the number of space vehicles that need to be produced.\nThe RLVs would be able to lift off, like conventional airplanes, on runways and explore energy sources in space. Another cost-saving aspect of the RLVs is their ability to collect and liquefy oxygen in space, negating the necessity of returning to Earth for more oxygen.\nSpace satellite service stations would be created for all satellites in the GEO as a permanent international facility. These stations would extend the life of satellites by providing in-orbit maintenance such as diagnosis, replacement, recharging, powering, refueling, and de-boosting after use.\nHis next point was comprehensive space security.\nKalam made the distinction between “defense” and “security” by elaborating on his plan’s goal of protecting the Earth, not engaging in military competition. The proposed security involved averting dangers that arise, protecting space and global assets, prevent militarization of space, performing necessary space rescues, managing space debris, and monitoring and defending against asteroids.\nKalam then explained that steps can be taken now to ensure make these plans a reality. The first step is to use our current capabilities to undertake interplanetary missions. The second is to develop more international cooperation, especially on projects that go beyond a global scale. The third step is to continue exploring space, and trying to provide current applications to the missions that we undertake.\nIf these steps are taken, Kalam believes that, in addition to scientific knowledge and advances, space travel can bring peace.\nThere was still some time after his presentation ended, so Kalam answered a few questions from the audience.\nThe first question dealt with concerns over the history of mankind, such as wondering if colonies in space would ever fight for independence. Kalam responded by saying that we need to work closely with those who are both developing the colonies and working on the science behind it to make sure that it is not an issue.\nThe second questioner asked if “space law” would become clearer in the future. Kalam responded positively, claiming that enhanced communications through satellites would make developing the laws much easier than earlier laws, which did not have the advantage of satellite communications.\nThe third questioner asked how we should go about getting politicians involved, especially those who do not believe that space travel is a big issue. Kalam responded by saying that democracies just need to make sure that their officials back them on these issues, especially because space travel can help solve other issues, such as energy sources.\nThe fourth questioner asked if there was Indian Astronauts were being actively pursued, to which Kalam suggested that Moon and Mars landings would be a great possibility. More so than nationality, he claimed, people needed to view “Earth, Moon, Mars as a single complex,” as opposed to worrying about nationality.\nThe fifth questioner asked if it was justifiable to spend so much money on space programs if the nation is in poverty. Kalam responded by saying that the space program, such as the case in India, can actually improve poverty, by creating jobs and increasing communication to impoverished parts.\nThe sixth questioner asked if future space endeavors would be funded by the private or public sectors. Kalam responded by saying that a World Space Council would control the funding, which consists of many governments.\nThe seventh questioner asked how space traffic would be dealt with, citing the example of hundreds of satellites, to which Kalam responded by proposing bringing nations together to make sure that it is not an issue.\nThe eighth questioner asked if humans would be able to survive the travel to places such as Mars. Kalam responded by claiming the colonization to be a long-term venture, and that with proper training it would be possible.\nThe ninth questioner asked if students were contributing to the future of space travel, to which Kalam responded that they are.\nThe tenth questioner asked if any large Indian companies, such as Tata Consistency, were contributing to space travel. Kalam responded by saying 500 industries have.\nThe final questioner asked how space could be protected, considering many major space companies have ties to the military. Kalam responded by saying that there would be a multinational defense force in space, to prevent any one country’s dominance.']",['https://knightnews.com/2009/10/former-indian-president-speaks-on-campus/'],0.8454206585884094,0.24261102080345154,0.5378763675689697

Starting with a goal to help the Political Science Department become more eco-friendly, Green Team has grown to take on the task of helping “UCF reach its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050” by partnering with the university’s Department of Sustainability & Energy Management (SEM).\n“When she came to the Department, Julie’s initial goal was to develop a program of energy efficiency, water conservation and recycling geared towards the faculty and staff members of the Political Science Department,” Alexandra Kennedy, SEM’s student outreach coordinator, said.\n“At the time, SEM was coincidentally working toward Energy Star Certification for our buildings, a prerequisite for LEED Certification,” Kennedy continued. “Energy Star Certification then became the central mission of the Green Team.”\nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification “provides independent, third-party verification that a building project is environmentally responsible, profitable and a healthy place to live and work,” according to the U.S. Green Building Council.\nAllen has helped SEM’s endeavors by forming a “student corps which accelerates the goals of the department by providing ideas, manpower and energy.” Green Team’s work towards achieving Energy Star Certification involves “measuring buildings, computing gross square footage, completing light and internal space audits, and encouraging behavioral change to save energy.”\nAllen has recruited fellow students to rally behind her mission. Her job as a resident advisor in Libra community’s Green Building helps her find other like-minded students.\nFreshman civil engineering major, Justin Kingsley is one of Green Building’s residents who joined Green Team after meeting Allen on move-in day. Kingsley is now the club’s secretary and is currently working on Green Room Certification for students’ residences.\n“Green Room Certification is basically when two or three people will come into a person’s dorm room and then survey the room for green appliances and things of that nature,” explained Kingsley.\nThe certification is currently only available for Green Building residences, but Allen hopes to offer it to “all on-campus residents in the spring in conjunction with SEM’s Kill-a-Watt initiative.” Her work in this area is bolstered by her position on the Housing Sustainability Taskforce.\nGreen Team’s historian, freshman nursing major Karina Grubbs, also met Allen as a Libra resident. The two developed a close relationship because of the similar goals they shared to make the university “a more environmentally friendly place.” Grubbs is specifically concerned with the harmful effects Styrofoam has on the environment and its use in campus cafeterias.\n“We’re in the process of planning a ban Styrofoam week,” Grubbs said.\nA recent move by UCF’s administration to attempt to relocate the Arboretum is also occupying Green Team’s man-hours. Allen, along with her friend and president of the Student Sustainability Alliance, Chelsea Stewart, is planning to petition “St. John’s Water Management Board to encourage them to not lift the conservation easement.”\n“To my understanding, the administration is offering the Arboretum 10 acres of land outside of the Gemini Loop,” Allen explained. “The Arboretum doesn’t want this because over 1,500 volunteer hours from UCF students have gone into building the community garden in its current location, and the land that is offered is marshland unsuitable for their education center.”\nAllen’s hard work and goal-oriented lifestyle has led to not only organizational accomplishments but also the admiration of her peers who see her as a role model.\n“When I first joined the club, I was so surprised at how efficient she was with putting ideas into action,” Grubbs recounted. “She is very passionate in what she does and will definitely go on to make a difference in the world.”\nHer efforts to bring student volunteers to the aid of the understaffed SEM have not gone unnoticed either. \n“The collective volunteer efforts of Green Team members have been very influential in working towards Energy Star Certification,” noted Kennedy.\nAllen has a passion for environmentalism that reveals a dogma quite comparable to that of a person with religious faith.\n“I tend to think of my environmental passion as a guiding force in my belief system because it dictates the way that I see the world and my own place in the world.” she said. “It helps me formulate morals and values.”\nAllen plans to continue her mission for a more sustainable future well after she graduates UCF, leaving fellow Green Team members to fill her shoes. She was recently accepted to become part of the Teach for America corps where she will begin teaching at an elementary school in Atlanta, GA next fall. \n“I hope to be able to work with my school district to help them save money through energy efficiency and maybe even develop some curriculum to teach my students about environmental stewardship,” Allen said. “The sky’s the limit!”']",['https://knightnews.com/2010/12/julie-allen-ucfs-green-team-founder/'],0.4993894100189209,0.3599787950515747,0.19905194640159607

The Governor opened up his brief remarks by saying that his campaign is making history by being the first campaign to, “have its headquarters in Florida.”  \nThe Governor turned Ambassador turned Presidential Candidate is vowing to campaign a clean campaign, telling his staff that “jobs and the economy are driving this campaign,” and that “civility means something.”  \nAs his campaign gets underway, having announced formally on Tuesday, he is courting the young people around the country to join his campaign.  He wants the young voters to understand that our main priority should be “debt and spending.” He pointed out that right now we are inheriting a $14.4 trillion debt, and it certain to continue to increase if we don’t get someone in the White House with his level of experience.\nThe Governor doesn’t only have experience as the head of the state, but also, as the former Ambassador to China.  After President Obama took office, he nominated Huntsman for the position due to his experience in the region, and the fact that he is also fluent in Mandarin Chinese.  \nAlthough Huntsman has mostly been touting his economic experiences as Governor of Utah, he clearly has experience in areas of foreign policy, which sets him apart from most of his other colleagues running for President.  He will be able to use his relationship and prior experience with China to bolster his case for President.  The Governor also served as Deputy Trade Representative under George W. Bush.\nWhen asked about how he plans to utilize the nation’s second largest University, he pointed out that they have a lot of young people already signed on to his campaign.  Analysts believe that Huntsman picked up a good portion of the young vote, when Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana decided not to seek the Presidency.\nThe Governor has announced that he will skip the Ames Iowa Straw Poll in August, which means that he will be setting his sights on New Hampshire as the first in the nation primary.  He pointed out that his campaign will take him from the Granite State, on to South Carolina and then Florida.  He hopes those states will help propel to a head-to-head battle against his former boss, and current President.

Several popular college bars, like Knight Library, FUBAR and Underground Bluz, will be bulldozed to make way for the fancy new facility. \nAnd some businesses, like Anmol Indian Cuisine and the Underground Bluz bar, were told they must close their doors by the end of this month, according to Bryan Eastman, Deputy Campaign Manager for the the Shayan Elahi for Florida House campaign.\nThe Elahi campaign held a press conference outside Underground Bluz Thursday, and alleged certain businesses, like Underground Bluz, were only given a few weeks of notice to move. “Anmol moved out last week as a result,” Eastman told KnightNews.com.\n“We have been accommodating and are working with the current retail tenants regarding the plans to vacate the shopping center for demolition, which should be underway by the end of 2012,” Cowart told KnightNews.com. “We have communicated all timelines well in advance of what is required by law so current tenants have ample time to find alternate locations or plans.” \nCowart also reiterated that the new facility will also have retail space for tenants — which students will also be able to enjoy. And there’s already interest. \n“We are currently in the process of accepting and reviewing tenant applications for the retail space,” Cowart told KnightNews.com. \nBut before the new facility can open, there will be that inevitable period where The Plaza that so many students spent some of the best times of their lives will be filled with construction workers instead of college students.\nWhile the demolition is expected the begin by the end of this year, Cowart said construction completion is targeted for fall 2014. \n\nBut while the future of The Station seems more certain than the classic bars facing demolition in The Plaza, it will have to compete — at least initially — with students who may want to hang on to what little time they have left living it up at the college bars that have become such a big part of UCF history. \nIt’s still not clear whether Knight Library, FUBAR, Lazy Moon and other popular shops at The Plaza will reopen, or close their doors for good. \nCheck back to KnightNews.com for special coverage of these historic changes coming to the UCF area, and for updates on what the businesses will do. \nSee more pictures of the new plaza on the next page, below:\nDay view of The New Plaza']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/05/ucfs-new-plaza-see-pictures-of-planned-apartments-retail/'],0.12447545677423477,0.08352037519216537,0.0625191405415535

After casual discussion with friends, I found it surprising how few twenty-somethings knew this and how dangerous this condition is. Most people I spoke with knew that a concussion was one of the reasons that Muhammad Ali had trouble speaking, and the main cause of former New York Jet Wayne Chrebet’s departure from the team after eleven years of playing. Unfortunately, this lack of understanding is one of the main causes of brain damage due to concussion; many individuals who sustain them continue to play.\nIn this January’s Annals of Biomedical Engineering, it was noted that football players were the most likely candidates to receive a concussion in the United States. The paper notes that the average collegiate football player will sustain roughly one thousand subconcussive head on hits during each season. For each UCF freshman that joins the football program, this means that he is likely to sustain about 4000 subconcussive hits during his career in college. The study did not note how players were subjected to hits in their potential professional careers.\nA July 7th article in The Indianapolis Star states that the younger an individual is, the longer it will take for a sustained concussion to heal. This means that collegiate players who played football in their youth and sustained concussions are more likely to have potentially unhealed concussions as they enter college. Unfortunately, this may go unnoticed in the college programs.\nThe NCAA does not require college sports programs to have a formal policy on concussion treatment or prevention, according to a 2009 New York Times article on the topic. Many Division I universities do not have a protocol in place, the article notes, and that the NCAA handbook on college sports injuries devotes only four pages out of its 126 total.\nIn a\xa0comment\xa0from UCF\xa0Athletics, the university does maintain a concussion protocol. I was also told,\xa0“UCF does not use the “hits” system (a tool developed to measure G forces of hits taken). UCF student-athletes do wear helmets certified by NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) that have evidence-based research behind their helmets.” This is a responsible stance taken by the university, and it is to be commended.\nAccording to Dr. Leonardo Olivera, Pegasus Health’s sports medicine physician and professor at the UCF College of Medicine, education is the number one factor in preventing injury, and parents and coaches should know the signs of concussion. Understanding how concussions occur and how to manage them once they are sustained is the best way to deal with this potentially debilitating condition.\n\xa0']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/07/opinion-concussion-management-should-be-a-top-priority/'],0.14458970725536346,0.11420726776123047,0.11609227955341339

She has served as president of the Society for the Advancement of the History of South Asia. Currently, Rao is working on a project titled Dalit Bombay, which focuses on the relationship between caste, political culture and everyday life in colonial and postcolonial Bombay.\nRao said she tells her students that India’s affirmative action regime, dating back to the 1880s, in which “princely states in southern India used the argument that proportionally representation to provide jobs and education to lower castes had been excluded by the British Bureaucracy”.\nIndia tried different methods to manage the country’s complex and repeating forms of diversity by presenting the idea of equality through multifaceted multi-religious, multi-ethnic and deeply hierarchical social order. In other words, producing social revolution through legal means.\nIndia has a large demographic of lower castes and dalits, or ex untouchables in which they have been challenging the control of schools, jobs, government and representation of media by the social elite and upper caste.\n“In order to understand Indian democracy, you have to understand the caste. The caste has been central to the way that Indian democracy has worked, caste has been central to the way that people have tried to produce democracy in India,” Rao said.\nGhandi believed reform required the repent of Hindus against such caste systems, not through political solutions, stating that the practice of untouchability dehumanizes those who practice it, not the individual who endures it. .\n“Effort to give the untouchables separate representation in 1932, failed because of the spectacular fast into death undertaken by Ghandi which became a global issue, and everyone, of course, wanted to make sure that Ghandi does not die,” Rao said.\nThis was opposite to B.R. Ambedkar, one of India’s most radical thinkers, and also an ex untouchable, or dalit, India’s first law minister and chairman of drafting committee of India’s consitution. Anti-caste radicals, the tradition that Ambadker came from, were inspired from new world struggles against racial servitudes.\n“Anti-caste radicals draw typologies of race, and argue that the relation between upper castes and lower castes was like a racial conflict between black and white,” Rao said\nThe language of slavery was also used to describe sexual subjugation, and Ambadker compared life on African American plantations to the caste system. History of emancipation in the Americas gave multi-caste and anti-caste radicals a different approach to the Hindu upper caste cultural nationalism.\n“These were global thinkers and global people who may have not traveled physically but they did indeed travel in their thought very widely,” Rao said.\nThe dalit approach was to take the practice of untouchability outside of religion and into social and political inequality. Unlike Ghandi, activists demanded access to public institutions, such as hotels, schools, water tanks and temples. Arguing that public property enabled these rights, regardless of caste system.\nDalits who participated in protests, would return home to find their huts burned or boycotts on their entire community for participating in acts of protests.\n“The activism around public facilities, which is very much like the activism in the United States with access to public sources and government property, shouldn’t obscure the very sophisticated ways in which dalits addressed inequality within religion itself,” Rao said.\nDalits, between 1928 and 1935, began to enter temples claiming that temples were like any other public space they had access to, disregarding the inequality of religious practices. Questioning their own validity as Hindus, since they had been barred from worshipping in temples. Temple entry was an act to make individuals aware of the inequality.\nHowever, colonial law maintained that Hindu temples were private property and were therefore allowed to practice caste segregation.\n“Should remind many of us about the history of race, and racial exclusion in the United states, and the way that the legal conversations around important cases around U.S civil rights were perceived in the very same manner in which was happening in India,” Rao said.\nAmbedker had written that political democracy cannot last unless there is social democracy.\nIn 1956, half a million people, along with Ambedker, arrived in Nagpur, clean and dressed in white to symbolize rebirth as they rejected Hinduism and converted to Buddhism.\nRao suggested, that like the United States, the history of inequality in India has produced a story of democracy.\nThe model of affirmative action in India is distinctive, because the policies are addressed to a majority who has suffered inequality, and the untouchables were also written into the constitution as persons requiring special rights.\nAccording to Rao, “this produces a very different understanding of the relationship between individual rights and group rights, and produces a different model of how society thinks about the project of responding to inequality. This in a sense has been the history of the relationship between caste and democracy”']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/09/author-discusses-caste-and-democracy-in-india/'],0.5086074471473694,0.6515536308288574,0.34456223249435425

It was later brought to Japan by Dr. Kombu to treat the Japanese emperor, Inkyo, for digestive problems, and it later spread to Russia, India and Europe. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel far to achieve immortality; Central Florida based Farm Boy Produce brews and sells it locally.\nEssentially, kombucha is fermented green or black tea comprised of a sea of health giving organic acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and nutrients. It also contains healthy bacteria in the form of Lactobacillus Acidophilus, as well as a dozen other probiotic strains. Kombucha carbonates naturally once bottled because it continues to ferment and release carbon dioxide that becomes trapped.\n“One of the byproducts is cellulose, as the stuff ferments, you have this production of the cellulose which ultimately accumulates on the surface layer and actually forms like a gasket on the surface, which is almost completely impervious, even with a really sharp knife its tough to slice through it, and its just the cellulose network that people refer to as the kombucha, mushroom,” said Mark Bevilaqua, founder of Farm Boy Produce, and producer of kombucha.\nSome of the benefits to drinking kombucha are that it improves digestion, boosts energy, improves circulation, prevents acid reflux, improves sleep, and it boosts the immune system.\nAccording to Food Research International, Russia conducted a series of studies in the 1900s and mid 1900s .One study was based on a remote area of Russia that was poverty-stricken, therefore had shortages of food, but the people were big consumers of kombucha. Scientists found that the people consuming kombucha in this area had no instances of cancer, and had healthy immune systems. During World War I, Russia’s secret home remedy was referred to as the “Wonderdrink” because it helped treat headaches, gastric illnesses, and regulated intestinal activity.\n“Ultimately the results of these studies were released and then they were tested and actually proven, in Netherlands, Germany, Poland, the news or the knowledge that kombucha, that fermented tea ultimately cures, prevents, cells from mutating, increases immune system function, all this stuff that has been proven by multiple scientific groups for almost half a century, basically the knowledge has been there,” said Bevilaqua.\nHowever, not all kombucha is made the same. The benefit of buying locally brewed kombucha is that it is not pasteurized. Mainstream kombucha available on store shelves are all pasteurized, therefore killing off all the beneficial bacteria. According to Bevilaqua, it’s like drinking soda with b vitamins.\nFarm Boy Produce uses reverse osmosis system, filtered water with the lowest dissolved solids, organic tea and sugar bought directly from producer or distributor. Their kombucha is available on draft or bottled in the following flavors: ginger soda, honey ginger, honey mate, yerba mate, spiralina, grape and apple cinnamon. You can find it on draft at Drunken Monkey or Redlight Redlight Beer Parlour.

Johanson helped organize the flash mob because he wanted to make the school aware that the Student Opera Club exists while showing that opera is not highbrow or elitist.\n“I’ve been doing opera for a while and a common stereotype is a certain kind of person is in to it,” Johanson said. “I want to make opera more accessible.”\nThe performance was about four minutes long and featured 8 solos, all singing the famous Italian melody. The Student Opera Club has been planning the event throughout the semester at their meetings, which occur twice a week. The organization has about 32 members, and to adapt to music majors’ busy schedules they meet on Mondays at 2 p.m. and Thursdays at 3 p.m. in room M16 of the music building.\n“A lot of music majors are very busy so it’s hard to get everyone’s schedule together,” Johanson said. Johanson is taking just nine credit hours this semester, however he is constantly busy between taking classes, leading the Opera club, and singing in both the Florida Opera Theater and at local churches. Vice President India Holoman, a music performance major, also adheres to a busy schedule, but she says her dedication to music is a labor of love.\n“I love this major. I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy in school,” she said. Holoman said that operas have exciting plotlines that students may find entertaining. “When I tell people I sing classical music they say, ‘what?’” Holoman said. “I don’t think people realize opera can be very, very funny.” \nIt is also intense. Holoman referenced the opera “Don Giovanni”, which begins with the title character raping a woman and killing her father, all in the first scene. These plotlines may be hard to pick up on when performed in Italian, and Opera students take Italian and diction courses to learn to properly sing the language.\nFor Tamra Pristou-Globokar, the self-described “super-senior” prefers to keep her interest in music as a hobby. Pristou-Globokar is a digital media major who joined the club this semester.\n“It’s the flash mob that got me into the club,” she said.

After watching the 2007 film Trade with Kevin Cleine about young teens bound in the ugly world of sex trafficking, Addison realized, “these kids are not fundamentally different from my own.”\nAddison visited India, Europe and Washington D.C to witness and research the global trade. In Mumbai he went undercover to brothels to hear the victims stories.\n“Slavery has a human face, they’re not just statistics and stories,” Addison said. He continues by saying that average age of entry in sex trafficking is 13 to 15, including the United States.\n“Reality is, billions of dollars are coming from the buyers,” Addison said, addressing the challenge of demand by “ordinary American men, people who look like me”.\nAddison says it is not just the criminals fueling the industry, but all people stating, “we are the solution”.\nHe also said that challenging priority is just as important to ending human trafficking.\n“We spend more money, annually on outfitting our military marching band, more money is spent in one month on the war against drugs, than we have ever spent on rescuing our children or other people in our own shores and around the world,” Addison said.\nAddison hopes to educate others, and for others to pass on their knowledge with the effort to eventually rid the world of human trafficking.\n“I want to see more awareness, because like he said, it’s a big underground community that is in this fight that is behind this veil curtain, so to speak, so you don’t really know about it, and I didn’t really know about it until I was 20 years old,” said Geoffery McDole, criminal justice student and an intern with International Justice Mission and component for fighting human trafficking since reading the manuscript for A Walk Across the Sun.\nInternational Justice Mission was one of Addison’s bases for his novel.\n“One of my big issues is comprehensive immigration reform, and I think this ties into that because a good portion of the human trafficking are immigrants, often times undocumented, this is an important issue for me, and I hope to be part of the solution,” said Melissa McGuire-Maniau, immigration reform activist, undergraduate in international affairs at Rollins College.']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/11/author-human-rights-activist-talks-modern-day-slavery/'],0.6084585189819336,0.36878934502601624,0.06254810839891434

Ball State will be making their first bowl appearance since 2008 when they lost to Tulsa 45-13 in the GMAC bowl.\nThe Knights won the Conference USA East Division this year for the fourth time since joining the league in 2005. Although they lost to Tulsa in the Conference USA championship, their 9-4 record proved to be good enough to send them to their fifth bowl appearance in the last eight seasons.\nThe Ball State Cardinals from Muncie, Indiana are currently riding a six game winning streak dating from October 6th when they lost to Northern Illinois 35-23.\nKeys to Knights victory:\nThe Knights are no stranger to the endzone this season, averaging 35.2 points per game which puts them 27th in the nation. A big reason for these numbers is the bigger role and responsibility on behalf of Sophomore QB Blake Bortles who has thrown 22 touchdowns on the season.\nIf the Knights can get the run game going with running back Latavius Murray taking the brunt of the carries and getting the ball to leading receivers J.J. Worton and Jeff Godfrey, the Knights should have no problem putting points on the board. \nThe Ball State Cardinals have allowed at least 20 points in every game this season, so that should bode well for the Knights offense. \nDefensively, the Knights may have a tough assignment against Ball State quarterback Keith Wenning who missed the Cardinals’ last regular-season game after having surgery on his fractured right ankle. Wenning has shined this season, throwing for 2,878 yards and 22 touchdowns. If the Knights can contain the Ball State passing attack and force the Cardinals to punt, C-USA Special Teams player of the year Quincy McDuffie will have a chance to show off his flashy kick/punt returns.\nFinal thoughts:\nThe Knights have an obvious home field advantage, being that St.Petersburg is only 125 miles away from campus. The match-up is pretty even, with the Knights favored by 7. Ball State will have a tough time stopping UCF from putting up lots of points, with the Knights having a myriad of scoring options on offense and even special teams. It doesn’t help the Ball State case when Kemal Ishmael, voted UCF’s Most Valuable Player, is lurking in the backfield against Keith Wenning who has thrown 10 interceptions this season.\nThe game will be close, but UCF will prevail on the intangibles and capitalize on Ball State turnovers, final score: UCF 31, Ball State, 27.']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/12/beef-o-bradys-bowl-preview-keys-to-a-knights-victory/'],0.3710009455680847,0.11774816364049911,0.07312772423028946

897,UCF,2013-01-24,journal_data/txt/UCF/2013_01_24.txt,"['The debate over gun control is a hot topic these days in the wake of the numerous shootings that seem to happen every time you turn on the news in this country. KnightNews.com sought out different opinions on the subject from students who all shared their views.\nMelissa Colon:\nGun control will not lead to a decrease in murders. Instead it will tighten the noose that the government already has tied around us. Just as the so-called war on drugs has not minimized drug usage, but has cost taxpayers over $1 billion annually to imprison pot offenders while our government hands over guns to Mexican cartels. A war declared by Reagan despite his approval to use drug traffickers to transport illegal arms into Nicaragua that resulted in an increase in the cocaine trade in California. The belief that gun control will stop mass murder, is just as naïve as believing that banning abortion will stop the practice of abortions.\nWhile many will choose to point fingers only at the Obama administration, or the Bush administration, the media and the\xa0government have succeeded in dividing us into left and right- literally. To believe that gun rights are our only rights being stripped away, we have failed to look closely at laws being passed or that have passed under the guise to protect our freedom. When organizing a protest gets you listed as a domestic terrorist, such as the case of Occupy Wall Street organizer Shannon McLeish from Daytona Beach, Florida, you should stop and wonder if gun rights are the only issue we should be worried about.\nLastly, we have become so distracted that we fail to notice how the shooters become celebrities. Our fascination with stardom feeds another fame-starved individual who watches, plots, and relies on the media to make them a star. Just as reality television stars are overnight celebrities, so is the shooter. Suddenly, everyone is in shock and affected by the death of innocent school children. While each shooting is a tragedy, many have forgotten that it is happening everyday at our expense like the $3 trillion that American taxpayers give to Israel annually to supply them with weapons to shoot Palestinian children throwing rocks. Somewhere along the way we are taught that we can justify and differentiate the act of killing another human even if it is someone else pulling the trigger.\nEvan Gregory:\nMy response to the proposed gun control plan goes as follows: banning guns such as the AR-15 on the basis of name or design will only lead to gun manufacturers designing different guns. Not\xa0only that, but this does not account for the fact that there are millions of guns of those types in circulation and are readily accessible if you have the money. The most annoying thing on this list of proposed measures has to be reducing clip size to a ten-bullet maximum. Do legislatures not realize that reloading a gun however many\xa0more times will not stop anybody from shooting anything up once they’ve decided that they are going to go through with it? I think hiking the price on ammunition would do a lot more help then adjusting the capacity at which you could carry it.\nI believe it is integral for everyone in America to own some kind of weapon in this day and age for his or her own protection. Regardless of whether you’re for or against any kind of gun legislature, the 10 minutes you spend waiting for the police to respond to your 911 call when 3 armed men barge into your house with illegally obtained weapons could mean life or death for your family. When the forefathers drafted the constitution, I’m sure they didn’t intend every single citizen to have rocket propelled grenades in their closets waiting to blow up anything in their way, but they did realize that at the end of the day, in the face of tyrannical government, it was the people’s responsibility to join in arms against the types of government that existed in the Revolution that brought about this country. I can guarantee that nobody thought in a million years that Caesar would march his armies over the Rhine to become the sole leader of Rome in 49 BCE, but there was no one to stop him once he did.\nTake a country like Switzerland for example that despite two world wars and many sweeping religious changes has maintained its sovereignty with such volatile neighbors as Spain, France, and Italy. Despite the Russians and Nazi’s sweeping through Europe in the 30’s and 40’s it’s not certain to many people why they didn’t get swept up in the campaign trail during World War II. This is because their militia involves every man in the country and the citizens are armed and trained to defend the homeland on a second’s notice. The problem with our second amendment isn’t the fact that it allows everyone to own any kind of weapon they can buy; the problem exists because we only follow the guidelines of this to a point, highlighting only the final sentence of the second most important amendment of them all, the amendment that makes sure the government will continue to honor our first.\nSo to those of you blaming Sandy Hook on the fact that Adam Lanza was able to get his hands on an AR-15 and impose his will on those children need to realize that it is his mom’s fault for not properly storing her firearm to NRA guidelines. Stop blaming society; stop blaming the media, start realizing that it is the individual that decides to make these rash decisions, him and him only. He could have ran in with a hammer, he could have ran in with a cigarette and killed them with second hand smoke (both of which contribute to more deaths than guns by astronomical numbers in the US every year) but unfortunately for many gun owners like me, he knew the combination to his mom’s gun safe and had to ruin it for all of America’s gun owners.\nNolan Thompson:\n“A person who demands further gun control legislation is like a chicken who roots for Colonel Sanders.” – Larry Elder.\nThroughout history weapons have always played a vital role in society. Without weapons we would not have been able to hunt as efficiently and evolve to where we are today. Weapons have been responsible for the destruction and creation of civilizations.\xa0When tragedy strikes, our immediate reaction is to make a law that takes away another freedom. The Patriot Act is an example of this.\nMahatma Ghandi said, “Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.”\nI think it would be hypocritical for a governing body that uses billions of individual tax dollars to fund its military, to decide if those same individuals should have guns or what types of guns to have.\n“Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants.” -Andrew Jackson\nI think guns should be regulated to an extent that all law abiding citizens that have passed a background check and safety course can own a gun. It’s important for each individual to remember that a gun is a violent tool that can cause unprecedented\xa0 social consequences. A gun is a tool that should only be used for food and the protection of freedom as a last line of defense.\nJake Rakoci:\nIf there is anything we can do as a nation to quell gun violence, by all means we should take steps in the direction to do that. I feel like the biggest fallacy to the entire gun control argument is the idea that fewer guns means fewer crimes.\nWhen you look at the numbers, the United States, despite having the highest gun ownership rate in the world, is 28th in the world in gun violence per 100,000 people. Our friends over in Great Britain, a country that bans guns and has an extremely low gun violence rate would be a good model to how we should regulate guns, right?\xa0Not necessarily, the UK has the fourth highest robbery rate and the second highest overall crime rate in the EU.\nOn Jan. 16 President Obama proposed his Gun Control bill to Congress in a time where the political environment for gun control is more favorable than it has been in a long time. I can agree with President Obama on the fact that the AR-15 and other assault style weapons really have no practical use, but I can’t see how taking the drastic step to ban them would be beneficial.\xa0I agree 100 percent with Obama saying that\xa0“if there’s even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there’s even one life that can be saved, then we’ve got an obligation to try.”\nI believe that obligation would be to tighten firearm regulations such as stricter background checks, not banning them. Even then, just like getting a drivers license, it does not mean that person will abide by the rules of the road. A properly educated and sane citizen in the United States should be able to own as many weapons they choose, no questions asked.\nI will end on this, if we are proposing legislation to save lives by banning guns, how many lives are we putting in danger by giving the assailant the upper hand? Even though we are divided as a nation on this issue, we can all agree that even though you may not see this on national news, if guns were banned things may have gone a lot differently.\nWARNING: The views and opinions expressed in the media, articles or comments on this site are those of the speakers or authors and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions held by KnightNews.com\nHave a view on the subject?

919,UCF,2013-02-17,journal_data/txt/UCF/2013_02_17.txt,"['Recently I’ve come to a realization; Mills Avenue is a culinary gem within the city of Orlando. Most of its restaurants specialize in the Asian culinary spectrum with a few exceptions here and there, but wherever the food is being braised, roasted, cured, pickled, etc. it’s always memorable. Hell, there is even a grassroots organization known as Mills 50 comprised of local business owners aimed at preserving the unique urban flavor of this area. When you talk to anyone about the restaurants on Mills though, there is always one that people told me I absolutely have to try; Tako Cheena. This Asian-Latin fusion hot spot has won rave reviews around these parts and it is also the brainchild of the owner of another local favorite, Pom Pom’s Teahouse. So after a couple of years of blowing off going, I decided it was time for me to get off my lazy butt and get my taco fix.\nPulling up to the restaurant, I could not help but chuckle inside a bit. The outside resembles a tattoo shop with its bright red paint and font selection for their sign and beneath the sign it reads, “Dim Sum Good Takos.” Honestly, with a quirky play on words like this on the window, how could you not already like this place? Luckily the quirky, artsy theme does not end with the exterior of the building. The interior is lined with beautiful art that can be purchased as well as a colorful chalkboard menu (always a plus in my book). Even the staff looks like they should be sitting behind a canvas creating masterpieces rather than serving food or cooking and I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them did this in their spare time. Like any restaurant worth its salt though, the real star of the show is the food.\nFor starters, the menu is not an extensive one which generally for me is a plus. I find that big menus sometimes cause the quality of certain dishes to decline and a smaller menu makes it easier to maintain quality throughout a service. The selection offered consists of tacos, hot dogs, burritos, an empanada that changes on a weekly basis, and a couple of desserts. The most extensive part of the menu was the impressive sauce selection. I decided to go with panko crusted cod tacos, a Korean hot dog, and an Indian butter chicken burrito. Needless to say, the waitress was perplexed as to how my one hundred and forty pound frame would survive this eating event.\nThe fish tacos (my favorite part of the meal) were clean and simple. There were no twenty-six ingredients covering a piece of fish that required a microscope to know it was even there. The fish was crispy and seasoned well, the cabbage added extra crunch, and the sweet and sour onion sauce had a nice creaminess and tang about it that the fried fish needed. Their play on a hot dog was one of the quirkier things on the menu that was far different from what we ate as kids but still somehow brought back a sense of childhood nostalgia. In place of a traditional hot dog they used a Chinese sweet sausage that on its own was a little too sweet for my taste but when eaten with the other components of the dish I enjoyed. There was a bit of cabbage, spicy mayo, sesame seeds, cilantro, and the always delicious mix of fermented vegetables and spices, kimchi.\nNext up was the burrito, which if I’m being completely honest was not my favorite. The slightly spicy curry and Mexican crema coating everything was delicious, but the ratio of grain to meat and vegetables was way, way off. The tortilla was filled with chicken, chickpeas, cilantro, and sweet potato but if you wanted to get a nice, uniform bite you had to make your way over a mountain of jasmine rice. I was hoping that maybe it was just my burrito but my friend who tagged along had the same problem with the burrito he ordered. This was disappointing for the both of us since each part of the burrito was actually really tasty and well-made; it was just the construction of the dish that was off.\nOverall, I would definitely say I understand why people flock to this Mills Avenue hot spot. The food is cheap (dishes range from around $3.00-$8.00), tasty, and for the most part well executed. They have an understanding of the importance of ambience in a restaurant as well and their artsy décor is welcoming and makes you feel pretty damn cool and hip while dining. So if you are looking for a different kind of quick bite, Tako Cheena’s blend of Asian and Latin cuisine through the use of familiar, everyday foods will certainly do the trick.\nWebsite: http://www.takocheena.com/\nMenu: http://www.allmenus.com/fl/orlando/310707-tako-cheena/menu/\n\xa0']",['https://knightnews.com/2013/02/tako-cheena-a-fun-twist-on-your-traditional-taco-joint/'],0.5949872136116028,0.11100959777832031,0.16109591722488403

So in 2011, he came to America, where he submitted his application to be an explorer of deep space.\nHe now is one step closer to becoming an astronaut, he may even be one of the first Earthlings to eventually become a Martian. For the time being, however, he sits calmly on Earth, talking about death on Mars just as casually as he talks about the best Indian food in Orlando (which he said is Moghul Indian Cuisine off University Boulevard).\n“You’re going to live there, you’re going to die there,” Bhatia said.\nThe deeply religious Bhatia, a native of India and current computer science doctoral student at UCF, recently applied to be a part of the Mars One space mission. Mars One is an organization that plans on sending four humans to Mars in 2023. The only catch for these four astronauts: there would be no coming back.\nBhatia has accepted this fact, and if chosen, is ready to live with it. It doesn’t bother him as much as it would many people, he sees it as similar to life on Earth.\n“Change is inevitable,” he said. “You enjoy things, and then you give up those things.” \nBhatia also sees the journey as a parallel to other excursions humans have take throughout history.\n“Like the European settlements, how many people survived? Very few,” Bhatia said. “But now there are many people and settlements on [North and South America] and they now belong on that continent.”\n“The same thing we are trying to get to happen on Mars,” he said.\nAhmed Hamed, Bhatia’s roommate and a UCF water resource engineering graduate student, doesn’t see why he would want to go.\n“It’s really shocking that any human would be considering it,” Hamed said.\nHowever, he does say that if people are to travel to the Red Planet, Bhatia would be a good fit.\n“I can easily imagine him being OK on Mars,” Hamed said.\nMars One is a privately funded organization, and so far they have only been raising money through donations and the $38 application fee that each of the 200,000 hopeful astronauts had to pay. A more unconventional way that they are planning of funding the trip is by making it into a reality television show.\nThe show will begin before the astronauts leave, including the end of the selection process, and will continue once the team has landed on Mars, broadcasting 24/7/365. Bhatia thinks that the project being in the public eye is a good thing.\n“Its a good feeling for humanity,” he said. “To go out of earth, go beyond the Moon.”\nDevina Dave, a former teammate of Bhatia’s on the Nakhra Knights dancing team, thinks he would work perfect on a reality show showcasing humans from across the globe. She relates it to when they were together on the dancing team.\n“He’s like the pillar that keeps everyone together,” she said. “He would be the one to make peace.”\nWhile academic success is not the only thing that the Mars One team is looking for when choosing applicants, it seems that what Bhatia has already achieved will likely help him. He already has a Master’s Degree in computer science, and is working on his doctoral degree. He has contributed to several papers on robotics and artificial intelligence.\nBhatia is a teacher’s assistant for Dr. Edwin Nassif, a UCF computer science professor. Nassif sees a direct correlation between what Bhatia is studying and being on a space mission.\n“Computers are pervasive, we don’t do things without computers,” he said.\nNassif also formerly worked for Lockheed Martin, an aerospace and advanced technology company, and so is directly aware of how having expertise in computers would be helpful on a spacecraft.\n“Having insight on what computers can do and how they function can be a real advantage,” Nassif said.\nOne thing that the team at Mars One will be looking for is people who are open\xad mindedand can adapt culturally, because it is likely that the four people chosen to become the first Martians are from four separate countries. This is another area that Bhatia appears to stand out.\nHe was born in India, and moved to the United States in 2011. He now has several American friends, and is the chairperson of the Indian Student Organization at UCF. He also helps to make the transition easier for Indian students coming to UCF, giving them tips on what helped him to adapt to life in America.\nMona Mathew, Bhatia’s roommate and a chemistry doctoral student at UCF is also is from India, and has seen him help several students with the change.\n“He helps people a lot,” she said. “Whoever is coming for the first time to America, he helps with temporary accommodations.”\nOne of the biggest influences on Bhatia’s life has been his religion. He is a practicing Sikh, and to him, this would help him on the mission.\n“[Sikhs] believes God is everywhere, in everyone,” he said.\nHis faith also helps him deal with leaving his loved ones on Earth.\n“Only God is with you when you leave this world,” he said. “At some point we’re all going to die. Why do we cry over things we cannot change?”\nBhatia meditates a lot, sometimes for hours a day, to help himself experience God and calm his mind.\nHamed can attest to his roommate’s dedication to religion and meditation.\n“I sometimes wake up at like four in the morning to get a drink of water and Taranjeet is meditating or praying,” Hamed said.\nWhatever happens with his application, Bhatia is excited for the mission, he sees it as the next step in the advancement of humanity.\n“It’s kind of the human desire to go to new places.” Bhatia said. “We started from one continent and expanded to other continents.

Chris Lako announced a scholarship is being created in his father’s memory and invited members of the UCF community to attend the late professor’s public viewing on Monday, Jan. 20, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., at Collison Funeral Home, located at 3806 Howell Branch Road Winter Park, FL.  \nBeloved UCF Law Professor Charles M. Lako Jr., Esq., J.D. Dies Following a Brief Illness\nBorn July 26, 1947 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Charles Michael Lako Jr., Esq., J.D. passed away peacefully surrounded by his family on January 13, 2014 following a brief illness. He is survived by his loving wife of 41 years Robyn Lako, his beloved sons Charles M Lako III and Christopher M Lako, his adoring sisters Helen R Scully and Elaine M Houlihan, and his special nieces Alyssa E Houlihan and Ilona M Scully.\nFollowing an Honorable discharge from a tour of duty in the Navy during wartime, Charles Lako graduated from Florida Atlantic University as an undergraduate and proceeded to work on Wall Street as a licensed stock, commodities, and futures analyst and broker. He returned to academia and graduated from John Marshall Law School with a Doctorate of Jurisprudence in 1977, earning Cum Laude Honors.  He dedicated himself as a trial lawyer, judge, and law professor serving every segment of the community in Atlanta, GA. In 1994, he moved to Stuart, FL and expanded his law practice to Florida. He was a member of the FL and GA Bar Associations, all Federal Courts, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Tax Court. While a trial lawyer in Florida, Charles Lako continued to serve the community.\nHe founded a Teen Court Program in the 19th Judicial Circuit, serving Martin, Indian River, and St. Lucie counties. Through the program he volunteered his time to teach over 150 high school students over seven years how to practice law and represent criminal teen defendants in a courtroom where he presided as the Judge. Charles Lako was also a trustee for two large trusts, including a scholarship fund at Martin County High School, which allowed countless students to attend college.\nContinuing his work educating others, Charles Lako became a law professor for the seven colleges of business at the University of Central Florida in 2004, where he taught until he passed away. Over his 10 year career at the university he educated 35,000 undergraduate and graduate students and founded the Res Ipsa Loquitor Law Society. The society instilled leadership and charitable fund raising in his students, raising money for the Make a Wish Foundation.\nCharles Lako was one of the most popular professors at the university and news of his death led to thousands of Facebook messages. A collection of the messages read as follows: “Dr. Lako may have passed away, but a part of him remains in each and every one of his thousands of students.”, “Great man huge heart, awesome teacher.”, “One of my favorite professors at UCF. A great educator. The memories will always be there.”, “Most amazing man inside and out, one of the few professors who truly cared about his students and went out of his way to better the lives of those around him. A giant loss for UCF and I am honored to have ever had him as a professor.”, “I am sorry for all of his loved ones and those who have not yet had the opportunity to be taught by this man!”, and “If anyone deserves a memorial, this man does…a great man and a great teacher!”. \nHe was a fixture of the University of Central Florida community, combining difficult material with his quirky personality, which included playing collections of Rod Stewart, Lady Gaga, and Beethoven in class and his dry wit. He always carried Hershey Kisses with him so he could give “kisses” to his students. Charles Lako would tell his students that he had a 1:1 student to faculty ratio as he was always available to his students. He frequently ate lunch with his students in UCF’s student union and became an honorary member of the Delta Sigma Pi business fraternity. The respect of his students earned him the prestigious TIP award at UCF and the inaugural awarding of the Outstanding Faculty Member award at IRCC.\nIn addition to leading a successful career, Charles Lako was the epitome of a family man. His favorite pastimes were fishing, boating, and vacationing on Sanibel Island with his family. When his sons were younger he volunteered as a coach for their soccer and baseball teams and was also a father figure for his two nieces. Charles Lako would always interrupt his busy work schedule to be there for his family and friends, frequently taking a long break at lunch to spend time with his sons and nieces after school even though it meant longer nights in the office. In his spare time he enjoyed working with hands, from gardening and landscaping his home to building furniture and completing home renovation projects with his sons. His most prized possession was his family.\nIt is only fitting to close with his favorite adage, which he coined, “Yesterday is who you were, today is who you are, and tomorrow is who you’re going to be.” – Charles M. Lako Jr., Esq., J.D.\nPublic visitation will be held from 6-8 pm on Monday January 20th, 2014 at Collison Funeral Home, 3806 Howell Branch Road Winter Park, FL 407-678-4500.

Hours are spent at the library, All Knight Study and you are left feeling washed out. So why not do something so that those hours don’t seem as terrible as they really are? Listen to study music! It is music that keeps you from getting distracted because of boredom and helps you focus on studying and getting work done.\nSome people have a hard time focusing in a silent environment and either fall asleep or find another mind-simulating activity to do which keeps them from studying. So what exactly counts as good music that you can study to? Usually, music that does not have lyrics in it and is mostly instrumental classifies as the best music to study with. \nIn fact, studies have shown that classical music (such as Mozart’s) can improve mental performance.\nHowever, some people do not enjoy classical music like Beethoven’s or Vivaldi’s. Luckily for them, there are bands that do covers of famous songs like the ones heard on the radio. \nOne of the most renowned cover bands in the world that is great to study along to is Vitamin String Quartet. They have a wide spectrum of music that they play including tributes to movies, bands and even music festivals like Coachella. It is music that you already know but with the sung parts replaced by instrumentals. No matter what genre you like, they have it covered.\nBesides classical music, there is also another genre of music which is great for studying: Chillwave. It is relaxing indie electronic music that does not distract but will keep you entertained and relaxed enough to study long hours. Some bands that are great to study with for this genre include: Neon Indian, Pretty Lights, Washed Out, and Toro y Moi.\nBefore you study, make a playlist with the songs you already know and love so that you waste no time picking and choosing. Another tip is to not crank the music all the way or else it will distract you from what your main focus is. Studying is undoubtedly hard but can be made bearable if you make a great playlist to keep you entertained!\nHere is a link to a VSQ playlist to help you study and conquer those tests!']",['https://knightnews.com/2014/02/kill-the-boredom-study-music/'],0.20029519498348236,0.039658594876527786,0.09002769738435745

It’s [the NFL] one big ‘Ru-Ru’ tribe.”\nIn another incident Ferraro recalls in the lawsuit, Ferraro claims that O’Leary said he had spoken with a former assistant, who is now a head coach in the NFL, and that he (O’Leary) had advised his former assistant that, while at the upcoming NFL combine in Indianapolis, to “check the [African-American] players to make sure that their gums are blue, because they are bigger, faster and stronger than [African- American] players with red gums.”\nRead the FULL COMPLAINT here.\n“UCF immediately investigated the allegations Mr. Ferraro made when he abruptly abandoned his job.

Once each team reappeared on the field, these problems only appeared more exaggerated. \nAfter a stellar performance from Josh McCown last week, the Buccaneer’s veteran quarterback managed to do little more than sabotage any of their hopes for victory. Throwing two interceptions and managing to gain little momentum from their three scoring drives, McCown’s performance really called into question Lovie Smith’s offensive strategy, once again. The game ended, with a Bear’s triumph of 21-13. Next week, the Buccaneers host the Cincinnati Bengals for a 1:00 P.M. game.\nTurning attention to the one Florida team with playoff hopes, the Miami Dolphins faced the Denver Broncos, in what became a nail-biter of a game, ending with the Bronco’s victory of 36-39. After three quarters of Dolphins domination, their defense seemed to give up altogether, allowing their opponent to score 22 points in the final quarter. While they may remain second in their division, even with this loss, their chances of making it to the playoffs are becoming slimmer and slimmer. They play the New York Jets, next Monday, at 8:30 P.M.\nFinally, we have to discuss one of the only teams worse than the Buccaneers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, who have again demonstrated their inability to do anything on either side of the ball, with a 23-3 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts prevented anything more than a single field goal from being scored against them, as well as intercepting the ball once and recovering a fumble. Blake Bortles has been struggling this season to live up the life of his college career, and his performance this past week was one of his most abysmal, ending the game with a passer rating of 55.5.

Considering the fact that the Panthers were unable to even break the .500 barrier during the regular season, it was a shock to see them attain any success in the post-season.

As a result of the investigation, Chandler reimbursed UCF about $30,000 for the “overpayments and double payments” he received, according to Johnson.\nUCF was helping to pay for trips that Chandler was taking all around the world, including to India and Hawaii. Chandler received funds for airline tickets, hotel, meals, taxis, tolls and parking.\nIn a July 2010 trip to Hawaii, he received over $4,000 from a third party organization to present a paper at the 2010 Disaster preparedness Conference in Honolulu. His airfare ticket was over $1,000, where he charged an additional $330 ticket upgrade fee, according to records.\nIn February of this year, he reimbursed UCF over $1,800 for the Hawaii trip, according to records.\n“With roughly 40 counts of ‘double-dipping’ on your travel expenses, it is impossible for me to accept an explanation of ‘sloppiness’ on your part,” Johnson said in the letter.\nIn addition to Chandler’s travel expenses, Johnson accused Chandler of using UCF employees to work on his outside projects, including having an employee “author” at least one chapter in Chandler’s book of which UCF did not benefit from, according to records.\nHe was also accused of hiring family members, which violates university regulations.\nIn a 10-page letter Chandler sent with his resignation notice to Johnson, Chandler addressed and denied all the accusations made against him.\n“…I deny your claims that my delays arose from a purposeful fraudulent intent,” Chandler said. “I deny your claim that I had ‘never’ previously reimbursed or not sought reimbursement from UCF for expenses paid by other parties until December 2014.”\nJohnson announced Chandler’s resignation to faculty in a meeting on March 27, according to NSC Area Coordinator and Associate Professor Steve Collins. Collins said Johnson told faculty Chandler’s resignation involved financial issues but were given no more details.\n“[Johnson] said this is not the first time someone has resigned from investigation,” Collins said. “I specifically asked if he thought, hindsight being 20/20, there were signs or someone could have found out sooner and he said he didn’t think so.”\nCollins continued: “I can tell you I am skeptical of that but I am not in a position to say.”\nThis is not the first time a UCF administrator was accused of misusing university funds.\xa0\nIn 2009, College of Engineering Dean Jamal Nayfeh was accused of using a UCF credit card to buy more than $40,000 in electronics for his home.

It was impossible for one’s attention to stray away from the sounds and the enthusiastic energy at which these performers demonstrated an age old craft; it was captivating to both sight and sound.\nThe enchantment continued as the C-Melody dancers representing Vietnam told their stories “through the eyes.” The rendition used the manipulation of fans and flowing silk fabrics to kept the focus on the dancer’s upper body movements. \nThis beautifully synchronized dance used the richness of the flowing fabrics to portray a classic tale of young love with a “demonic” twist. The majestic colors and graceful movements of the dancers truly did tell the tale to the fullest. The seemingly effortless dance charmed the audience as the young women evoked the passion and conflict existing between two lovers.\nThe non-stop sensory explosion continued with a duo known as “Philipinese” further as they further immersed everyone in the romantic mood by serenading them with unique acoustic sounds.

Shuyu Liu’s performance proved that, despite our cultural differences, we all share an emotional connection; it was the perfect segway in appeasing the audience’s thirst for more entertainment as the dance troupe followed suit with legendary dances from the Philippines. \nThe dancers engaged the audience with their face-paced footwork. This performance included wooden beams strategically laid out on the stage where the dancers demonstrated their technical skills as they rhythmically moved to the essence of the music. Different members of the same dance group then stirred the rhythmic juices as they engulfed the stage with their synchronized gesticulations of “punches” in combination with the powerful artist skill of tumbling, somersaults and once again, amazing footwork that captivated the audience throughout the performance.\nThe culminated feature was Knights Kangna, representing India whose agility and graceful gestures brought out the rich culture of their country’s dance as the artists incorporated modern movements. Modernizing the typical hand gestures or “mudra,” the dances combined the upbeat music of Bollywood and popular western hits as they told the story of two sisters whose family was tragically separated and eventually brought together.

On Wednesday, that was replaced by a poster labeled “Breaking Stereotypes,” balsa wood, and permanent markers.\nHosted by the Dems’ Asian-American Caucus, the event did exactly as advertised. Participants wrote their most hated statement attributed to their race and literally broke that stereotype in half.\nThe purpose, as described by caucus leaders, was to promote inclusiveness within the community by dispelling, in part, what is known as the model minority myth. Often used to describe Asians, the “model minority” is defined on a distributed flier as one “whose members are most often perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average.” The term, the flier said, is used to counter calls for government action to reduce racial discrimination.\nFrom pursuing STEM careers–a stereotype “broken” by political science and art history student Pratyush Goberdhan–to the common trope that Chinese students perform well at math, are some examples of misconceptions made about Asians that perpetuate the model minority.\nAlso, contrary to popular belief, Asians, which comprise six percent of the UCF student population, come from nationalities as far west as Turkey and as far south as Indonesia. Devi Mody, another co-founder of the Asian-American Caucus and the treasurer of the Dems, confronts the misconception as an Indian-American.\n“Let me tell you, people in middle school–like, do they not realize that India is in Asia?” Mody asked with a chuckle. “India’s in Asia, therefore making us Asian. People have fought me on this, and I’m like ‘Google a map and you will see.'”\nIndeed, many Asian students who participated in “breaking” their stereotypes did not fit the mythical profile, such as Sarah Siraj, a Pakistani student activist who wrote “Muslims are terrorists” on her board before splitting it in two.\nMany stereotypes are considered paradoxically positive while possibly having negative implications, and some come as a result of confusing continental separation with racial profiles, but others range into the purely negative. An example of this is that Asian men are not masculine enough, an idea which Stephanie Slater, a co-founder of the caucus and a Chinese-born criminal justice student, said may be because of other cultural and physical misconceptions.\n“People don’t think they are manly because ‘they don’t stand up for themselves, they’re not openly masculine,'” Stephanie Slater, a Chinese-born criminal justice student and a co-founder of the caucus, said. “They are shorter, which doesn’t help. And I think it’s because Asians are smart, so when you see them doing math all the time or engineering, you don’t typically see them as Superman.”\nSlater herself breaks the trope of the homogeneous Asian family. While she was born in China, she and her twin sister were adopted by American parents and grew up in the United States with an English-language last name.\nHaving gone to school in Florida, she was taunted by her appearance and was called “chink,” a racial slur against Chinese people particularly and one which, she said, many Americans see nothing wrong with saying.\xa0She does, however, continue to learn more about Chinese culture and customs, something which she feels is part of the Asian-American experience.\n“It’s very different for me because I grew up American, but to me it’s about being proud of where you come from, and I am proud of being Chinese,” Slater said. “When people ask me what I am, I say Chinese. I assume people know I am also American.”\nAsian-Americans, while they were the primary target of Breaking Stereotypes, were not the only ones who sought to do so. One black student broke a board with “Watermelons” scribbled across it. A Colombian dispelled the stereotype that he sells cocaine. And another student confidently split a board with the words, “I shower with my hijab on.”""]",['https://knightnews.com/2016/02/asian-american-students-seek-to-break-stereotypes/'],0.5779615640640259,0.7483647465705872,0.4540955126285553

A multitude of people started to arrive, including children, college students and parents. Some wore blank white t-shirts in anticipation for the bags of paint that would end up plastered to them by the end of the day, while others bought T-shirts that were available for a $5 donation to Sangam, UCF’s Indian Student Association.\nHoli, the Hindu Festival of Colors, is a famous holiday in India that marks the advent of spring.\nThe joyful celebrations traditionally include people throwing colored powder and water balloons at each other, as well as singing and dancing. This year, India celebrated Holi on Thursday, March 24.\nAt UCF, Sangam hosted their very own Holi celebration from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on April 3. The event was free to all UCF students and faculty. People from the community paid a small fee of $5 for paint bags, water balloons and food.\nThe festivities commenced with DJ Keshav Nelavai, a sophomore at UCF, playing catchy Bollywood songs with the occasional addition of E.D.M and pop music while the President of Sangam Chirag Bhandari gave instructions to form two lines facing each other.\n“We try to have everyone clash in the middle so there is an explosion of color,” Bhandari said. “This way, it looks cool and you get a feel for what it is actually like in India.”\nThe walls of people rushed forward as a brilliant haze from all the colors rose up to the sky.\n“Holi is a huge community thing. Neighbors, family and people from out of town all come together and have fun,” Bhandari said.\nSince it became a registered student organization on campus in 1983, Sangham has been hosting the festival. Bandar said they do it ever year.\nUCF junior Adrian Del Toro said he would definitely come next year.\n“It has been a lot of fun throwing paint on each other and just acting like fools,” Del Toro said.\nThe color wars were temporarily halted for a lunch break. The rainbow colored line of people twisted around the Lake Claire pavilion. The Indian cuisine from Aashirwad included chicken biryani.\nCaelin Linaja, one of the most vividly painted participants, said he enjoyed his first Holi celebration.\n“The highlight of today was the connections I made,” Linaja said. “You can do things you normally wouldn’t do in a group like dance crazy and throw water on random strangers.”\nThe day concluded with water gun and water balloon fights.

In the more tense moments of the protest, police officers have subjected the demonstrators to tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, and blasts from water cannons in subfreezing temperatures. Now, with winter approaching and no sign that either side will back down, the situation seems to have reached a stalemate.\nTwo UCF alumni who have spent time protesting at the Standing Rock Reservation were among those rallying around Lake Eola Sunday.\nEmily Ruff, a 2005 graduate, described the harmonious atmosphere of Standing Rock when she first visited in September.\n“Hundreds of tribes that previously had experienced years of intertribal conflict were setting aside their baggage to stand united in solidarity for a single mission: to protect the water and the environment,” she said.\n“It was really beautiful and moving to see both indigenous tribes and non-indigenous allies standing together in incredible solidarity and bringing our power together to support the Earth and all that’s sacred.”\nThe group was also assembled to protest the construction of the Sabal Trail Pipeline, a $3 billion natural gas pipe that will run under portions of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia.\nSunday’s demonstration opened with a prayer ritual performed by Joey Karei, a Taino Indian. Karei, along with the rest of those assembled, prayed for open-mindedness, understanding, and the forgiveness of police officers and Dakota Access workers.\nThe group then marched to the Orlando offices of Senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio and the SunTrust building. SunTrust is one of several banks partially funding the Dakota Access Pipeline, according to Food & Water Watch.\nAlthough the march was peaceful and occurred largely without incident, there was at least one instance of a truck driver, angered that the protestors were marching in the street, accelerating suddenly toward the back of the group before slamming on his brakes.\nAlthough students may feel compelled to travel to North Dakota to protest the pipeline in person, doing so is not necessarily the best way to show support, said Matt De Vlieger, a 2007 UCF graduate.\nDe Vlieger had just returned from North Dakota. He had originally intended to only stay for 5 days, but lengthened his stay to nearly two weeks after seeing a rubber bullet break his friend’s arm.\nThe best way for people to support the water protectors in North Dakota, he said, is to simply start a conversation about the project and identify the “pillars of support” funding the project. From there, he encourages students to do their part to non-violently oppose the construction project.\n“We need to commit ourselves to nonviolence. We need to commit ourselves to nonviolent direct action. That means not just sitting on Facebook and clicking,” he said.']",['https://knightnews.com/2016/11/dozens-protest-dakota-access-sabal-trail-pipelines-in-orlando/'],0.10901128500699997,0.2208593189716339,0.024671079590916634

Although the road to true love never runs smooth, with these two headstrong romantics holding the reins, love’s journey is as bumpy as a surrey ride down a country road.

2067,UCF,2017-01-27,journal_data/txt/UCF/2017_01_27.txt,"['On Tuesday afternoon students and faculty gathered in the Student Union to engage in insightful conversation at the Social Justice & Advocacy’s “Breaking Barriers Lunch.”\nThe University of Central Florida recognizes a “Social Justice Week” annually. The week is filled with events that demonstrate and promote the idea of being an open-minded, socially conscious individual.\nThe lunch, catered by Subway, was the quintessential opportunity to socialize with people of various cultures, sexual orientations, and economic backgrounds.\nWith the onset of the recent inauguration, people had a lot to say about their opinions on social justice and why they decided to come there.\nLuis Mujica is a senior studying health sciences and creative writing. He is a proud member of the LQBTQ community. He was open about why this event was so important to him.\n“Social justice always interests me being that I’m gay. I’ve dealt with a lot of oppression from my family…and even with the Pulse situation one of my friends worked there. The whole situation hit me hard. I think this is a great way to talk about whatever is bothering you or just listening to people. I love listening to people.”\nJamie Booth, a senior interdisciplinary studies major also discussed what social justice means to her.\n“I’m a very big proponent of social justice, especially when it comes to women’s rights. There’s always going to be bias, racism, sexism, and things like that. That’s why I’m a very big proponent for equality and for everyone to be treated for the person that they are and not for something such as skin color, race, and gender.”\nJil Shah is a sophomore biomedical science major. She expressed the struggles that she faces as an Indian-American and female in general.\n“I was lucky enough to be raised in a really diverse area. I’m from Michigan. The area that I was born in is right next to Detroit which has a very large African-American population. I also lived near Deerborne which has the highest amount of Arabs outside of the Middle East….I grew up around people and in a community that welcomes our differences and embraces them. Of course, there’s the daily struggle of being a minority with things such as how you are supposed to speak up for your entire race because you know who else is at the table to speak for you. But for me, I have lately felt more pressure as a woman, than as an Indian. Those are two things that very well define me, but with the recent election and everything that is going on…”\nShah later expressed that she was not prepared for the new presidential transition going from a president that is a self-proclaimed feminist to one that she believes does not share those beliefs.\nConversations continued from a faculty in the engineering department, Stephania Hayes.\nShe shared her thoughts on being an African-American woman with a unique name and rocking her natural hair in the workplace.\n“I have to admit; I was actually scared to wear my natural hair for the job interview (at UCF).

As the Student Body President, I was honored to pledge the love and support of the University of Central Florida toward all who were affected. The official statement is listed below.\n\xa0\nAs always, thank you for your continued support.\n\xa0\nGo Knights! Charge On!\nSincerely,\n \xa0\n Nicholas R. Larkins\n Student Body President\n Member, UCF Board of Trustees\n Student Government Association\n University of Central Florida”\nThe president of the university followed in the same day with a message.\nDubbed “The Wrong Side of History,” UCF President John C. Hitt of 25 years enumerated the university’s opposition to ‘racism, bigotry, and hate,’ and strength in values such as\xa0equality, inclusivity, and respect.\nThe message has been reproduced below:\n“The recent violence in Charlottesville was repugnant, and it stands as an anathema to the values Americans hold dear.\nIt is even more disturbing that so much of the violence occurred on a college campus — the historic and prestigious University of Virginia.\nMore frequently than ever, hate groups target public universities like ours because we vigorously promote free speech. That’s why I support what UVA President Teresa Sullivan said after Nazis, white supremacists, and anti-Semitic protestors stormed her campus.\nWhat took place at UVA “wasn’t about ideas,” she said. “People weren’t out there arguing with each other. They were clobbering each other. That’s a very different situation. That’s violence. Violence is not free speech.”\nI couldn’t agree more.\nUCF stands alongside those who oppose the racism, bigotry, and hate seen in Charlottesville. These views are on the wrong side of history and have no place in our future.\nWe choose to side with equality, inclusivity, and respect.\nIn my lifetime, Americans have defeated Nazis, won the Cold War, and fought for equal rights for all.\nOur progress toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive people is a strength of our great nation. Our embrace of justice and equality has been a beacon to others around the world.\nThese values represent the best of America. Let us strive to uphold these values in all we do, now more than ever.”\n\xa0\nAforementioned statement:\nSTATEMENT\nAs Student Body Presidents across the United States, we are deeply saddened by the events that have occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. We are united with the students of the University of Virginia, as what affects one of our campuses affects us all. College campuses are spaces that students should be able to call home, not places of violence, hate, and racism. Students should always feel welcome and safe at our incredible higher education institutions, never having to fear for their personal well-being. As the voice of our students, we collectively call on one another to speak up in the face of injustice, as silence reduces us to bystanders in oppression. This is a statement to not only support the Student Body at the University of Virginia but to make clear our advocacy for the victimized and marginalized students on all our campuses. We will continue to support students and universities in their peaceful resistance to violence, racism, white supremacy, bigotry, and acts of terrorism on our own campuses and beyond.

Around 50 faculty members from various colleges at UCF lined up to ask Singell about his credentials and vision. Here are four things you need to know about Singell:\nStance on student’s : “UCF has students that are more representative of the population as a whole than other institutions I have observed in the rest of the country. This campus represents America in a much truer way than most of the campuses that I have seen, and so this is a grand experiment about can we make this work and work well and that’s the part that makes me excited about the [provost position]”\nStance on faculty: “If there’s an opportunity for me to enroll more students and give more student credit hours I’d do it. I have an individual, he has to talk to me on a regular basis, but his instructions are that if it’s profitable do it. That can happen because there’s a direct link between the money and the delivery of instruction. To the extent it’s possible, you know a provost that can look at what’s profitable for the institution as a whole and make resources available is something that would be collectively wise. I would look towards mechanisms that more closely align instructional demand with resources.”\nStance on Education: “One of my goals when I became executive dean at the college of arts and sciences [at Indiana University] was to create a career services department in which students participated in career services from day one. Career is really about what am I good at, what am I passionate about, what am I interested in given those skill sets and how does that translate into your next step. I really do believe that conversation has to start immediately. One of the problems of the college of arts and sciences is your experience about discovering [career path] after you get out is one that is not uncommon. It’s not about the first job it’s about a career and a career requires general skills.”\nStance on His role as provost: “Economists believe that decisions closest to where the action is, is the appropriate place to happen. The provost role is to find the resources that strategically encourage units that may not work together to work together, but again a provost budget is somewhat limited so it has to look in strategic places where those investments will make a difference. I believe that if we do this together collectively we are going to be more successful and you, the individual, will be more successful.

This time Searles was examining the gills of a little shrimp. \nAdam Searles, a recent UCF alumnus has taken his biology\nstudies from Orlando to the Atlantic coast. Searles works on behalf of\nFlorida’s environment in the most diverse estuary in North America at the Florida\nFish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in Melbourne.\nSearles said he was always fascinated with marine life\nand knew from an early age studying wildlife would be his career.\n“Research gives you a sneak peek into a world that not\nmany people get to see,” Searles said. “But you’re also doing good for the\nhabitat that you’re admiring.”\nThe Indian River Lagoon is home to over 14 federally threatened or endangered species and 45 more species listed by the state as threatened, endangered, special concern or commercially exploited, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nWildlife populations are declining in the Indian River\nLagoon due to the environmental impacts of rapid population growth. This is the\nsame wildlife that sustain a healthy ecosystem and ultimately society. \n“Our fish quality is a reflection of what may happen to us. So, we must work for what we want for our lives,” said Richard Paperno, a monitor adviser at FWC who devoted his life to conservation for over 30 years and trained Searles.\nAs a part of Searles’ job he monitors aquatic species\nof the lagoon and collects samples to observe diseases and population declines.\nSearles said his work has been gratifying to understand the interconnected\nfactors that allow ecosystems to flourish.\n\xa0“Civilization\ncan’t live without properly functioning ecosystems,” Searles said. “Because if\nyou take out the ecosystem, it’s like a house of cards, the whole thing falls.”\nSpecies stability is not only important for wildlife but directly to people as well, Searles said. \nWhen Searles is researching different aquatic species he’ll typically collect a sample and examine their gills and other body parts through a microscope. He searches to find anything peculiar, such as the species growing to a smaller size, or discoloration. \nSearles emphasized the importance of paying attention\nto species at the lower levels of the food chain. These lower-level species matter\nindirectly because their stability has an ecological ripple effect. That’s why\nthe FWC uses ecosystem-based science, because it considers all species, Searles\nsaid. A species may appear insignificant to most people but provide food to the\ngame fish which directly effects fisheries and subsequently the economy.\nSearles said it’s been a humbling experience to work\nin nature and understand wildlife more.\nAnother active member of the UCF community is Melinda\nDonnelly, a UCF biology postdoctoral fellow who has also devoted her work to\nconservation on the Indian River Lagoon. She has\nrecently been focusing on the social dimensions of the ecology of the lagoon.\nDonnelly is researching the lagoon through the experiences of local people who live there, on how the lagoon has changed over the years. Donnelly said what she hears most often from people is how congested the surrounding area of the Indian River Lagoon has become. People typically complain about the overcrowding because it diminishes the number of vital flood control wetlands of the lagoon, she said. \n\xa0“The wetlands\nare definitely one of our most underappreciated ecological systems,” Donnelly\nsaid. “We realized that we rely on them for so many ecosystem services. Now we\nknow wetlands support everything from cleaning up all the storm water to\nsupporting local fisheries.”\nThe diseases fish can get from the diminished water\nquality due to pollution effects the overall trajectory of the entire aquatic\npopulation, Searles said.\nPreservation of these important ecosystems has become\ncrucial. Donnelly spoke about major threats, and how people are influencing ecosystem\ndeclines in more ways than population increase.\n“Our water systems are affected by the use of the\nfertilizers, herbicides and pesticides which eventually ends up in our\nwaterways and into the ecosystems,” Donnelly said. “What are you putting in\nyour yard and are you contributing to a much larger problem?”\nDespite damages that have been done to the ecosystem, Donnelly said it isn’t the end.

Assistant coach Tyrone Corbin has since replaced Clifford as the acting head coach going forward going into Monday’s matchup.\xa0\nIt was a dismal start for the Magic trailing 28-16 after the first quarter which saw the team shoot a woeful 27% from the court going 6-22.\xa0\xa0\nThings quickly started to heat up though as the Magic went on a tear in the second quarter outscoring the Lakers 40 to 22 to jump out the lead the Lakers 56-50 by the end of the first half.\xa0\nMagic forward Chuma Okeke said he believed his dunk over Lakers center Andre Drummond in the first couple minutes of the second quarter ignited the run they went on.\xa0\n“I feel that gave us a boost for everybody on the team,” Okeke said. “That gave us a boost to play harder than we were playing. That made us even more locked in.”\xa0\nCorbin said he believes that after having a strong second quarter it gave his players confidence in competing against the reigning NBA champions.\xa0\n“We started to believe that we can play with these guys I think,” Corbin said. “For young guys, it’s a tremendous thing for them to feel that energy of each and say, ok we can do this.”\xa0\nThe Lakers came out strong at the start of the third quarter and reclaimed the lead for the first time the first few minutes of the second after Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma scored a fast-break dunk to grab the lead 74-73.\xa0\nThe Magic had the last laugh though, as guard Gary Harris hit a deep three pointer from beyond the arc with less than 30 seconds left in the quarter to head into the fourth quarter with a slim 80-79 lead.\xa0\nThe first three possessions of the fourth quarter lead to back and forth three-pointers from both teams but the Lakers ultimately proved to be too much for the Magic as they were outscored 35-23 to lead the Lakers to a 114-103 come from behind victory.\xa0\nLakers guard Dennis Schroder helped fuel the late fourth-quarter comeback, scoring 13 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter finishing the 10 for 18 for 21 points and 10 assists.\xa0\nThe big question heading into Monday’s game was the uncertain play of Lakers forward Anthony Davis returning to the lineup recently after 30 games because of a right calf injury went 8 for 15 in 31 minutes of play and finishing the night with 18 points, eight rebounds and three assists.\xa0\nOrlando traded much of its veteran power earlier this season. At the end of March, forward Aaron Gordon went to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for veteran shooting guard Gary Harris and rookie R.J. Hampton and Denver’s protected 2025 first-round pick. The Celtics acquired Magic guard Evan Fournier in exchange for two second-round picks.\nThe team also traded All-Star center Nikola Vucevic and forward Al-Farouq Aminu to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for center Wendell Carter Jr., forward Otto Porter, a 2021 first-round pick and a 2023 first-round pick, signaling a rebuild of the team.\xa0\n𝙋𝙐𝙏 '𝙀𝙈 𝙊𝙉 𝘼 𝙋𝙊𝙎𝙏𝙀𝙍, 𝘽𝙄𝙂 𝘾𝙃𝙐𝙈@chuma_okeke | #MagicTogether pic.twitter.com/Js1wK5wB3P\nDespite the losing effort, Okeke led the way for the Magic going 7 for 12 scoring 18 points, five rebounds going 3 for 5 from 3-point range.\xa0\xa0\nWith the loss, the Magic fell to 18-43 for the season after losing six straight and now have the worst record in the eastern conference.\xa0\nThe Magic will travel to the Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday to take on the Cleveland Cavaliers at 7 p.m.\xa0""]",['https://knightnews.com/2021/04/magic-fall-late-to-lakers-to-extend-losing-streak-to-6/'],0.47258347272872925,0.492789089679718,0.4582487642765045
