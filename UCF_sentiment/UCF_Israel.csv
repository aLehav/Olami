KnightNews.com launched in the middle of July and became UCF’s only news source locally owned by students. Since our launch, we’ve produced hundreds of videos and focused on a 24-hour breaking news format. Since UCF doesn’t have a student-run TV station, 2009 marked the first year students enjoyed consistently produced video content geared toward their interests. It seems fair to say that KnightNews.com has revolutionized how students stay informed  — and entertained — at UCF.\nVIDEO: Our search for UCF students auditioning for American Idol was one of our first videos.\n\nA New Quarterback Came To UCF\nKnightNews.com was the first campus media to report about a new quarterback who quietly transferred to UCF from Wake Forest. We reported how this new Knight would fight for the starting QB job, and Brett Hodges did just that. Hodges eventually won the starting job, and helped the Knights recover from a rough season start, due in part to former starting QB Rob Calabrese’s inconsistency. Hodges went on to lead the Knights to its first ever win over a ranked opponent, and a winning season.\nBoard of Trustees Slashes Majors, Jobs\nThe tough economic times plaguing the nation, hit home at UCF this summer. In July, the UCF Board of Trustees voted to cut several majors from campus. The move cost 1,000 students their majors and 37 employees their jobs. It saved $4.6 million from UCF’s budget. Administrators said the cuts were critical and needed, while faculty union reps claimed administrators had plenty of money in reserves. Regardless, the meeting was emotional, reducing on BOT member, Ida Cook, to tears. Only Cook and SGA President Brian Peterson voted against the cuts. The cuts came after UCF students saw unprecedented tuition and fee increases this school year.\nDeaths of 2 Popular Students Occurred Days Apart, Shook Student Body \nThe end of July marked a sad time for the Knights, with the deaths of students Trevor Shipley and J.P. Saul happening just days apart. Shipley, a member of Beta Theta Pi, died in a car accident in Tavares. Members of Shipley’s fraternity spoke at his memorial in Tavares. KnightNews.com provided a live streaming video of the service, and later uploaded the entire video for those unable to attend. Saul, known as the “Van Wilder of UCF” for his love of partying,  died of unknown circumstances in his Boardwalk apartment. Friends designed T-shirts to wear at tailgates in his honor, and organized memorial services at UCF’s Reflecting Pond and Knight Library, his favorite Happy Hour spot. Proceeds from the shirts went to help his family with Saul’s final expenses.\nAUGUST 2009: \nUCF Surpasses UF as the Largest School in Florida, Becomes Third Largest in Nation\nWith UCF’s freshmen class of 2013 pouring onto campus in August, the University of Central Florida officially outgrew UF and became the largest school in the state. The preliminary fall 2009 headcount showed 53,811 students enrolled. UCF officials boasted about the No. 1 ranking, but we reported about horrible parking headaches to plague students — especially around the first few days of class. We showed you how Parking Services was unforgiving, dishing out hundreds of tickets to new students who claimed they didn’t know they couldn’t park on curves. (http://knightnews.com/2009/08/parking-a-big-problem-on-ucfs-first-day-of-class/)\nUCF Grad Blasts Into Space \nAs 100 current UCF students watched Space Shuttle Discovery blast off from a campus parking garage this August, a former UCF student was living her dream on board. With Saturday’s awe-inspiring midnight launch, Nicole Stott became the first UCF graduate to soar into space. Stott earned a UCF master’s degree in Engineering Management in 1992, and credits the support of her professors and program with giving her the confidence boost to go for her dream and apply to be an astronaut.\nSEPTEMBER 2009: \nSGA Senate Elections Marred By Bribery Scandal\nIn September, KnightNews.com broke news of an elections scandal involving SGA veteran William Lusk and UCF’s College Republicans. Lusk was found in major violation of SGA Election Statutes, for allegedly attempting to bribe the College Republicans club with money, in exchange for the group endorsing Lusk’s Unite Ticket. The elections commission voted 7 to 1 in favor of William Lusk receiving a major violation. Lusk appealed the finding to SGA’s Judicial Council, but his attempts to keep his Senate seat were unsuccessful — the council upheld the initial finding against him. Despite talking to KnightNews.com before we broke the scandal, Lusk refused to talk to us after we brought you the news. Because of that, our cameras chased him trying to ask the tough questions anyway. The video became popular, drawing a fierce debate on the comments section between both political sides.\nAll Fraternities Go On Suspension After Parent Claims Pledge Was Beaten, Bruised\nClaims of a brutal pledge beating rocked UCF’s Greek community after KnightNews.com broke the exclusive details revealing how a parent called UCF President John Hitt’s office saying she found her son “beaten and bruised” by his fraternity. After the call, UCF officials persuaded all fraternities to go under a short “voluntary” suspension, drawing criticism from Greek leaders. It was later revealed in an e-mail to Greek leaders from the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life that the anonymous caller accused an African American Fraternity of the beating. UCF had said they never were able to confirm the claims, so no fraternity ended up being punished for the accusations.\nPresident Hitt Gives Student Media First Known Interview in Years\nAfter years of declining interview requests with campus media because of a controversy over an old political cartoon, UCF President John Hitt broke his silence to KnightNews.com. Hitt gave an exclusive interview to KnightNews.com reporters following his Sept. open forum. Despite Hitt clearing off more than an hour of his schedule and sending out a campus e-mail advertising the forum, only two students showed up to ask questions. In our exclusive interview after the forum, Hitt told KnightNews.com that although the forums usually last longer, he was not completely surprised to see how quickly it ended. He elaborated on this claim by saying that very few questions indicate students’ contentment with how the University is run. However, after we published the story, many students commented that they never got the e-mail. The problem could have been with the new Knights e-mail system, which was in its early stages at the time.\nCops Arrest UCF Bartenders, UCF Helped Plan the Undercover Sting Operations\nAs bar after bar in the UCF area was being hit by an underage drinking sting, KnightNews.com was providing live continuous coverage, telling you which bars were being hit, and how the cops were conducting their operations. Several student bartenders were arrested from at least three area bars, including Devaney’s, Scoops and TD’s Sports Bar.  After breaking the news of the bar busts, KnightNews.com did some digging, and discovered UCF President John Hitt was a co-creator of the task force that planned and carried out undercover operations. Hitt created the task force, along with Orange County Mayor Richard Crotty in 2008, after it was discovered that two UCF freshmen died in alcohol-related accidents. We exposed how the deputies used 18-year-old “confidential informants” to buy alcohol from bartenders. After our report, we haven’t heard of any other stings using that technique at UCF bars.\nUCF Greeks Dance for a Good Cause, Videos a Big Hit on KnightNews.com\nEach fall, Kappa Delta and Zeta Tau Alpha sororities get UCF’s Greek community up on stage to dance for a good cause. KnightNews.com gave both events coverage like never before, including quickly uploading videos of all the fraternities and sororities performances. The videos quickly became a big hit, and led to never before seen video coverage of organizations dances during Homecoming as well.\nTailgate Time Cuts Meet Fierce Opposition from Outrages Alumni, Students \nAngry alumni raised their voices at meetings — and some even showed up on game day and sat in protest — after UCF officials announced a plan to make major cuts to tailgating start times for night games. Administrators said it was to make the game day safer, less about alcohol and save money. Some fans said it the change was unacceptable — especially because UCF waited to tell fans about the change until after season tickets were bought. Attendance during games was down this year. Was it because of the time cuts, or just the economy?  We report, you decide!\nTailgate Time Cuts Didn’t Stop People From Getting Drunk, As Seen on Our Fan Cam \nA new UCF tradition was born this year, with the KnightNews.com fan cam. Patrolling UCF’s Memory Mall with a camera during tailgate parties proved quite entertaining, and this quickly became one of our most popular segments. We saw everything from Knights running around to upper classmen teaching freshmen how to dance and the best places to party. We saw tailgaters wearing practically nothing, and some wearing giant paintings of sex organs on their bodies. It was an interesting and entertaining time, and is sure to be back next year!\nOCTOBER 2009\nAnother Popular UCF Student, Brother of ATO, Dies in Car Crash\nUCF lost another Knight in a tragic car crash in October. John Grosso, a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, was only 21 when he died. He and a friend, who did not attend UCF, crashed on Tanner Rd. after coming around a sharp curve in the early morning hours. Grosso’s fraternity brothers held a candlelight vigil at their house, and invited KnightNews.com to document the tribute to their fallen friend.\nCreepy Sex Offender Stars in YouTube Video\nOK, so this didn’t have much to do about UCF, but we covered it. This elderly, and very creepy, sex offender got in trouble for posting videos on YouTube. He’d sing in the videos, or have his dog bite his stomach. He was booked in a Central Florida jail. The videos are something else. Take a look!\nMarcus Jordan’s Shoes Cost UCF Millions\nWhen the UCF Knights basketball team scored the son of NBA legend Michael Jordan to play on the team, they also inherited a little problem — Marcus Jordan doesn’t wear Adidas shoes. UCF promised Marcus he could wear his dad’s Air Jordan brand by Nike during recruitment. But the Adidas reps UCF got the OK from, weren’t high enough on the totem pole to OK that. In the end, Jordan wore Jordans, and UCF lost the $3 Million Adidas deal.\nString of Robbers Targeting UCF Students Still at Large\nThe Orange County Sheriff’s Office released surveillance video to KnightNews.com showing the faces of the men investigators believe to be involved in the robbery to Jimmy John’s on University Blvd. at gunpoint in October.\xa0The video of the suspected robbers was taken outside Shamrock Liquor Store, in the shopping plaza with McDonald’s right across from UCF, before the Jimmy John’s was robbed early Oct. 4. These suspects are still on the run.\nUCF Student Arrested For Seeking ‘Kinky’ Sex With Underage Girl\nWe were the first local news source to\xa0tell you about a UCF student accused of a heinous Internet sex crime. Nathan B. Schaller stands accused of taking pictures of his penis and pleasuring himself over a Web cam while wearing a UCF T-shirt — all to try and lure what he thought was a 14-year-old girl into “kinky sex,” according to a Palm Beach County charging affidavit obtained by KnightNews.com. It turns out, the person on the other end of the computer wasn’t a young girl, but an undercover agent instead.\nNOVEMBER 2009\nVortex Amazing Takes Area By Storm\nIf you haven’t been in this thing yet, you have to try it at least once. This big trailer likes to post up next to Scoop, and lure drunk students in for a $2.00 cover charge. When you are inside, you feel it’s “vortex” power. The guy who owns it works in construction, and made it to stay afloat during the tough economic times.\nKnights Make Historic Football Win, Cops Grab, Detain UCF Fan Who Tried Storming Field\nWhen UCF beat the nationally ranked Houston Cougars — the first victory ever against a ranked team — one UCF fan tried celebrating the way many college campuses would with such a win, by storming the field. But UCF police had different plans for him. Armed with riot gear, including an apparent bean bag gun and dogs, the fan was swarmed and taken down. KnightNews.com captured exclusive video of it unfolding. What shocked many fans was, CBS College Sports reported O’Leary gave fans permission to storm the field before the game, so long as the Knights won. We asked UCF police and UCF Athletics for comment about why O’Leary and police apparently were not on the same page, but we never got an answer to that question.\nKyle Schumacher, Caitlyn McManus Named UCF Homecoming King and Queen\nDuring UCF’s Historic Homecoming game against nationally-ranked Houston, Kyle Schumacher and Caitlyn McManus were crowned UCF Homecoming King and Queen. McManus is a member of Alpha Xi Delta sorority, and Schumacher is a DU, but more widely known for being elected IFC President. What will the future hold for these two? Could either make a run for SGA President in Spring? Schumacher has worked in the White House before, so anything’s possible! We will watch them both closely, and of course, break the news if they do — or don’t — decide to throw their hats in the ring.\nBomb Scare Rocks Campus, Days After Mass Downtown Orlando Shooting\nTensions were high following a mass shooting in Downtown Orlando, and days after that horror unfolded just down the 408, the UCF campus became center stage for a major bomb scare. The FBI and bomb squad came to campus and shut down garages after UCF police arrested student Cory Carr for making a bomb threat in Classroom 1. No bomb was ever found, and Carr later blamed the incident on a misunderstanding caused by his reaction to Obama’s plan to send troops to Afghanistan. Carr, a former marine, claims he spoke out loud, saying the US should blow the terrorists up, rather than put US marines in harm’s way. Other students, he said, misheard him, and reported him for claiming he planed to blow up Classroom 1 when he never planned to. Carr says UCF found him not in violation of any campus rules at his hearing.\nBeta Theta Pi Gets UCF to Back Down, Let Them on Campus Early, Despite Sexual Misconduct Finding\nThe brothers of Beta Theta Pi will be back on campus in by Summer of 2010, despite being found in violation of school rules prohibiting sexual misconduct by UCF’s Office of Student Conduct. Beta Theta Pi was suspended by UCF after being accused of gang raping a girl, but the girl later dropped the case. A controversy ensued when UCF found the group to have committed sexual misconduct, based on school rules, despite the criminal case being dropped. Beta showed UCF it would fight them in court, and UCF backed down and cut the suspension in half as part of the settlement.\nT-Pain, Asher Roth, Party at Scoop with UCF Students\nAfter UCF’s homecoming concert, headliners T-Pain and Asher Roth kept the party going — at UCF’s popular college bar, Scoop. The two posed with students, and KnightNews.com posted exclusive photos of the party. It wasn’t all fun though, we got reports that T-Pain ordered lots of top shelf drinks, but didn’t pay the bill, never mind tip his bartenders.\nDECEMBER 2009\nKnights Lose to Rutgers in St. Pete Bowl\nHopes were high that UCF would beat the Big East’s Rutgers in the St. Pete Bowl, and show the BCS conference it’s where we belong. But the game merely proved we couldn’t hang with the big boys. O’Leary even said he was embarrassed by the performance. QB Brett Hodges went out on a low note, and the man he replaced, Rob Calabrese, finished out the last game after Hodges took one too many hard hits. All in all, the Knights seemed to appreciate Hodges though, and at least he didn’t cry after losing — unlike the QB for that smaller university a little bit to our north.\nOur QB’s Don’t Cry, But Do They Drink and Drive?\nKyle Israel made headlines as UCF’s star Quarterback in 2007, when he led the Knights to a C-USA championship, and against Mississippi State in the Autozone Liberty Bowl. (Which we lost). But he also made headlines two years after his glory days ended — for being arrested on DUI charges near campus. UCF police made the bust, claiming he was twice the legal limit. Israel has declined comment.\nThe entire staff at KnightNews.com thanks all of you for your tremendous support this year. Be sure to invite your friends to be our facebook fan, and send us tips by e-mailing news@knightnews.com. We want to hear from you, and how we can better serve the campus.

It was an interesting and entertaining time, and is sure to be back next year!\nOCTOBER 2009\nAnother Popular UCF Student, Brother of ATO, Dies in Car Crash\nUCF lost another Knight in a tragic car crash in October. John Grosso, a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, was only 21 when he died. He and a friend, who did not attend UCF, crashed on Tanner Rd. after coming around a sharp curve in the early morning hours. Grosso’s fraternity brothers held a candlelight vigil at their house, and invited KnightNews.com to document the tribute to their fallen friend.\nCreepy Sex Offender Stars in YouTube Video\nOK, so this didn’t have much to do about UCF, but we covered it. This elderly, and very creepy, sex offender got in trouble for posting videos on YouTube. He’d sing in the videos, or have his dog bite his stomach. He was booked in a Central Florida jail. The videos are something else. Take a look!\nMarcus Jordan’s Shoes Cost UCF Millions\nWhen the UCF Knights basketball team scored the son of NBA legend Michael Jordan to play on the team, they also inherited a little problem — Marcus Jordan doesn’t wear Adidas shoes. UCF promised Marcus he could wear his dad’s Air Jordan brand by Nike during recruitment. But the Adidas reps UCF got the OK from, weren’t high enough on the totem pole to OK that. In the end, Jordan wore Jordans, and UCF lost the $3 Million Adidas deal.\nString of Robbers Targeting UCF Students Still at Large\nThe Orange County Sheriff’s Office released surveillance video to KnightNews.com showing the faces of the men investigators believe to be involved in the robbery to Jimmy John’s on University Blvd. at gunpoint in October.\xa0The video of the suspected robbers was taken outside Shamrock Liquor Store, in the shopping plaza with McDonald’s right across from UCF, before the Jimmy John’s was robbed early Oct. 4. These suspects are still on the run.\nUCF Student Arrested For Seeking ‘Kinky’ Sex With Underage Girl\nWe were the first local news source to\xa0tell you about a UCF student accused of a heinous Internet sex crime. Nathan B. Schaller stands accused of taking pictures of his penis and pleasuring himself over a Web cam while wearing a UCF T-shirt — all to try and lure what he thought was a 14-year-old girl into “kinky sex,” according to a Palm Beach County charging affidavit obtained by KnightNews.com. It turns out, the person on the other end of the computer wasn’t a young girl, but an undercover agent instead.\nNOVEMBER 2009\nVortex Amazing Takes Area By Storm\nIf you haven’t been in this thing yet, you have to try it at least once. This big trailer likes to post up next to Scoop, and lure drunk students in for a $2.00 cover charge. When you are inside, you feel it’s “vortex” power. The guy who owns it works in construction, and made it to stay afloat during the tough economic times.\nKnights Make Historic Football Win, Cops Grab, Detain UCF Fan Who Tried Storming Field\nWhen UCF beat the nationally ranked Houston Cougars — the first victory ever against a ranked team — one UCF fan tried celebrating the way many college campuses would with such a win, by storming the field. But UCF police had different plans for him. Armed with riot gear, including an apparent bean bag gun and dogs, the fan was swarmed and taken down. KnightNews.com captured exclusive video of it unfolding. What shocked many fans was, CBS College Sports reported O’Leary gave fans permission to storm the field before the game, so long as the Knights won. We asked UCF police and UCF Athletics for comment about why O’Leary and police apparently were not on the same page, but we never got an answer to that question.\nKyle Schumacher, Caitlyn McManus Named UCF Homecoming King and Queen\nDuring UCF’s Historic Homecoming game against nationally-ranked Houston, Kyle Schumacher and Caitlyn McManus were crowned UCF Homecoming King and Queen. McManus is a member of Alpha Xi Delta sorority, and Schumacher is a DU, but more widely known for being elected IFC President. What will the future hold for these two? Could either make a run for SGA President in Spring? Schumacher has worked in the White House before, so anything’s possible! We will watch them both closely, and of course, break the news if they do — or don’t — decide to throw their hats in the ring.\nBomb Scare Rocks Campus, Days After Mass Downtown Orlando Shooting\nTensions were high following a mass shooting in Downtown Orlando, and days after that horror unfolded just down the 408, the UCF campus became center stage for a major bomb scare. The FBI and bomb squad came to campus and shut down garages after UCF police arrested student Cory Carr for making a bomb threat in Classroom 1. No bomb was ever found, and Carr later blamed the incident on a misunderstanding caused by his reaction to Obama’s plan to send troops to Afghanistan. Carr, a former marine, claims he spoke out loud, saying the US should blow the terrorists up, rather than put US marines in harm’s way. Other students, he said, misheard him, and reported him for claiming he planed to blow up Classroom 1 when he never planned to. Carr says UCF found him not in violation of any campus rules at his hearing.\nBeta Theta Pi Gets UCF to Back Down, Let Them on Campus Early, Despite Sexual Misconduct Finding\nThe brothers of Beta Theta Pi will be back on campus in by Summer of 2010, despite being found in violation of school rules prohibiting sexual misconduct by UCF’s Office of Student Conduct. Beta Theta Pi was suspended by UCF after being accused of gang raping a girl, but the girl later dropped the case. A controversy ensued when UCF found the group to have committed sexual misconduct, based on school rules, despite the criminal case being dropped. Beta showed UCF it would fight them in court, and UCF backed down and cut the suspension in half as part of the settlement.\nT-Pain, Asher Roth, Party at Scoop with UCF Students\nAfter UCF’s homecoming concert, headliners T-Pain and Asher Roth kept the party going — at UCF’s popular college bar, Scoop. The two posed with students, and KnightNews.com posted exclusive photos of the party. It wasn’t all fun though, we got reports that T-Pain ordered lots of top shelf drinks, but didn’t pay the bill, never mind tip his bartenders.\nDECEMBER 2009\nKnights Lose to Rutgers in St. Pete Bowl\nHopes were high that UCF would beat the Big East’s Rutgers in the St. Pete Bowl, and show the BCS conference it’s where we belong. But the game merely proved we couldn’t hang with the big boys. O’Leary even said he was embarrassed by the performance. QB Brett Hodges went out on a low note, and the man he replaced, Rob Calabrese, finished out the last game after Hodges took one too many hard hits. All in all, the Knights seemed to appreciate Hodges though, and at least he didn’t cry after losing — unlike the QB for that smaller university a little bit to our north.\nOur QB’s Don’t Cry, But Do They Drink and Drive?\nKyle Israel made headlines as UCF’s star Quarterback in 2007, when he led the Knights to a C-USA championship, and against Mississippi State in the Autozone Liberty Bowl. (Which we lost). But he also made headlines two years after his glory days ended — for being arrested on DUI charges near campus. UCF police made the bust, claiming he was twice the legal limit. Israel has declined comment.\nThe entire staff at KnightNews.com thanks all of you for your tremendous support this year.

The moment of transformation that’s taking place because the people of Egypt are calling for change.\n“And they’ve turned out in extraordinary numbers, representing all ages and all walks of life, but its young people who have been at the forefront. A new generation. Your generation, who want their voices to be heard. So going forward, we want those young people to know, and we want all Egyptians to know Americans will continue do everything that we can to support an orderly and genuine transition to democracy in Egypt.” \nThe movement means a lot to those in the UCF community with ties to Egypt and the middle east. \n\n“This all started with a man wanting his dignity and honor,” says Somaya Mellouli, a Norwegian born UCF Psych Major and US citizen whose family is from Tunisia. \nAfter burning himself in protest of the confiscation of his merchandise and the humiliation inflicted on him by a female municipal officer, Mohamed Bouaziz’s death on Dec 17th, 2010 sparked the Tunisian ‘Jasmine Revolution’ which spread to Egypt.

It is hard to believe, since we (in the USA) live with so much freedom especially freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. Also one thing we take for granted is the right to vote. Imagine living for 50 or so years under governments that are not accountable to anyone.”\nEgypt’s economy is another factor that has played a role in the uprising. About 40% of the people in Egypt live on less than $2 a day. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US aid after Israel. According to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Egypt has received $28billion in assistance since 1975. \nWhile these funds have been used for programs devoted to health, education and trade among other things, most US aid goes to Egypt’s military.

But I do talk to my family over there at least once a week and from what they tell me it has gotten a lot worse than when I was living there. It is not just the economy.

Some faculty tend to bring in things they have created and it’s been somewhere else,” Hernandez said. “We want to present something to the school and the public that has not been on show for five years, and mostly everything here is 2011, 2012.”\nThe Visual Arts department offers a variety of specialties apparent in the eclectic exhibit, which includes such art mediums as photography, digital print, painting, drawing, ceramics, 3D animation, and three different forms of sculpture. \n“This year we actually have one of the professors doing a performance piece, which is unusual, we don’t always have someone doing that so what we’ll do is they’re going to do the performance [at the opening], someone will be videotaping them and then we’ll have their performance piece looping on a TV,” Gallery Coordinator Diane Daugherty said.\nAssistant Professor Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz performed the piece throughout the opening event where she appeared in Victorian era clothing, sat on a throne with a costumed woman by her side and held a silver tray on her lap that was filled with trash.\nAlso looping on a television in a small makeshift theater is an animation piece called “Dentophobia” by Darlene Hadrika, with a musical score by Professor Stella Sung.\n“Darlene is putting on her own personal animation, written and completely generated by her own effort, which is pretty impressive,” Digital Media Instructor JoAnne Adams said about her coworker.\nAdams is also featuring work, including a three-piece set called “Earth Sky Series. “I had been doing some, I’ll call it digital collage, because I start with my own photography and then take the photographs apart and piece them together into a separate piece and play with space and interpretation of space,” Adams said.\nAdams earned a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts degree from the University of New Orleans and a Master’s of Fine Arts from the University of Florida. She started teaching at UCF in 2008, after working as a professional artist for years. “I have always wanted to be a teacher and I got my BFA and started working right away as an artist and had a really nice career at Disney in feature animation\nfor 15 years and so, saved up enough money to go back and get my MFA,” Adams said. “I always wanted to give back.”\nDaugherty said that professors have a duty to exhibit their work to students at the gallery.\n“I see it as a responsibility on the professors part, because they are professional artists therefore they should be creating as a professional artist,” Daugherty said. “By presenting your work you are showing your students this is what a professional artist does.”\nAbout 200 people attended the exhibit’s opening reception, including Israel Perez, an art student who has taken classes with featured faculty including\nInstructor Matt Dombrowski and Associate Professor Scott F. Hall. Perez favored a sculpture by Assistant Professor David Isenhour called “The Better to See You With.” “I really like the plan, the form, how the pedestal is dripping with paint,” he said.\nHernandez also commented on the sculpture. “It’s this piece that you want it to come to life and you’re staring at these eyeballs and foam and you’re just staring waiting for one of them to twitch and if you stare at it long enough you might think it does,” Hernandez said. “It’s this dark, cynical piece that you can’t help but appreciate.”\nAlthough visitors admire the exhibit, Daugherty said that because of a lack of funding, the gallery has made cut backs that affect the quality of their shows. About three months ago they had to let their art specialist go because they lacked funding for the full time position.\nThe gallery is funded by donations and partly through the Jenkins Family Foundation.\n“It was set up in 1986 to help UCF fund, focus on art, art therapy, art administration, and art education,” Daugherty said.\nBecause their budget does not allow for a full staff, the gallery relies on volunteers like Alison Yorinks and Kayla Robinson. During two and a half to three hour shifts, three times a week, these volunteers contribute by greeting guests, completing data entry projects, and answering phones. Other duties include hanging artwork, labeling, archiving, and maintaining the gallery walls.\n“It’s very informative, more so this year,” Yorinks said. “We are getting more experienced with gallery tasks.” Yorinks, a senior interdisciplinary major has volunteered since her junior year and recommends that students visit the gallery. “It’s free to anyone, you don’t have to be a student,” Yorinks said. “You never know what you’ll find here.”\nThe exhibition runs through Nov. 16, and the gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.', 'SGA, LGBTQ Services and the Multicultural Student Center hosted “An Evening with Kate Bornstein” last night in honor of LGBTQ History Month at UCF. \nThe event, one of several in October, marks the first year that the history month has been organized university-wide. It allowed students to join the acclaimed author in her discussion on gender expression, identity and sexual orientation.\nThe event was open to the public, and students and faculty alike met in the UCF Pegasus Ballroom as the speaker gave her presentation, titled “World Peace Through Gender Anarchy and Sex Positivity.”\n“My students are counselors in training, and they are going to be exposed to very different world views throughout their careers,” said Dr. Sejal Barden, an Assistant Professor in the UCF Department of Educational and Human Sciences. “I thought Kate would be a great person for my class to see and learn from about the topics she’ll be addressing.”\nBornstein, author of Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women, and The Rest of Us, underwent a male-to-female sex change after being raised a Jewish male that identified herself more as female individual, though she did not fully identify as being female either. Bornstein now speaks at universities and workshops nationwide about why gender binary is incorrect, the belief that individuals must identify as either male or female.\n“Kate’s theories are being taught in many gender studies and courses because she’s been so impactful in challenging people to think about gender in a way that’s not so black and white,” said David Moran, Graduate Coordinator for the UCF Student Outreach Services. “I think it’s important we bring philosophers to UCF test the way we approach life beyond, say, MTV. That stuff is fun too, but I think Kate can help UCF students think about who they really want to be.”\n“I’ve been suicidal six times in my life, but this is what kept me alive,” said Bornstein in regards to her third book, 101 Alternatives to Suicide for Teens, Freaks, and Other Outlaws. “Viewing gender as an “either/or” approach is a magnet for bullying. Who says we have to be one of the two?”\nBornstein also spoke on topics including the keys to make life worth living, which she described as identity, desire and power, and the queer theory, the idea that a person can be more than one gender identity at the same time.\n“For a long time, people like us have been left out,” said Bornstein. “If you would bring us into the coalition of margins, I promise we’d be the fun ones.”\n“When I saw the email that UCF would be hosting a trans-gender author, I knew this would be an amazing learning opportunity,” said Stephanie Worley, 22, a UCF English Literature major. “I think every student should just grab a friend, get out of bed, and come to educational events like this at UCF. If you don’t like it, then leave. But Kate was delightful.”\nFor more information about the event, or for information about LGBTQ History Month at UCF, please visit ucf.edu/lgbtq.', 'UCF has confirmed that Mr. Robert Ashely, UCF Rosen College’s first-ever faculty member, has passed away.\nUCF Today reports that Ashley, who taught food service education at UCF for nearly 30 years, passed away at the age of 65, this Friday, after suffering fibrosis of the lung.\n\nMichael Weiss, Assistant Director of Public Relations for UCF’s Rosen College of Hospitality Managementtold us that Rosen College will be hosting an on-campus memorial service for late Robert Ashley this Thursday, Oct. 25, from 3:30-5:00 p.m. at the Darden Auditorium.\nDonna Ashley, his wife, told the Orlando Sentinel that Ashley fell ill after returning from a cruise last month. She also said the family does not plan a funeral but instead will donate his body to UCF’s medical college.\nStudents expressed thoughts and condolances over social media sites like Facebook and Twitter saying things such as “RIP Professor Ashley” (\u200f@alissamanion), “So sad to hear… He was a great professor” (@Bri_Moore407) and “Rosen Kiddos, you’re not gonna believe it. Prof. Ashley died. So young. #rip #favoriteprofessor” (@jaimista)\nAshley is survived by a daughter, Shannon Ashley; sister, Johanna Cyr; and brother, David Ashley.', 'On Monday, the Student Labor Action Project had scheduled an open discussion in the Student Union for students to discuss and question SGA President Cortez Whatley about the 15 percent hike on tuition. Over 25 students from VOX, NOW, Amnesty International, Student Disability Services and Campus Peace Action showed up to attend the discussion.\nThe forum had originally been scheduled for 12 pm in the Pegasus Ballroom BC, then was changed to room 228 A. Shortly after hearing of a room change, Whatley canceled the meeting 45 minutes before it was scheduled to start, but hesitantly rescheduled to commence an hour later after SLAP members and students spent an hour convincing Whatley to commence with the originally scheduled meeting.\n“This meeting was never specifically about Cortez, we wanted to address Cortez because of actions and the power he has as the one student voice on the board of governors, and he did vote to increase tuition,” said Haley Cavataro, SLAP member, English major.\nShe continues, “He fought to increase tuition, maximum percent, 15, and as the Student Labor Action Project, and also as students who pay tuition at this school, and feel that burden, we are very well aware of the effect that tuition rising has on students.”\nCavataro said the purpose of the meeting was to sit down with students and Cortez to propose “clear cut solutions where tuition hikes are unacceptable”.\nSGA’s Public Relations Coordinator Oluwafunlola Falade told SLAP the reason for the cancelation was due to a mess up with Cortez’s schedule, and that they didn’t agree with the set up of an open forum, but then proposed a solution to hold a campus wide event.', 'As soon as Knightly News appeared with a camera, and students were beginning to show up in protest of the cancellation, Falade delivered news that the meeting would continue as scheduled, but with only a select few of students, specifically members of SLAP.\n“He’s a fellow student, it shouldn’t be that hard to get to meet with him, a leader is supposed to be easily accessible to students, an SGA leader especially,” said Luis Lopez, double major in Political Science and history.\nLopez expressed that the student government does not represent the student body, and he is frustrated with the lack of interest the SGA has done with engaging with students, considering this would make the second time the SGA has canceled a meeting due to schedule conflicts.\n“He doesn’t have the decency as a representative of students to come and say to his fellow students ‘I cant make it to this meeting’, instead, he sends a PR person to talk to us and to defend him at all costs, because that’s his job, its an insult to students,” Lopez said.\nFalade also told students that the SGA did not like the flyers for the event.\nThe flyer features a center image of Whatley with the following text: “Your president was the deciding vote to raise your tuition 15 % for the 4th year in a row, We deserve to know why, Join SLAP October 22”.\n“We didn’t think it was professionally done. I didn’t think it was necessarily top notch quality, if you guys wanted an image, I feel as if maybe I could have found somebody to have assimilated an image around you guys,” Falade said. He continues on that the quote regarding the deciding vote was not entirely accurate.\n“Right now, we’re at $1000 more than we were paying in 2007, it’s ridiculous. I’m studying to be a teacher, I’m not going to make that much money, I shouldn’t have to pay so much money for a job I’m not going to make much money doing,” said Stu Kalver, 23, English major.\nWith UCF topping a little over 60,000 students, Kalver says UCF has made an extra $60,000,000, “bleeding all the students dry, putting TV’s in the Student Union, where they really don’t need TV’s”.\nKalver is concerned with where his extra tuition money is going. He is seeing less and less classes being taught in classrooms, but being diverted to online classes. \n\nSLAP members and students were eventually invited to discuss the discrepancy of the scheduled meetings in the SGA office, after students protested to the SGA’s attempt to limit the meeting to only five representatives of SLAP.\n“It was a forum, in my opinion, a very isolated, distinct part of the student body,” Whatley said.\nWhatley told SLAP they should have sent him an agenda so they would be adequately prepared to address students’ needs.\nStudents proposed again to move the meeting from the SGA office to room 228 A upon handing Whatley the agenda for him to review.\n“It is not in our best interest, on both parties, to take this and do this right now, if we’re to move this to a later date and hold it to a broader audience, this is an issue that’s not just related to the members in this room here, to you guys as students, but to obviously the entire student population,” Whatley said.\nThis isn’t the entire student body, he said, this is a select group of students that is part of the student body.\nWhatley finally agreed to proceed with the discussion in room 228A after he was told the meeting was not about bashing him, but merely voicing their concerns.\nHowever, the meeting was cut short to 30 minutes.\nAt the meeting, students shared their personal stories regarding how they already struggle to pay for tuition, and the rise in tuition will only cause more financial burden not only on them, but their families as well; and that education is a right no matter the socioeconomical background of a student or where they come from.\n“I voted in the way that I did because it was the best for our institution the best for our current students, and students to come after us,” Whatley said. He continues with a story about a student he met that was working and paying her way through school and would rather pay more to take the classes she needs in order to not delay her graduation.\n“Just to put it in the magnitude of the cut, 52 million is about equivalent than the operations of our two largest colleges,” Whatley said regarding Governor Rick Scott’s $1.3 billion cut on the state’s education last year.\nWhatley said that the cuts would not have affected majors that are stem majors, but rather programs such as social sciences and liberal arts. These cuts reduce the amount of available classes and professors, therefore delaying graduation.\nAt the end of the meeting, students proposed to Whatley to join the national organization the United States Student Association. The USSA is an organization comprised of and led by students, and in October 2011 it was selected as the organization to represent the student voice. According to the USSA, it has lobbied to protect the Pell grant, and increase funding, they helped to introduce “The Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012” with Congressman Hansen Clark which created a 10-10 standard for student loan forgiveness as well as capping Federal student loan interest at 3.4 percent.\nWhatley said he would have to review the pros and cons of the organization before making the decision to join the USSA.\nSLAP will continue to gather petition signatures to get the USSA on the ballot.\n“He really turned this into a much bigger ordeal than it needed to be, we just wanted to have a discussion,” said Paul Thurston, public relations coordinator for SLAP.\nThurston said he didn’t think Whatley answered any of the student’s questions, instead continued to blame the legislatures, Gov. Scott, and the people who took our reserves.\n“He has the power to call for this referendum, we have to get 2,000 signatures to get this on our ballot as a student body, he could do it with two-thirds the majority in the senate, he has the power to do this, so whether he chooses to or not is on him, but we’re going to go forward and we’re going to get this done,” Thurston said.']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/10/ucf-art-gallery-hosts-annual-faculty-exhibit/'],"['The University of Central Florida’s Art Gallery began its annual Faculty Exhibition on Thursday.\nThe exhibit features the work of about 30 faculty members from the School of Visual Arts and Design and allows students and the local community to learn about the professional abilities of UCF’s staff.\n“Artwork, for anyone, is a depth of soul,” Collections Manager Kayla Hernandez said. “To be able to get a perspective of your professor or faculty member that’s not figurative, that’s not that person standing in front of you, to be able to see how they think and their process, it does help develop that relationship.”\nThe gallery accepts art from any faculty member that is interested in submitting a piece, and the only requirement is that the work has not been shown the past five years.\n“We just wanted a fresher body of work.

Drew Brees, Tom Brady, and Aaron Rodgers combined for 7 interceptions and just 2 touchdowns this week. Meanwhile, rookies Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck both led their teams to impressive come-from-behind victories in the 4th quarter. Week 14 is the beginning of the playoffs for most teams, and if you need a replacement for an injured starter, these players might help you win your matchup.\nLast Week’s Picks:\nColin Kaepernick, 49ers- 14 points\nAlthough Kaepernick probably lost the game for the 49ers this week, Coach Harbaugh announced Monday that he will remain the starter. Even after a terrible game, he still finished with more points than Brady or Brees this week, because of his running abilities.\nKnowshon Moreno, Broncos- 7 points\nHe carried the ball 20 times for only 69 yards against the Bucs, but he got the majority of touches at running back for the Broncos and is still worth starting. He should put up better numbers this week against a weak Raiders run defense, and is definitely still worth starting.\nBeanie Wells, Cardinals- 2 points\nIt doesn’t get much worse than 15 carries for 22 yards. He’s still worth keeping on your roster, in case you lose a starting running back, but don’t bother starting him unless you need to.\nMichael Bush, Bears- 3 points\nMatt Forte was still able to start, despite injury, leaving Bush in a limited role. He’s worth stashing on your bench if you have room still.\nDanario Alexander, Chargers- 10 points\nDX led all Chargers receivers with 6 catches for 106 yards, like he has since being signed with the team. Keep an eye on Vincent Brown, who could steal targets if he returns this season. Keep him in your lineup for now.\nMohamad Sanu, Bengals- 0 points\nHe injured his foot in practice, and is out for the season.\nJets D/ST- 11 points\nCardinals D/ST- 18 points\nThis Week’s Pickups:\nQuarterbacks:\nRussell Wilson, Seahawks (17% owned)\nThe guy named after 2 budget-priced athletic wear brands is really silencing critics after a slow start to the season. He’s actually the only quarterback with at least 15 points in his last 5 starts. I still wouldn’t bench Brady, Brees, or Rodgers for him, but he has a couple great matchups coming up against the Cardinals, Bills, and Rams if you’re in need of a quarterback.\nTim Tebow, Jets (10% owned)\nAfter the benching of Mark Sanchez last week, Rex Ryan refused to name a starting quarterback for the Jets for Week 14. This is something to keep an eye on because Tebow puts up a lot of fantasy points with his legs. My best guess is that McIlroy will probably get the start. This is a huge longshot, so only pick him up if you really have an extra spot.\nRunning Backs:\nMontell Owens, Jaguars (0% owned)\nOwens carried the load for Jacksonville after starting running back Rashad Jennings, who had 8 carries for 20 yards, left the game with a concussion. Owens finished with a slightly better stat line- 7 carries for 29 yards. He’s in line to get the start at home this week vs. the Jets if Jennings can’t pass his concussion tests, and if Maurice Jones-Drew is unable to play yet again. Montell is owned in less leagues than Terrell Owens (0.2%), who was cut by the Seahawks preseason.\nJustin Forsett, Texans (1% owned)\nForsett got the same number of touches as Foster (14) against the Titans Sunday, and many of them were in the first half. Could the 11-1 Texans be resting their superstar for the playoffs? This is definitely something to keep an eye on.\nWide Receiver:\nChris Givens, Rams (3% owned)\nI actually picked him up Sunday morning, put him in my lineup, and then dropped him for some Vikings guy that only scored one point. Always follow your gut instinct!\nGolden Tate, Seahawks (10% owned)\nThe Notre Dame alumnus has 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games, and at least fantasy 15 points in 3 of those games. With Russell Wilson getting better every week at quarterback, the Seahawks receivers are definitely increasing in value.\nTight End:\nBrandon Myers, Raiders (22% owned)\nAny tight end with 14 catches for 130 yards and a touchdown needs to be owned and started in every league. Especially because he has 5 touchdowns in his last 5 games. And take a look at his remaining schedule: Broncos, Chiefs, Panthers, Chargers. Carson Palmer will be throwing a lot, and he seems to like Myers as his favorite target.\nDallas Clark, Bucs (5% owned)\nHe’s scored a touchdown in 3 of his last 4 games, and the game he didn’t score he had 68 yards receiving. If you’re in a squeeze for a tight end, he’s not a bad pickup.\nDefense:\nChargers (29% owned), vs. Steelers\nIf Big Ben is still out, you have to like the Chargers D here. Last time they played against a backup quarterback, it was the Chiefs on a Thursday night, and they scored 26.\nDolphins (16% owned) vs. 49ers\nThe Dolphins held Tom Brady to just one touchdown last week. This is Thomas Brady we’re talking about here, not Mark Sanchez. They should do well against rookie Colin Kaepernick this week.\nOther Notes:\nLeSean McCoy is in stage 3 out of 4 in his recovery from a Week 11 concussion. Bryce Brown remains a top 10 running back play in McCoy’s absence, so owners of both players should keep an eye on the news.\nLions WR Ryan Broyles is out for the season with a torn ACL. This could mean an increased role for newly acquired WR Mike Thomas, or perhaps an unbenching of Titus Young. Lions WR Calvin Johnson is also on pace to break Jerry Rice’s record for receiving yards in a season, and has 140+ yards receiving in his last 4 games. I guess there’s no Madden curse after all.\nAndy Reid announced Monday that the Eagles will stick with QB Nick Foles for the remainder of the season, so it’s safe to drop Michael Vick.', 'The Wave is 2008 German film directed by\xa0Dennis Gansel\xa0and starring\xa0Jürgen Vogel,\xa0Frederick Lau,\xa0Jennifer Ulrich\xa0and\xa0Max Riemelt\xa0in the leads. It is based on\xa0Ron Jones‘\xa0social experiment\xa0The Third Wave.\nThe Wave is an eye opening movie that teaches the world a great lesson. The movie takes place in modern day Germany and is based off a true story. A teacher (Reiner) at a high school originally wants to teach an anarchy class during project week. He is influential and popular among the students and an anarchist himself. Instead of anarchy he ends up teaching the autocracy class which is slightly less popular because all the German students are fed up with hearing about dictatorships because of what Hitler did and claim that it could never happen in Germany again.\nDue to the students claim, Reiner decides to run an experiment on the class, turning the class room into a mini dictatorship with the main message being unity is power. The first thing Reiner implements is discipline; he tells students they have to sit with perfect posture and stand up to speak. Next, he changed the seating arrangement so that all the people with bad grades sat next to the people with good grades and told them to help each other. He also has students march in unity in order to bother the anarchy class and make their class seem cooler.\nAfter adding these benefits to the class room, the class grew more popular and more students wanted to join. Now that students liked the class they could be influenced more. The teacher then implements uniforms, a logo, and even a hand gesture to symbolize a wave motion. As the unity of the class grows it starts effecting the student’s and teacher’s outside lives by ruining relationships and starting fights. Some people in the class really start taking to the class while others that didn’t want to wear the uniform or weren’t in the class are being ostracized.\nFinally, things start getting really out of hand when Reiner calls a meeting at the auditorium claiming that the Wave will roll over Germany and take over the world. During his speech Reiner starts to understand that things are going to far and calls off the Wave and thats when tragedy strikes and the students realize they became the monsters they said they never would.\nTo read about the experiment click here.', 'UCF President John C. Hitt and SGA President Cortez Whatley, along with presidents from other Florida universities, will meet for a conference in Tallahassee on Wednesday to propose a plan for Florida lawmakers about funding higher education in the upcoming session\nDuring last week’s SGA Senate meeting, Whatley announced that the State University System would not be increasing tuition. \nPresidents from various colleges around Florida planning to attend the event include: Eric Barron (FSU), Judy Bense (UWF), John Delaney (UNF), Judy Genshaft (USF), John Hitt (UCF),  Bernie Machen (UF),  Donal O’Shea (New College), Larry Robinson (FAMU) and student leaders from across the State University System\nUCF’s tuition was raised the maximum 15% this past year after Whatley voted for the hike. He claimed that the tuition increase was necessary to retain certain majors and classes after a $50 million budget cut to the school. Questions arose surrounding UCF’s large financial reserves  as well as recent raises for the UCF President.\nIt appears now that the Florida University system is teaming up to support funding for higher education and stop the massive budget cuts the state is relaying onto the universities. Exactly how they propose to do this, however, remains uncertain at this time.\nThe conference is scheduled for Wednesday at 10 a.m. Check back for updates following the event.', 'Stereo IQ is a crowd-sourced lyrics website set to be released soon, and is poised to be the standard for lyrics in pop and rock music.\nAlex Koenig, one of its two founders, is a senior studying journalism at the University of Central Florida, with a minor in creative writing. Stereo IQ’s Facebook page boasts more than 3,700 likes, and although the site is not ready yet, it’s already building a following. Stereo IQ’s Twitter page has over 2,000 followers, and its profile describes it as “rapgenius.com – except we explain the lyrics of rock ‘n’ roll and pop music.”\nRap Genius was started in October of 2009 by three Yale graduates, with the purpose of critiquing rap as poetry and explaining its lyrics. Instead of their team doing the lyric explanations however, they created a formula similar to that of Wikipedia’s, whereas any user with an account could explain a line.\nThis crowd sourced model proved to be an innovation in the right direction for a lyrics website, and Rap Genius has earned over 10 million unique visitors per month.\nFor every explanation that gets good ratings from peers and editors, users get points added to their “Rap IQ.” Rap Genius is already considered the authority by avid hip hop listeners. Cesar Martinez, a junior studying business at Florida International University, is a hip hop aficionado who regularly checks out the lyrics of his favorite artists, including Kendrick Lamar and Curren$y.\n“Rap songs are difficult to understand sometimes, and this Wikipedia model has really proven itself, I’m looking forward to Stereo IQ covering every genre,” Martinez said.\nAlex Koenig, along with Tomi Fischer, began to build up the rock and pop database on Rap Genius in April of 2012, and have a system in place so that they will be able to transfer the lyrics to their new website when it is ready.\nAndreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm based in California, announced it will invest $15 million in Rap Genius, a landmark investment in the future of crowd sourced lyrics. A portion of the investment will be granted to Stereo IQ.\n“They wanted to turn Rap Genius into the ‘Internet Talmud,’ and to do that they obviously want to do more than just hip hop, so some of that money is going toward Stereo IQ,” Koenig said.\nRap Genius has 56 moderators, about 500 editors, and has had over 250,000 people submit explanations. Stereo IQ currently has only 60 consistent editors.\nNonetheless they produce a large volume of content consistently.\n“We try to bring something different to the music game by offering different features centered on lyrics as opposed to just music, so we’re trying to distinguish ourselves in that sense,” Koenig said.\nStereo IQ’s content is not limited to lyric explanations however, which captured the attention of the “internet newspaper” the Huffington Post. The Huffington Post now hosts a blog for Stereo IQ, where they post guides to albums, editorial pieces, top lyrics of the week, interviews, amongst other things. Stereo IQ’s reach through the Huffington\nPost, Twitter, Facebook, and Rap Genius is wide, all in anticipation of the site’s launch. Another site like Stereo IQ will be released soon as well, but dedicated to poetry, calling itself Poetry Brain. Users on Rap Genius have already expressed support for Stereo IQ and Poetry Brain, and have begun to contribute even before the sites are released.\nRap Genius has a signature venn diagram, with its logo sitting in the middle of three circles labeled rap lyrics, Wikipedia, and Urban Dictionary. Urban Dictionary is a massively popular website dedicated to defining terms unique to the modern era, and has become a reliable resource for street slang.\nStereo IQ’s venn diagram has a silver Q sitting in the middle three circles labeled sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll.', 'A speaker hosted at UCF continues to cause student uproar over the comments he made about the Jewish state of Israel and its people.\nOn Nov. 17, the Ahlul-Bayt Islamic Society invited Sheikh Jaffer Ladak to UCF to speak on Islam and Anthropology, however, he was caught on camera saying, what appears to be, anti-semitic comments made about Jewish people–relating them to Neanderthals and people from Mars. \n“The Ahlul Bayt Society is committed to freedom of thought, speech and robust discussion,” the Ahlul Bayt organization told KnightNews.com. “The views of the speaker are not necessarily reflective of our views, and we find the comments in question to be in poor taste, yet we enshrine the constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression.”\nThe group also told us ” We believe his [Sheikh Jaffar Ladak] comments were taken out of context by an individual who has a history of misconstruing the views of Muslims, on and off campus.”\nStudents have asked UCF to get involved and take appropriate actions towards the group. Many just wish to get more information from the group and UCF as to why this speaker was allowed to speak at UCF and why no student or faculty member stood up to the anti-semetic remarks.\nGrant Heston, UCF’s Associate Vice President of Communications & Public Affairs gave us UCF’s view of the situation as it stands.\n“It is important to know that a student group’s invitation to a speaker does not mean the university endorses the speaker’s background or comments,” Heston said. “Rather, it means the university supports students’ rights to free speech and an open exchange of ideas.”\nThe speaker was not invited by UCF nor paid for by SGA.

KnightNews.com sought out different opinions on the subject from students who all shared their views.\nMelissa Colon:\nGun control will not lead to a decrease in murders. Instead it will tighten the noose that the government already has tied around us. Just as the so-called war on drugs has not minimized drug usage, but has cost taxpayers over $1 billion annually to imprison pot offenders while our government hands over guns to Mexican cartels. A war declared by Reagan despite his approval to use drug traffickers to transport illegal arms into Nicaragua that resulted in an increase in the cocaine trade in California. The belief that gun control will stop mass murder, is just as naïve as believing that banning abortion will stop the practice of abortions.\nWhile many will choose to point fingers only at the Obama administration, or the Bush administration, the media and the\xa0government have succeeded in dividing us into left and right- literally. To believe that gun rights are our only rights being stripped away, we have failed to look closely at laws being passed or that have passed under the guise to protect our freedom. When organizing a protest gets you listed as a domestic terrorist, such as the case of Occupy Wall Street organizer Shannon McLeish from Daytona Beach, Florida, you should stop and wonder if gun rights are the only issue we should be worried about.\nLastly, we have become so distracted that we fail to notice how the shooters become celebrities. Our fascination with stardom feeds another fame-starved individual who watches, plots, and relies on the media to make them a star. Just as reality television stars are overnight celebrities, so is the shooter. Suddenly, everyone is in shock and affected by the death of innocent school children. While each shooting is a tragedy, many have forgotten that it is happening everyday at our expense like the $3 trillion that American taxpayers give to Israel annually to supply them with weapons to shoot Palestinian children throwing rocks. Somewhere along the way we are taught that we can justify and differentiate the act of killing another human even if it is someone else pulling the trigger.\nEvan Gregory:\nMy response to the proposed gun control plan goes as follows: banning guns such as the AR-15 on the basis of name or design will only lead to gun manufacturers designing different guns. Not\xa0only that, but this does not account for the fact that there are millions of guns of those types in circulation and are readily accessible if you have the money. The most annoying thing on this list of proposed measures has to be reducing clip size to a ten-bullet maximum. Do legislatures not realize that reloading a gun however many\xa0more times will not stop anybody from shooting anything up once they’ve decided that they are going to go through with it? I think hiking the price on ammunition would do a lot more help then adjusting the capacity at which you could carry it.\nI believe it is integral for everyone in America to own some kind of weapon in this day and age for his or her own protection. Regardless of whether you’re for or against any kind of gun legislature, the 10 minutes you spend waiting for the police to respond to your 911 call when 3 armed men barge into your house with illegally obtained weapons could mean life or death for your family. When the forefathers drafted the constitution, I’m sure they didn’t intend every single citizen to have rocket propelled grenades in their closets waiting to blow up anything in their way, but they did realize that at the end of the day, in the face of tyrannical government, it was the people’s responsibility to join in arms against the types of government that existed in the Revolution that brought about this country. I can guarantee that nobody thought in a million years that Caesar would march his armies over the Rhine to become the sole leader of Rome in 49 BCE, but there was no one to stop him once he did.\nTake a country like Switzerland for example that despite two world wars and many sweeping religious changes has maintained its sovereignty with such volatile neighbors as Spain, France, and Italy. Despite the Russians and Nazi’s sweeping through Europe in the 30’s and 40’s it’s not certain to many people why they didn’t get swept up in the campaign trail during World War II. This is because their militia involves every man in the country and the citizens are armed and trained to defend the homeland on a second’s notice. The problem with our second amendment isn’t the fact that it allows everyone to own any kind of weapon they can buy; the problem exists because we only follow the guidelines of this to a point, highlighting only the final sentence of the second most important amendment of them all, the amendment that makes sure the government will continue to honor our first.\nSo to those of you blaming Sandy Hook on the fact that Adam Lanza was able to get his hands on an AR-15 and impose his will on those children need to realize that it is his mom’s fault for not properly storing her firearm to NRA guidelines.

Rejecting arguments from political leaders such as Attorney General Pam Bondi, who\xa0challenged the bill summary arguing that its language would mislead voters into allowing a widespread use of marijuana in Florida, the court decided it’s legal to put the question to voters.\nJustices Barbara Pariente, Fred Lewis, Peggy Quince and James Perry ruled in favor of the medical marijuana\xa0amendment. \xa0Chief Justice Ricky Polston, Justices Charles Canady and Jorge Labarga voted in favor of striking the medical marijuana amendment from the ballot.\n“I agree with Chief Justice Polston and Justice Labarga that the proposed amendment should be denied placement on the ballot because the ballot summary is clearly and conclusively misleading. One of the most important rights enjoyed by the people of Florida under our constitution is the right to vote on constitutional amendments proposed through the initiative process. That right and the initiative process are subverted when the voters are presented a misleading ballot summary,” Justice Canady said during the hearing.\nHowever, even with dissenting opinions from Canady, Polston and Labarga, the Supreme Court came to the final decision of placing the medical marijuana amendment on the ballot.\n“We conclude that the proposed amendment has a logical and natural oneness of purpose—namely, whether Floridians want a provision in the state constitution authorizing the medical use of marijuana, as determined by a licensed Florida physician, under Florida law,” the court majority wrote.\nElections supervisors certified that the medical marijuana petition reached 710,508 signatures more than the 683,149 needed for it to reach the ballot.', 'The restaurant that former UCF quarterback Daunte Culpepper helped open in August of 2013 has closed its doors, according to Brandon Helwig of UCF.rivals.com.\nCulpepper’s, which was located on University Boulevard had a UCF theme.

', 'There’s been a lot of questions surrounding the proposed downtown campus, and officials at the University of Central Florida attempted to answer some an open forum Wednesday afternoon. \nUCF was given the green light for the project from the Florida Board of Governors last month. They gave the okay for $2.77 million from the Legislature to allow UCF to continue planning the campus.\nPaul Lartonoix, assistant vice provost, and Fred Kittinger, associate vice president for university relations gave an update:\n– UCF is looking into having Google buses, with Wi-Fi in bus, for students to be able to work on projects during their commute.\n– The programs moving downtown will be finalized later this spring. For now the potential\xa0programs include: Visual Arts/Digital Media & Studio Arts, Health and Public Affairs, WUCF Public TV & Radio, and the Nicholson School of Communication.\n–\xa0There is the possibility of intramural sports, a recreation and wellness center, and the Burnett Honors College at the downtown campus.\n– UCF is projecting\xa0to begin the master planning concept with architects\xa0this summer, start construction of Phase I and II in July 2016 for the anticipated opening of\xa0July\xa02017.\nStudents raised concerns of a disconnect between the two campuses. A major part of the undergraduate experience is\xa0football season, which student who are downtown would need to then commute to.\xa0According to Lartonoix, it will be beneficial\xa0in the sense that students are commuting\xa0back to main campus and everything will be going\xa0back to UCF’s main hub.\nAs for the Greek community, that remains to be seen. So far, that has not been a major part of the planning process for the downtown campus.\n“We don’t have a Greek section on the map but I guess we’ll have to figure that out,” Lartonoix said.\nAnother topic that was raised was Student Government’s role and presence downtown. Kittinger said that at Arizona State, that\xa0has a successful downtown campus, student government leaders are selected for each\xa0branch campus but that SGA would need to decide what model would be best for our community.\nChristine Dellert, senior director of internal communications at UCF, said that university officials and community partners are meeting weekly to continue the planning process, despite state funding not being guaranteed yet.\n\xa0', 'Big Sean will be coming to Orlando this Sunday, March 22, having just released his new album Dark Sky Paradise.\nThe concert will take place at Venue 578 (formerly Firestone Live), with doors opening at 7:00 p.m. and the show starting at 8:00 p.m. This is an all ages show and tickets can be purchased at online.\nBig Sean is a hip-hop artist currently signed to GOOD Music who has been releasing a steady stream of albums and mixtapes for over 10 years now.

Dylan Moore, Tommy Williams and Woods ran in the first scores of the game following a homer from Williams.\nThe 4th inning totaled 5 runs, improving the score to 8-0 in favor of UCF. Bethune-Cookman responded with three runs at the bottom of the 5th but would be outdone by UCF’s five runs in the next two frames. The Wildcats fought back at the bottom of the 8th with their seven run inning and three runs in the ninth. An attempted repeat of the 8th inning for the Wildcats fell short to end the game 18-13, UCF.\nSecond baseman Kam Gellinger recorded 5 RBI’s before the game’s end, trailed by Tommy Williams’ 4 RBI’s and home run. Williams went 6 for 7 at the plate and earned two doubles on his career-high 6 hits, tying a 17-year-old record made by Eric Riggs, in 1998 versus Stetson, when UCF was still referred to as The Golden Knights. Seniors Erik Barber and JoMarcos Woods joined Williams in their home runs, with 5 RBI’s for the pair.\nUCF’s batting lineup has notched two grand slams and 30 home runs this season, powering the Knights forward in their No. 7 ranking, according to Baseball America. The Black and Gold have peaked at No. 6 in the rankings, the highest ever for the program. Following the weekend sweep against Fairfield, UCF ranked first in home runs (27) and slugging percentages (.536), and ranked second and third in batting averages (.331) and runs total (171), respectively.\n“Over the course of a 56-game regular season, every team in the country is going to go through highs and lows and ups and downs. Right now, our offense is incredible and is doing a terrific job this season,” said head coach Terry Rooney. “Our pitching [has been] struggling over the past couple of games, but we are going to get better.

She told deputies she was approached by a man who grabbed her and forced her to the ground. He then partially disrobed her and exposed himself while holding her down, deputies said.\nShe cried for help and the unidentified suspect fled and has not been found by deputies.  \nThe man is described as having close-cut brown hair and a well-groomed beard. He is approximately 6′ tall with a thin build and is anywhere from 20-30 years old, deputies said. The man was last seen wearing a dark colored shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. \nOrange County deputies are asking for help identifying the suspect and are offering a reward of up to $1,000. \nThe 911 caller, who asked to keep his identity private as a safety precaution, explained that he heard screaming outside his home so he peered through his blinds and thought something was suspicious. Feeling guilty that he did not have a way to protect the victim, the resident called 911.\n“In the end she was not raped, fortunately,” he said. \nThe incident took place across the street from the University of Central Florida, however, students did not receive the usual UCF alert about the crime. \n“Although we are not required to send alerts about such off-campus crimes, we routinely do so as part of our commitment to help keep students safe,” UCF spokesperson Zenaida Gonzalez Kotala said. “An alert should have been sent last night given the nature of this crime. We continue to work with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office to ensure students are notified about off-campus crimes in a timely manner.”\nA neighborhood resident and UCF student, Danny Beebe expressed his concern after the incident.\n“Knowing that all of this is taking place right next to the school is pretty horrifying,” Beebe said.\nBeebe said he thinks the college students in the area are vulnerable and the lack of lighting in what students refer to as the “greek ghetto” makes matters worse. \nBoth the 911 caller and Beebe said they think more lighting on their dark streets would bring down the crime rate.\n“There’s a lot of dark areas,” Beebe said. “There’s a lot of students walking back in forth in this neighborhood and the streets are just not really safe.”\n—-\nOrange County spokeswoman Lourdes Clayton wouldn’t comment if the woman is a student at UCF because of the sensitive nature of the case. She said deputies are continuing to investigate the case and want to keep the woman’s identity private while the investigation continues. \nIf you have any information on this crime, call Crime Line at 407-423-8477. \nChristal Hayes contributed to this story.\nCheck back for updates on this breaking news story.', 'Have you ever dreamed of speaking at a TED Talk, or do you have an unhealthy addiction of binge watching them online?\nWell, mark your calendars because the Campus Activities Board is bringing TEDx to UCF on Saturday, April 11 at 1:15 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Business Administration room 119.\nAccording to Ryan Rasmussen, the Speakers director with CAB, speaker applications are available online at www.tedxucf.org, on the UCF CAB website, or on the UCF CAB mobile app and the deadline to apply is March 23 at 11:59 p.m. A selection committee will be in charge of choosing the 2015 speakers on March 25.

The only criteria to be a speaker are to be a UCF student and to have a great idea.\nLast year’s TEDxUCF hosted four student speakers covering a variety of topics from farming to cancer detection research. One was Afif Abu-Hanna, a premed student from Israel who had been researching a cancer detection device that would track chemicals in the human breath and confirm whether or not a cancer was present. This device is already functional in labs in Israel, detecting lung cancer specifically, but it has yet to be used in doctors’ offices. According to Abu-Hanna and his partner Professor Hossam Haick, it has a 92% chance of detecting lung cancer and accurately reporting it.\n“It’s not hopeless, we are making progress and it may be slow but we’re getting there, we’re going to win the fight eventually against cancer and against other diseases,” Abu-Hanna said.\nAccording to Abu-Hanna, his biggest challenge was putting his speech into terms that non-science majors would relate to, but with the help of his speech professor and mentor, Gino Perrotte, he was able to effectively tell his story.\n“Everyone who steps up on the podium is trying to tell their story. I think that’s the power behind TED Talks, it’s that it’s personal it’s not just statistics,” Abu-Hanna said.\nAnother was sophomore Alfredo Salkeld who spoke on the benefits of learning more about the food we consume, and his experience working on a local blueberry farm for a week.\nBitten by the travel bug, Salkeld said he googled “how to travel for cheap” and found a directory for farming opportunities called Woofing. Although the advertising major had never farmed before in his life, he emailed local farmers assuring them of his work ethic and eagerness to jump into a new challenge.\n“I think the idea of wanderlust is there no matter what age you are,” Salkeld said. “Sharing ideas makes people want to do more with their lives. It can be something really small. Even if just one person looks [Woofing] up, I made a difference.”\nThe travel theme continued with Hugo Cardona, a senior majoring in finance, centered his speech on the power of traveling and experiencing other cultures. He said that by putting himself in circumstances that push him out of his comfort zone, he’s able to grow as a person. Cardona who’s lived in six different countries said, “When it comes to TED talks you truly have to be passionate about what you’re talking about otherwise people won’t get the message.”\nLast year’s speakers director, Catherine Samarista said that all the speakers brought a lot of energy and passion to the table throughout the coaching sessions that they held.\n“You could almost feel the intensity in the room,” she said.\nSamarista, who won the 2013-2014 CAB speakers committee award, said she hopes to see the same intensity with this year’s speakers.']",['https://knightnews.com/2015/03/2nd-annual-ted-talks-coming-to-ucf-featuring-student-speakers/'],"['Have you ever dreamed of speaking at a TED Talk, or do you have an unhealthy addiction of binge watching them online?\nWell, mark your calendars because the Campus Activities Board is bringing TEDx to UCF on Saturday, April 11 at 1:15 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Business Administration room 119.\nAccording to Ryan Rasmussen, the Speakers director with CAB, speaker applications are available online at www.tedxucf.org, on the UCF CAB website, or on the UCF CAB mobile app and the deadline to apply is March 23 at 11:59 p.m. A selection committee will be in charge of choosing the 2015 speakers on March 25.

I think that’s the power behind TED Talks, it’s that it’s personal it’s not just statistics,” Abu-Hanna said.\nAnother was sophomore Alfredo Salkeld who spoke on the benefits of learning more about the food we consume, and his experience working on a local blueberry farm for a week.\nBitten by the travel bug, Salkeld said he googled “how to travel for cheap” and found a directory for farming opportunities called Woofing. Although the advertising major had never farmed before in his life, he emailed local farmers assuring them of his work ethic and eagerness to jump into a new challenge.\n“I think the idea of wanderlust is there no matter what age you are,” Salkeld said. “Sharing ideas makes people want to do more with their lives. It can be something really small. Even if just one person looks [Woofing] up, I made a difference.”\nThe travel theme continued with Hugo Cardona, a senior majoring in finance, centered his speech on the power of traveling and experiencing other cultures. He said that by putting himself in circumstances that push him out of his comfort zone, he’s able to grow as a person. Cardona who’s lived in six different countries said, “When it comes to TED talks you truly have to be passionate about what you’re talking about otherwise people won’t get the message.”\nLast year’s speakers director, Catherine Samarista said that all the speakers brought a lot of energy and passion to the table throughout the coaching sessions that they held.\n“You could almost feel the intensity in the room,” she said.\nSamarista, who won the 2013-2014 CAB speakers committee award, said she hopes to see the same intensity with this year’s speakers.']"

New details released in the incident report and 911 call say the victim had to fight the man off, and the suspect committed a sex act in her presence, leaving evidence on her and her vehicle.\nThe woman, who is not a UCF student, told police she was walking to get something out of her friend’s car in Garage D when she felt someone behind her. When she turned around, she saw a man was standing behind her exposing and touching himself through the zipper of his jeans, the incident report said.\n\nThe woman yelled “get off me” and grabbed the man by the shirt to push him away, the report said.\xa0Police said evidence of the sex crime was found on the woman’s skin, clothes\xa0and her vehicle.\nThe man ran off and got into a blue or gray minivan. The man’s van was caught on surveillance footage while he was traveling along Gemini Boulevard.\xa0The suspect is\xa0described as a white man about 20 years old with dark brown hair, police said.\nSpokeswoman for UCF Police Courtney Gilmartin said the UCF alert didn’t include these details because they were trying to get out the information as quickly as possible. She said the investigation is still ongoing and police are continuing to work with the victim, who wasn’t injured in the incident. \nThe victim talked to WKMG Local 6 and told them she thought she was going to be raped, and she was outraged when she found out UCF didn’t have cameras in the garage.\nKnightNews.com has been following UCF student Ryan McKinney’s plea for more cameras in garages. He appeared in front of the Board of Trustees Thursday asking officials to put cameras in the garages after his car was vandalized during the first week of spring semester.', 'The 2015 Student Government Association Presidential Elections have started with yet another controversy within the campaigns: table wars.\nKnight News received a tip this morning that candidates Cait Zona and Jarell Jones had taken over the table at the Student Union patio that was assigned to Brian Zagrocki and Alex Bennett.\nWhen we approached Brian, he said, “We had an agreement, that’s our spot for tabling. UCF SU made an agreement with the election commissioner. We got here to find out that they already had our spot and they told us that we couldn’t have it.”\nZona had set up the tent closest to the Student Union, on the left side when facing the entrance. According to Zagrocki, the spot the tents are placed at really makes a difference.\n“Why else would they have gotten here at five o’clock and stolen what we’ve already reserved?” said Zagrocki.\nKnightNews also approached Zona regarding the information. She told us that, “Statutorily, any of the spots are open” and that, “Per statute, it’s first come first serve.”\nZona admitted that they picked numbers through the EC, but she had asked the SU for approval to table there.\nNicklas Bajema, Supervisor of Elections for the Election Commission, disputed Zona’s previous statement.\n“It was not first come, first serve. There was an agreement had by the candidates initiated by me. They basically drew in a snake style fashion, basically if you had an NFL draft, kind of fantasy football style, so everyone gets a first, second, and last choice. And then, they pick the spots and they were supposed to honor that,” Bajema said.\nRegarding the numbered spots Zona talked about, Bajema said that, “There was a preconceived notion that each person had a spot available to them in a fair manner, because it was established beforehand in an agreement with the elections commission.”\nAfter receiving Bajema’s statement, we went back to Zona and asked her why she had said that the spots were first come, first serve.\nZona said that they received building permission and anything that was reserved was for Election Commissioner general.\n“We just decided with our team we just wanted to be as close to students and this was actually not a spot previously. So there was one spot per candidate, one spot per ticket, and they still have their own spot right there. This was actually not a spot on the map,” she said.\n\nKnightNews.com was able to attain the map with the numbered spots the candidates received and compare that to the spot that Zona’s table was located.\nAs shown in the pictures, Zona’s table appears to be in a spot in the map, a spot assigned to Brian and Alex.\nWe also spoke to event services, who gave us a screenshot of the patio reservation schedule.\nThe entire patio was reserved for elections, but no reservation was made specifically for that table, which is shown to be a numbered table in the EC document, not an Event Services table.\nZona did request permission for that spot to be closer to students and Event Services agreed because the patio was open for elections. However, Event Services was not in charge of the table the EC had previously assigned,\nKeep checking back to Knight News for continuing SGA election coverage.', 'When she was growing up, Alexis Lemay remembers her mother getting up early every day for cancer treatments. \nIt was breast cancer. \nThe disease put a strain on their family, but her mother wouldn’t give up. She continued teaching kindergarten and wouldn’t miss a day of work. \nAfter a year-long battle, Lemay’s mother beat the disease. \nLemay, now a senior at UCF majoring in business, and a group of UCF students have been raising funds for the organization Base Camp. \nBase Camp provides a place for children fighting cancer to be just be kids. There’s video games, drawers of makeup, beautiful clothing for dress up and tons of food. \nThey celebrate birthdays and milestone parties at their facility in Winter Park. The organization also helps the families of patients by providing food and support, even donating lunches and dinners to nearby hospitals every week. \n“My mom may have been an adult with cancer but to be a child with cancer, it affects me even more,” Lemay said. “You think how scary that must be for them and to see them keep smiling throughout treatment is truly amazing.”\nLemay’s six-person group, Base Knights, has raised over $500 for the organization. They are just one of the almost 10 cornerstone groups helping Base Camp this semester. \nTerri Jones, president of Base Camp, estimates that students from UCF would bring in about $30,000 in cash, food and donations this semester.\nJones said their organization is starting a new campaign #ConquerTheClimb, which hopes to raise $100,000 in 10 years. With the help of these UCF students, they are one step closer.\n“We are able to do so much because of these students,” Jones said. “We’re so thankful for their hard work, and I can’t imagine what we’d do without them. The kids just adore them.”', 'Imagine graduating high school and rather than experiencing the freedom of going away to college, you are thrown into the front line of warfare. \nNot worried about which party to go to this Friday night, but of all the civilian lives you are responsible for protecting. \nThat is what the average teenager experiences in Israel.\nBeneath the Helmet began as the sun set Thursday night Mar. 19 at 8 p.m. in SU Room 221.

The GOP debate will feature the top 10 candidates and Carly Fiorina, who made the cut off after her average poll number placed her in the ranks with her male counterparts.  \nDivided into two parts, the first half of the debate features the four candidates who met the minimum one percent threshold in public polls. Those candidates include George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum. \nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry was invited to join them on stage but suspended his bid after he realized his poll numbers were just as dismal as his campaign funds.\nA variety of issues will be discussed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \nKeep your ears primed for several issues ranging from Immigration, Foreign Policy and National Security, Health Care, and several Civil Rights not limited to Women’s Rights and LGBTQ affairs. \nWe will examine a few topics and the primary presidential potentials viewpoints, hoping to provide you with more knowledge on their platforms.\nObamaCare/ Health care\n•\tRand Paul- Longtime supporter of the Republican Party, Paul pursued a life of civic engagement while attaining a medical doctor degree. Having both performed eye surgery and owning his own practice in the past 18 years, Paul has years of experience in the medical field under his belt and has felt the effects of a failing health care reform. An opponent of Obamacare, he plans to rescind government involvement in health care as to eliminate the bureaucratic restrictions that hinder development.\n•\tChris Christie- Both Christie and Paul have come under fire for telling audiences that it was a parental decision on whether children should be vaccinated; however, Christie quickly clarified his position by stating that there should be a balance between what the government mandates. He supports the expansion Medicaid in his state of New Jersey because it was relatively small under ObamaCare. He called for the President to apologize to people who were getting their health plans canceled and was quoted saying that anyone who has run anything in their lives could see the problem with a state based health exchange a mile away.\n•\tMarco Rubio- A proponent of massive health care reform, Rubio believes that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, has done more harm than good; stating that not only are states being left with unfunded liability that ultimately limits market competition. His plan would include transparency to facilitate value-based informed decisions and expanded choice in Medicaid options as well as longer funding periods.\nAbortion\n•\tJeb Bush- elder Bush brother and former Florida Governor, Bush has asserted his formidable pro-life stance in a variety of ways in the past 20 years. Within his first year in office he used his executive power to approve a specialty license plate promoting the right-to-life “Choose Life” that donated $20 of proceeds to adoption agencies which provided counseling, but not to clinics that provided abortion counseling. He had even a feeding tube reinserted on a severely brain-damaged woman against the family’s wishes.\n•\tChris Christie- Once a pro-choice proponent, Governor Christie changed his mind when he heard his daughter’s heartbeat at 13 weeks back in 1995. He has since been pro-life and only supports abortions in cases where the mother’s life is at risk. He also eliminated state funding for Planned Parenthood stating that there were many other services women could use if they wanted family planning services.\n•\tCarly Fiorina- With exceptions to cases in the instance of rape, incest, and maternal endangerment, the former business executive supports the defunding of Planned Parenthood. She believes that American attention should be focused on more pressing issues.\nImmigration\n•\tJeb Bush- Having a fairly moderate view on immigration, Bush has since come to support a path for permanent legal residency that would hope to open the path to naturalization after years of supporting the deportation of illegal immigrants.\n•\tDonald Trump- Infamously known on for his disparaging comments about Hispanics during his presidential announcement speech, Trump called for a tighter southern border going so far to propose building a wall that Mexico will have to pay out of pocket. He supports legal immigration from European countries and providing legal status to international students who complete their degree at an American university.\n•\tTed Cruz- Texas senator has expressed to the media about Obama’s “lawless amnesty” on his comprehensive immigration reform, which included background checks, earned citizenship for DREAMers, and strict requirements for those who would like permanent resident status. Cruz has tried to combat Obama’s executive order to cease the deportation of young, undocumented immigrants.\nForeign Policy \n•\tBen Carson- On our ally ship with Israel, the retired neurosurgeon has urged the U.S. to listen and consider Netanyahu during his speech to denounce Obama’s nuclear limitation deal with Iran. He advocates the U.S. using a proactive stance on leadership, versus waiting for what other nations will do first.\n•\tRand Paul- Having changed his views of removing all foreign aid, including Israel, because of America’s rising debt, he was quoted saying that we cannot give away money we don’t have. Paul has since then broadened his stance to support American allies. (On Cuba)\n•\tMarco Rubio- Rubio stands as one of two Hispanic Republican candidates for the 2016 elections, and believes that Cuba must improve their position on human rights in order for American engagement with the island to be successful. He views our involvement with the country to not be enough if they don’t take measures into their own hand and initiate true, long lasting change.\nGun Control\n•\tScott Walker- the Wisconsin governor believes that protecting and preserving the second amendment is not optional—in fact, it is one of the most important things a governor can do. Using his executive power, he signed a law transforming Wisconsin gun laws to one of the freest in the U.S.\n•\tTed Cruz- A staunch supporter of the second amendment, he penned a brief on behalf of the 31 states that supported the right to keep and bear arms. He stands on the side of opposition to restricting magazines with more than 10 bullets and the United Nation’s Arms Trade Treaty, which sought to limit the misuse of firearms in wartime interactions in foreign countries.\n•\tDonald Trump- Before his campaign for presidency began, Trump was more permissive toward gun control opting to place a ban on assault weapons and proposing a slightly longer waiting period. However, he touts his support of the second amendment and mandates that guns are necessary for defense and that “not every gun is an assault weapon.”\nEducation\n•\tJohn Kasich- A supporter creationism, Kasich likens stories from the 4000-year-old Bible as historical facts recounting factual human history, taken from historical record. Outside of his religious views, he believes that competition in American universities is what makes this country great and would like to incorporate that drive into the refurbishing of primary and secondary school establishment.\n•\tJeb Bush- An advocate for Common Core education standards, an assessment that would monitor kids K-12 progress on the English language and mathematics. However, the plan has been criticize governmental overreach and to lessen the daunting effects of it the Obama administration has incentive its usage rather than require it be done 43 states it was approved in.\n•\tCarly Fiorina- In Fiorina’s explanation of the private versus public school debate she lays out the downfall of a free-market voucher-driven system of public school education, stating that many schools would were only able to achieve the lowest common denominator. If we let competition reign the strongest schools would prosper and the weaker ones would be left to perish.', 'The U.S. Department of Energy awarded UCF mechanical and aerospace engineering assistant professor Subith Vasu $1.1 million to investigate using supercritical CO2 (sCO2), a fluid state of carbon dioxide, instead of steam in power plants.\nGraduate researcher Owen Pryor, 25, said that there were nine projects in total and both Georgia Tech, the only other university awarded in the nation, wrote proposals on sCO2 although both universities are performing different projects.\nPryor said that supercritical steam is used in nuclear power plants but is being looked into being replaced since it is both corrosive and hard to compress. The theoretical idea is that with CO2 it would only take four stages to compress versus 55 it takes steam to compress.\n“We use a shock wave to compress chemicals and then, in fuels for examples, if you do this right, their temperature and pressure high enough, then they start to break down and turn into different chemicals and basically you get ignition like fire and combustion. It’s all just chemical reactions so we use this to study chemical reactions,” explained 22-year-old graduate researcher, Joseph Lopez about how shock tubes work.\nThe shock waves sent through the tube are like a single piston stroke compressing the chemicals. With the information they collect from different chemical reactions, they record concentrations over time of different species. Pryor said the mechanism they are creating will simulate the chemical reactions that occur using two species and ignition delay times to validate the mechanism.\n“The goal by the end of the project is to have a validated chemical kinetic mechanism that can be implemented in an open source CFD code. A chemical kinetic mechanism is a tool that allows people to simulate the reactions to help understand what is produced during combustion, temperatures and pressures,” Pryor explained. “The mechanism will then be added to a computer code to simulate the sCO2 combustor. Possible preliminary designs of combustors will be created.\nVasu said they aim to help industries develop technologies to use CO2 as a working fluid which can be stored underground and enable using less water which is scarce in certain areas of the nation. Florida is a leading state when it comes to power generation industry and many major gas turbine companies, including Mitsubishi and Siemens. The gas turbine companies work with UCF’s Center for Advanced Turbomachinery and Energy Research (CATER) which is headed by Prof. Jayanta Kapat from the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.

The GOP debate will feature the top 10 candidates and Carly Fiorina, who made the cut off after her average poll number placed her in the ranks with her male counterparts.  \nDivided into two parts, the first half of the debate features the four candidates who met the minimum one percent threshold in public polls. Those candidates include George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum. \nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry was invited to join them on stage but suspended his bid after he realized his poll numbers were just as dismal as his campaign funds.\nA variety of issues will be discussed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \nKeep your ears primed for several issues ranging from Immigration, Foreign Policy and National Security, Health Care, and several Civil Rights not limited to Women’s Rights and LGBTQ affairs. \nWe will examine a few topics and the primary presidential potentials viewpoints, hoping to provide you with more knowledge on their platforms.\nObamaCare/ Health care\n•\tRand Paul- Longtime supporter of the Republican Party, Paul pursued a life of civic engagement while attaining a medical doctor degree. Having both performed eye surgery and owning his own practice in the past 18 years, Paul has years of experience in the medical field under his belt and has felt the effects of a failing health care reform. An opponent of Obamacare, he plans to rescind government involvement in health care as to eliminate the bureaucratic restrictions that hinder development.\n•\tChris Christie- Both Christie and Paul have come under fire for telling audiences that it was a parental decision on whether children should be vaccinated; however, Christie quickly clarified his position by stating that there should be a balance between what the government mandates. He supports the expansion Medicaid in his state of New Jersey because it was relatively small under ObamaCare. He called for the President to apologize to people who were getting their health plans canceled and was quoted saying that anyone who has run anything in their lives could see the problem with a state based health exchange a mile away.\n•\tMarco Rubio- A proponent of massive health care reform, Rubio believes that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, has done more harm than good; stating that not only are states being left with unfunded liability that ultimately limits market competition. His plan would include transparency to facilitate value-based informed decisions and expanded choice in Medicaid options as well as longer funding periods.\nAbortion\n•\tJeb Bush- elder Bush brother and former Florida Governor, Bush has asserted his formidable pro-life stance in a variety of ways in the past 20 years. Within his first year in office he used his executive power to approve a specialty license plate promoting the right-to-life “Choose Life” that donated $20 of proceeds to adoption agencies which provided counseling, but not to clinics that provided abortion counseling. He had even a feeding tube reinserted on a severely brain-damaged woman against the family’s wishes.\n•\tChris Christie- Once a pro-choice proponent, Governor Christie changed his mind when he heard his daughter’s heartbeat at 13 weeks back in 1995. He has since been pro-life and only supports abortions in cases where the mother’s life is at risk. He also eliminated state funding for Planned Parenthood stating that there were many other services women could use if they wanted family planning services.\n•\tCarly Fiorina- With exceptions to cases in the instance of rape, incest, and maternal endangerment, the former business executive supports the defunding of Planned Parenthood. She believes that American attention should be focused on more pressing issues.\nImmigration\n•\tJeb Bush- Having a fairly moderate view on immigration, Bush has since come to support a path for permanent legal residency that would hope to open the path to naturalization after years of supporting the deportation of illegal immigrants.\n•\tDonald Trump- Infamously known on for his disparaging comments about Hispanics during his presidential announcement speech, Trump called for a tighter southern border going so far to propose building a wall that Mexico will have to pay out of pocket. He supports legal immigration from European countries and providing legal status to international students who complete their degree at an American university.\n•\tTed Cruz- Texas senator has expressed to the media about Obama’s “lawless amnesty” on his comprehensive immigration reform, which included background checks, earned citizenship for DREAMers, and strict requirements for those who would like permanent resident status. Cruz has tried to combat Obama’s executive order to cease the deportation of young, undocumented immigrants.\nForeign Policy \n•\tBen Carson- On our ally ship with Israel, the retired neurosurgeon has urged the U.S. to listen and consider Netanyahu during his speech to denounce Obama’s nuclear limitation deal with Iran. He advocates the U.S. using a proactive stance on leadership, versus waiting for what other nations will do first.\n•\tRand Paul- Having changed his views of removing all foreign aid, including Israel, because of America’s rising debt, he was quoted saying that we cannot give away money we don’t have. Paul has since then broadened his stance to support American allies. (On Cuba)\n•\tMarco Rubio- Rubio stands as one of two Hispanic Republican candidates for the 2016 elections, and believes that Cuba must improve their position on human rights in order for American engagement with the island to be successful. He views our involvement with the country to not be enough if they don’t take measures into their own hand and initiate true, long lasting change.\nGun Control\n•\tScott Walker- the Wisconsin governor believes that protecting and preserving the second amendment is not optional—in fact, it is one of the most important things a governor can do. Using his executive power, he signed a law transforming Wisconsin gun laws to one of the freest in the U.S.\n•\tTed Cruz- A staunch supporter of the second amendment, he penned a brief on behalf of the 31 states that supported the right to keep and bear arms. He stands on the side of opposition to restricting magazines with more than 10 bullets and the United Nation’s Arms Trade Treaty, which sought to limit the misuse of firearms in wartime interactions in foreign countries.\n•\tDonald Trump- Before his campaign for presidency began, Trump was more permissive toward gun control opting to place a ban on assault weapons and proposing a slightly longer waiting period. However, he touts his support of the second amendment and mandates that guns are necessary for defense and that “not every gun is an assault weapon.”\nEducation\n•\tJohn Kasich- A supporter creationism, Kasich likens stories from the 4000-year-old Bible as historical facts recounting factual human history, taken from historical record. Outside of his religious views, he believes that competition in American universities is what makes this country great and would like to incorporate that drive into the refurbishing of primary and secondary school establishment.\n•\tJeb Bush- An advocate for Common Core education standards, an assessment that would monitor kids K-12 progress on the English language and mathematics. However, the plan has been criticize governmental overreach and to lessen the daunting effects of it the Obama administration has incentive its usage rather than require it be done 43 states it was approved in.\n•\tCarly Fiorina- In Fiorina’s explanation of the private versus public school debate she lays out the downfall of a free-market voucher-driven system of public school education, stating that many schools would were only able to achieve the lowest common denominator. If we let competition reign the strongest schools would prosper and the weaker ones would be left to perish.']"

On September 2, 2014, a video surfaced of Islamic State showing Steven’s beheading at the hands of ‘Jihadi John.’ He was only 31.\nSteven attended UCF for two years and was a senior staff writer for the Central Florida Future. \nAfter a trip to Israel in his second year, he realized he wanted to cover the Middle East. His parents were proud but concerned for his safety.\n“I would tell him, ‘Steven, you’re walking around with a target on your back,’” said Arthur. “But he wasn’t worried – he said had to do what he had to do.”\nSteven often became known for his want to provide a “voice to the voiceless,” later travelling regularly to the Middle East to cover unfolding events as a freelance journalist, making little money, although eager to continue pursuing his dreams.', 'Places like Syria drew his attention, where people had no way of sharing their accounts.\n“He never wanted to go for the big stories – it was always about the common people,” Arthur said. “It was about the voiceless, the people standing in the breadlines and the hospitals, the people that were suffering.”\nArthur and Shirley\xa0opened a panel to students and described the journey taken by their son at UCF and through his career.\nUCF sophomore journalism student Gianna Doxey was honored to have been able to hear the Sotloffs speak.\n“We all needed to hear this extra push and inspiration, especially after the recent Paris attacks,” she said. “Last week, the whole country was concerned by the red cups at Starbucks, and then a real story happened. Now we’re here tonight, and I think it was meant to be.”\nTo honor Sotloff and continue his legacy, the Sotloffs created the 2LIVES: Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial Foundation to provide scholarships for journalism students.\n“The scholarship not only memorializes our son, but also contributes to the future in a way that lives on for future journalists,” Shirley said.\nThe Foundation will soon award its first scholarship to a University of Miami journalism student. The first Steven Sotloff endowed scholarship will be presented on December 6 at 1 p.m. at the Miami Dolphins vs. Baltimore Ravens game.\n“Knowing that our son lives on, and the endowment will touch the lives of students with similar interests truly touches our entire family,” Shirley said.\nThough the Sotloffs have made strides in their acceptance of Steven’s death, they are still devastated.\n“My son was murdered in front of the entire world,” said Arthur. “I still can’t put my feelings into words.”\nPhoto Credit: Aileen Perilla', 'Where the tents sprout like mushroom caps and dangling lights illuminate the night sky, individuals from all walks of life joined together this past week at Tent City: Rising, an event of unity.\nBiannually, the Campus Peace Action club illustrates an ideal, peaceful community that befalls within the tranquil surroundings of the UCF Arboretum. For seven days and six nights from November 9th through 14th, familiar and unfamiliar faces are invited to come together and coexist through music, art, and a whole lotta love. All workshops are hosted and executed by members of the CPA club and shared with the community.\n“Tent City started back in 2003 as a response to the wars in Iraq. The event has moved around campus from the free speech zone, to memory mall, and now the arboretum. Over the years, the event became less politically fueled, evolving into a place for peaceful gathering and self-expression.” Said Jaimie Lanning, host of Tent City: Rising. “It’s the first place I felt at home at UCF. I’m just happy to be involved in creating an event that continues to spread that feeling.”\nThe event has evolved just as its participants have. Tent City is a space where anyone can explore the purest parts of themselves and share those parts securely within the community. Each day of the event is devoted to unity, expressed through drum circles, yoga, art, meditation, and various educational workshops. “On Tuesday night my band, Garden Party, played a surprise set to an amazing crowd,” Lanning said. “There’s just an indescribable feeling that you get from creating music with your friends.”\nPast and present members of Tent City alike have expressed that the best way to experience the event was to enter with a clear mind, free of premature suppositions of the world, and allow the light emulating from surrounding people shine onto you. This allows people to experience a world without routine and enables them to bask in the now; something these members wish to carry on in their every day lives.\nSome walk in alone, but none walk out alone. \n“You can’t walk alone. Many have given the illusion, but none have really walked alone. Man is not made that way. Each man is bedded in his people, their history, their culture, and their values.” – Peter Abrahams', 'Tour of Asia, hosted by Asian Student Association for the eleventh year, enthralled its audience at the University of Central Florida. \nThe tour began in Japan and crossed the seas to indulge its Orlando audience with unique renditions of traditional and modern Asian dance and unique sounds. The first to immediately captivate the audience was the Orlando Taiko Dojo. \nOrlando Taiko Dojo is a Japanese drumming troupe who demonstrates the Japanese traditional art of drumming, hence the name “Taiko.”\nThe sound of the drums permeated the atmosphere and everyone was immediately drawn to the steady rhythmic beats as the performers kept in perfect sync. It was impossible for one’s attention to stray away from the sounds and the enthusiastic energy at which these performers demonstrated an age old craft; it was captivating to both sight and sound.\nThe enchantment continued as the C-Melody dancers representing Vietnam told their stories “through the eyes.” The rendition used the manipulation of fans and flowing silk fabrics to kept the focus on the dancer’s upper body movements. \nThis beautifully synchronized dance used the richness of the flowing fabrics to portray a classic tale of young love with a “demonic” twist. The majestic colors and graceful movements of the dancers truly did tell the tale to the fullest. The seemingly effortless dance charmed the audience as the young women evoked the passion and conflict existing between two lovers.\nThe non-stop sensory explosion continued with a duo known as “Philipinese” further as they further immersed everyone in the romantic mood by serenading them with unique acoustic sounds. The pair blended pop culture top hits with Studio Ghibli (animation film producers) music strung in between; stimulated by the sounds, the audience accompanied the music with rhythmic strikes of the palms.\nAfter intermission, a one-man show brought out the child in everyone with the Chinese interpretation of “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” from Disney’s animated motion picture, Mulan. Shuyu Liu’s performance proved that, despite our cultural differences, we all share an emotional connection; it was the perfect segway in appeasing the audience’s thirst for more entertainment as the dance troupe followed suit with legendary dances from the Philippines. \nThe dancers engaged the audience with their face-paced footwork. This performance included wooden beams strategically laid out on the stage where the dancers demonstrated their technical skills as they rhythmically moved to the essence of the music. Different members of the same dance group then stirred the rhythmic juices as they engulfed the stage with their synchronized gesticulations of “punches” in combination with the powerful artist skill of tumbling, somersaults and once again, amazing footwork that captivated the audience throughout the performance.\nThe culminated feature was Knights Kangna, representing India whose agility and graceful gestures brought out the rich culture of their country’s dance as the artists incorporated modern movements. Modernizing the typical hand gestures or “mudra,” the dances combined the upbeat music of Bollywood and popular western hits as they told the story of two sisters whose family was tragically separated and eventually brought together. The visual narrative was a perfect ending to both the show and the emotionally moving evening.', 'The University of Central Florida Police Department forwarded a case involving a former UCF director of the Nicholson School of Communication to the state attorney’s office, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\nIn April of 2015, Knight News broke the story about Robert Chandler becoming pressured to resign after accusations arose of misusing travel reimbursements and university resources on business trips.\nApparently double-dipping 40 times on the trips in amounts of $30,000 drew suspicion from the university, which looked into Chandler’s expenses and concluded foul play may be at hand.\nAs a result of the investigation, Chandler reimbursed UCF about $30,000 for the “overpayments and double payments” he received, according to UCF records. Chandler denied wrongdoing, telling UCF there were delays but not a “purposeful fraudulent intent.”\nMichael Johnson, the UCF dean of Sciences, wrote a letter in response to Chandler’s explanation shortly after, saying “It is impossible for me to accept an explanation of ‘sloppiness’ on your part.

The Knights will honor seniors: Isai Cetoute, Tarik Cook, Joey Grant, Lance McDowdell, Thomas Niles, Joseph Puopolo, Domenic Spencer, Brendin Straubel and Cedric Thompson.\nAs you can imagine it will be an emotional game for the Knights; for some of the seniors it will be their last football game.\n“It’s sad knowing that it’s coming to an end,” said redshirt senior H-Back Joseph Puopolo. “When you’re a freshman here, you never really think like It’s gonna come to an end. It’s just crazy to think that it’s here right now.”\n“All the things that we’ve been through, the championships, the wins and just ending it like this. It’s crazy to think about,” added Puopolo.\nThese seniors were a part of the Knights teams that won the BCS Fiesta Bowl in 2014 against Baylor and back to back conference titles in 2013 and 2014 seasons.\n“My favorite memory is for sure the Fiesta Bowl,” said redshirt senior H-back Cedric Thompson. “It was just a surreal experience. Everybody counted us out…we did a great job preparing and we got the result that we wanted.”\n“It was fun, to go out there and actually show that we can play with anybody,” said redshirt senior defensive end Thomas Niles. “The whole year [2013] shocking people, taking down top 10 teams like Louisville, playing with South Carolina when nobody really gave us a chance in that game either. Just that whole year [2013] was just great.”\nThe seniors are used to winning and they do not want to have a 0-12 season and end their UCF careers with a loss.\nThe Knights want to go out with a bang, win against their rivals (USF) and knock them out of contention to win the American East conference. UCF plans to blackout the Bulls as they will be wearing all black for the first time since 1995.\nEveryone remembers their last game, a point touched on by UCF interim head coach Danny Barrett.\n“Cause of the love for the game, you never want it to end,” said Barrett.', 'On Nov. 16, University of Central Florida students gathered with faculty to remember the life of former UCF journalism student and freelance journalist Steven Sotloff. \nSteven’s parents Arthur and Shirley Sotloff gathered in an auditorium at UCF to speak to students about their son and the legacy he leaves behind, inspiring young journalists all over the world.\nSteven Joel Sotloff was only 31 years old when he was murdered on camera by Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) after being held captive for over 13 months. \nSotloff is remembered for his heroic acts of journalism through his curiosity, commitment and most importantly, courage. \nCourage is the exact term to describe Arthur and Shirley who sat in front of journalism students from Professor Rick Brunson’s Principles of Journalism class and faculty members to share fond memories of their late son and his passion for journalism. \n“His curiosity and love for people had no bounds,” Shirley said of her son.\nSteven attended UCF from 2002 to 2004 where he worked his way up through the publication Central Florida Future to become their senior staff writer and had several stories, most about politics, make the front page. \nAfter his time at UCF, according to his father, Steven went on a weeklong trip to Israel through the organization called Birthright for young Jewish adults wishing to visit Israel. When he finished the trip, he decided to complete his education there, at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya College. He received his bachelor’s in Government, Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security. With his degrees he was also awarded Cum Laude honors. \nFrom there on, Steven jump-started his career working for TIME Magazine, the Christian Science Monitor and World Affairs Journal. As his father perfectly stated, Steven was “compelled to be the voice of the voiceless and report to the world what he had seen.”\nProfessor Brunson introduced Steven’s parents with a warm welcome and shared a few lines from a tribute to Steven he had written for the UCF Forum, which was later picked up by the Huffington Post. \n“Steven Sotloff dedicated himself to bearing and shedding light, especially in dark corners of the world torn by war and riven by age-old hatreds and intractable, systematic poverty,” Brunson read.\nShirley then stood in front of the audience and began to speak about Steven, how kind, intelligent and well liked he was. She also spoke of his passion for reporting news internationally. \n“He was dedicated to working in those areas of the world where free speech was limited or even harshly prevented. Steven showed us that no matter who you are or where you come from, if you listen and step out of your comfort zone, you will learn, you will grow, and you will experience life through a newer, larger lens,” she said.\nShirley ended by speaking about the scholarship fund she and her husband started a year ago in his name. \n“Everyone has two lives. The second one begins when you realize you have only one.” These words written by Steven in a letter to his parents is what inspired them to start the 2Lives Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial Foundation, a scholarship that has been set up to raise money for aspiring young journalists. \nFunds have provided airfare for journalists traveling to Ireland with training as part of a new global initiative for freelance reporters to help them receive first aid courses, health insurance policies and risk assessment skills.\nBoard Member of the fund and close family friend Frank Urrutia was sitting by the Sotloffs’ side and not only spoke of the fund but also stated although he wasn’t a dear friend of Steven’s, he said Steven was, “a big inspiration to me because he always demonstrated the characteristics that make this school very special: curiosity, courage, and commitment.”\n“It was definitely inspirational, I know there was a lot of mention of death, life, and rebirth but I think its more important to know that there’s an impact today and now, on the people who are living here. For people like me going into journalism, it literally gives us the push to keep going and keep doing this,” journalism student Nicole Garcia said on how she felt hearing the Sotloffs’ speak.\nFor more information on the 2Lives Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial Foundation, visit the official website.', 'On Saturday, Nov. 14, Alpha Tau Omega hosted their annual Rock the Wreath charity\nconcert with a performance by University of Central Florida Alpha Tau Omega alumni, Henry Fong, to benefit The Children’s Miracle Network.\n\nThe Children’s Miracle Network raises money for 170 children’s hospitals to support research, training, equipment purchases and pay for uncompensated care to benefit the lives of children across the United States and Canada, according to their website. \nThe concert was held at the on-campus fraternity house that transformed their front lawn to resemble a true outdoor concert. The event raised over $31,000 for The Children’s Miracle Network, over $5,000 more than last year’s concert featuring the Ying Yang Twins.\nUCF students, alumni and members of the community came out to support the cause and enjoy\nperformances by UCF students Connor and EJ Dunne, DJ Alex Wood and headliner Henry Fong, with a special guest appearance from DallasK. \n“My brother and I had a ton of fun and were grateful ATO gave us the opportunity to open for Henry\nFong and drop two of our original mixes,” Connor Dunne said. “We were pleasantly surprised by the set up; from the stage, Red Bull tents, tables, audio and visuals, and of course Henry Fong bringing his own energy to the crowd. It was a great experience.”\nUCF ATO brother and chairman of the event, Brandon Glaser, spent the semester planning\nand preparing for the night.\n“It was a pleasure being in charge of this year’s event and I’m so glad to see everyone have a great time; I couldn’t have been more satisfied with the end product,” Glaser said.\nAll the guests seemed to enjoy the concert: crowding around the stage, singing and dancing as the DJ’s performed and the brothers represented their fraternity and supporters by waving a UCF and ATO flag in the sea of people.\n“Rock the Wreath surpassed my expectations. It was amazing to see everyone come together for a\ncommon cause. All the money raised and hard work put into making this a success was incredible to\nexperience and be a part of,” UCF student Angie Marini said.\nThe night finished with the announcement of Zeta Tau Alpha winning the fundraising event to\nparticipate in ATO Viking Week 2016 and Kappa Delta member, Eden Marcu, winning the position of\nATO sweetheart.\n“I’ve know the gentlemen of Alpha Tau Omega since arriving at UCF and have seen all the time and\neffort they put into not just this, but everything they do.

He hit a key a layup when then the team was down by four points with 2:54 remaining in the second half. Followed by a key box out to get the ball back and then tied the game at 61-61 with 1:35 remaining.\n“He started driving the ball at the end and I think that’s where he’s really good,” Head Coach Donnie Jones said. “He really got to the rim and really made some big plays down the stretch.”\nThe leadership Davis carried was prominent during the game; his teammates seemed to feed of his play.\n“A.J’s personality is very attractive,“ Jones said. ”Guys attract to him because he’s a great competitor, he’s a great practice guy, he’s high energy and he brings it. It’s hard not to respect that every day.”\n“He plays with great energy every night,” Jones added. “You know what you’re getting from him.”\nDavis plays with great toughness, reminiscent of his dad, Antonio Davis, who played 15 seasons in the NBA and is currently a NBA analyst for ESPN.\n“At his size, he’s a little bit bigger than me, so we’re two different players,” Davis said. “But I still try to learn to play like he did.”\nHaving a former NBA player as a father, Davis has a lot of basketball knowledge and that helps him with his leadership.\n“I’m a vocal guy, so I try my best to talk and communicate,” Davis said. “I been around the game for a long time, so I try to speak up and just encourage everybody.”', 'The Knights edged out the UMass Minutemen for their third consecutive win after a tip-in from Shaheed Davis gave UCF the lead with just 2.4 seconds remaining in the game on Tuesday night.\n“I’m just really happy with a lot of efforts from the team tonight. They showed some toughness and executed down the stretch,” Head Coach Donnie Jones said. “We got the stops, we got the finishes we needed and it was a great team victory.”\nDefense was the name of the game on Tuesday night as the Knights held UMass to just 38.2 percent from the field and 23.3 percent from beyond the arc. Sophomore guard Donte Clark, the Minutemen’s lead scorer, was held to his second lowest scoring total of the season with only 12 points.\nSophomore swingman Adonys Henriquez also seemed to find his shot early on in the game, scoring 9 points in the first half to go with 3 rebounds and 2 assists. Henriquez has seen a lot of attention from opposing defenses thus far this season, but the sophomore was able to find space regularly despite the stingy UMass defense.\nUCF was stuck in a sloppy defensive battle for most of the game as both teams ended the night with a combined 29 turnovers, but the Knights’ solid shooting kept them ahead of the Minutemen for the lion’s share of the game. The Minutemen came out of halftime on a 25-12 run which eventually allotted them their first lead of the game midway through the second half.\nThe Knights team-first style of basketball paid off once again and allowed them to take advantage of UMass in the waning moments of the game with quality minutes from seniors Staphon Blair and Daiquan Walker.\n“Last year we had to depend on one or two guys to get points for us and those were freshmen and one of those freshmen has not played this year,” Jones said. “So now we get a whole new group of guys that’s asking to be given different roles here. So I think the beauty of what we do is that it isn’t one guy that has to win for us, it is our team that can win for us.”\nHowever, it was redshirt sophomore AJ Davis who made the difference in the final minutes when he scored consecutive buckets to pull the game back to a tie. Davis stuffed the stat sheet with 5 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals while also leading the team in scoring with 14 points.\n“I try to drive, really thinking pass-first and get my teammates involved and get other guys easy shots because I want to help facilitate and get our shooters good looks,” AJ Davis said.\nDonnie Jones final play call with seconds remaining led to an open shot for Daiquan Walker, but his shot just wouldn’t fall and senior Shaheed Davis was able to tap it in as it came off the rim to give the Knights the close victory.\n“I was just waiting for [the ball] to come off, like my initial intent was to dunk it but it sat up there [on the rim] for a while so I just found a way to get it done,” Shaheed Davis said.\nStill missing for the Knights is sophomore court general BJ Taylor who is working his way back from a bone bruise he suffered before the season began. UCF is a much better team with Taylor on the court and that is certainly a welcome prospect for all Knights fans considering how well the team has played without him.\nUCF will take on the Florida Atlantic Owls this coming Saturday as they seek to build upon their three-game win streak. The Owls are 1-5, but their lone victory came against the Miami (OH) Redhawks who beat the Knights back on Nov. 28.\n\xa0', 'Chabad at the University of Central Florida will be bringing Chanukah cheer to the UCF campus throughout the week by hosting parties, various activities and a public menorah lighting.\nA menorah lighting and toy drive will take place Tuesday night at 6 p.m. on the free speech lawn in front of the Student Union. Chabad will also be handing out menorahs around the campus.\n“Chanukah is not just the commemoration of a situation past, but its message and lessons relate to each and every one of us today. In short, Chanukah is the celebration of the small over the many, the seemingly weak over the strong. It is about determination and faith and trusting that when we are doing the right thing with the end goal in mind, we can overcome all challenges in our way,” co-director of Chabad at UCF Rabbi Chaim Lipskier said.\nThe night and toy drive are supported by Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Zeta Beta Tau and Knights for Israel, according to co-director of Chabad at UCF, Rivkie Lipskier.\n“On Chanukah we publicize the miracle that took place by lighting our menorah in places where all can see. For Jewish students this is especially powerful to know that even if they are a minority on campus, they should always be proud of who they are and what they represent. And whenever faced with adversity or challenge, we should never try to fight the darkness directly but rather add light as the light will instantaneously make the darkness disappear,” Rivkie said.\nRivkie also mentioned that President Hitt will be in attendance and will light the first candle on the Menorah.\nStudents are encouraged to bring toys to donate to JAFCO, Jewish Adoptions Foster Care Options.

Either A, its god telling you this is your mission in life, its your job to fix it but that’s why he showing you these problems, or B, it’s time to bring light into your own life and you need to fix yourself. If we take that message to heart, that everytime we see pain and suffering, everytime we see a moment of darkness, everytime we see a struggle, or something that’s not okay, ask yourself, A. what can I do about it, is this my mission to fix? Cause often times it is or B. am I just seeing things a little bit off cause I need some fixing?

An RA went outside and said that whoever applied the signs did so in front of a security camera. From there, security footage of two persons of interest was released.\nA second occurrence took place when a Residence Assistant in Nike “noticed ‘anti- Jewish’ stickers that were stuck to the community mailbox,” the incident report stated.\nAnother incident, also the same day, happened at Lake Claire where an RA’s bulletin board was destroyed and replaced with stickers that read statements such as “Truth is Treason in the empire of lies, Muh Holocaust and another one had a swastika on it,” according to the report. \nThe day after those three incidents, Nov. 16, more stickers were found under the bus shelter in front of Tower 3, according to reports. \n“The stickers had markings of swastika symbols on them and appeared to have been placed there as an act of vandalism, causing minor damage to the area,” the report stated.\nA similar sticker to the one found at the bus shelter was discovered on a street sign at the intersection of East Plaza Drive and Gemini Blvd.\n“The sticker was white in color and displayed the Star of David with the words ‘1 percenters’ on it. That sticker appeared to be antisemitic in nature, and was eventually removed before a police report could be done on it,” according to the incident report.\nUCFPD is still investigating the incidents and following up with tips that came in after the Tower 4 security footage was released.\nSome students addressed the situation with President Hitt saying what has been done regarding the events “is simply not enough.”\n34 Jewish and civil rights organizations emailed Hitt and copied Provost Whittaker with their concerns on the way these incidents have been handled and ways to move forward.\n“We are aware that your administration has vowed to find the perpetrator(s) of these hateful acts and stated that UCF ‘has a zero tolerance policy regarding incidents or bias in any form.’  But this is simply not enough. We are dismayed that in the weeks since the stickers and flyers appeared, neither you nor any other UCF administrator has yet to publicly condemn these postings as antisemitic, specifically targeting Jewish students and causing them to feel threatened and unsafe.  A public statement demonstrates to the campus and wider communities that you will not tolerate acts of bigotry directed at Jewish students and that you are committed to addressing antisemitic acts with the same promptness and vigor as all other racial, ethnic and gender bigotry. A public statement is also the single most important step to deterring future acts of antisemitism,” the email said.\nThe correspondence suggested that UCF administration should publicly acknowledge and condemn these acts, publicly commit to educating university staff and police in identifying the hate crimes, adopt the U.S State Department’s definition of antisemitism to accurately identify the acts and allocate resources and educate students about antisemitism.\nSome of the organizations in the correspondence include Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, Israeli-American Council, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi, Students and Parents Against Campus Anti-Semitism and many more.\n“Taking these steps will show your students, their parents, University of Central Florida alumni, and the larger community that University of Central [Florida] stands firmly against bigotry and hatred, including antisemitism, and will protect all members of the campus community,” the email stated.\nCheck back on KnightNews.com for updates on this story.']","['https://knightnews.com/2015/12/chabad-at-ucf-celebrates-chanukah-with-toy-drive/', 'https://knightnews.com/2015/12/students-call-on-hitt-to-condemn-anti-semitic-acts-ucfpd-releases-reports/']","['Hundreds of students gathered together outside of the student union to celebrate with Jewish organization Chabad and its co-sponsors AEPI, AEPHI, ZBT and Knights for Israel with a menorah lighting ceremony.

Either A, its god telling you this is your mission in life, its your job to fix it but that’s why he showing you these problems, or B, it’s time to bring light into your own life and you need to fix yourself. If we take that message to heart, that everytime we see pain and suffering, everytime we see a moment of darkness, everytime we see a struggle, or something that’s not okay, ask yourself, A. what can I do about it, is this my mission to fix? Cause often times it is or B. am I just seeing things a little bit off cause I need some fixing? I think it’s essentially what the message of Chanukah really is: adding light.”\nTo learn more about JAFCO and how to donate please visit www.jafco.org.', 'The University of Central Florida community was shaken when anti-Semitic stickers and propaganda popped up throughout campus.\nThe University of Central Florida Police Department released the incident reports related to these displays Tuesday afternoon but some students believe UCF is not taking enough action.\nThree reports were filed on Nov. 15, the day KnightNews.com broke the story about the UCF newsstand defaced with anti-Semitic labels.\nAn official in Tower 4 reported that they were “contacted by someone who was concerned about the nature of a sign on the front glass door and two stickers that were applied to a newspaper dispenser outside the front door,” according to the report. An RA went outside and said that whoever applied the signs did so in front of a security camera. From there, security footage of two persons of interest was released.\nA second occurrence took place when a Residence Assistant in Nike “noticed ‘anti- Jewish’ stickers that were stuck to the community mailbox,” the incident report stated.\nAnother incident, also the same day, happened at Lake Claire where an RA’s bulletin board was destroyed and replaced with stickers that read statements such as “Truth is Treason in the empire of lies, Muh Holocaust and another one had a swastika on it,” according to the report. \nThe day after those three incidents, Nov. 16, more stickers were found under the bus shelter in front of Tower 3, according to reports. \n“The stickers had markings of swastika symbols on them and appeared to have been placed there as an act of vandalism, causing minor damage to the area,” the report stated.\nA similar sticker to the one found at the bus shelter was discovered on a street sign at the intersection of East Plaza Drive and Gemini Blvd.\n“The sticker was white in color and displayed the Star of David with the words ‘1 percenters’ on it. That sticker appeared to be antisemitic in nature, and was eventually removed before a police report could be done on it,” according to the incident report.\nUCFPD is still investigating the incidents and following up with tips that came in after the Tower 4 security footage was released.\nSome students addressed the situation with President Hitt saying what has been done regarding the events “is simply not enough.”\n34 Jewish and civil rights organizations emailed Hitt and copied Provost Whittaker with their concerns on the way these incidents have been handled and ways to move forward.\n“We are aware that your administration has vowed to find the perpetrator(s) of these hateful acts and stated that UCF ‘has a zero tolerance policy regarding incidents or bias in any form.’  But this is simply not enough. We are dismayed that in the weeks since the stickers and flyers appeared, neither you nor any other UCF administrator has yet to publicly condemn these postings as antisemitic, specifically targeting Jewish students and causing them to feel threatened and unsafe.  A public statement demonstrates to the campus and wider communities that you will not tolerate acts of bigotry directed at Jewish students and that you are committed to addressing antisemitic acts with the same promptness and vigor as all other racial, ethnic and gender bigotry. A public statement is also the single most important step to deterring future acts of antisemitism,” the email said.\nThe correspondence suggested that UCF administration should publicly acknowledge and condemn these acts, publicly commit to educating university staff and police in identifying the hate crimes, adopt the U.S State Department’s definition of antisemitism to accurately identify the acts and allocate resources and educate students about antisemitism.\nSome of the organizations in the correspondence include Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, Israeli-American Council, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi, Students and Parents Against Campus Anti-Semitism and many more.\n“Taking these steps will show your students, their parents, University of Central Florida alumni, and the larger community that University of Central [Florida] stands firmly against bigotry and hatred, including antisemitism, and will protect all members of the campus community,” the email stated.\nCheck back on KnightNews.com for updates on this story.']"

Rise up, fight back!”\nThis chant was repeated by student activists three\xa0times outside of Millican Hall to protest the so-called “Aramark takeover” of the Student Union.\nThe protest, which was organized by the Student Labor Action Project, was attended by 13 people, many of whom were representatives of other on-campus political organizations like the College Democrats and the National Organization for Women.\nEach protester was given a sign to hold as they walked from the free speech lawn by the library to the Reflection Pond, where they hung a banner bearing the words “#HoldAramarkAccountable” in red and black letters.\nOne sign, held by SLAP member Nicole McLaren, had the hashtag as well as the words, “To workers who deserve better.”\nDirect actions such as today’s protest are in response to stipulations in Aramark’s contract renewal with UCF, where they will have exclusive control over the Student Union, except for two local businesses, which has many people concerned over what that means for current businesses operating within the building and how workers will be affected. SLAP has been the organization spearheading the campaign against it.\n“I believe in free enterprise, not oligopoly,” Cynthia Benson, a political science professor, said of the agreement as protesters handed her campaign literature. “It’s nice to see students give a damn about something.”\nFollowing the distribution of fliers, some protesters went to Vice President Bill Merck’s office on the third floor of Millican Hall to deliver a letter “thanking” him for allowing Aramark to control the Union. Merck is one of many officials overseeing the deal.\n“UCF is great when you go behind student’s backs and kick out local businesses,” said one letter that was shared with Knight News.\nKnight News has reached out to Merck’s office, but assistants in his office did not have any information as to his reaction to the card nor could they respond to the extent of Merck’s involvement with the Aramark deal.\nPart of the anti-monopoly efforts includes a minimum wage increase to $15 an hour. That demand happens to tie into an upcoming rally that will be hosted on Wednesday by several progressive student organizations at the Union’s patio.\nBut what does “holding Aramark accountable” mean?\n“It means giving workers living wages,” NOW secretary Hayley Kranz said. The wages being earned now is “not enough for school and it isn’t enough sometimes to eat. There’s only so much financial aid and sometimes that doesn’t cover everything either.”\nAmong SLAP’s demands to the university in its recent dealings with Aramark is to form a primarily student-run committee that would oversee the implementation of any contractual obligations. The purpose, so said the group’s outreach director Nicole Hamm, would be to “hold Aramark accountable to past and current mistreatment of workers now that they control the Student Union.”\nWhile Aramark would take control over what restaurants will be operating within the Union, the contract proposal would allow two local businesses to sub-let in the building, but still under the control of the corporation. While this helps mitigate some concerns by businesses like Wackadoo’s and Topper’s, which are owned by UCF alumni, it is not enough for people like Josaphat Alvarez, who is NOW’s director of communications.\n“When you monopolize, you put corporations over local businesses,” they said. “They aren’t prioritizing living wages over renovating the Union.”\nNOW, which represents women as well as transgender and gender neutral students on campus, feel that the Aramark takeover as it pertains to wages is an issue worth addressing. As treasurer Killian Muollo pointed out, women and trans people are typically paid less than cisgender white men. The gap is worse when taking into account race and sexual orientation.\nAramark employs 499 people at UCF, 300 of whom are students, according to a university spokesperson. 117 workers are employed full-time, with the remaining working part-time. The company does not currently have seasonal workers on its payroll.\nCurrently, the extent of the deal with UCF and Aramark is unknown beyond the proposal documents already available for public viewing. A contract will not be available for public viewing until this summer.', '“I know the rules very well, but I know it’s stacked against me by the establishment,” Presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a special CNN Town Hall event in New York.\nTrump won the popular vote in Louisiana with 41.4% of the electorate while competitor Ted Cruz only received 37.8% of the electorate.\n“I end up winning Louisiana and then when everything is done I find out I get less delegates than this guy that got his a– kicked, OK? Give me a break. Really disgust[s] me. So it’s a very sick system,” Trump said at one of his rallies.\nWhat happened in Louisiana is not an isolated incident; Trump was swept in Colorado where Ted Cruz wound up winning all 34 delegates.\nTrump turned to twitter to voice his distain, “I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!” Trump tweeted Sunday.\nTrump later tweeted, “The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!”\nTed Cruz responded to Trumps tweets and comments in Irvine California saying, “Donald has been yelling and screaming. A lot of whining. I’m sure some cursing. And some late-night fevered tweeting.”\nCurrently Donald Trump leads the Republican presidential field with 743 delegates. His competition Ted Cruz and John Kasich respectively have 545 and 143 delegates leaving 854 delegates still up for grabs, according to the Associated Press.\nIn order to win the Republican presidential nomination a candidate must accumulate 1237 delegates. If none of the candidates reach this number by the time of the convention, many delegates will become unbound and be able to vote how they see fit.\nThe next primary is New York on April 19 where 95 delegates will be awarded to the Republican Party.\nKnight News is planning on attending the Republican National Convention this July.

Hitt Library was for more than checking out books and study sessions. The building hung up the secrets of eleven members of the UCF faculty and staff. Their secret? Art. One might have never suspected that a professor or someone working in one of the many offices on campus was a “Hidden Artist,” as the exhibit was rightfully named. It was the third year that this event has taken place to spotlight the talents of UCF’s staff. \nImmediately, one could be drawn in to the crystal-clear photographs by Gina Clifton, an Admissions Specialist. Clifton’s photos included a dazzling golden sunset, few of colorful birds and an obvious love for art.\n“My passion for photography comes from a love of nature, people, places, and life. I enjoy capturing that moment in time and sharing it with other people. The gallery exhibit gave me another outlet for sharing my photographs,” Clifton shared. \nAmong the most heartfelt pieces was the very first on display, titled “We Are…” by IT Business Analyst Senior Dawn Herrod which was a collection of photographs taken in wake of the tragedy at the Pulse Nightclub and displayed how the community came together to show their support for Orlando. \n“I spent several days visiting the memorials, often just sitting on the hot sidewalk reading the signs and notes, watching other visitors, and even taking water to the homeless man who watched over the site at Dr. Phillips. I think I took literally hundreds of photos of the memorials, visitors, and even one of the victims who was wheeled out of the hospital by his nurses to visit his friends’ crosses,” Herrod said.\n“For the first time in my life, I saw a local and national outpouring of support for the LGBTQ community. It is unfortunate that sometimes it takes a tragic loss to soften people’s hearts, but somehow it did just that for many. Even if it was only for a short time, people were reminded that we are all just people trying to find our place in this world, trying to find love, joy, and safety. Taking the photos was therapeutic for me, helping me to process what happened. Putting the piece in the exhibit was my way of holding onto the support of the community just a little while longer.”\nThese artists don’t just sell copies of their artwork, they give back in ways that benefit the community. IT Department Manager Russell Muller, whose artwork features that of a dog sticking its head out of a window on a car ride, does just that. \n“I donate a percentage of all of my art sales to Halifax Humane Society, and they are my charity of choice when I make donations,” Muller said.\nThe focus of most of his images were classic cars. \nOther artists featured in this exhibit were Meredith Malkin, Pamela Williams Gruen, Simona Loh, Fiona Murphy, Judy Bragg Pardo, Brian Pate, and M.C Santana. The exhibit showed UCF’s community that staff members are much more than just staff members. They have incredible talents and are people with passions, just like students.\nLibrary image a rendering of a reading room a few years way from construction.', 'Three chariots carrying the gods pulled through the campus for the Ratha Yatra celebration on Wednesday.\nThe annual Festival of the Chariots, as it’s called, opened as volunteers carried bright and lavish chariots in a large parade from Pegasus Circle to the Student Union at UCF, before hosting a multicultural celebration in the Pegasus ballroom encouraging tolerance of other faiths.\nThe ceremony represents the humanization of God according to Professor Deepa Nair, a Faculty Advisor for the Indian Student Association.\n“It is an opportunity to see God and for him to see us,” Nair said.\nRatha Yatra honors Lord Krishna’s return to Vrindaban and originated over 5,000 years ago in India, in a city called Jagannatha Puri. The three wooden chariots are present for the three deities, Lord Balarama and Lady Subhadra, and namely the “Lord of the Universe,” Jagannatha.\nHigh energy dances and drums filled the ballroom echoing the same chants that accompanied the Chariot parade which circled the Student Union in the afternoon.\nEnthusiasts joyously dancing and chanting the “Lord’s Holy Names” remind those in attendance just how universal religious traditions are:\nHare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare\nHare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.\nNot unlike Allah or Yahweh, Jehovah or Jesus Christ, the supreme deity at the center of the Hindu occasion is the source of dutiful pride for those in attendance but people involved insist the festival is anything but religious.\nShraddhanjali Devidasi of the Hare Krishna Society described it as “a cultural outreach.” Similarly, Dvaipayana Das of UCF’s Sangam Club said: “this is about spirituality and self-realization, not religion.”\nThe chariot procession and wellness festival is part of a larger effort to tell people about the ancient civilization of India in colleges around the U.S. by groups like the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) who organized the event and performs around the world.\nSeveral hundreds of students and enthusiasts from all backgrounds partook in the diverse celebration ranging from a Bhakti Yoga session, vegetarian Indian foods, sacred dance, and a lengthy musical performance from The Mayapuris and lasted nearly nine hours.\nThe diversity of the crowd even surprised Das who glanced into the ballroom at those enjoying the art of a Hindu sculptor. “We do not consider any boundaries, anybody comes.”\nUndoubtedly, the sight of an open and embracing Hindu tradition greeting new faces with Kirtan world music and what they called prasadam (free food) is more than welcome.\nFor leaders like Nair the spiritual passion of the festival is crucial. “The times that we are living in, we need to be aware of the different cultures and be respectful of different cultural ideas and identities.”\n\xa0', 'A young woman attends a sexual morality conference at the Student Union, listening intently.\nIn front of her, a panel of religious leaders discusses their views on gender equality, homosexuality, and transgender visibility.

The more conservative Orthodox Judaism generally disapproves of homosexuality, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism are more tolerant.

I’m thinking that any hatred directed at a particular group should be condemned.”\nAccording to the FBI There were 973 hate crimes against Jews reported in the U.S. in 2017. Anti-Semitic hate crimes were 58 percent of all hate crimes against a religious group, and 13 percent of all hate crimes in 2017.\nWeil said anti-Semitism derives from emotion not reason. Some examples of anti-Semetic ideologies are the Nationalist Socialist, which was the political ideology of Nazi Germany, or the Ku Klux Klan, an American White Supremacy hate group.\nThe increase in hate crimes against Jews isn’t only in the United States.

Weil also said he had an experience where an individual threw pennies at him. However, Weil stated one memory sticks out to him the most.\nWeil said he remembers when he was younger an encounter he had while opposing a Ku Klux Klan rally in Georgia, where he participated as part of a large counter-protest.\nWeil ended up in the same restroom as a KKK member, who was dressed in a full robe and Capirote hood, he said.\nThe KKK member, with his young son by his side, asked Weil how he was doing, Weil said.\nWeil said he responded with, “I’m good, how are you?” that he remembers the moment as “normal.”\n“I’m thinking to myself, how ironic — here we stand together at the urinal … and he was completely nice to me,” Weil said. “And then after, he turns right and went toward his group, and I went toward my group. And we yelled and they yelled, and I’m thinking, ‘but back in the bathroom … ‘”\nWeil said we are living in an extremely polarizing time, and that people are becoming more comfortable to being intolerant or discriminatory again.\n“We’re living in very challenging times, where America is ripping itself apart,” Weil said. “We’re seeing it in both political parties, where anti-Semitism has been dormant but has never really gone away.”\nHolmes, echoing the sentiment raised by Weil’s father, said that the current amount of hateful speech is a part of unpredictable “waves” within society’s evolution and that it’s normal to see a steep rise and a steep fall in hate crimes as humanity evolves.\nWeil said the key to dismantling the mindset of prejudice begins with ending generalizations of other people.\n“Hatred begins when you say, ‘those people’ — that’s when you know you are wrong,” Weil said. “Everything that follows after that sentence is wrong. The mere notion of ‘those people’ ignores the human individuality in everyone.”\nWeil said he describes himself along with the Jewish population of UCF and Orlando as resilient in the wake of hatred.\n“There was a significant amount of fear in the community around the time that this happened,” Weil said. “Since then, the community has been galvanized and together with generous support from other communities.

In some moments when you are sitting there, you think what if the sirens go off right now?” Mills said.\nMills said seeing schools where both Jewish and Muslim students went was highly uncommon, despite this they had the opportunity to see one.\n“Despite this conflict, we saw peace and unity at a preschool where an Arab man married a Jewish woman and they started this preschool,” Mills said. “They have Jewish and Muslim students that all get taught at the same school and they now have five schools.”\n\nMills said the trip offered the ability to converse with politicians from Israel and Palestine.  She said the takeaway for her was even though there are vast differences between the two sides this as a major step forward for community growth and unity.\n “Schools are at the true core, and it’s how you change the conflict,” Mills said. “Because not only are the parents interacting the children are as well. It’s how you change the interaction, and it’s how you say why are we actually fighting? Where is the unity?”']"

Instead, it serves to reflect a sentiment shared by the governing body of an institution — in this case, UCF’s.\nAt a time where universities around the U.S. are taking pro and anti-BDS stances, UCF SG held first reading to pass Resolution 52-05, which is “opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement at the University of Central Florida.”\nSG proposed the resolution under the same breath that it proposed, and later passed, the controversial Fiscal Bill 52-60, which voted to allocate $17,875 of student money to fund the right-wing political commentator Ben Shapiro to speak at the main campus and six UCF Police Department officers.\xa0\nMubarak and her group showed up to protest the resolution at the senate committee meeting on Feb. 6, the same night that another group of demonstrators also showed up to protest against the Ben Shapiro bill.\nThe proposer of the bill, Sen.

The image showed the words, “LOVE not HATE,” with a swastika in place of the “O” for “LOVE,” and a Star of David in place of the “A” for “HATE.”\xa0\nThis confused Seema Azim, a UCF alumna of Afghan descent who attended the second hearing with Mubarak’s group. \nShe said the BDS Movement stands against the country of Israel’s politics to deny Palestinians their right to exist, not against the people of Israel or of the Jewish faith. Unlike white supremacy, which does.\n“It was kind of clear that people of the senate did not really understand what BDS was,” Azim said. “There were no Palestinian voices being considered, so all in all, it was a very one-sided approach. One-sided being that they believe BDS to be a discriminatory movement, which it is not.”\xa0\nRembaum, who said he joined UCF SG to serve as a voice for students, said he had not considered the other side of the argument when he’d presented the resolution. \nHe said that when he realized the resolution would do more harm than good, he began to change his mind.\n“I wasn’t able to talk to them about it beforehand because I don’t know many people in that community, and it’s hard for me to reach out to people I don’t know,” Rembaum said. “After hearing their concerns on the senate floor, after talking to them, after senate meetings and hearing their voices, I decided to kill the resolution.”\nMyers, who cosponsored the resolution, said it was meant to be preventative.\n“Not so much on UCF’s campus, but in a lot of other campuses around the country, we have seen a spike in the boycott divestment and sanctions of Israel, and just because a problem hasn’t been super present on our campus, that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening in other places or that it can’t happen at UCF,” Myers said.\xa0\nMyers also said the stance was supposed to be a pro-peace and pro-Israel act of support for the UCF Jewish community, and should not be seen as anti-Muslim.\xa0\n“BDS is almost inherently discriminatory, so I think that a lot of times there’s a lot of confusion with people who are pro-BDS,” Myers said. “Just because we’re doing something for the Jewish community does not mean the exact counter to that is something that is negative toward the Muslim community.”\nBut Grayson Lanza, a UCF alumnus of Jewish descent who attended the meetings as part of Mubarak’s group, said that standing for Israel does not necessarily mean standing for such a diverse community as the whole Jewish population.\xa0\nHe said anti-BDS resolutions and laws purposely weaponize Jewish identity in order to push a separate agenda.\xa0\n“Israel is often improperly associated, either in bad faith or by genuine misunderstanding, as representative and associative with all Jews,” Lanza said. “But not all Jews are Israeli, and historically, we were not for the most part, either. [They] claim it is to fight anti-Semitism; however, it is honestly anti-Semitic to conflate Israel with all Jews.”\nIn the end, when the demonstrators spoke at the committee, the senate assured them that they had already decided to kill the resolution and there was no need for further concern.\nMubarak, Azim and Lanza all said they still felt uneasy. Azim said she felt it would undermine first amendment rights to free speech for some students, in contrast to the Ben Shapiro bill, which passed namely on the arguments from supporters that it protects conservatives’ rights to free speech.\xa0\xa0\n“It’s scary because it kind of makes students — including me — feel like your entire school stands against your rights to express your concerns with human rights violations, and that’s not a nice feeling,” Azim said. “Standing up for oppressed populations already is isolating enough, and it can be marginalizing with a resolution like this on top of it. It would likely push students to not even talk about these things.”\xa0\nThat was Lanza’s main point at the committee meeting that evening. \nWhen he spoke, he made sure to stress the importance of SG including the entirety of the UCF community into these decisions — not just the few closest to them.\xa0\n“One of the most significant issues with the resolution was that there was zero effort from proponents of the resolution to discuss the matter with the UCF Palestinian community or the Orlando Palestinian community as a whole,” Lanza said. “These conversations so, so often erase Palestinians, and there is absolutely no denying that. Regardless of your opinions, Palestinians are the ones who suffer from the conflict the most.”\xa0\nMubarak recognized not adopting the resolution was good news but addressed the heavy responsibility of setting a premise on such dangerous rhetoric, arguing that it promotes xenophobia among students.\nShe said she fears for the future of UCF under divisive management and said she exhorts the student governing body to take accountability to heart.\xa0\n“When you introduce language like that, it takes seconds to further disenfranchise these communities,” Mubarak said. “As leaders, yes, you have power, but it is within you to decide if you want to divide or unify.
