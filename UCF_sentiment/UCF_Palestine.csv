Bianchi also spoke with former state Sen. Lee Constantine, a UCF alumnus, who is sure Genshaft is trying to block the Knights from the Big East.\n“Make no mistake about it,” Constantine told Bianchi, “Judy Genshaft is behind this. She unsuccessfully tried to stand in the way of UCF getting a medical school and now she’s trying to stand in the way of UCF’s football program. It’s becoming very transparent, and it’s time for our state legislature to say enough is enough. What you have here is one state-funded institution harming another state-funded institution and costing the taxpayers money.”\n\nAfter KnightNews.com read Constantine’s quote, we decided to ask state leaders what they thought  about Genshaft’s reported efforts to hinder UCF.

And then there’s climbers who are legally blind and use all their other senses to ascent some of the most difficult climbs, and leave everyone around staring in awe.\nOn Feb. 11, Tripp Clemens, Will Humphrey and Zach Bastian, three members of the four-man team with Harvey Burrell, came to UCF for the screening of their documentary “Endless Abilities.” UCF Housing, Student Disabilities Services, Sporting clubs, the Multicultural Student Center and the Office of Diversity sponsored the event. The movie showcased the world of adaptive sports and highlighted Paralympic athletes, and rehabilitation patients that they met on their 7,000 mile journey. These individuals were swimmers with muscular dystrophy training for the Paralympics, climbers who are legally blind, and quadriplegic soccer players and the four friends sought to tell their stories.\nBastian got in a dirt bike accident when he was in high school and lost most of his legs’ mobility. After six months, doctors told him that he’d probably be in a wheelchair for life. He said that his friends and family helped him come to accept his disability and move forward.\n“Knowing that yeah I lost half my body, but I didn’t lose my friends, that’s what kind of got me through,” Bastian said.\nGrowing up in a coastal town in Rhode Island, his friends were all sailors and surfers so there wasn’t any question about leaving that part of him on hold. Inspired by them and Jesse Billauer, a paraplegic surfer, Bastian dove back in. And he brought three new friends with him.\nClemens, Humphrey, and Burrell are childhood friends and met Bastian in 2010. After filming him surfing, they realized they wanted to do more. Thanks to a $10,000 grant from the Hartford Insurance Company in Connecticut, and $30,000 raised on Kick Starter, the Endless Abilities team’s dream was beginning to look possible. In the summer of 2012, the four friends drove cross-country searching for adaptive sports for people with physical disabilities and told their stories in a documentary film.\n“The project became much bigger than us. People were calling us saying ‘We really want to be a part of what you’re doing,’” Bastian said.\nPeople reached out to them and asked them to connect along the way.\n“The other half of the stops were done through our sponsor, Disabled Sports USA,” Humphrey said.\nDuring the road trip, Humphrey, Clemens, and Burrell experienced what Bastian’s daily life is like.\n“You get to really understand what someone’s going through in their shoes, when they’re in a wheelchair, when you live with them,” Clemens said. “I was learning to live with someone else’s abilities.”\nBastian said that some of his favorite parts of the trip were also the most unexpected. Although the four had been friends for about two years, they undoubtedly formed a special bond.\n“People look at me like ‘He’s the man, he’s the voice,’ but I’m just happy to be a part of their film. These guys are incredible. They’re phenomenal,” Bastian said.\nThey said what is special about adaptive sports is that it is such an equalizer, making it a level playing field for everyone. They came back from the summer of their lives, but it didn’t end there.\n“We have a deal with PBS and so starting this spring anyone can see the film on their local PBS station,” Humphrey said.\n“Endless Abilities” has gained quite an audience on small and big screens. Movie theatres have screenings, and people can take the film and create a fundraising event for themselves with it. Spaulding hospital and Vanderbilt hospital are showing the film to individuals with physical disabilities. According to Clemens, that’s their ultimate audience.\n“If we’re going to change, not just the three of us, but society as a whole, the way disabilities are perceived we really have to be not just in places where people with disabilities are like hospitals, we have to be in auditoriums like this and education facilities and change the culture,” Humphrey explained.\nTo keep the ball moving forward, they’ve created a film company called Windy Films, making short documentaries, based in Boston.\n“Our second documentary film is following a couple and their work to have the world’s first complete malaria vaccine and it will take us to Africa in about a week and a half,” Clemens said.\nThe team will be in Equatorial Guinea for a few weeks. For anyone who missed the screening, “Endless Abilities” is available on DVD.', 'The UCF community came together Thursday night for a vigil to remember three Muslim students who were shot and killed in North Carolina, a slaying that has the nation rattled. \nUCF alumni, students and members of the Muslim community gathered at the Reflecting Pond to honor the students killed in Chapel Hill, N.C., reportedly over a parking dispute.\nChapel Hill police identified the three victims as Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife, Yusor Mohammad, 21, of Chapel Hill, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, of Raleigh. The two female victims were sisters. Barakat and Yusor Mohammad were newly weds.\nNational media reported they were university students, Muslims of Arab descent and regularly volunteered in the area. Chapel Hill police arrested and charged their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, with three counts of murder after he turned himself in for the slayings. Police say the dispute was over parking spaces in their apartment complex.\nHicks described himself as an atheist on his Facebook page, criticizing religion and denouncing religious groups. After attention was drawn to Hicks’ Facebook page, civil rights advocates from the Muslim community declared it a hate crime, accusing Hicks of targeting the students for their Muslim faith. \nThe killings have sparked debate and controversy among the public, including students.\nUCF alumnus Rasha Mubarak, 29, and her husband planned the vigil as soon as they learned of the killings. Mubarak is Palestine American Muslim who serves as a board director at the Arab American Community Center and is newlywed herself.\n“I think what happened to three young American heroes, it shakes the core of the Muslim community and across the country,” Mubarak said. “This is very disturbing for many of us.”\nUCF alumnus and social worker, Drionne Arney, 24, sat on the grass waiting for the vigil to begin.\n“I feel sad,” Arney said. “As a black American woman, after everything that’s been happening in the news, I feel like we’re going through another civil rights movement that’s bigger than the one we know of.”\nThe vigil began at 6:50 p.m. While facing the guest speakers, children huddled together holding a banner with the victims faces, the trending Twitter hashtag, #MuslimLivesMatter, and a sign that read, “End Hate Speech, End Hate Crime #ChapelShooting.” \nTen representatives from various on-campus organizations introduced themselves in front of the crowd. Mia Warshofsky, a sophomore majoring in international relations and Spanish, was one of those representing her organization, Students For Justice In Palestine at UCF.\nAlthough she’s not part of the Muslim community, Warshofsky said she’s Jewish and felt “as a religious minority” she had to come out and show her solidarity.\n“It’s so sad,” Warshofsky said. “We like to think of America as tolerate, so accepting and to have three people killed like this… I want [the Muslim community] to not feel alone.

Instead, it serves to reflect a sentiment shared by the governing body of an institution — in this case, UCF’s.\nAt a time where universities around the U.S. are taking pro and anti-BDS stances, UCF SG held first reading to pass Resolution 52-05, which is “opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement at the University of Central Florida.”\nSG proposed the resolution under the same breath that it proposed, and later passed, the controversial Fiscal Bill 52-60, which voted to allocate $17,875 of student money to fund the right-wing political commentator Ben Shapiro to speak at the main campus and six UCF Police Department officers.\xa0\nMubarak and her group showed up to protest the resolution at the senate committee meeting on Feb. 6, the same night that another group of demonstrators also showed up to protest against the Ben Shapiro bill.\nThe proposer of the bill, Sen. Ben Rembaum, said amid so much controversy, he and the senate decided to postpone the anti-BDS resolution indefinitely — also known as “PPI” or “kill” the resolution — before the senate committee meeting even took place.\nAlthough Myers has said that SG is meant to be a strictly nonpartisan entity, some students said they feel like SG is leaning in a clear direction.\n“At this point, every time SG makes a ‘tough decision’ that ends up being contrary to our ‘core beliefs,’ I’m disappointed but not surprised,” said Shahaan Khan, director of political affairs for College Democrats at UCF. “The recent direction SG has taken with the bills they’ve been processing has been worrying.”\xa0\nSG supporters of the resolution said it was intended to be a stand against discrimination as a whole on campus.\nRembaum, a 20-year-old sophomore economics major, said the resolution was proposed in response to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks around college campuses in the U.S., though not specifically at UCF.\xa0\n“Even though this resolution says ‘Anti-BDS,’ it also targeted all forms of discrimination that go on in college campuses,” Rembaum said. “In my eyes and other people’s eyes, the people within the [BDS] movement at certain campuses caused discrimination and sometimes it caused violence, and I did not want that to happen to UCF.”\nOn the night of the resolution’s first hearing, Rembaum presented a slide show with images of an anti-Semitic white supremacist display that was reported on campus. The image showed the words, “LOVE not HATE,” with a swastika in place of the “O” for “LOVE,” and a Star of David in place of the “A” for “HATE.”\xa0\nThis confused Seema Azim, a UCF alumna of Afghan descent who attended the second hearing with Mubarak’s group. \nShe said the BDS Movement stands against the country of Israel’s politics to deny Palestinians their right to exist, not against the people of Israel or of the Jewish faith. Unlike white supremacy, which does.\n“It was kind of clear that people of the senate did not really understand what BDS was,” Azim said. “There were no Palestinian voices being considered, so all in all, it was a very one-sided approach. One-sided being that they believe BDS to be a discriminatory movement, which it is not.”\xa0\nRembaum, who said he joined UCF SG to serve as a voice for students, said he had not considered the other side of the argument when he’d presented the resolution. \nHe said that when he realized the resolution would do more harm than good, he began to change his mind.\n“I wasn’t able to talk to them about it beforehand because I don’t know many people in that community, and it’s hard for me to reach out to people I don’t know,” Rembaum said. “After hearing their concerns on the senate floor, after talking to them, after senate meetings and hearing their voices, I decided to kill the resolution.”\nMyers, who cosponsored the resolution, said it was meant to be preventative.\n“Not so much on UCF’s campus, but in a lot of other campuses around the country, we have seen a spike in the boycott divestment and sanctions of Israel, and just because a problem hasn’t been super present on our campus, that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening in other places or that it can’t happen at UCF,” Myers said.\xa0\nMyers also said the stance was supposed to be a pro-peace and pro-Israel act of support for the UCF Jewish community, and should not be seen as anti-Muslim.\xa0\n“BDS is almost inherently discriminatory, so I think that a lot of times there’s a lot of confusion with people who are pro-BDS,” Myers said. “Just because we’re doing something for the Jewish community does not mean the exact counter to that is something that is negative toward the Muslim community.”\nBut Grayson Lanza, a UCF alumnus of Jewish descent who attended the meetings as part of Mubarak’s group, said that standing for Israel does not necessarily mean standing for such a diverse community as the whole Jewish population.\xa0\nHe said anti-BDS resolutions and laws purposely weaponize Jewish identity in order to push a separate agenda.\xa0\n“Israel is often improperly associated, either in bad faith or by genuine misunderstanding, as representative and associative with all Jews,” Lanza said. “But not all Jews are Israeli, and historically, we were not for the most part, either. [They] claim it is to fight anti-Semitism; however, it is honestly anti-Semitic to conflate Israel with all Jews.”\nIn the end, when the demonstrators spoke at the committee, the senate assured them that they had already decided to kill the resolution and there was no need for further concern.\nMubarak, Azim and Lanza all said they still felt uneasy. Azim said she felt it would undermine first amendment rights to free speech for some students, in contrast to the Ben Shapiro bill, which passed namely on the arguments from supporters that it protects conservatives’ rights to free speech.\xa0\xa0\n“It’s scary because it kind of makes students — including me — feel like your entire school stands against your rights to express your concerns with human rights violations, and that’s not a nice feeling,” Azim said. “Standing up for oppressed populations already is isolating enough, and it can be marginalizing with a resolution like this on top of it. It would likely push students to not even talk about these things.”\xa0\nThat was Lanza’s main point at the committee meeting that evening. \nWhen he spoke, he made sure to stress the importance of SG including the entirety of the UCF community into these decisions — not just the few closest to them.\xa0\n“One of the most significant issues with the resolution was that there was zero effort from proponents of the resolution to discuss the matter with the UCF Palestinian community or the Orlando Palestinian community as a whole,” Lanza said. “These conversations so, so often erase Palestinians, and there is absolutely no denying that.

Instead, it serves to reflect a sentiment shared by the governing body of an institution — in this case, UCF’s.\nAt a time where universities around the U.S. are taking pro and anti-BDS stances, UCF SG held first reading to pass Resolution 52-05, which is “opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement at the University of Central Florida.”\nSG proposed the resolution under the same breath that it proposed, and later passed, the controversial Fiscal Bill 52-60, which voted to allocate $17,875 of student money to fund the right-wing political commentator Ben Shapiro to speak at the main campus and six UCF Police Department officers.\xa0\nMubarak and her group showed up to protest the resolution at the senate committee meeting on Feb. 6, the same night that another group of demonstrators also showed up to protest against the Ben Shapiro bill.\nThe proposer of the bill, Sen. Ben Rembaum, said amid so much controversy, he and the senate decided to postpone the anti-BDS resolution indefinitely — also known as “PPI” or “kill” the resolution — before the senate committee meeting even took place.\nAlthough Myers has said that SG is meant to be a strictly nonpartisan entity, some students said they feel like SG is leaning in a clear direction.\n“At this point, every time SG makes a ‘tough decision’ that ends up being contrary to our ‘core beliefs,’ I’m disappointed but not surprised,” said Shahaan Khan, director of political affairs for College Democrats at UCF. “The recent direction SG has taken with the bills they’ve been processing has been worrying.”\xa0\nSG supporters of the resolution said it was intended to be a stand against discrimination as a whole on campus.\nRembaum, a 20-year-old sophomore economics major, said the resolution was proposed in response to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks around college campuses in the U.S., though not specifically at UCF.\xa0\n“Even though this resolution says ‘Anti-BDS,’ it also targeted all forms of discrimination that go on in college campuses,” Rembaum said. “In my eyes and other people’s eyes, the people within the [BDS] movement at certain campuses caused discrimination and sometimes it caused violence, and I did not want that to happen to UCF.”\nOn the night of the resolution’s first hearing, Rembaum presented a slide show with images of an anti-Semitic white supremacist display that was reported on campus. The image showed the words, “LOVE not HATE,” with a swastika in place of the “O” for “LOVE,” and a Star of David in place of the “A” for “HATE.”\xa0\nThis confused Seema Azim, a UCF alumna of Afghan descent who attended the second hearing with Mubarak’s group. \nShe said the BDS Movement stands against the country of Israel’s politics to deny Palestinians their right to exist, not against the people of Israel or of the Jewish faith. Unlike white supremacy, which does.\n“It was kind of clear that people of the senate did not really understand what BDS was,” Azim said. “There were no Palestinian voices being considered, so all in all, it was a very one-sided approach. One-sided being that they believe BDS to be a discriminatory movement, which it is not.”\xa0\nRembaum, who said he joined UCF SG to serve as a voice for students, said he had not considered the other side of the argument when he’d presented the resolution. \nHe said that when he realized the resolution would do more harm than good, he began to change his mind.\n“I wasn’t able to talk to them about it beforehand because I don’t know many people in that community, and it’s hard for me to reach out to people I don’t know,” Rembaum said. “After hearing their concerns on the senate floor, after talking to them, after senate meetings and hearing their voices, I decided to kill the resolution.”\nMyers, who cosponsored the resolution, said it was meant to be preventative.\n“Not so much on UCF’s campus, but in a lot of other campuses around the country, we have seen a spike in the boycott divestment and sanctions of Israel, and just because a problem hasn’t been super present on our campus, that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening in other places or that it can’t happen at UCF,” Myers said.\xa0\nMyers also said the stance was supposed to be a pro-peace and pro-Israel act of support for the UCF Jewish community, and should not be seen as anti-Muslim.\xa0\n“BDS is almost inherently discriminatory, so I think that a lot of times there’s a lot of confusion with people who are pro-BDS,” Myers said. “Just because we’re doing something for the Jewish community does not mean the exact counter to that is something that is negative toward the Muslim community.”\nBut Grayson Lanza, a UCF alumnus of Jewish descent who attended the meetings as part of Mubarak’s group, said that standing for Israel does not necessarily mean standing for such a diverse community as the whole Jewish population.\xa0\nHe said anti-BDS resolutions and laws purposely weaponize Jewish identity in order to push a separate agenda.\xa0\n“Israel is often improperly associated, either in bad faith or by genuine misunderstanding, as representative and associative with all Jews,” Lanza said. “But not all Jews are Israeli, and historically, we were not for the most part, either. [They] claim it is to fight anti-Semitism; however, it is honestly anti-Semitic to conflate Israel with all Jews.”\nIn the end, when the demonstrators spoke at the committee, the senate assured them that they had already decided to kill the resolution and there was no need for further concern.\nMubarak, Azim and Lanza all said they still felt uneasy. Azim said she felt it would undermine first amendment rights to free speech for some students, in contrast to the Ben Shapiro bill, which passed namely on the arguments from supporters that it protects conservatives’ rights to free speech.\xa0\xa0\n“It’s scary because it kind of makes students — including me — feel like your entire school stands against your rights to express your concerns with human rights violations, and that’s not a nice feeling,” Azim said. “Standing up for oppressed populations already is isolating enough, and it can be marginalizing with a resolution like this on top of it. It would likely push students to not even talk about these things.”\xa0\nThat was Lanza’s main point at the committee meeting that evening. \nWhen he spoke, he made sure to stress the importance of SG including the entirety of the UCF community into these decisions — not just the few closest to them.\xa0\n“One of the most significant issues with the resolution was that there was zero effort from proponents of the resolution to discuss the matter with the UCF Palestinian community or the Orlando Palestinian community as a whole,” Lanza said. “These conversations so, so often erase Palestinians, and there is absolutely no denying that. Regardless of your opinions, Palestinians are the ones who suffer from the conflict the most.”\xa0\nMubarak recognized not adopting the resolution was good news but addressed the heavy responsibility of setting a premise on such dangerous rhetoric, arguing that it promotes xenophobia among students.\nShe said she fears for the future of UCF under divisive management and said she exhorts the student governing body to take accountability to heart.\xa0\n“When you introduce language like that, it takes seconds to further disenfranchise these communities,” Mubarak said. “As leaders, yes, you have power, but it is within you to decide if you want to divide or unify. And you have taken a stance to send a message of division, and within that division comes hate and violence against these communities.”']"
