Before Israel was arrested, the officer wrote, he was “clearing a traffic stop on University Blvd. and Turbine Dr.,” which is the entrance to the plaza where Knight Library and Fubar are located.\nUCF police Ofc. Holt first noticed Israel’s SUV, he wrote, because his headlights were off while he was driving down University Blvd. toward Alafaya Trail. Holt then followed Israel to that intersection, and wrote that Israel was driving erratically while approaching the intersection and then while turning left onto Alafaya Trail, so he pulled him over at Centaurus Drive and Alafaya Trail.\nHolt’s affidavit suggests Israel put his windshield wiper on by mistake, thinking it was his headlights, because he was allegedly intoxicated.\nHolt wrote that Israel told him he had been drinking at TD’s Sports Bar earlier in the night, and even possibly filled in as a bartender for a friend. However, Holt said Israel also initially told him he was coming from Science Drive, even though Science Drive didn’t intersect with University Blvd., where Holt first noticed him.\n“Most of what Mr. Israel was saying seemed to not make any sense,” Holt wrote.\nHolt had Israel perform several field sobriety tests after smelling alcohol on his breath and noticing his eyes were “extremely red and glassy.” Based on the tests, Holt brought Israel to the Orange County DUI Testing Center.\nIsrael initially refused to submit to the\xa0breathalyser test, but was apparently persuaded to do so by Holt, after “explaining the\xa0consequences\xa0for (Israel’s) different options multiple times,” according to the affidavit.\nThe\xa0affidavit states Israel\xa0blew twice. The first reading at 4:48 a.m. came in at \xa0.165, and the next reading, at 4:52 a.m., came in at .177. The legal limit in Florida is .08.\nIsrael was arrested and booked into the Orange County Jail shortly thereafter. Records show he bonded out shortly before noon.\nKnightNews.com sent Israel a Facebook message seeking his side of the story, but he has not replied. UCF Police spokesman Cpl. James Roop also has, so far, declined to comment on this high-profile arrest. Click here to read the entire five page affidavit yourself.\nKnightNews.com wants to know: Have you, or anyone you know, been pulled over by UCF police off campus lately? Are UCF police employing the same aggressive DUI enforcement tactics off campus that they have been reported to use on campus, such as “courtesy stops” around the same times the bars close? E-mail us at news@knightnews.com to share your story, or call our tip line at 407-5-tip-UCF to let us know. \nIsrael, who attended University High School before playing for UCF, led the Knights to a Conference USA Championship in 2007. He played professional football earlier this year in Germany, and came back to Orlando and worked as a commentator for Bright House Sports Network.\nWe are gathering more information on this developing story and are attempting to contact Israel for his side of the story.\nUCF Police Spokesman Cpl.

KnightNews.com launched in the middle of July and became UCF’s only news source locally owned by students. Since our launch, we’ve produced hundreds of videos and focused on a 24-hour breaking news format. Since UCF doesn’t have a student-run TV station, 2009 marked the first year students enjoyed consistently produced video content geared toward their interests. It seems fair to say that KnightNews.com has revolutionized how students stay informed  — and entertained — at UCF.\nVIDEO: Our search for UCF students auditioning for American Idol was one of our first videos.\n\nA New Quarterback Came To UCF\nKnightNews.com was the first campus media to report about a new quarterback who quietly transferred to UCF from Wake Forest. We reported how this new Knight would fight for the starting QB job, and Brett Hodges did just that. Hodges eventually won the starting job, and helped the Knights recover from a rough season start, due in part to former starting QB Rob Calabrese’s inconsistency. Hodges went on to lead the Knights to its first ever win over a ranked opponent, and a winning season.\nBoard of Trustees Slashes Majors, Jobs\nThe tough economic times plaguing the nation, hit home at UCF this summer. In July, the UCF Board of Trustees voted to cut several majors from campus. The move cost 1,000 students their majors and 37 employees their jobs. It saved $4.6 million from UCF’s budget. Administrators said the cuts were critical and needed, while faculty union reps claimed administrators had plenty of money in reserves. Regardless, the meeting was emotional, reducing on BOT member, Ida Cook, to tears. Only Cook and SGA President Brian Peterson voted against the cuts. The cuts came after UCF students saw unprecedented tuition and fee increases this school year.\nDeaths of 2 Popular Students Occurred Days Apart, Shook Student Body \nThe end of July marked a sad time for the Knights, with the deaths of students Trevor Shipley and J.P. Saul happening just days apart. Shipley, a member of Beta Theta Pi, died in a car accident in Tavares. Members of Shipley’s fraternity spoke at his memorial in Tavares. KnightNews.com provided a live streaming video of the service, and later uploaded the entire video for those unable to attend. Saul, known as the “Van Wilder of UCF” for his love of partying,  died of unknown circumstances in his Boardwalk apartment. Friends designed T-shirts to wear at tailgates in his honor, and organized memorial services at UCF’s Reflecting Pond and Knight Library, his favorite Happy Hour spot. Proceeds from the shirts went to help his family with Saul’s final expenses.\nAUGUST 2009: \nUCF Surpasses UF as the Largest School in Florida, Becomes Third Largest in Nation\nWith UCF’s freshmen class of 2013 pouring onto campus in August, the University of Central Florida officially outgrew UF and became the largest school in the state. The preliminary fall 2009 headcount showed 53,811 students enrolled. UCF officials boasted about the No. 1 ranking, but we reported about horrible parking headaches to plague students — especially around the first few days of class. We showed you how Parking Services was unforgiving, dishing out hundreds of tickets to new students who claimed they didn’t know they couldn’t park on curves. (http://knightnews.com/2009/08/parking-a-big-problem-on-ucfs-first-day-of-class/)\nUCF Grad Blasts Into Space \nAs 100 current UCF students watched Space Shuttle Discovery blast off from a campus parking garage this August, a former UCF student was living her dream on board. With Saturday’s awe-inspiring midnight launch, Nicole Stott became the first UCF graduate to soar into space. Stott earned a UCF master’s degree in Engineering Management in 1992, and credits the support of her professors and program with giving her the confidence boost to go for her dream and apply to be an astronaut.\nSEPTEMBER 2009: \nSGA Senate Elections Marred By Bribery Scandal\nIn September, KnightNews.com broke news of an elections scandal involving SGA veteran William Lusk and UCF’s College Republicans. Lusk was found in major violation of SGA Election Statutes, for allegedly attempting to bribe the College Republicans club with money, in exchange for the group endorsing Lusk’s Unite Ticket. The elections commission voted 7 to 1 in favor of William Lusk receiving a major violation. Lusk appealed the finding to SGA’s Judicial Council, but his attempts to keep his Senate seat were unsuccessful — the council upheld the initial finding against him. Despite talking to KnightNews.com before we broke the scandal, Lusk refused to talk to us after we brought you the news. Because of that, our cameras chased him trying to ask the tough questions anyway. The video became popular, drawing a fierce debate on the comments section between both political sides.\nAll Fraternities Go On Suspension After Parent Claims Pledge Was Beaten, Bruised\nClaims of a brutal pledge beating rocked UCF’s Greek community after KnightNews.com broke the exclusive details revealing how a parent called UCF President John Hitt’s office saying she found her son “beaten and bruised” by his fraternity. After the call, UCF officials persuaded all fraternities to go under a short “voluntary” suspension, drawing criticism from Greek leaders. It was later revealed in an e-mail to Greek leaders from the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life that the anonymous caller accused an African American Fraternity of the beating. UCF had said they never were able to confirm the claims, so no fraternity ended up being punished for the accusations.\nPresident Hitt Gives Student Media First Known Interview in Years\nAfter years of declining interview requests with campus media because of a controversy over an old political cartoon, UCF President John Hitt broke his silence to KnightNews.com. Hitt gave an exclusive interview to KnightNews.com reporters following his Sept. open forum. Despite Hitt clearing off more than an hour of his schedule and sending out a campus e-mail advertising the forum, only two students showed up to ask questions. In our exclusive interview after the forum, Hitt told KnightNews.com that although the forums usually last longer, he was not completely surprised to see how quickly it ended. He elaborated on this claim by saying that very few questions indicate students’ contentment with how the University is run. However, after we published the story, many students commented that they never got the e-mail. The problem could have been with the new Knights e-mail system, which was in its early stages at the time.\nCops Arrest UCF Bartenders, UCF Helped Plan the Undercover Sting Operations\nAs bar after bar in the UCF area was being hit by an underage drinking sting, KnightNews.com was providing live continuous coverage, telling you which bars were being hit, and how the cops were conducting their operations. Several student bartenders were arrested from at least three area bars, including Devaney’s, Scoops and TD’s Sports Bar.  After breaking the news of the bar busts, KnightNews.com did some digging, and discovered UCF President John Hitt was a co-creator of the task force that planned and carried out undercover operations. Hitt created the task force, along with Orange County Mayor Richard Crotty in 2008, after it was discovered that two UCF freshmen died in alcohol-related accidents. We exposed how the deputies used 18-year-old “confidential informants” to buy alcohol from bartenders. After our report, we haven’t heard of any other stings using that technique at UCF bars.\nUCF Greeks Dance for a Good Cause, Videos a Big Hit on KnightNews.com\nEach fall, Kappa Delta and Zeta Tau Alpha sororities get UCF’s Greek community up on stage to dance for a good cause. KnightNews.com gave both events coverage like never before, including quickly uploading videos of all the fraternities and sororities performances. The videos quickly became a big hit, and led to never before seen video coverage of organizations dances during Homecoming as well.\nTailgate Time Cuts Meet Fierce Opposition from Outrages Alumni, Students \nAngry alumni raised their voices at meetings — and some even showed up on game day and sat in protest — after UCF officials announced a plan to make major cuts to tailgating start times for night games. Administrators said it was to make the game day safer, less about alcohol and save money. Some fans said it the change was unacceptable — especially because UCF waited to tell fans about the change until after season tickets were bought. Attendance during games was down this year. Was it because of the time cuts, or just the economy?  We report, you decide!\nTailgate Time Cuts Didn’t Stop People From Getting Drunk, As Seen on Our Fan Cam \nA new UCF tradition was born this year, with the KnightNews.com fan cam. Patrolling UCF’s Memory Mall with a camera during tailgate parties proved quite entertaining, and this quickly became one of our most popular segments. We saw everything from Knights running around to upper classmen teaching freshmen how to dance and the best places to party. We saw tailgaters wearing practically nothing, and some wearing giant paintings of sex organs on their bodies. It was an interesting and entertaining time, and is sure to be back next year!\nOCTOBER 2009\nAnother Popular UCF Student, Brother of ATO, Dies in Car Crash\nUCF lost another Knight in a tragic car crash in October. John Grosso, a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, was only 21 when he died. He and a friend, who did not attend UCF, crashed on Tanner Rd. after coming around a sharp curve in the early morning hours. Grosso’s fraternity brothers held a candlelight vigil at their house, and invited KnightNews.com to document the tribute to their fallen friend.\nCreepy Sex Offender Stars in YouTube Video\nOK, so this didn’t have much to do about UCF, but we covered it. This elderly, and very creepy, sex offender got in trouble for posting videos on YouTube. He’d sing in the videos, or have his dog bite his stomach. He was booked in a Central Florida jail. The videos are something else. Take a look!\nMarcus Jordan’s Shoes Cost UCF Millions\nWhen the UCF Knights basketball team scored the son of NBA legend Michael Jordan to play on the team, they also inherited a little problem — Marcus Jordan doesn’t wear Adidas shoes. UCF promised Marcus he could wear his dad’s Air Jordan brand by Nike during recruitment. But the Adidas reps UCF got the OK from, weren’t high enough on the totem pole to OK that. In the end, Jordan wore Jordans, and UCF lost the $3 Million Adidas deal.\nString of Robbers Targeting UCF Students Still at Large\nThe Orange County Sheriff’s Office released surveillance video to KnightNews.com showing the faces of the men investigators believe to be involved in the robbery to Jimmy John’s on University Blvd. at gunpoint in October.\xa0The video of the suspected robbers was taken outside Shamrock Liquor Store, in the shopping plaza with McDonald’s right across from UCF, before the Jimmy John’s was robbed early Oct. 4. These suspects are still on the run.\nUCF Student Arrested For Seeking ‘Kinky’ Sex With Underage Girl\nWe were the first local news source to\xa0tell you about a UCF student accused of a heinous Internet sex crime. Nathan B. Schaller stands accused of taking pictures of his penis and pleasuring himself over a Web cam while wearing a UCF T-shirt — all to try and lure what he thought was a 14-year-old girl into “kinky sex,” according to a Palm Beach County charging affidavit obtained by KnightNews.com. It turns out, the person on the other end of the computer wasn’t a young girl, but an undercover agent instead.\nNOVEMBER 2009\nVortex Amazing Takes Area By Storm\nIf you haven’t been in this thing yet, you have to try it at least once. This big trailer likes to post up next to Scoop, and lure drunk students in for a $2.00 cover charge. When you are inside, you feel it’s “vortex” power. The guy who owns it works in construction, and made it to stay afloat during the tough economic times.\nKnights Make Historic Football Win, Cops Grab, Detain UCF Fan Who Tried Storming Field\nWhen UCF beat the nationally ranked Houston Cougars — the first victory ever against a ranked team — one UCF fan tried celebrating the way many college campuses would with such a win, by storming the field. But UCF police had different plans for him. Armed with riot gear, including an apparent bean bag gun and dogs, the fan was swarmed and taken down. KnightNews.com captured exclusive video of it unfolding. What shocked many fans was, CBS College Sports reported O’Leary gave fans permission to storm the field before the game, so long as the Knights won. We asked UCF police and UCF Athletics for comment about why O’Leary and police apparently were not on the same page, but we never got an answer to that question.\nKyle Schumacher, Caitlyn McManus Named UCF Homecoming King and Queen\nDuring UCF’s Historic Homecoming game against nationally-ranked Houston, Kyle Schumacher and Caitlyn McManus were crowned UCF Homecoming King and Queen. McManus is a member of Alpha Xi Delta sorority, and Schumacher is a DU, but more widely known for being elected IFC President. What will the future hold for these two? Could either make a run for SGA President in Spring? Schumacher has worked in the White House before, so anything’s possible! We will watch them both closely, and of course, break the news if they do — or don’t — decide to throw their hats in the ring.\nBomb Scare Rocks Campus, Days After Mass Downtown Orlando Shooting\nTensions were high following a mass shooting in Downtown Orlando, and days after that horror unfolded just down the 408, the UCF campus became center stage for a major bomb scare. The FBI and bomb squad came to campus and shut down garages after UCF police arrested student Cory Carr for making a bomb threat in Classroom 1. No bomb was ever found, and Carr later blamed the incident on a misunderstanding caused by his reaction to Obama’s plan to send troops to Afghanistan. Carr, a former marine, claims he spoke out loud, saying the US should blow the terrorists up, rather than put US marines in harm’s way. Other students, he said, misheard him, and reported him for claiming he planed to blow up Classroom 1 when he never planned to. Carr says UCF found him not in violation of any campus rules at his hearing.\nBeta Theta Pi Gets UCF to Back Down, Let Them on Campus Early, Despite Sexual Misconduct Finding\nThe brothers of Beta Theta Pi will be back on campus in by Summer of 2010, despite being found in violation of school rules prohibiting sexual misconduct by UCF’s Office of Student Conduct. Beta Theta Pi was suspended by UCF after being accused of gang raping a girl, but the girl later dropped the case. A controversy ensued when UCF found the group to have committed sexual misconduct, based on school rules, despite the criminal case being dropped. Beta showed UCF it would fight them in court, and UCF backed down and cut the suspension in half as part of the settlement.\nT-Pain, Asher Roth, Party at Scoop with UCF Students\nAfter UCF’s homecoming concert, headliners T-Pain and Asher Roth kept the party going — at UCF’s popular college bar, Scoop. The two posed with students, and KnightNews.com posted exclusive photos of the party. It wasn’t all fun though, we got reports that T-Pain ordered lots of top shelf drinks, but didn’t pay the bill, never mind tip his bartenders.\nDECEMBER 2009\nKnights Lose to Rutgers in St. Pete Bowl\nHopes were high that UCF would beat the Big East’s Rutgers in the St. Pete Bowl, and show the BCS conference it’s where we belong. But the game merely proved we couldn’t hang with the big boys. O’Leary even said he was embarrassed by the performance. QB Brett Hodges went out on a low note, and the man he replaced, Rob Calabrese, finished out the last game after Hodges took one too many hard hits. All in all, the Knights seemed to appreciate Hodges though, and at least he didn’t cry after losing — unlike the QB for that smaller university a little bit to our north.\nOur QB’s Don’t Cry, But Do They Drink and Drive?\nKyle Israel made headlines as UCF’s star Quarterback in 2007, when he led the Knights to a C-USA championship, and against Mississippi State in the Autozone Liberty Bowl. (Which we lost). But he also made headlines two years after his glory days ended — for being arrested on DUI charges near campus. UCF police made the bust, claiming he was twice the legal limit. Israel has declined comment.\nThe entire staff at KnightNews.com thanks all of you for your tremendous support this year. Be sure to invite your friends to be our facebook fan, and send us tips by e-mailing news@knightnews.com. We want to hear from you, and how we can better serve the campus.

402,UCF,2011-02-10,journal_data/txt/UCF/2011_02_10.txt,"['At Northern Michigan University this morning, President Barack Obama made a statement on Egypt, which put the historical importance of what’s unfolding there into perspective. \n“We are following today’s events in Egypt very closely,” Obama said. “And we’ll have more to say as this plays out, but what is absolutely clear is that we are witnessing history unfold. The moment of transformation that’s taking place because the people of Egypt are calling for change.\n“And they’ve turned out in extraordinary numbers, representing all ages and all walks of life, but its young people who have been at the forefront. A new generation. Your generation, who want their voices to be heard. So going forward, we want those young people to know, and we want all Egyptians to know Americans will continue do everything that we can to support an orderly and genuine transition to democracy in Egypt.” \nThe movement means a lot to those in the UCF community with ties to Egypt and the middle east. \n\n“This all started with a man wanting his dignity and honor,” says Somaya Mellouli, a Norwegian born UCF Psych Major and US citizen whose family is from Tunisia. \nAfter burning himself in protest of the confiscation of his merchandise and the humiliation inflicted on him by a female municipal officer, Mohamed Bouaziz’s death on Dec 17th, 2010 sparked the Tunisian ‘Jasmine Revolution’ which spread to Egypt. On Jan 25th, 2011 hundreds of protestors took to the streets in Egypt in response to a call that originated from a facebook page with 87,000 followers that was initially set up to honor him. “Our protest on the 25th is the beginning of the end” wrote the organizers. \nIbrahim Zeini, a Scottish born UCF Grad Student and US Citizen whose family is from Egypt said: “People in Egypt and most of the Middle Eastern countries have been living in fear of speaking, breathing, living and have witnessed corruption. Anyone who spoke out or tried to speak would be intimidated, tortured, and sometimes would even disappear. It is hard to believe, since we (in the USA) live with so much freedom especially freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. Also one thing we take for granted is the right to vote. Imagine living for 50 or so years under governments that are not accountable to anyone.”\nEgypt’s economy is another factor that has played a role in the uprising. About 40% of the people in Egypt live on less than $2 a day. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US aid after Israel. According to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Egypt has received $28billion in assistance since 1975. \nWhile these funds have been used for programs devoted to health, education and trade among other things, most US aid goes to Egypt’s military. According to the US State Department, over $1.3 billion received by Egypt annually is through a stream of funding known as Foreign Military Financing. \nDalia Mahgoub, a UCF Electrical  Engineering Graduate Student who was born and raised in Egypt, and has lived in the US for last 10 years says: “It was already bad when I was living there. Everything was way too expensive and you were basically either really rich or really poor with a few exceptions of course that you could barely find. But I do talk to my family over there at least once a week and from what they tell me it has gotten a lot worse than when I was living there. It is not just the economy. People live in constant fear of the government. People graduate college and have no jobs and if you wanted to get married that’s almost completely out of the question because if you can’t support yourself how are you going to support a family.”\nOn February 4, hundreds of thousands of anti-government protestors gathered in Cairo’s Tahrir Square for ‘The Day of Departure’ chanting for President Hosni Mubarak to leave. At least six people are reported to have died so far and more than 1,500 others injured in clashes, according to officials and doctors quoted by the Reuters news agency. \nReem Abdallah, a UCF Freshman and US Citizen whose parents are from Egypt has mixed emotions. \n“I’m definitely happy that there is a mood for change and democracy but also very sad and worried about my country and people,” Abdallah said. “All the martyrs and horrific incidents from the past couple of days make me believe that we can’t stop now. These innocent people died for change for us and we must honor them by continuing their path until what they were asking for, simple change and human rights, is inputted into the Egyptian government. These people I see everyday in the protests made me very proud to be Egyptian and made me see my country with a new perspective; one that is full of optimism and hope for a better future.” \nMariam Zeini, a UCF/USF Medical School student and US Citizen whose family is also from Egypt says: “I continuously refresh the screen on my homepage to see if there is any news. I am glued to the television, watching history unfold. The events that are occurring in Egypt are historical. The outcome will affect generations to come. Millions have been protesting for over two weeks in order to gain their rights and have a government that represents them. The situation is not an easy one, but change is never easy. I see the masses of people courageously standing up for what is right, I watch and I pray that no one else will get hurt. It’s amazing to see the protesters standing, unified together. People want their children to grow up in a country based on principles. They want to be paid for their hard work, they want to have food for their families, they want their votes to count and their voices to be heard. The price of freedom has not been cheap, but God willingly, the end result will be priceless.” \nOutside the UCF Student Union, Ali Kurnaz a UCF Political Science Major, has been collecting petitions to demand for Human Rights and Democracy in the Middle East on behalf of the Progressive Caucus of the College Democrats at UCF. Kurnaz believes that it’s important to be sympathetic to the plight of those struggling for democracy. Kurnaz says this issue should concern UCF students because unlike in the USA, many students who receive college degrees in these countries may end up having to sell fruits on the streets because they can’t even find jobs and because most people cannot voice their concerns and demand their rights openly in the Middle East.  \nOn Tuesday the White House called for “Restraining the Ministry of Interior’s conduct by immediately ending the arrests, harassment, beating, and detention of journalists, and political and civil society activists, and allowing freedom of assembly and expression; and immediately rescinding the emergency law. US Vice President Joe Biden has also pressured for “an orderly transition of power that is prompt, meaningful, peaceful and legitimate.”  \nWhen asked for her comments, Rasha Mubarak, a Molecular Biology & Microbiology UCF Alumni and present Youth Director for the Arab American Cultural Association (AACC) took the opportunity to present an open invitation to UCF families to join the AACC’s very first Arab American Cultural Festival in Orlando on Feb 27th from noon – 7pm at Lake Eola saying, “There is no better time than to be proud to be Tunisian, to be proud to be Egyptian, to be proud to be an Arab American.

Some faculty tend to bring in things they have created and it’s been somewhere else,” Hernandez said. “We want to present something to the school and the public that has not been on show for five years, and mostly everything here is 2011, 2012.”\nThe Visual Arts department offers a variety of specialties apparent in the eclectic exhibit, which includes such art mediums as photography, digital print, painting, drawing, ceramics, 3D animation, and three different forms of sculpture. \n“This year we actually have one of the professors doing a performance piece, which is unusual, we don’t always have someone doing that so what we’ll do is they’re going to do the performance [at the opening], someone will be videotaping them and then we’ll have their performance piece looping on a TV,” Gallery Coordinator Diane Daugherty said.\nAssistant Professor Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz performed the piece throughout the opening event where she appeared in Victorian era clothing, sat on a throne with a costumed woman by her side and held a silver tray on her lap that was filled with trash.\nAlso looping on a television in a small makeshift theater is an animation piece called “Dentophobia” by Darlene Hadrika, with a musical score by Professor Stella Sung.\n“Darlene is putting on her own personal animation, written and completely generated by her own effort, which is pretty impressive,” Digital Media Instructor JoAnne Adams said about her coworker.\nAdams is also featuring work, including a three-piece set called “Earth Sky Series. “I had been doing some, I’ll call it digital collage, because I start with my own photography and then take the photographs apart and piece them together into a separate piece and play with space and interpretation of space,” Adams said.\nAdams earned a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts degree from the University of New Orleans and a Master’s of Fine Arts from the University of Florida. She started teaching at UCF in 2008, after working as a professional artist for years. “I have always wanted to be a teacher and I got my BFA and started working right away as an artist and had a really nice career at Disney in feature animation\nfor 15 years and so, saved up enough money to go back and get my MFA,” Adams said. “I always wanted to give back.”\nDaugherty said that professors have a duty to exhibit their work to students at the gallery.\n“I see it as a responsibility on the professors part, because they are professional artists therefore they should be creating as a professional artist,” Daugherty said. “By presenting your work you are showing your students this is what a professional artist does.”\nAbout 200 people attended the exhibit’s opening reception, including Israel Perez, an art student who has taken classes with featured faculty including\nInstructor Matt Dombrowski and Associate Professor Scott F. Hall. Perez favored a sculpture by Assistant Professor David Isenhour called “The Better to See You With.” “I really like the plan, the form, how the pedestal is dripping with paint,” he said.\nHernandez also commented on the sculpture. “It’s this piece that you want it to come to life and you’re staring at these eyeballs and foam and you’re just staring waiting for one of them to twitch and if you stare at it long enough you might think it does,” Hernandez said. “It’s this dark, cynical piece that you can’t help but appreciate.”\nAlthough visitors admire the exhibit, Daugherty said that because of a lack of funding, the gallery has made cut backs that affect the quality of their shows. About three months ago they had to let their art specialist go because they lacked funding for the full time position.\nThe gallery is funded by donations and partly through the Jenkins Family Foundation.\n“It was set up in 1986 to help UCF fund, focus on art, art therapy, art administration, and art education,” Daugherty said.\nBecause their budget does not allow for a full staff, the gallery relies on volunteers like Alison Yorinks and Kayla Robinson. During two and a half to three hour shifts, three times a week, these volunteers contribute by greeting guests, completing data entry projects, and answering phones. Other duties include hanging artwork, labeling, archiving, and maintaining the gallery walls.\n“It’s very informative, more so this year,” Yorinks said. “We are getting more experienced with gallery tasks.” Yorinks, a senior interdisciplinary major has volunteered since her junior year and recommends that students visit the gallery. “It’s free to anyone, you don’t have to be a student,” Yorinks said. “You never know what you’ll find here.”\nThe exhibition runs through Nov. 16, and the gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/10/ucf-art-gallery-hosts-annual-faculty-exhibit/'],0.32430559396743774,0.5702274441719055,0.19179198145866394

As a registered student organization the SGA President has the ability to dissolve any organization on campus with his signature, however, has not decided to do so, fearing bringing SGA and UCF into a controversy with free speech rights and a possible lawsuit, according to SGA sources familiar with the situation.\nThe Ahlul Bayt Society has told us they seek the full audio and visual recording from the person who uploaded the video, which appears to be a member of The United West organization.

897,UCF,2013-01-24,journal_data/txt/UCF/2013_01_24.txt,"['The debate over gun control is a hot topic these days in the wake of the numerous shootings that seem to happen every time you turn on the news in this country. KnightNews.com sought out different opinions on the subject from students who all shared their views.\nMelissa Colon:\nGun control will not lead to a decrease in murders. Instead it will tighten the noose that the government already has tied around us. Just as the so-called war on drugs has not minimized drug usage, but has cost taxpayers over $1 billion annually to imprison pot offenders while our government hands over guns to Mexican cartels. A war declared by Reagan despite his approval to use drug traffickers to transport illegal arms into Nicaragua that resulted in an increase in the cocaine trade in California. The belief that gun control will stop mass murder, is just as naïve as believing that banning abortion will stop the practice of abortions.\nWhile many will choose to point fingers only at the Obama administration, or the Bush administration, the media and the\xa0government have succeeded in dividing us into left and right- literally. To believe that gun rights are our only rights being stripped away, we have failed to look closely at laws being passed or that have passed under the guise to protect our freedom. When organizing a protest gets you listed as a domestic terrorist, such as the case of Occupy Wall Street organizer Shannon McLeish from Daytona Beach, Florida, you should stop and wonder if gun rights are the only issue we should be worried about.\nLastly, we have become so distracted that we fail to notice how the shooters become celebrities. Our fascination with stardom feeds another fame-starved individual who watches, plots, and relies on the media to make them a star. Just as reality television stars are overnight celebrities, so is the shooter. Suddenly, everyone is in shock and affected by the death of innocent school children. While each shooting is a tragedy, many have forgotten that it is happening everyday at our expense like the $3 trillion that American taxpayers give to Israel annually to supply them with weapons to shoot Palestinian children throwing rocks. Somewhere along the way we are taught that we can justify and differentiate the act of killing another human even if it is someone else pulling the trigger.\nEvan Gregory:\nMy response to the proposed gun control plan goes as follows: banning guns such as the AR-15 on the basis of name or design will only lead to gun manufacturers designing different guns. Not\xa0only that, but this does not account for the fact that there are millions of guns of those types in circulation and are readily accessible if you have the money. The most annoying thing on this list of proposed measures has to be reducing clip size to a ten-bullet maximum. Do legislatures not realize that reloading a gun however many\xa0more times will not stop anybody from shooting anything up once they’ve decided that they are going to go through with it? I think hiking the price on ammunition would do a lot more help then adjusting the capacity at which you could carry it.\nI believe it is integral for everyone in America to own some kind of weapon in this day and age for his or her own protection. Regardless of whether you’re for or against any kind of gun legislature, the 10 minutes you spend waiting for the police to respond to your 911 call when 3 armed men barge into your house with illegally obtained weapons could mean life or death for your family. When the forefathers drafted the constitution, I’m sure they didn’t intend every single citizen to have rocket propelled grenades in their closets waiting to blow up anything in their way, but they did realize that at the end of the day, in the face of tyrannical government, it was the people’s responsibility to join in arms against the types of government that existed in the Revolution that brought about this country. I can guarantee that nobody thought in a million years that Caesar would march his armies over the Rhine to become the sole leader of Rome in 49 BCE, but there was no one to stop him once he did.\nTake a country like Switzerland for example that despite two world wars and many sweeping religious changes has maintained its sovereignty with such volatile neighbors as Spain, France, and Italy. Despite the Russians and Nazi’s sweeping through Europe in the 30’s and 40’s it’s not certain to many people why they didn’t get swept up in the campaign trail during World War II. This is because their militia involves every man in the country and the citizens are armed and trained to defend the homeland on a second’s notice. The problem with our second amendment isn’t the fact that it allows everyone to own any kind of weapon they can buy; the problem exists because we only follow the guidelines of this to a point, highlighting only the final sentence of the second most important amendment of them all, the amendment that makes sure the government will continue to honor our first.\nSo to those of you blaming Sandy Hook on the fact that Adam Lanza was able to get his hands on an AR-15 and impose his will on those children need to realize that it is his mom’s fault for not properly storing her firearm to NRA guidelines. Stop blaming society; stop blaming the media, start realizing that it is the individual that decides to make these rash decisions, him and him only. He could have ran in with a hammer, he could have ran in with a cigarette and killed them with second hand smoke (both of which contribute to more deaths than guns by astronomical numbers in the US every year) but unfortunately for many gun owners like me, he knew the combination to his mom’s gun safe and had to ruin it for all of America’s gun owners.\nNolan Thompson:\n“A person who demands further gun control legislation is like a chicken who roots for Colonel Sanders.” – Larry Elder.\nThroughout history weapons have always played a vital role in society. Without weapons we would not have been able to hunt as efficiently and evolve to where we are today. Weapons have been responsible for the destruction and creation of civilizations.\xa0When tragedy strikes, our immediate reaction is to make a law that takes away another freedom. The Patriot Act is an example of this.\nMahatma Ghandi said, “Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.”\nI think it would be hypocritical for a governing body that uses billions of individual tax dollars to fund its military, to decide if those same individuals should have guns or what types of guns to have.\n“Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants.” -Andrew Jackson\nI think guns should be regulated to an extent that all law abiding citizens that have passed a background check and safety course can own a gun. It’s important for each individual to remember that a gun is a violent tool that can cause unprecedented\xa0 social consequences. A gun is a tool that should only be used for food and the protection of freedom as a last line of defense.\nJake Rakoci:\nIf there is anything we can do as a nation to quell gun violence, by all means we should take steps in the direction to do that. I feel like the biggest fallacy to the entire gun control argument is the idea that fewer guns means fewer crimes.\nWhen you look at the numbers, the United States, despite having the highest gun ownership rate in the world, is 28th in the world in gun violence per 100,000 people. Our friends over in Great Britain, a country that bans guns and has an extremely low gun violence rate would be a good model to how we should regulate guns, right?\xa0Not necessarily, the UK has the fourth highest robbery rate and the second highest overall crime rate in the EU.\nOn Jan. 16 President Obama proposed his Gun Control bill to Congress in a time where the political environment for gun control is more favorable than it has been in a long time. I can agree with President Obama on the fact that the AR-15 and other assault style weapons really have no practical use, but I can’t see how taking the drastic step to ban them would be beneficial.\xa0I agree 100 percent with Obama saying that\xa0“if there’s even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there’s even one life that can be saved, then we’ve got an obligation to try.”\nI believe that obligation would be to tighten firearm regulations such as stricter background checks, not banning them. Even then, just like getting a drivers license, it does not mean that person will abide by the rules of the road. A properly educated and sane citizen in the United States should be able to own as many weapons they choose, no questions asked.\nI will end on this, if we are proposing legislation to save lives by banning guns, how many lives are we putting in danger by giving the assailant the upper hand? Even though we are divided as a nation on this issue, we can all agree that even though you may not see this on national news, if guns were banned things may have gone a lot differently.\nWARNING: The views and opinions expressed in the media, articles or comments on this site are those of the speakers or authors and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions held by KnightNews.com\nHave a view on the subject?

Marcu said in the higher-risk places like Southern Israel, people are practically living in their shelter rooms.\nThe United States, a long-time ally of Israel, doesn’t feel safe flying planes into the country anymore, since a rocket fell near an airport.

Due to limited seating, attendees will need to apply for a guaranteed seat by March 30 at 11:59 p.m., or be chosen by lottery on April 1. There is no cost of speaking or attending.\nRasmussen said that the goal of TEDxUCF is to give students a space to share revolutionary ideas, unique experiences, and burning passions in a conversational environment. The only criteria to be a speaker are to be a UCF student and to have a great idea.\nLast year’s TEDxUCF hosted four student speakers covering a variety of topics from farming to cancer detection research. One was Afif Abu-Hanna, a premed student from Israel who had been researching a cancer detection device that would track chemicals in the human breath and confirm whether or not a cancer was present. This device is already functional in labs in Israel, detecting lung cancer specifically, but it has yet to be used in doctors’ offices. According to Abu-Hanna and his partner Professor Hossam Haick, it has a 92% chance of detecting lung cancer and accurately reporting it.\n“It’s not hopeless, we are making progress and it may be slow but we’re getting there, we’re going to win the fight eventually against cancer and against other diseases,” Abu-Hanna said.\nAccording to Abu-Hanna, his biggest challenge was putting his speech into terms that non-science majors would relate to, but with the help of his speech professor and mentor, Gino Perrotte, he was able to effectively tell his story.\n“Everyone who steps up on the podium is trying to tell their story. I think that’s the power behind TED Talks, it’s that it’s personal it’s not just statistics,” Abu-Hanna said.\nAnother was sophomore Alfredo Salkeld who spoke on the benefits of learning more about the food we consume, and his experience working on a local blueberry farm for a week.\nBitten by the travel bug, Salkeld said he googled “how to travel for cheap” and found a directory for farming opportunities called Woofing. Although the advertising major had never farmed before in his life, he emailed local farmers assuring them of his work ethic and eagerness to jump into a new challenge.\n“I think the idea of wanderlust is there no matter what age you are,” Salkeld said. “Sharing ideas makes people want to do more with their lives. It can be something really small. Even if just one person looks [Woofing] up, I made a difference.”\nThe travel theme continued with Hugo Cardona, a senior majoring in finance, centered his speech on the power of traveling and experiencing other cultures.

Students could enjoy cookies and coffee while watching the premiere screening of the documentary Beneath the Helmet: From High School to the Home Front by Jerusalem U.\nDeputy Company Commander, Aviv Regev, who is featured in the film, was present during the screening, and afterward spoke to students about the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and answered any questions they had about the film and about Israel.\n“The film was produced over a 2-year period. We followed the soldiers’ lives during their 8-month training period, both in—and out—of the army. That was followed by an extensive post-production period,” Wayne Kopping said, the director and editor of Beneath the Helmet.\nKopping’s documentaries have been seen by over 40,000,000 people worldwide. His work has been featured on CNN and Fox News, as well as in The New York Times and countless other publications and blogs.\n“As Eilon Kohan, one of the recruits we feature in the film tells us, kids his age in just about any other country are thinking about what college to attend, which parties to go to, and where to travel. But as a soldier, he’s having to crawl over thorns, realizing that he may be called to put his life on the line to defend the\xa0country,” Kopping said.\nKopping said he found it remarkable to witness that this process didn’t leave the soldiers bitter and angry, but rather, filled with courage and a selfless desire to serve and ‘give back, just as those who came before them took a stand to protect the nation.\nThe audiences often have insightful questions, he said, and who better to answer them, than those soldiers and officers who’s lives are depicted onscreen.\n“Over and above all else, these soldiers are some of the coolest people you’ll ever meet, so who wouldn’t want to come out to a screening to meet them?” Kopping said.\nDuring his time in the service, Regev was in charge of 120 soldiers, logistics in training, at the time of the film. Meaning, all of the soldiers seen in the film were his soldiers.\nWhen he was 16, he was tending to his family’s orchards when a missile hit near him launched by a terrorist group in the second Lebanon war.\n“I realized that for 16 years I had been living peacefully and happily without a worry or care in the world, thanks to the soldiers who were protecting me and my family and that in a few years it would be my turn to do the same,” Regev said.\n“Try to think of it, when was the last time you did something that you thought was impossible that there was no way to finish it?” he said to the audience. “It doesn’t happen very often.”\n“It’s something that I think is really unique of the Israel Defense Forces, we train our soldiers to pass these mental and physical barriers to realize that nothing is impossible.” At the end of the soldier’s training, as featured in the film, the soldiers are required to walk a distance of 57 miles.\nAt the age of 21, his skills and motivation allowed him to climb the ranking ladder to become an officer of a platoon. It was at the age of 23 that he became deputy company commander, the age at which he was featured in the film.\n“[The film crew] was my biggest worry. The camera man thinks it’s nice to shoot the guns when they’re firing towards the camera, very creative,” Regev said, making the audience laugh. “But they were able to capture the process that we go through, especially in training.”\nHe explained the responsibilities of being a commander at a young age, and all the sacrifices made and decisions that carry the lives of so many others. Regev did not lose any of his soldiers under his command and he did not have to kill anyone during his time in the service.\nAfter finishing his service in Nov. 2013, Jerusalem U approached him and asked if he would be interested in representing the film in the United States.\n“As you can imagine after 5 years in the army it was not on the top of my to-do list,” he said.\nHe then told them politely no, and later found himself crossing China by himself. He traveled 2,000 miles from north to south, and hiked a few hundred miles in New Zealand. It was during that time that he met a lot of teenagers from over a dozen countries who were were interested in his story and asked him many questions.\n“The problem is that these questions were based on propaganda and lies and misconceptions. And that was when I realized there was this whole other war going on in the international media and on campuses,” Regev said. “And once I understood this that there’s not only a physical battlefront but a verbal one I felt like I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and watch.”\nIt was for this reason that he decided to represent the film in the states; to share his stories and to answer any questions about Israel that students may have.\nRebekah Kanefsky, 19, is a senior majoring in Psychology.\n“The club is pro-Israel and aims to educate students and the Orlando community about Israel,” she said.\nKanefsky is the event coordinator for knights for Israel, and first got involved in the club because she knew the current club president in high school, and had introduced her to Knights for Israel when she came to college.\n“I am really passionate about Israel and advocating for it, so that’s why I wanted to get involved,” she said.\n“I liked [the film] because it was an effective reminder that Israeli soldiers are human too. The Israeli people just want their children to come home safe and the soldiers are very similar to you and I in many aspects,” Kanefsky said.\n“Other pro Israel groups around the country also are screening [the film] and I think it’s an interesting documentary that makes students feel supportive of the soldiers. I think the film was beneficial because it was inspirational to watch the soldiers go through those experiences,” Kanefsky said.\nFor more information the film, visit www.beneathhelmet.com.

The GOP debate will feature the top 10 candidates and Carly Fiorina, who made the cut off after her average poll number placed her in the ranks with her male counterparts.  \nDivided into two parts, the first half of the debate features the four candidates who met the minimum one percent threshold in public polls. Those candidates include George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum. \nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry was invited to join them on stage but suspended his bid after he realized his poll numbers were just as dismal as his campaign funds.\nA variety of issues will be discussed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \nKeep your ears primed for several issues ranging from Immigration, Foreign Policy and National Security, Health Care, and several Civil Rights not limited to Women’s Rights and LGBTQ affairs. \nWe will examine a few topics and the primary presidential potentials viewpoints, hoping to provide you with more knowledge on their platforms.\nObamaCare/ Health care\n•\tRand Paul- Longtime supporter of the Republican Party, Paul pursued a life of civic engagement while attaining a medical doctor degree. Having both performed eye surgery and owning his own practice in the past 18 years, Paul has years of experience in the medical field under his belt and has felt the effects of a failing health care reform. An opponent of Obamacare, he plans to rescind government involvement in health care as to eliminate the bureaucratic restrictions that hinder development.\n•\tChris Christie- Both Christie and Paul have come under fire for telling audiences that it was a parental decision on whether children should be vaccinated; however, Christie quickly clarified his position by stating that there should be a balance between what the government mandates. He supports the expansion Medicaid in his state of New Jersey because it was relatively small under ObamaCare. He called for the President to apologize to people who were getting their health plans canceled and was quoted saying that anyone who has run anything in their lives could see the problem with a state based health exchange a mile away.\n•\tMarco Rubio- A proponent of massive health care reform, Rubio believes that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, has done more harm than good; stating that not only are states being left with unfunded liability that ultimately limits market competition. His plan would include transparency to facilitate value-based informed decisions and expanded choice in Medicaid options as well as longer funding periods.\nAbortion\n•\tJeb Bush- elder Bush brother and former Florida Governor, Bush has asserted his formidable pro-life stance in a variety of ways in the past 20 years. Within his first year in office he used his executive power to approve a specialty license plate promoting the right-to-life “Choose Life” that donated $20 of proceeds to adoption agencies which provided counseling, but not to clinics that provided abortion counseling. He had even a feeding tube reinserted on a severely brain-damaged woman against the family’s wishes.\n•\tChris Christie- Once a pro-choice proponent, Governor Christie changed his mind when he heard his daughter’s heartbeat at 13 weeks back in 1995. He has since been pro-life and only supports abortions in cases where the mother’s life is at risk. He also eliminated state funding for Planned Parenthood stating that there were many other services women could use if they wanted family planning services.\n•\tCarly Fiorina- With exceptions to cases in the instance of rape, incest, and maternal endangerment, the former business executive supports the defunding of Planned Parenthood. She believes that American attention should be focused on more pressing issues.\nImmigration\n•\tJeb Bush- Having a fairly moderate view on immigration, Bush has since come to support a path for permanent legal residency that would hope to open the path to naturalization after years of supporting the deportation of illegal immigrants.\n•\tDonald Trump- Infamously known on for his disparaging comments about Hispanics during his presidential announcement speech, Trump called for a tighter southern border going so far to propose building a wall that Mexico will have to pay out of pocket. He supports legal immigration from European countries and providing legal status to international students who complete their degree at an American university.\n•\tTed Cruz- Texas senator has expressed to the media about Obama’s “lawless amnesty” on his comprehensive immigration reform, which included background checks, earned citizenship for DREAMers, and strict requirements for those who would like permanent resident status. Cruz has tried to combat Obama’s executive order to cease the deportation of young, undocumented immigrants.\nForeign Policy \n•\tBen Carson- On our ally ship with Israel, the retired neurosurgeon has urged the U.S. to listen and consider Netanyahu during his speech to denounce Obama’s nuclear limitation deal with Iran. He advocates the U.S. using a proactive stance on leadership, versus waiting for what other nations will do first.\n•\tRand Paul- Having changed his views of removing all foreign aid, including Israel, because of America’s rising debt, he was quoted saying that we cannot give away money we don’t have. Paul has since then broadened his stance to support American allies. (On Cuba)\n•\tMarco Rubio- Rubio stands as one of two Hispanic Republican candidates for the 2016 elections, and believes that Cuba must improve their position on human rights in order for American engagement with the island to be successful. He views our involvement with the country to not be enough if they don’t take measures into their own hand and initiate true, long lasting change.\nGun Control\n•\tScott Walker- the Wisconsin governor believes that protecting and preserving the second amendment is not optional—in fact, it is one of the most important things a governor can do. Using his executive power, he signed a law transforming Wisconsin gun laws to one of the freest in the U.S.\n•\tTed Cruz- A staunch supporter of the second amendment, he penned a brief on behalf of the 31 states that supported the right to keep and bear arms. He stands on the side of opposition to restricting magazines with more than 10 bullets and the United Nation’s Arms Trade Treaty, which sought to limit the misuse of firearms in wartime interactions in foreign countries.\n•\tDonald Trump- Before his campaign for presidency began, Trump was more permissive toward gun control opting to place a ban on assault weapons and proposing a slightly longer waiting period. However, he touts his support of the second amendment and mandates that guns are necessary for defense and that “not every gun is an assault weapon.”\nEducation\n•\tJohn Kasich- A supporter creationism, Kasich likens stories from the 4000-year-old Bible as historical facts recounting factual human history, taken from historical record. Outside of his religious views, he believes that competition in American universities is what makes this country great and would like to incorporate that drive into the refurbishing of primary and secondary school establishment.\n•\tJeb Bush- An advocate for Common Core education standards, an assessment that would monitor kids K-12 progress on the English language and mathematics. However, the plan has been criticize governmental overreach and to lessen the daunting effects of it the Obama administration has incentive its usage rather than require it be done 43 states it was approved in.\n•\tCarly Fiorina- In Fiorina’s explanation of the private versus public school debate she lays out the downfall of a free-market voucher-driven system of public school education, stating that many schools would were only able to achieve the lowest common denominator. If we let competition reign the strongest schools would prosper and the weaker ones would be left to perish.']",['https://knightnews.com/2015/09/cnn-republican-primary-debate/'],0.061361346393823624,0.19841629266738892,0.027510153129696846

When he finished the trip, he decided to complete his education there, at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya College. He received his bachelor’s in Government, Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security. With his degrees he was also awarded Cum Laude honors. \nFrom there on, Steven jump-started his career working for TIME Magazine, the Christian Science Monitor and World Affairs Journal. As his father perfectly stated, Steven was “compelled to be the voice of the voiceless and report to the world what he had seen.”\nProfessor Brunson introduced Steven’s parents with a warm welcome and shared a few lines from a tribute to Steven he had written for the UCF Forum, which was later picked up by the Huffington Post. \n“Steven Sotloff dedicated himself to bearing and shedding light, especially in dark corners of the world torn by war and riven by age-old hatreds and intractable, systematic poverty,” Brunson read.\nShirley then stood in front of the audience and began to speak about Steven, how kind, intelligent and well liked he was. She also spoke of his passion for reporting news internationally. \n“He was dedicated to working in those areas of the world where free speech was limited or even harshly prevented. Steven showed us that no matter who you are or where you come from, if you listen and step out of your comfort zone, you will learn, you will grow, and you will experience life through a newer, larger lens,” she said.\nShirley ended by speaking about the scholarship fund she and her husband started a year ago in his name. \n“Everyone has two lives. The second one begins when you realize you have only one.” These words written by Steven in a letter to his parents is what inspired them to start the 2Lives Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial Foundation, a scholarship that has been set up to raise money for aspiring young journalists. \nFunds have provided airfare for journalists traveling to Ireland with training as part of a new global initiative for freelance reporters to help them receive first aid courses, health insurance policies and risk assessment skills.\nBoard Member of the fund and close family friend Frank Urrutia was sitting by the Sotloffs’ side and not only spoke of the fund but also stated although he wasn’t a dear friend of Steven’s, he said Steven was, “a big inspiration to me because he always demonstrated the characteristics that make this school very special: curiosity, courage, and commitment.”\n“It was definitely inspirational, I know there was a lot of mention of death, life, and rebirth but I think its more important to know that there’s an impact today and now, on the people who are living here.

Chabad will also be handing out menorahs around the campus.\n“Chanukah is not just the commemoration of a situation past, but its message and lessons relate to each and every one of us today.

I actually had foster kids in my home growing up.

Either A, its god telling you this is your mission in life, its your job to fix it but that’s why he showing you these problems, or B, it’s time to bring light into your own life and you need to fix yourself. If we take that message to heart, that everytime we see pain and suffering, everytime we see a moment of darkness, everytime we see a struggle, or something that’s not okay, ask yourself, A. what can I do about it, is this my mission to fix? Cause often times it is or B. am I just seeing things a little bit off cause I need some fixing?

An RA went outside and said that whoever applied the signs did so in front of a security camera. From there, security footage of two persons of interest was released.\nA second occurrence took place when a Residence Assistant in Nike “noticed ‘anti- Jewish’ stickers that were stuck to the community mailbox,” the incident report stated.\nAnother incident, also the same day, happened at Lake Claire where an RA’s bulletin board was destroyed and replaced with stickers that read statements such as “Truth is Treason in the empire of lies, Muh Holocaust and another one had a swastika on it,” according to the report. \nThe day after those three incidents, Nov. 16, more stickers were found under the bus shelter in front of Tower 3, according to reports. \n“The stickers had markings of swastika symbols on them and appeared to have been placed there as an act of vandalism, causing minor damage to the area,” the report stated.\nA similar sticker to the one found at the bus shelter was discovered on a street sign at the intersection of East Plaza Drive and Gemini Blvd.\n“The sticker was white in color and displayed the Star of David with the words ‘1 percenters’ on it. That sticker appeared to be antisemitic in nature, and was eventually removed before a police report could be done on it,” according to the incident report.\nUCFPD is still investigating the incidents and following up with tips that came in after the Tower 4 security footage was released.\nSome students addressed the situation with President Hitt saying what has been done regarding the events “is simply not enough.”\n34 Jewish and civil rights organizations emailed Hitt and copied Provost Whittaker with their concerns on the way these incidents have been handled and ways to move forward.\n“We are aware that your administration has vowed to find the perpetrator(s) of these hateful acts and stated that UCF ‘has a zero tolerance policy regarding incidents or bias in any form.’  But this is simply not enough. We are dismayed that in the weeks since the stickers and flyers appeared, neither you nor any other UCF administrator has yet to publicly condemn these postings as antisemitic, specifically targeting Jewish students and causing them to feel threatened and unsafe.  A public statement demonstrates to the campus and wider communities that you will not tolerate acts of bigotry directed at Jewish students and that you are committed to addressing antisemitic acts with the same promptness and vigor as all other racial, ethnic and gender bigotry. A public statement is also the single most important step to deterring future acts of antisemitism,” the email said.\nThe correspondence suggested that UCF administration should publicly acknowledge and condemn these acts, publicly commit to educating university staff and police in identifying the hate crimes, adopt the U.S State Department’s definition of antisemitism to accurately identify the acts and allocate resources and educate students about antisemitism.\nSome of the organizations in the correspondence include Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, Israeli-American Council, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi, Students and Parents Against Campus Anti-Semitism and many more.\n“Taking these steps will show your students, their parents, University of Central Florida alumni, and the larger community that University of Central [Florida] stands firmly against bigotry and hatred, including antisemitism, and will protect all members of the campus community,” the email stated.\nCheck back on KnightNews.com for updates on this story.']","['https://knightnews.com/2015/12/chabad-at-ucf-celebrates-chanukah-with-toy-drive/', 'https://knightnews.com/2015/12/students-call-on-hitt-to-condemn-anti-semitic-acts-ucfpd-releases-reports/']",0.6658606380224228,0.36711184307932854,0.17558127641677856

We came here tonight to prove that is certainly not the truth,” Speaker Director of CAB Stanley Swindling said.\nThe debate was filled with popular topics of today from legalization of marijuana to immigration reform.\nDuring the Debate the three speakers were able to find some common ground on a plethora of topics such as the war on drugs, prison reform, and reducing military spending. Each speaker agreed that these areas need change; they just differed on how to go about it and to what extent.\nHowever with every agreement there were plenty of differences. From gun control to climate change each speaker made clear distinctions of their opinions and stood up for their beliefs.\n“Even though their were lots of disagreements, it always makes me happy to see students getting involved and coming together to discuss the important issues that are going on,” President of the College Democrats Nikki Mariutto said.\n“I’d rather have a debate like this over people sitting around saying they don’t care about politics,” Mariutto continued.\nSpeaker Director Swindling echoed Mariutto saying, “We certainly expected some disagreements and partisanship.

1968,UCF,2016-09-02,journal_data/txt/UCF/2016_09_02.txt,"['A young woman attends a sexual morality conference at the Student Union, listening intently.\nIn front of her, a panel of religious leaders discusses their views on gender equality, homosexuality, and transgender visibility. It’s an odd topic, to be sure, but one that she said she finds fascinating. She studiously takes notes throughout.\nWhen asked why she was personally invested in the conference, her answer was simple.\n“I’m gay and I want to be a rabbi,” she said. “So I want to promote a better cultural understanding within religion.”\nKayla Symonds, a sophomore religion and cultural studies major at UCF, is the president of BAGELS+, a club for Jewish members of the LGBTQ+ community. BAGELS+ (an acronym for Bisexual, Asexual, Gay, Exploring and Lesbian Students) is a part of Central Florida Hillel, a Jewish cultural center for college students in the Central Florida area. As president of BAGELS+, Symonds plans events such as celebrations of Jewish holidays and scriptural readings.\n“There’s a lot more of us than you’d think,” Symonds said.\nAccording to Central Florida Hillel’s mission page, UCF has the third largest Jewish student population outside of Israel, with an estimated 6,000 Jewish students attending. UCF is also well-known for its LGBTQ+ inclusive\xa0environment – it’s the only Florida school to make Campus Pride’s Top 50 LGBT-Friendly List as of 2014. The combined support from the Jewish and LGBTQ+ community made UCF the perfect environment for BAGELS+ to flourish.\nSymonds began working at Central Florida Hillel as a community engagement intern. She found her niche in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community after recognizing the need for more involvement.\n“I’ve always found the struggles of the Jewish community and the LGBTQ+ community linked,” Symonds said. “Anti-Semitism and homophobia are two issues we still face today. And being a member of both communities means being a minority within a minority.”\nSam Friedman, director of community relations at Central Florida Hillel, also recognized the importance of BAGELS+.\n“One of the things we’re most proud of is forming BAGELS+,” Friedman said. “We pride ourselves on being a center for the community, and the community means everybody.\nFor Symonds, Judaism is the foundation of her identity. She keeps her diet kosher, has a mezuzah (a scroll with Hebrew verses from the Torah) on her door, and observes Shabbat. A common misconception, she said, is believing that her religion conflicts with her sexuality.\n“When people find out that I’m gay and Jewish, they ask, ‘do you really believe in it [Judaism]?’, and the answer is yes. Yes, I am gay. Yes, I am religious. And yes, I am observant.”\nHomosexuality is a divisive issue within the Jewish community. The more conservative Orthodox Judaism generally disapproves of homosexuality, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism are more tolerant. Central Florida Hillel is firmly LGBTQ+ friendly.\n“Some Jewish organizations say that homosexuality is expressly forbidden in the book of Leviticus,” Friedman said. “But Abraham, the first Jew, was known for welcoming every guest that came to his tent. You can’t be like Abraham if you’re not going to welcome everybody.”\n“In Judaism, we have an expression: two Jews, three opinions. So a lot of different people will say a lot of different things,” Symonds said. “I firmly believe that it is up to you to interpret the text, and for me, the text embraces my identity.”\nAfter graduating UCF, Symonds said she plans to spend a year in Jerusalem before attending Hebrew Union College to continue her rabbinical studies. The college has campuses in Cincinnati, Jerusalem, Los Angeles and New York, but Symonds said she’s not sure where she wants to study just yet.\n“It depends on how things go with my girlfriend. We’re looking at schools near her,” Symonds said.\nSymonds said her faith in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community was reaffirmed in February.\nSymonds is active on Tumblr, and read the story of a German transgender woman who wanted to convert to Judaism. Her rabbi warned her that the beit din (a group of rabbis that oversee the conversion process) might require her to compromise her gender identity.\n“I thought that I might be able to help, so I emailed a friend who works with French Jewish LGBTQ+ organizations,” Symonds said. “My friend ended up forwarding the email to Frank Giaoui, the president of the World Congress of GLBT Jews. And he emailed the former president. One thing led to another, and they found a beit din that would help her convert.”\n“Seeing so many people respond was affirming,” Symonds said. “We have another expression: he who saves one life saves the world entire. I truly believe that.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2016/09/jewish-lgbt-club-leader-reaches-minorities-within-minorities/'],0.5831114053726196,0.23581691086292267,0.13986173272132874

The Nu Delta chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi organized ‘We Walk To Remember’ on Thursday at the University of Central Florida. AEPi chapters across the nation partnered with B’nai B’rith International, a Jewish service organization, to stage similar marches throughout college campuses.\nAttendees held signs emblazoned with the Star of David, as well as slogans such as “We Remember” and another quote from Wiesel, “To forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.” Others wore Israeli flags draped over their shoulders, and a gay pride flag with a Star of David was held at the front of the procession.\nThose participating were given small flyers to hand out, explaining the reasoning behind their silent walk. It highlighted the atrocities of the holocaust, not only to Jews but also to the millions of others who perished.\nParticipants walked silently from the John C.

Weil now said he was wrong.\nWeil is the Director of Central Florida Hillel Center for Jewish Life. Hate crimes have risen in the U.S. by 21 percent since 2013, according to the FBI. Weil attended the Synagogue that experienced the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation that killed 11 people and injured seven. The mass shooting, Oct. 7 2018, was the deadliest attack on Jews in American history.\n “As a college student in the 80s I told my dad the whole concept of anti-Semitism is over,” Weil said. “That Armageddon that swept across Europe during WWII burns out that kind of small thinking, and people are not cosmopolitan.”\nWeil now said he was wrong about anti-Semtism being over.\n“My dad said anti-Semitism flows it goes up and it goes down, and it’s going to come back,” Weil said. And look 30 years later it came back.”\nLast month on Christmas morning anti-Semitic graffiti was found on campus south of the University and Alafaya intersection.\nNirit Gelfer, an Israel Fellow at the Hillel Center for Jewish Life at UCF, said she was surprised to hear the news.\n“I was surprised that I saw it on campus because I did not feel any anti-Semitism from the moment I moved here,” Gelfer said. “It is unfortunate for me to know that there is still such hatred in our times. I’m thinking that any hatred directed at a particular group should be condemned.”\nAccording to the FBI There were 973 hate crimes against Jews reported in the U.S. in 2017. Anti-Semitic hate crimes were 58 percent of all hate crimes against a religious group, and 13 percent of all hate crimes in 2017.\nWeil said anti-Semitism derives from emotion not reason. Some examples of anti-Semetic ideologies are the Nationalist Socialist, which was the political ideology of Nazi Germany, or the Ku Klux Klan, an American White Supremacy hate group.\nThe increase in hate crimes against Jews isn’t only in the United States. Hate crimes against Jewish people in Canada grew by 24 percent in the last two reported years. In 2016 178 Jewish hate crimes were reported, compared to 221 crimes in 2017, according to Canadian Hate Crime Stats.\n“If someone is filled with hatred, and hates Jews, it doesn’t matter if they’re rich or poor, successful or not, alive or dead,” Weil said.\nMark Winton, a UCF criminal justice associate lecturer who researches hate crimes, said hate crimes are transparent and punishable by law. But the complex part is hate speech where individuals can be radicalized online is a big issue, Winton said. The digital age has allowed many individuals to become radicalized online.\n“Hate speech is protected under the First Amendment regardless of how radical someone’s speech may be or foreshadowing of hate crimes,” Winton said. “Until an individual or group makes a clear threat, law enforcement is not required to get involved.”\nAccording to Pew Research Center, people of the Jewish faith make up almost 2 percent of the U.S. population as of 2014.\nStephen Holmes, a UCF criminal justice associate professor who researches and studies murderers, said he believes people are increasingly targeting places of worship because attacking a place of worship sends a strong message.\n“If you can’t be safe there, you can’t be safe in any public area,” Holmes said. “Places of worship are a rich target area for people who harbor hate because they send a clear message of fear.”\n“We’ve had shootings in a lot of places but a church or a synagogue is a place people go to worship,” Holmes said. “A place [where] you should be protected.”\nWeil remembered instances of discrimination he said he had faced in his youth where on a rare occasion someone would tell him “Jew you down,” which he described as a negative stereotype of Jewish people’s bargaining habits. Weil also said he had an experience where an individual threw pennies at him. However, Weil stated one memory sticks out to him the most.\nWeil said he remembers when he was younger an encounter he had while opposing a Ku Klux Klan rally in Georgia, where he participated as part of a large counter-protest.\nWeil ended up in the same restroom as a KKK member, who was dressed in a full robe and Capirote hood, he said.\nThe KKK member, with his young son by his side, asked Weil how he was doing, Weil said.\nWeil said he responded with, “I’m good, how are you?” that he remembers the moment as “normal.”\n“I’m thinking to myself, how ironic — here we stand together at the urinal … and he was completely nice to me,” Weil said. “And then after, he turns right and went toward his group, and I went toward my group. And we yelled and they yelled, and I’m thinking, ‘but back in the bathroom … ‘”\nWeil said we are living in an extremely polarizing time, and that people are becoming more comfortable to being intolerant or discriminatory again.\n“We’re living in very challenging times, where America is ripping itself apart,” Weil said. “We’re seeing it in both political parties, where anti-Semitism has been dormant but has never really gone away.”\nHolmes, echoing the sentiment raised by Weil’s father, said that the current amount of hateful speech is a part of unpredictable “waves” within society’s evolution and that it’s normal to see a steep rise and a steep fall in hate crimes as humanity evolves.\nWeil said the key to dismantling the mindset of prejudice begins with ending generalizations of other people.\n“Hatred begins when you say, ‘those people’ — that’s when you know you are wrong,” Weil said. “Everything that follows after that sentence is wrong. The mere notion of ‘those people’ ignores the human individuality in everyone.”\nWeil said he describes himself along with the Jewish population of UCF and Orlando as resilient in the wake of hatred.\n“There was a significant amount of fear in the community around the time that this happened,” Weil said. “Since then, the community has been galvanized and together with generous support from other communities. There is a great feeling of optimism over the almost overwhelming outpouring of support for Jewish people in the United States that has really been reassuring.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2019/01/ucf-jewish-leaders-discuss-hate-crime-increase-after-christmas-day-incident/'],0.09441544860601425,0.6650733947753906,0.2552582621574402

We also want to have the conversations on the challenges that Israel faces.”\nGray said he came to the trip with an open mind and just wanted to learn and experience as much as he could.\n“We were at the Golan Heights, which at one point was ISIS [Islamic State] controlled territory, and IDF [Israeli Defense Force] soldiers at the border of Israel and Lebanon and would allow ISIS soldiers who were injured in the country and give them free medical care,” Gray said.  “It was the beauty of the humanity in it; that these people can be at war in one minute and helping each other the next.”\nGray said the trip allowed them to hear both voices at the table firsthand without the media.

Instead, it serves to reflect a sentiment shared by the governing body of an institution — in this case, UCF’s.\nAt a time where universities around the U.S. are taking pro and anti-BDS stances, UCF SG held first reading to pass Resolution 52-05, which is “opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement at the University of Central Florida.”\nSG proposed the resolution under the same breath that it proposed, and later passed, the controversial Fiscal Bill 52-60, which voted to allocate $17,875 of student money to fund the right-wing political commentator Ben Shapiro to speak at the main campus and six UCF Police Department officers.\xa0\nMubarak and her group showed up to protest the resolution at the senate committee meeting on Feb. 6, the same night that another group of demonstrators also showed up to protest against the Ben Shapiro bill.\nThe proposer of the bill, Sen. Ben Rembaum, said amid so much controversy, he and the senate decided to postpone the anti-BDS resolution indefinitely — also known as “PPI” or “kill” the resolution — before the senate committee meeting even took place.\nAlthough Myers has said that SG is meant to be a strictly nonpartisan entity, some students said they feel like SG is leaning in a clear direction.\n“At this point, every time SG makes a ‘tough decision’ that ends up being contrary to our ‘core beliefs,’ I’m disappointed but not surprised,” said Shahaan Khan, director of political affairs for College Democrats at UCF. “The recent direction SG has taken with the bills they’ve been processing has been worrying.”\xa0\nSG supporters of the resolution said it was intended to be a stand against discrimination as a whole on campus.\nRembaum, a 20-year-old sophomore economics major, said the resolution was proposed in response to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks around college campuses in the U.S., though not specifically at UCF.\xa0\n“Even though this resolution says ‘Anti-BDS,’ it also targeted all forms of discrimination that go on in college campuses,” Rembaum said. “In my eyes and other people’s eyes, the people within the [BDS] movement at certain campuses caused discrimination and sometimes it caused violence, and I did not want that to happen to UCF.”\nOn the night of the resolution’s first hearing, Rembaum presented a slide show with images of an anti-Semitic white supremacist display that was reported on campus. The image showed the words, “LOVE not HATE,” with a swastika in place of the “O” for “LOVE,” and a Star of David in place of the “A” for “HATE.”\xa0\nThis confused Seema Azim, a UCF alumna of Afghan descent who attended the second hearing with Mubarak’s group. \nShe said the BDS Movement stands against the country of Israel’s politics to deny Palestinians their right to exist, not against the people of Israel or of the Jewish faith. Unlike white supremacy, which does.\n“It was kind of clear that people of the senate did not really understand what BDS was,” Azim said. “There were no Palestinian voices being considered, so all in all, it was a very one-sided approach. One-sided being that they believe BDS to be a discriminatory movement, which it is not.”\xa0\nRembaum, who said he joined UCF SG to serve as a voice for students, said he had not considered the other side of the argument when he’d presented the resolution. \nHe said that when he realized the resolution would do more harm than good, he began to change his mind.\n“I wasn’t able to talk to them about it beforehand because I don’t know many people in that community, and it’s hard for me to reach out to people I don’t know,” Rembaum said. “After hearing their concerns on the senate floor, after talking to them, after senate meetings and hearing their voices, I decided to kill the resolution.”\nMyers, who cosponsored the resolution, said it was meant to be preventative.\n“Not so much on UCF’s campus, but in a lot of other campuses around the country, we have seen a spike in the boycott divestment and sanctions of Israel, and just because a problem hasn’t been super present on our campus, that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening in other places or that it can’t happen at UCF,” Myers said.\xa0\nMyers also said the stance was supposed to be a pro-peace and pro-Israel act of support for the UCF Jewish community, and should not be seen as anti-Muslim.\xa0\n“BDS is almost inherently discriminatory, so I think that a lot of times there’s a lot of confusion with people who are pro-BDS,” Myers said. “Just because we’re doing something for the Jewish community does not mean the exact counter to that is something that is negative toward the Muslim community.”\nBut Grayson Lanza, a UCF alumnus of Jewish descent who attended the meetings as part of Mubarak’s group, said that standing for Israel does not necessarily mean standing for such a diverse community as the whole Jewish population.\xa0\nHe said anti-BDS resolutions and laws purposely weaponize Jewish identity in order to push a separate agenda.\xa0\n“Israel is often improperly associated, either in bad faith or by genuine misunderstanding, as representative and associative with all Jews,” Lanza said. “But not all Jews are Israeli, and historically, we were not for the most part, either. [They] claim it is to fight anti-Semitism; however, it is honestly anti-Semitic to conflate Israel with all Jews.”\nIn the end, when the demonstrators spoke at the committee, the senate assured them that they had already decided to kill the resolution and there was no need for further concern.\nMubarak, Azim and Lanza all said they still felt uneasy. Azim said she felt it would undermine first amendment rights to free speech for some students, in contrast to the Ben Shapiro bill, which passed namely on the arguments from supporters that it protects conservatives’ rights to free speech.\xa0\xa0\n“It’s scary because it kind of makes students — including me — feel like your entire school stands against your rights to express your concerns with human rights violations, and that’s not a nice feeling,” Azim said. “Standing up for oppressed populations already is isolating enough, and it can be marginalizing with a resolution like this on top of it. It would likely push students to not even talk about these things.”\xa0\nThat was Lanza’s main point at the committee meeting that evening. \nWhen he spoke, he made sure to stress the importance of SG including the entirety of the UCF community into these decisions — not just the few closest to them.\xa0\n“One of the most significant issues with the resolution was that there was zero effort from proponents of the resolution to discuss the matter with the UCF Palestinian community or the Orlando Palestinian community as a whole,” Lanza said. “These conversations so, so often erase Palestinians, and there is absolutely no denying that. Regardless of your opinions, Palestinians are the ones who suffer from the conflict the most.”\xa0\nMubarak recognized not adopting the resolution was good news but addressed the heavy responsibility of setting a premise on such dangerous rhetoric, arguing that it promotes xenophobia among students.\nShe said she fears for the future of UCF under divisive management and said she exhorts the student governing body to take accountability to heart.\xa0\n“When you introduce language like that, it takes seconds to further disenfranchise these communities,” Mubarak said. “As leaders, yes, you have power, but it is within you to decide if you want to divide or unify. And you have taken a stance to send a message of division, and within that division comes hate and violence against these communities.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2020/03/ucf-sg-kills-anti-bds-resolution-students-voice-concerns-of-sg-taking-a-right-wing-approach/'],0.01760629564523697,0.5840034484863281,0.02333432249724865
