He said the chairman of Ford told him the automaker is investing over $16 billion in plant and equipment, creating over 12,000 jobs in the US.

Last week, the FSU Elections Commission agreed, finding Ignite in violation and disqualifying the ticket. Ignite is appealing that decision to the Supreme Court. \nHowever, the more controversial allegation made against Ignite is that the party used state resources in an attempt to secure campaign material tax-free. The Elections Commission didn’t uphold that accusation, so Progress Coalition is appealing that to the Supreme Court, hoping to get a conviction there too. \nKnightNews.com has reached out to the Ignite Party for comment over Facebook and email, but has not heard back. The FSU newspaper also had reported Ignite wasn’t available for comment in its coverage. An FSU alumnus did contact KnightNews.com, however, to defend Ignite. \n“Please do remember, however, that FSU Senators are not paid (though the Supervisor of Elections and Student Body President are) and that these students with Ignite are mostly volunteering their time and want to simply serve and learn,” the FSU SGA alumnus said. “I’d bet none of them will forget to file a financial disclosure document again. It may be difficult to see sometimes, but not everyone has an ulterior motive. Sometimes people really do just accidentally mess up paperwork.” \nThe Progress Coalition, however, says the behavior is nothing new and has been happening since last year. A party official gave KnightNews.com a copy of receipts showing $0.00 in taxes for what he says is Ignite campaign material in 2011 and 2012.', '“This is awful, and disgusts me as a student,” that official told KnightNews.com, regarding the evidence. \nKnightNews.com will be monitoring the meeting tonight and will update you with the outcome. \nOn the next page you can find the accusations being made by the Progress Coalition in its press release:\n\n“This is awful, and disgusts me as a student,” that official told KnightNews.com, regarding the evidence. \nKnightNews.com will be monitoring the meeting tonight and will update you with the outcome. \nOn the next page you can find the accusations being made by the Progress Coalition in its press release:', 'The University of Central Florida is looking into a new campus location in China, according to Central Florida News 13.\nFaculty members from UCF, led by\xa0Dr. Abe Pizam,\xa0dean of UCF’s Rosen College of Hospitality Management, are meeting in China this week to discuss details about opening a new campus on Hainan Island, China’s southernmost territory and only tropical island.\nThe campus would be set to host about 5,000 students with study topics focusing on the tourism industry and hospitality management.\nThe group is scheduled to return from China March 1st.

After casual discussion with friends, I found it surprising how few twenty-somethings knew this and how dangerous this condition is. Most people I spoke with knew that a concussion was one of the reasons that Muhammad Ali had trouble speaking, and the main cause of former New York Jet Wayne Chrebet’s departure from the team after eleven years of playing. Unfortunately, this lack of understanding is one of the main causes of brain damage due to concussion; many individuals who sustain them continue to play.\nIn this January’s Annals of Biomedical Engineering, it was noted that football players were the most likely candidates to receive a concussion in the United States. The paper notes that the average collegiate football player will sustain roughly one thousand subconcussive head on hits during each season. For each UCF freshman that joins the football program, this means that he is likely to sustain about 4000 subconcussive hits during his career in college. The study did not note how players were subjected to hits in their potential professional careers.\nA July 7th article in The Indianapolis Star states that the younger an individual is, the longer it will take for a sustained concussion to heal. This means that collegiate players who played football in their youth and sustained concussions are more likely to have potentially unhealed concussions as they enter college. Unfortunately, this may go unnoticed in the college programs.\nThe NCAA does not require college sports programs to have a formal policy on concussion treatment or prevention, according to a 2009 New York Times article on the topic. Many Division I universities do not have a protocol in place, the article notes, and that the NCAA handbook on college sports injuries devotes only four pages out of its 126 total.\nIn a\xa0comment\xa0from UCF\xa0Athletics, the university does maintain a concussion protocol. I was also told,\xa0“UCF does not use the “hits” system (a tool developed to measure G forces of hits taken). UCF student-athletes do wear helmets certified by NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) that have evidence-based research behind their helmets.” This is a responsible stance taken by the university, and it is to be commended.\nAccording to Dr. Leonardo Olivera, Pegasus Health’s sports medicine physician and professor at the UCF College of Medicine, education is the number one factor in preventing injury, and parents and coaches should know the signs of concussion. Understanding how concussions occur and how to manage them once they are sustained is the best way to deal with this potentially debilitating condition.\n\xa0', 'Ralph Lauren, an iconic American clothing brand and a popular choice of clothing at UCF, was responsible for making the blazers and pants for the US Olympic uniform later this month in London.\nHowever, the uniform which dons the colors of red, white, and blue, wasn’t made in the nation it is going to be worn in. The US Olympic uniforms, which are going to be worn on US Olympians, and made by an American company, were actually made in China, according to ABC World News.\nThis leaves many people unhappy. The textile has been economically stagnant recently, and shipping the jobs for the US uniforms overseas has not helped. \xa0Members of Congress have been furious about the decision of the United States Olympic Committee(USOC) to even accept uniforms that were made overseas.\nHarry Reid, a Senator(D-Nev.) expressed his anger in a Capitol Hill news conference.\n“I am so upset. I think the Olympic committee\xa0should be ashamed of themselves. I think they should be embarrassed. I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again.”\nThe Ralph Lauren Company hasn’t made a comment yet, although the United States Olympic Committee released a statement saying,\xa0“Unlike most Olympic teams around the world, the U.S. Olympic Team is privately funded and we’re grateful for the support of our sponsors,” Spokesman Patrick Sandusky said.\n\xa0']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/07/us-olympic-uniforms-made-in-china-congress-unhappy/'],"['Ralph Lauren, an iconic American clothing brand and a popular choice of clothing at UCF, was responsible for making the blazers and pants for the US Olympic uniform later this month in London.\nHowever, the uniform which dons the colors of red, white, and blue, wasn’t made in the nation it is going to be worn in.

This is exactly what his app is hoping to stop.\n“China is making a lot of high-end fake IDs that people pay 200 or 300 dollars for, and we catch a significant amount of them. If someone fiddles with a date or something in the bar code … you better do it exactly the right way,” Ludlow told the Huffington Post.\nThe app can be downloaded by anyone, but the company release states that bar owners will need to purchase a license if they intend to use the app on a company-wide scale.\nIf the embarrassment of being rejected on a fake ID isn’t enough, another feautre of the app includes being able to permanately ban an individual from the establishment.']"

New details released in the incident report and 911 call say the victim had to fight the man off, and the suspect committed a sex act in her presence, leaving evidence on her and her vehicle.\nThe woman, who is not a UCF student, told police she was walking to get something out of her friend’s car in Garage D when she felt someone behind her. When she turned around, she saw a man was standing behind her exposing and touching himself through the zipper of his jeans, the incident report said.\n\nThe woman yelled “get off me” and grabbed the man by the shirt to push him away, the report said.\xa0Police said evidence of the sex crime was found on the woman’s skin, clothes\xa0and her vehicle.\nThe man ran off and got into a blue or gray minivan. The man’s van was caught on surveillance footage while he was traveling along Gemini Boulevard.\xa0The suspect is\xa0described as a white man about 20 years old with dark brown hair, police said.\nSpokeswoman for UCF Police Courtney Gilmartin said the UCF alert didn’t include these details because they were trying to get out the information as quickly as possible. She said the investigation is still ongoing and police are continuing to work with the victim, who wasn’t injured in the incident. \nThe victim talked to WKMG Local 6 and told them she thought she was going to be raped, and she was outraged when she found out UCF didn’t have cameras in the garage.\nKnightNews.com has been following UCF student Ryan McKinney’s plea for more cameras in garages. He appeared in front of the Board of Trustees Thursday asking officials to put cameras in the garages after his car was vandalized during the first week of spring semester.', 'The 2015 Student Government Association Presidential Elections have started with yet another controversy within the campaigns: table wars.\nKnight News received a tip this morning that candidates Cait Zona and Jarell Jones had taken over the table at the Student Union patio that was assigned to Brian Zagrocki and Alex Bennett.\nWhen we approached Brian, he said, “We had an agreement, that’s our spot for tabling. UCF SU made an agreement with the election commissioner. We got here to find out that they already had our spot and they told us that we couldn’t have it.”\nZona had set up the tent closest to the Student Union, on the left side when facing the entrance. According to Zagrocki, the spot the tents are placed at really makes a difference.\n“Why else would they have gotten here at five o’clock and stolen what we’ve already reserved?” said Zagrocki.\nKnightNews also approached Zona regarding the information. She told us that, “Statutorily, any of the spots are open” and that, “Per statute, it’s first come first serve.”\nZona admitted that they picked numbers through the EC, but she had asked the SU for approval to table there.\nNicklas Bajema, Supervisor of Elections for the Election Commission, disputed Zona’s previous statement.\n“It was not first come, first serve. There was an agreement had by the candidates initiated by me. They basically drew in a snake style fashion, basically if you had an NFL draft, kind of fantasy football style, so everyone gets a first, second, and last choice. And then, they pick the spots and they were supposed to honor that,” Bajema said.\nRegarding the numbered spots Zona talked about, Bajema said that, “There was a preconceived notion that each person had a spot available to them in a fair manner, because it was established beforehand in an agreement with the elections commission.”\nAfter receiving Bajema’s statement, we went back to Zona and asked her why she had said that the spots were first come, first serve.\nZona said that they received building permission and anything that was reserved was for Election Commissioner general.\n“We just decided with our team we just wanted to be as close to students and this was actually not a spot previously. So there was one spot per candidate, one spot per ticket, and they still have their own spot right there. This was actually not a spot on the map,” she said.\n\nKnightNews.com was able to attain the map with the numbered spots the candidates received and compare that to the spot that Zona’s table was located.\nAs shown in the pictures, Zona’s table appears to be in a spot in the map, a spot assigned to Brian and Alex.\nWe also spoke to event services, who gave us a screenshot of the patio reservation schedule.\nThe entire patio was reserved for elections, but no reservation was made specifically for that table, which is shown to be a numbered table in the EC document, not an Event Services table.\nZona did request permission for that spot to be closer to students and Event Services agreed because the patio was open for elections. However, Event Services was not in charge of the table the EC had previously assigned,\nKeep checking back to Knight News for continuing SGA election coverage.', 'When she was growing up, Alexis Lemay remembers her mother getting up early every day for cancer treatments. \nIt was breast cancer. \nThe disease put a strain on their family, but her mother wouldn’t give up. She continued teaching kindergarten and wouldn’t miss a day of work. \nAfter a year-long battle, Lemay’s mother beat the disease. \nLemay, now a senior at UCF majoring in business, and a group of UCF students have been raising funds for the organization Base Camp. \nBase Camp provides a place for children fighting cancer to be just be kids. There’s video games, drawers of makeup, beautiful clothing for dress up and tons of food. \nThey celebrate birthdays and milestone parties at their facility in Winter Park. The organization also helps the families of patients by providing food and support, even donating lunches and dinners to nearby hospitals every week. \n“My mom may have been an adult with cancer but to be a child with cancer, it affects me even more,” Lemay said. “You think how scary that must be for them and to see them keep smiling throughout treatment is truly amazing.”\nLemay’s six-person group, Base Knights, has raised over $500 for the organization. They are just one of the almost 10 cornerstone groups helping Base Camp this semester. \nTerri Jones, president of Base Camp, estimates that students from UCF would bring in about $30,000 in cash, food and donations this semester.\nJones said their organization is starting a new campaign #ConquerTheClimb, which hopes to raise $100,000 in 10 years. With the help of these UCF students, they are one step closer.\n“We are able to do so much because of these students,” Jones said. “We’re so thankful for their hard work, and I can’t imagine what we’d do without them. The kids just adore them.”', 'Imagine graduating high school and rather than experiencing the freedom of going away to college, you are thrown into the front line of warfare. \nNot worried about which party to go to this Friday night, but of all the civilian lives you are responsible for protecting. \nThat is what the average teenager experiences in Israel.\nBeneath the Helmet began as the sun set Thursday night Mar. 19 at 8 p.m. in SU Room 221.

The five officers were selected from a pool of 278 applicants, and bring the total count to 71 officers across the main campus, Rosen, Lake Nona and the regional campuses, according to UCF spokeswoman Courtney Gilmartin.\nOfficers Terrell Alexander, Jerad Engel, Agustin Gonzalez and Ricky Lopez took their oath of office in front of UCF Police Chief Richard Beary. A fifth officer, a retired NYPD officer and Army veteran, prefers to let his classmates have the spotlight.\nOfficer Jerad Engel was a staff sergeant for the Florida Air National Guard. He also has experience working security for a hospital in Jacksonville. When asked about his new role, he said he’s excited about “interacting with the public and making sure UCF students are safe and protected.”\n“These officers will help UCF Police enhance our community-policing practices and deliver on our mission to provide a safe environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors,” said UCF Police Chief Richard Beary. “We are excited to welcome them to our family.”\nThe officers started a field-training program back in September, and will continue through five months of classroom training and working in the field while paired with a UCFPD officer.\nUCFPD plans to hire two additional classes, with four to five officers over the next several years, according to Gilmartin.', 'In the early 1970s, motion pictures took a new direction when Bruce Lee introduced martial arts cinema to the world. Since then, he has remained a film icon and influenced countless people to take up martial arts as a hobby. If it weren’t for Bruce Lee, 24-year-old UCF karate team coach Colton Woodard may have never found his passion for karate or have been selected to represent the United States at the World Karate Federation (WKF) championships in Okinawa, Japan.\nWhen William Woodard, Colton’s father, got his ACL and MCL injured during high school while playing football in the early 70s, he was told by doctors he would never play any sport again but refused to obey those rules and was inspired while watching Bruce Lee to become a martial arts expert. At age 17, he began training, winning competitions and saw that even as a cripple, he could beat others and was in fact able to do a sport. Since then he has travelled internationally, taught karate for over 40 years and become the president of the National Karate Kobudo Federation (NKKF) as well as the vice president of Kuniba Kai International.\n“I didn’t have to do karate but fell in love with it as well when I went to Okinawa as a teenager and watched my dad compete,” says Colton. That’s something that inspired me as an american. To perform at an olympic level and really step up my game and represent our country athletically.”\nColton got a real passion, greater respect and understanding for karate while in Japan seeing how it was different than in America. Since then, he has made it his mission as an american to be really good at karate and become a world competitor. He is ecstatic that karate is in the final approval process of being added to the Olympics for 2020 and hopes to be able to compete in the upcoming games.\nOn November 28-29, Colton will represent the US in the Karate 1 Premier League in Okinawa, Japan along with three other representatives from California. He first had to place in state representing Florida AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) Karate and was then put into a national selection pool where he was selected.\nKarate has been a part of Colton’s life since he was about two or three years old. He won his first world championship at age five and since has won AAU state championships multiple times competing in places such as Chicago, Las Vegas, North Carolina, New York and more.\n“I’ve been competing every year and getting close you know, getting runner up but I got second place and then you get placed in a selection pool for the USA national team and I got placed in the selection pool a couple of times so when I actually got selected for the USA team this year, I was like ‘Wow, no way! This is finally coming true all these years later,” says Colton.\nWhen he found out he made the USA team, he knew that nothing was going to hold him back and it had been something he was saving up for overtime. Selling possessions such as guitars, he says that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity because he never knows if he will qualify again. As a karate teacher in three different schools, this will also add to his resume and give him many great experiences he might not have otherwise. If Colton wins in the Male Kata (floor routine) and Kumite (fighting), he can never compete as an amateur again because WKF is a professional circuit.\n“Money can’t buy that kind of experience. You can’t buy your way into qualifying for a tournament,” says Colton.\nHe knows money will always come back and many of his friends and family have helped him along the way as well as UCF’s OSI by paying his registration fee to compete.\nColton is going to Japan alone but is meeting with his coach, Soke Kozo Kuniba, whom he first met when he was eight. Although they have a bit of a communication barrier, they still understand each other well enough since Colton knows a bit of conversational Japanese and knows karate terms. Kozo Kuniba speaks a bit of English as well which helps them communicate.\nColton’s WKF competitors range from ages 19-35 and are the best of their countries.\n“I might be the nicest guy in the world, but as soon as my feet step in that ring, it’s just business. I’m here to work. I got to do my job. Afterwards, man, I’ll shake your hand and we can be friends, I’ll buy you a beer but when we get in the ring, I got to do my job, you got to do yours and only one of us is going to win,” says Colton.\nUCF karate team coach Colton Woodard will represent the United States at the World Karate Federation championship.Photo by Katrina Poggio.\nThe competitions are always a challenge he says but it is very rewarding because when he wins, he realizes all the matches he had to overcome and there is a great comradery that comes with that realization as well.\nWhile in Okinawa, Colton will train a few days before with Kozo Kuniba as well as be introduced to many grandmasters his coach knows.\nWith the Karate Team at UCF, he wants to do a seminar at UCF with the grandmasters he is meeting in Japan where all students can come meet them and get their autographs. There will hopefully also be a free clinic with them where attendees can learn first hand from masters of the art.\nColton aspires to make a competition team at UCF with avid athletes that will train seriously and compete in the AAU karate league traveling for state and national competitions. So far, there are 28 official members signed and he hopes to take about 12 competitors to the four state qualifying competitions held in Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Fort Pierce.\nAs the founder of the Karate Team at UCF, he is happy showing the community different skills which many people charge for in places he likes to call McDojos. These places are workout kind of martial arts instead of the samurai art form that has been passed down from teacher to student over hundreds of years. He hopes to keep karate as original as possible and wants to inspire others to preserve the art but also strive for excellence and to focus on the competition aspect of karate.\nBesides the Karate Team at UCF, Colton also teaches in Ocala Karate Dojo and Socrates Preparatory School. Collectively, he has 100 students ranging from ages four to 56.\n“It really is a passion of mine because I get to see results. It’s not always a fast thing but this past year, our team from Ocala, we had 26 state champions, 16 national champions and named top 20 schools of the United States for the fifth year in a row,” says Colton. That’s a really big feat for us and i’m hoping to get that same level of competition, the same accomplishments, here at UCF this coming up year. Bring that same kind of training and dedication to our school.”\nAs a referee for the state of Florida competitions, he has gone through training where he has a good base knowing what judges are looking for. Training takes a lot of dedication and patience but shows overtime.\nGrowing up, Colton was never forced to do martial arts and neither was his brother, Dalton. They both still share the same love for karate although Dalton now lives as a blues guitarist in New York.\nEven though he competed in multiple competitions throughout his life, Colton never missed school due to karate but says he truly lived like the real karate kid. After school, he would finish his homework and then train in the Dojo his father built behind their house. Sometimes he trained so hard and was so tired that he would pass out and wake up with a blanket on him that his parents placed.\n“Colton has always been the Karate Kid. He trains for perfection. He is a dynamically motivated individual, and succeeds at whatever he sets out to do,” says William Woodward.\nNow Colton is a junior at UCF studying pre-clinical health sciences with goals of becoming a surgeon and hopes of continuing graduate school right at UCF. Besides karate, he has always had a deep interest in the medical fields and was inspired to become a surgeon when he had to get five stitches on his finger after slicing it with a sword he was cleaning.\nHis main goal besides becoming a surgeon is to win a medal for USA and to compete well into his 30s until his body can’t take it anymore or doctor’s say he cannot.\n“I feel like everything is finally coming together at the right point of my life,” says Colton. “I feel like i’m at the peak of my athletic abilities as well.”\nColton is one step closer to making his dreams a reality with the upcoming WKF competition and is not just going against the USA this time, but against the world.\n“I loved going to tournaments as a kid and have competed my whole life. I loved the thrill of being there and having a crowd screaming and going against people that you knew were top quality martial artists. I still have that same excitement,” Colton says. “You know, you get those butterflies if you know the guy’s awesome. If you know he’s from Macau or Japan or China or Taiwan or he might be from Africa or Sweden or Iran and you know nothing about this competitor but you know he’s a black belt and he’s the very best of his country. Knowing that, I get this super excitement going and hey, I might not win but I’m going against the very best and that’s something I can always say for the rest of my life.”\nPhotos by Katrina Poggio.']",['https://knightnews.com/2015/10/ucf-karate-coach-to-compete-in-world-karate-federation-competition/'],"['In the early 1970s, motion pictures took a new direction when Bruce Lee introduced martial arts cinema to the world.

He won his first world championship at age five and since has won AAU state championships multiple times competing in places such as Chicago, Las Vegas, North Carolina, New York and more.\n“I’ve been competing every year and getting close you know, getting runner up but I got second place and then you get placed in a selection pool for the USA national team and I got placed in the selection pool a couple of times so when I actually got selected for the USA team this year, I was like ‘Wow, no way! This is finally coming true all these years later,” says Colton.\nWhen he found out he made the USA team, he knew that nothing was going to hold him back and it had been something he was saving up for overtime. Selling possessions such as guitars, he says that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity because he never knows if he will qualify again. As a karate teacher in three different schools, this will also add to his resume and give him many great experiences he might not have otherwise. If Colton wins in the Male Kata (floor routine) and Kumite (fighting), he can never compete as an amateur again because WKF is a professional circuit.\n“Money can’t buy that kind of experience. You can’t buy your way into qualifying for a tournament,” says Colton.\nHe knows money will always come back and many of his friends and family have helped him along the way as well as UCF’s OSI by paying his registration fee to compete.\nColton is going to Japan alone but is meeting with his coach, Soke Kozo Kuniba, whom he first met when he was eight. Although they have a bit of a communication barrier, they still understand each other well enough since Colton knows a bit of conversational Japanese and knows karate terms. Kozo Kuniba speaks a bit of English as well which helps them communicate.\nColton’s WKF competitors range from ages 19-35 and are the best of their countries.\n“I might be the nicest guy in the world, but as soon as my feet step in that ring, it’s just business. I’m here to work. I got to do my job. Afterwards, man, I’ll shake your hand and we can be friends, I’ll buy you a beer but when we get in the ring, I got to do my job, you got to do yours and only one of us is going to win,” says Colton.\nUCF karate team coach Colton Woodard will represent the United States at the World Karate Federation championship.Photo by Katrina Poggio.\nThe competitions are always a challenge he says but it is very rewarding because when he wins, he realizes all the matches he had to overcome and there is a great comradery that comes with that realization as well.\nWhile in Okinawa, Colton will train a few days before with Kozo Kuniba as well as be introduced to many grandmasters his coach knows.\nWith the Karate Team at UCF, he wants to do a seminar at UCF with the grandmasters he is meeting in Japan where all students can come meet them and get their autographs. There will hopefully also be a free clinic with them where attendees can learn first hand from masters of the art.\nColton aspires to make a competition team at UCF with avid athletes that will train seriously and compete in the AAU karate league traveling for state and national competitions. So far, there are 28 official members signed and he hopes to take about 12 competitors to the four state qualifying competitions held in Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Fort Pierce.\nAs the founder of the Karate Team at UCF, he is happy showing the community different skills which many people charge for in places he likes to call McDojos. These places are workout kind of martial arts instead of the samurai art form that has been passed down from teacher to student over hundreds of years. He hopes to keep karate as original as possible and wants to inspire others to preserve the art but also strive for excellence and to focus on the competition aspect of karate.\nBesides the Karate Team at UCF, Colton also teaches in Ocala Karate Dojo and Socrates Preparatory School. Collectively, he has 100 students ranging from ages four to 56.\n“It really is a passion of mine because I get to see results. It’s not always a fast thing but this past year, our team from Ocala, we had 26 state champions, 16 national champions and named top 20 schools of the United States for the fifth year in a row,” says Colton. That’s a really big feat for us and i’m hoping to get that same level of competition, the same accomplishments, here at UCF this coming up year. Bring that same kind of training and dedication to our school.”\nAs a referee for the state of Florida competitions, he has gone through training where he has a good base knowing what judges are looking for. Training takes a lot of dedication and patience but shows overtime.\nGrowing up, Colton was never forced to do martial arts and neither was his brother, Dalton. They both still share the same love for karate although Dalton now lives as a blues guitarist in New York.\nEven though he competed in multiple competitions throughout his life, Colton never missed school due to karate but says he truly lived like the real karate kid. After school, he would finish his homework and then train in the Dojo his father built behind their house. Sometimes he trained so hard and was so tired that he would pass out and wake up with a blanket on him that his parents placed.\n“Colton has always been the Karate Kid. He trains for perfection. He is a dynamically motivated individual, and succeeds at whatever he sets out to do,” says William Woodward.\nNow Colton is a junior at UCF studying pre-clinical health sciences with goals of becoming a surgeon and hopes of continuing graduate school right at UCF. Besides karate, he has always had a deep interest in the medical fields and was inspired to become a surgeon when he had to get five stitches on his finger after slicing it with a sword he was cleaning.\nHis main goal besides becoming a surgeon is to win a medal for USA and to compete well into his 30s until his body can’t take it anymore or doctor’s say he cannot.\n“I feel like everything is finally coming together at the right point of my life,” says Colton. “I feel like i’m at the peak of my athletic abilities as well.”\nColton is one step closer to making his dreams a reality with the upcoming WKF competition and is not just going against the USA this time, but against the world.\n“I loved going to tournaments as a kid and have competed my whole life. I loved the thrill of being there and having a crowd screaming and going against people that you knew were top quality martial artists. I still have that same excitement,” Colton says. “You know, you get those butterflies if you know the guy’s awesome. If you know he’s from Macau or Japan or China or Taiwan or he might be from Africa or Sweden or Iran and you know nothing about this competitor but you know he’s a black belt and he’s the very best of his country. Knowing that, I get this super excitement going and hey, I might not win but I’m going against the very best and that’s something I can always say for the rest of my life.”\nPhotos by Katrina Poggio.']"

Now new details are finally surfacing. \nKnight News received a tip that UCF was planning to place non-Greek students in the fraternity house for the upcoming spring semester due to an overbooking of on campus housing.\nWhen asked about the tip, UCF spokesman Chad Binette said, “We have made no determinations about the long-term use of this house. However, we are scheduled to accommodate four male students at the former Theta Chi house on a temporary basis during the spring semester.”\nBinette did not specify as to whether these four students were involved in Greek life or not.\nUCF often has multiple openings for on campus housing during move-in weekends, according to Binette.\n“We typically have multiple openings come up during move-in weekend, so these four students could soon be housed in other locations. The students have agreed to the temporary arrangements,” said Binette.\n[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”79256″]\nUCF did not specify what would happen if more students wanted to live on campus come the spring semester. If no openings are available on campus, it is uncertain if UCF would continue to fill the house with more new residents.\nIt was also unsaid whether these four male students would have a RA if they lived in the house or if they would have the entire house to themselves.  ', 'Scott Frost, UCF Football’s new head coach, focused heavily on the importance of in-state recruiting and finding the right staff at a press conference on Thursday.\n“We’re going to add the right pieces whenever it is possible to add them. There might be an add or two as this semester starts,” Frost said. “Florida is obviously one of the richest recruiting grounds in the country and I think we’d be foolish not to do the majority of our recruiting right here around home.”\nFrost met with the media on Thursday to give an update on what he has been doing in his first month on the job as head coach of the UCF football program. The biggest questions posed to Frost surrounded the development of his coaching staff and the strides that the new regime has made in attracting recruits.\n“We want kids to want to come here,” Frost said. “To be honest with you, I’m not as concerned if they have four stars or five stars or two stars after their name. I want the right guys, I want the right type of character guys and the right type of athletes.”\nThe Knights’ new defensive coordinator Erik Chinander also made it clear that the program needs to recruit from within and focus on the vast talent crop that the state of Florida has to offer.\n“When we were at Oregon, obviously there is somewhere between 5 and 15 division one recruits per year,” Chinander said. “But now you’ve got everybody in your backyard, so I don’t have to get on planes every night and I don’t have to take red eyes. I drive to Tampa and I stay in town or I drive down to Miami, it’s going to be awesome.”\nChinander is just the latest hire for the Knights who now have most of the staff in place heading into the 2016 season.

The biggest questions posed to Frost surrounded the development of his coaching staff and the strides that the new regime has made in attracting recruits.\n“We want kids to want to come here,” Frost said. “To be honest with you, I’m not as concerned if they have four stars or five stars or two stars after their name. I want the right guys, I want the right type of character guys and the right type of athletes.”\nThe Knights’ new defensive coordinator Erik Chinander also made it clear that the program needs to recruit from within and focus on the vast talent crop that the state of Florida has to offer.\n“When we were at Oregon, obviously there is somewhere between 5 and 15 division one recruits per year,” Chinander said. “But now you’ve got everybody in your backyard, so I don’t have to get on planes every night and I don’t have to take red eyes. I drive to Tampa and I stay in town or I drive down to Miami, it’s going to be awesome.”\nChinander is just the latest hire for the Knights who now have most of the staff in place heading into the 2016 season.

This is a team that has been through a lot, I’m so proud of them, I’m so happy for them,” consoled UCF Head Coach Scott Frost with the season’s bigger picture in mind.\nThere were glimmers of hope for the recently stagnant UCFast system – leaping out to an early 7-0 lead on the game’s first series, pulling off an unexpected 72-yard tick play touchdown from Tristan Payton to Tre’Quan Smith, almost recovering a sneaky onside kick – but it was clear all game that this was a battle waged between two units firing in different dimensions this season.\nUSF’s lethal combination of rushing ammunition blew the game wide open in waves of quick-strike scores, recording rushing touchdowns of 24, 43, 56 and 62 yards.\nQuarterback Quinton Flowers teamed up with his backfield partner Marlon Mack to combine for 307 yards and four touchdowns, dominating to the tune of 7.7 yards per carry. \xa0Mack alone accounted for 155 yards and two scored on 20 carries, putting the elite running back over 1,000 years for his third consecutive season.\nEven with the outstanding play from Mack, not enough can be said about Quinton Flowers’ contributions; the USF offense runs through him. Flowers carried the ball as many times as Mack did, broke the 62 yard score, completed 17-of-26 passes for 152 yards, had no turnovers and even completed a pass to himself.\nMcKenzie Milton had a completely different day under center.\nHe was hit continuously and had to play a serious game of keep-away from the Bulls’ pass rush, finding turf three times under USF pressure. The Bulls’ three sacks totaled a loss of -22 yards for UCF, and Milton was coerced into two interceptions – even though he did rack up 225 yards on 42 pass attempts.\nWith no real running game to back him up, Milton received the brunt of the physical USF defense. His backs combined to give him 27 yards. Very few programs can win games with 27 rushing yards, especially when piloted by a true freshman quarterback.\n“They get a first down and somebody goes sixty [yards]. We get a first down and we have to get more first downs. It’s hard to maintain a drive for fifteen plays and execute for all those plays down the field. We’ll have a day when guys are taking it to the house from sixty and those sort of things,” said Frost about the offensive production today.\nUCF was outflanked, outmanned and out planned in this years’ installment of the War on I4. Their normally stout defense surrendered 503 yards and more points than they have since a loss at The Big House in the second week of 2016. The offensive struggles continued, and there were numerous blown opportunities.\nAt 6-6, though, progress has definitely still been made.\n“I’m proud of our team,” said linebacker Shaqem Griffin. “We came together, we could have been out there arguing like last year, but we didn’t. We came together and we kept fighting.”\nUCF will move on from the first sanctioned battle in this now-trophied rivalry with a bowl game, a consolation prize that seemed impossible just twelve short months ago. To Frost, who has made it clear that this season was not about wins or losses in his mind, today’s loss was just a launching pad.\n“Someday we’ll have the script flipped and we’ll be the good team and teams are going to need breaks against us. Right now we needed to make those things happen and they went the wrong way.”', 'Scott Frost and team will have a chance to end a rebound year at Raymond James Stadium this Saturday and gain bragging rights with the War On I-4.\nThe Knights were picked to finish last in the American Athletic Conference at media day in Rhode Island where performance expectations matched that of the 2015 season. Despite the odds, Frost built up a 6-5 record that\xa0should\xa0have been at least 9-2, as the Bulls have built.\nFour out of the last five losses came when UCF was either leading or tied at the half – three of those losses where the Knights led by more that one score – but crumbled in the second half. The first loss came at the hands of No. 3 powerhouse University of Michigan.\nIf UCF expects to take out the number two offense in the country, key players such as senior linebacker Shaquem Griffin (11 sacks, 17.5 TFL) and Errol Clarke (6.5 sacks, 10 TFL) must close out the running lanes to Quinton Flowers and Marlon Mack. The\xa0caveat to USF’s offense has shown to be the kind of passing game that, on paper, will concede to UCF’s pass defense. Even in the 2015 campaign, UCF managed to hold out the bomb passes that trailed their way downfield, and in the Bulls’ most recent game against SMU, holes in the pass efficiency made clear the way Eric Chinander could stack the defense.\nThe UCF offensive drives will be what to watch.\nAn underperforming Knights offense and Bulls defense will make those drives shaky but critical for Frost if his plans to outpace the opposing offense. UCF QB Mackenzie Milton will need to sharpen the mechanics of his passing to hit the big plays and break the dry spell of passing touchdowns that took place. That’s not to say that Milton is the only one at fault – the UCF offensive line has occasionally faltered in giving Milton those few extra seconds to find an open receiver.\nCalls to put in former starting QB Justin Holman were met with a stark no from Frost in Monday morning’s press conference, who plans on sticking with Milton, barring any unusual circumstances.\nIf Milton can improve his explosiveness as part of the ‘UCFast’ mantra, then USF should concede touchdowns no-problem.\nIf UCF can restore their run game, however, then USF will have reason to be concerned.\nIn the wake of a chance to get their first 10-win season since 1997, the Bulls have a desire to succeed and are favored considerably but won’t see the same scoring margin as last-time-out at Bright House.\nA trophy with a base and detachable key were revealed on Sunday to go to the winner of the noon game. Orlando and Tampa, UCF and USF, respectively, are lasered into one side of the interstate-roadsign shaped key hold. All previous matchups will go onto a plaque, according to the current plan.\nKickoff for the War On I-4 takes place at noon at Raymond James Stadium.']",['https://knightnews.com/2016/11/the-war-on-i-4-ucf-vs-usf/'],"['Scott Frost and team will have a chance to end a rebound year at Raymond James Stadium this Saturday and gain bragging rights with the War On I-4.\nThe Knights were picked to finish last in the American Athletic Conference at media day in Rhode Island where performance expectations matched that of the 2015 season.

I don’t like to direct it,” said Dixon, a 1975 graduate in accounting, to the Orlando Sentinel.\n“This is money I’m giving to the athletic department to do the things they need to do to hopefully make it a Top 25 program one of these days.”\nAccording to a Board of Trustees agenda, the gift will “help fund certain priorities of University of Central Florida, including building themed walkways connecting the training and competition facilities in the athletics village, constructing four recognition monument signs, and providing working capital to help fund other existing athletics priorities, as determined by the Vice President and Director of Athletics.”\nThe We Rise and Conquer Initiative by UCF Athletics will benefit from this donation – the gift amounts to 20% of its set goal.\nThe goals of the UCF Athletics under the campaign:\nNew facilities across all sports fall under the umbrella for the money raised.\n\n“World-class facilities have never been more important to attract recruits and win championships. We are seeking more than $25 million in charitable gift commitments from alumni and friends to construct and renovate facilities where our student-athletes live, study, train and compete,” the campaign says.\nThis isn’t the first time Dixon has made a large donation to the university. The UCF school of accounting holds Dixon’s name after a 2004 donation amounting to $2.5 million to academics was made. The donation was eligible for state matching funds at the time, reaching a ceiling of $5 million.\nWith the most recent donation, UCF will provide Dixon with naming rights to an “athletics village,” pending trustee approval.\nThe mentioned village will span 95 acres over CFE Arena, Bright House Networks Stadium, and other nearby facilities.\n“The Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village is defined as the current 95 acres or any successor site on which intercollegiate home game athletics are played, including\xa0the current CFE Arena, Bright House Networks Football Stadium, John Euliano Park for baseball (pending Board of Trustees approval), Nicholson Field House, Wayne Densch Center for Student-Athlete Leadership, softball, soccer, and track facilities, and associated practice fields and plazas,” a memo for the Board of Trustees’ upcoming Friday meeting said.\nPhoto courtesy of Chris Cummings', 'The We Rise and Conquer Campaign, constructed by Director of Athletics Danny White and the UCF Athletics board, sets a goal of $25 million dollars for the future of UCF Athletics.\nIn the campaign outline are milestones university administration have made to mark the progress of the donation campaign, along with information that compares UCF as a money-making school.\nBudget comparisons with the Power 5 conferences, annual fund comparisons within the American Athletic Conference, and revenue comparisons with the Big 12’s Kansas State are among a few references to where UCF stands in terms of resources.\n\n“That’s our vision for UCF Athletics. I believe — and I know you believe — we can be a Top 25 intercollegiate athletics program. But it takes more than belief,” White says. “It takes resources.”\n“Together, every UCF fan can help us achieve these goals. We’re rolling out The Rise and Conquer Initiative that will allow us to build new facilities, enhance our existing facilities and continue upgrading the programming that allows our young men and women who proudly wear the Black and Gold to have a championship experience in competition, in the classroom and in the community.”\n“With your support, we can create the positive impact that will provide an even brighter future for UCF Athletics and our student-athletes.

Coach Frost said that for the most part the depth chart has been set – with the exception of cornerback and offensive guard. Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander said as recently as Tuesday that the competition in the secondary will battle on until game day on Thursday.\nDefensive Backfield: All four of UCF’s starting defensive backs left the program in the offseason – a loss of 11 interceptions, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 242 tackles. New\nLinebacker: Headed into the spring football game, it looked like UCF had lost a ton of depth inside with the losses of Mark Rucker, Demeitre Brim, and Chequan Burkett. Luckily enough for UCF, Burquett’s decision to leave team didn’t last for long and he was welcomed back with open arms.\nShaquem Griffin remains cemented on the outside but lost a partner in crime, Errol Clarke – leaving a big gap on the other side of the field. With opponents likely to give huge attention to Shaquem, it frees up a massive opportunity for Titus Davis and position transfer Shawn Burgess-Becker to step up and eat.\nWide Receiver: Tre’Quan Smith is an absolute stud. His play in the offseason became a regular kind of special, where he continuously was said to separate himself head and shoulders from the crowd. The trick is the rotation behind him.\nOffensive coordinator Troy Walters said that UCF will have to use a receiver by committee approach, but that Emmanuel Logan-Greene has looked sharp all through camp. Expect blocking-specialist Cam Stewart to start the season on the outside, but Greene could quickly play his way from the slot into a more featured role.\nOffensive Line: Bookend tackles are nice to have. Really nice to have. They just don’t account for a system with pulling guards and constant high-tempo. Jordan Johnson stepped up last year at right guard but is making the cross-over to center while Freshman Sam Jackson has impressed enough to get the chance at Guard alongside Chavis Dickey headed into week one.', 'Knights on the Mall will open tailgate reservations on Sunday for the University of Central Florida’s football season opener against Florida International University.\nOn Sunday, August 27, at 6 p.m. students will be able to reserve a space here.\nTailgate time for UCF vs FIU:\nKnights on the Mall has curated a Frequently Asked Questions\xa0page to assist students with their reservation:\nRESERVATIONS\nHow do I make a reservation?\nReservations for each home game will be made on Knightsonthemall.com.

Coach Frost said that for the most part the depth chart has been set – with the exception of cornerback and offensive guard. Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander said as recently as Tuesday that the competition in the secondary will battle on until game day on Thursday.\nDefensive Backfield: All four of UCF’s starting defensive backs left the program in the offseason – a loss of 11 interceptions, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 242 tackles. New\nLinebacker: Headed into the spring football game, it looked like UCF had lost a ton of depth inside with the losses of Mark Rucker, Demeitre Brim, and Chequan Burkett. Luckily enough for UCF, Burquett’s decision to leave team didn’t last for long and he was welcomed back with open arms.\nShaquem Griffin remains cemented on the outside but lost a partner in crime, Errol Clarke – leaving a big gap on the other side of the field. With opponents likely to give huge attention to Shaquem, it frees up a massive opportunity for Titus Davis and position transfer Shawn Burgess-Becker to step up and eat.\nWide Receiver: Tre’Quan Smith is an absolute stud. His play in the offseason became a regular kind of special, where he continuously was said to separate himself head and shoulders from the crowd. The trick is the rotation behind him.\nOffensive coordinator Troy Walters said that UCF will have to use a receiver by committee approach, but that Emmanuel Logan-Greene has looked sharp all through camp. Expect blocking-specialist Cam Stewart to start the season on the outside, but Greene could quickly play his way from the slot into a more featured role.\nOffensive Line: Bookend tackles are nice to have. Really nice to have. They just don’t account for a system with pulling guards and constant high-tempo. Jordan Johnson stepped up last year at right guard but is making the cross-over to center while Freshman Sam Jackson has impressed enough to get the chance at Guard alongside Chavis Dickey headed into week one.']"

Karen Caudillo, who was one of those 10, sat on the far end of the table. She was the first to tell her story.\n“I came to Mexico when I was four years old,” she said. “I don’t remember my homeland.”\nCaudillo, a 21-year old business owner and political science student at UCF, had something in common with many of the people at the table. She is a DACA student, meaning that while she is protected from deportation under an Obama-era program while still being undocumented. She and the other DACA students sat alongside four Democratic members of the Florida legislature: Sen. Victor Torres (FL 15), Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (FL 49), Rep. Amy Mercado (FL 48) and Rep. John Cortes (FL 43).\nThe purpose of the dinner was to discuss the challenges facing undocumented students, including the over 100 DACA students who attend the University of Central Florida. While they are protected from deportation, the program is at risk of being axed by the Trump administration, which was reportedly working toward that aim as recently as last week.\n“I have been suffering from anxiety and a lot of uncertainty,” Caudillo said. “I don’t know what my life is going to look like, I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish school.”\nCaudillo, who lived in Naples before attending UCF, was a junior in high school when President Obama signed the executive order known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which gives undocumented people temporary protected status and a work permit if they entered the country before 2007 and before they turned 16.\n“President Obama may have signed DACA, but it was thanks to people who worked to get something done for DREAMers,” said Eli Garcia, an organizer for the Hope Community Center, which focuses in part on advocating on behalf of immigrant communities. She is also an undocumented student from Mexico.\nFollowing DACA’s implementation, Garcia said, the HCC created legal clinics to help eligible people sign up for the program. Still, there is a lot more to be done.\n“We’ve already helped something like 500 people, and we’re still working to help them as well as advocate for something more permanent,” she said.\nAnd the congresspeople who attended the dinner share that fight. Smith, whose district covers UCF, is one of those leading the fight to protect undocumented students. While he was born in the US to a Peruvian father and a Canadian mother, he says he understands and sympathizes with undocumented people who “have to hide in the shadows.”\n““The importance of this meeting is to first make sure that DREAMers know that they have people on their side who are willing to fight for them,” Smith said. “We want to send a message that in Donald Trump’s America, not everyone is against them. Second, hearing real-life stories keeps us grounded in the fight we are committed to.”\nLast March, Smith sponsored a bill dubbed the Florida Trust Act, which would have, among other things, prohibited state and local governments from complying with federal immigration authorities without a court order. However, the bill did not even make it to committee, something which does not discourage Smith, who plans on continuing to file the bill for “as long as it takes.”\n“It’s important to create that bond of trust between local law enforcement and local governments and immigrant communities, which has been shown to reduce crime,” he said.\nBut for students like Caudillo, it is an uphill battle. The Trump administration could end DACA in the coming weeks and both houses of the Florida legislature are controlled by Republicans.\n“It’s our obligation to resist. We have to resist these unconstitutional, racist, and bigoted policies that are coming from the Trump administration because our communities depend on it,” Smith said.\nStill, Sen. Torres said, immigrants have “economic power” in spite of not having political power. There are about 100,000 DACA recipients living in Florida, 8,000 of whom live in Orange County, according to the Migration Policy Institute. If all those people were to disappear, Torres said, the economy would suffer.\n“When you touch the wallet of an American, they cry,” he said.\nGarcia, the HCC organizer, said that what is important is for people to get involved and to contact their representatives to affect change. The dinner, she said, is one way of doing so.\n“The people representing us who don’t know our stories or don’t sit down with us don’t know what we’re going through,” she said. “I believe it was important to see them.”\n“We need to turn that fear into power.”\n\xa0\nCynthia Ramirez contributed to this report.', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – Trysten Hill is no stranger to attention. The 325-lb defensive lineman made waves his freshman year with stellar play and viral videos – squatting the weight of small cars to the delight of Knights fans everywhere.\nThe hype train only built speed over the offseason and the sophomore is poised to build off his first year at UCF in a big way but in a different position. Hill was moved inside this offseason to nose guard in a transition officially announced through the release of UCF’s depth chart on Friday.\nIt is a move that will draw attention up the middle of the defense, help stuff the run in a big way, and free up some of the playmakers around the defense – the most excited of whom may be Jamiyus Pittman, who was able to bump out to defensive end in a corresponding move.\n“I’m happy with what I’m working with,” said Pittman about the guys around him. “I think I can depend on everybody on the front seven – I can depend on my secondary [too], it’s just… I’m confident that we’ll go out and ball out on Thursday.”\n\xa0\nPittman started eight games in 2016 at nose, racking up a pair of sacks and 28 tackles while fighting through countless double teams – a formidable task for the generously listed six-foot-nothing lineman.\n“It gets me one-one-ones now,” gleefully explained Pittman. “No more helmets to the ribs. I’ll be out there working my magic like I was supposed to be [doing] last year.”\nHis partner in crime across the line, Tony Guerad, had double-digit tackles for a loss last year and notched 3.5 sacks of his own. The duo will get plenty of opportunities to wreak havoc this year, and it isn’t just Trysten’s move. Depth across the board will play a significant factor, and not just because this staff finally pieces to match the roles they carved out in this system, but because it lessens the problem of fatigue in the fourth quarter.\n“I expect more production out of those guys this year,” said Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “I expect them to run the show a little bit. With that being said, there are guys that can come in and spell them. It’s a little different than last year, last year we played those guys a little more as they clearly rose to the top of the depth chart.”\nUCF still boasts the reigning AAC Defensive Player of the Year and has great depth at outside linebacker by all accounts. If Hill is able to continue his growth and the rotation can play at full-tilt for sixty minutes, this defensive line is going to be scary good.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/08/jamiyus-pittman-and-ucfierce-pass-rush-prime-beneficiaries-of-trysten-hill-move-to-nose-guard/'],"['ORLANDO, Fla. – Trysten Hill is no stranger to attention.

We’re exhausting all options. We want to make sure that we get an eleventh game, and we’re working, we have a lot of irons in the fire trying to figure it out.”\nThe idea that UCF could replace that bye week does seem to be more and more of a concrete eventuality than a marginal pipe dream, but as fans in Orlando know all too well, nothing is certain until your opponent takes the field. With the hope slowly emerging for another game gaining ground as an eventuality, the program has begun to mentally steel themselves for the challenge ahead.\n“It’s not ideal,” said Head Coach Scott Frost about the potential change. “I liked where our bye week was when I saw the schedule came out.”\n“The good thing this year compared to last year is that last year the bye week got changed on us last minute, so we didn’t get a chance to give our kids any time off. There was no time to recover physically, there was no time to get rested, the one benefit this year compared to last year is these guys had about five or six days off. That should help us. We’re going to have a long stretch here of ten straight games – hopefully, if we get another game scheduled.”\nChallenging or not, there isn’t a player or coach on the team who would tell you that they would rather turn in for an extra week of rest than fit an opponent, any opponent, into the mix. The benefits of getting in the game are huge for every square inch of the program, even beyond the hashmarks.\nPlaying an eleventh game that week brings back suspended players Nevelle Clarke and Tristan Payton back a week earlier. It appeases season ticket holders to some extent for the loss of the Georgia Tech game. An eleventh game also provides an outstanding opportunity to further another run at bowl-game eligibility.\nThere’s just one place off the field that the game might hurt – recruiting. Coaches normally take that time to do some of their more extensive in-season recruiting, visiting kids that are far from local and checking out a couple of games. It’s\n“We’ll have to get out on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday night and go see some games,” said Offensive Coordinator Troy Walters on making up the time. “So, we’ll make adjustments and keep rolling, but first and foremost, we’ve got to win games,” he continued.\n“We’ll find ways to recruit, it’s easier to recruit when you’re winning games. That’s the key and that’s the focus – to win football games.”\nDefensive Coordinator Erik Chinander had similar comments about the situation, and added on that the proximity of UCF’s heavy in-state recruiting focus is a huge boost for situations like this.\n“Obviously we couldn’t go out during the hurricane, all the schools were closed so you’re going to lose a week on the road for recruiting, but fortunately being in the state of Florida, most of the players that we want come from the state of Florida, so we can get a lot of them here to a lot of our games,” Chinander explained.\n“When we were other places, we were flying across the country during our bye week. Here we’re driving to Miami, we’re driving to Ft. Lauderdale, we’re driving to Tallahassee, so I think we can get those kids here and then maybe on a Thursday night or Friday night for games we can get there and see them.”\nNothing is a better teacher than experience, and for the Knights, Hurricane Matthew’s stopover during the First Frost is keeping anyone from hitting the panic button.\n“That’s a little bit above my head right there,” admitted Chinander. “It’s for the head coach to have a plan and I know he’s going to have a great plan for us moving forward. He’s been in situations like this where we play a lot of games in a row, some of us have been to the NFL where sometimes you play twelve games in a row. To me, I don’t really care. I don’t really care when our bye week is, I don’t care if we get one, I just want to play.”\nFor now, we can only wait for official word on the status of UCF’s scheduled bye week, making for what could be a very important lazy Saturday in October.', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – Living in the consequence of a schedule altered by state-wide emergency, suspended UCF Defensive Back Nevelle Clarke and Wide Receiver Tristan Payton will not be unavailable to return to action until after the Knights’ October 21st game against Navy. There has not been an increase in the suspension’s game length, only a push back of the date UCF will take the field a seventh time.\nThe dup was handed a six-game suspension in December of 2016 for violating NCAA mandated drug tests leading up to UCF’s Cure Bowl appearance. Terms of the suspension dictated by NCAA policy mandated that the two would miss six-games, minimum.\nOriginally that meant surviving without two of the team’s top talents until the East Carolina game at Spectrum Stadium on October 14th. It meant missing two conference games in Memphis and Cincinnati, as well as FIU, Georgia Tech, Maryland, and Maine.\nWith the movement of their schedule – canceling the Georgia Tech game and replacing Maine with Memphis – UCF will not play their sixth game until October 21st, a road trip to Annapolis against a respected Navy team.\nThe ambiguity on their return to the team will depend on if UCF is able to nail down an eleventh game during their scheduled bye week. If so, Clarke and Payton will make a triumphant return to an easier level of competition in the form of a late-add FCS opponent. If not, the two will get their first taste of the 2017 college football season November 4th in a conference matchup against SMU in Dallas.\nUnless the Knights announce drastic changes to a NCAA policy, missing an extra conference game may serve a huge blow. Granted, the addition of ECU is a minor task in comparison to slaying extremely tough competition in Memphis and Cincinnati, but anything can happen on any given Saturday.', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – It has felt like an eternity without football in Central Florida, existing in strange paradox where UCF fans were forced to the sidelines to watch as the college football season rolled right along without them. Even the other teams affected in week two were able to get back to a semblance or regularity with relative quickness, but circumstances called for a longer pause in Orlando.\n\nFinally, with the community well on the road to recovery from Hurricane Irma, the Knights are back to focusing on the gridiron.\n“Well it’s early, but Monday felt like Monday for the first time in a couple of weeks a day felt like it’s supposed to feel,” said Head Coach Scott Frost. “Players responded well, I thought they came out and practiced really well today, so hopefully we’re taking the first step to getting back to a regular schedule.”\nThursday and Friday were both days to shake the rust off, regroup and begin the process of mentally locking into the process again before taking the weekend off. It was the first football UCF had really sniffed since the Friday’s pregame activities leading into the cancelled.\nMemphis game, but not the first time they had progressed as a team in that time span.\nHelping alongside the National Guard, hunkering down together in the dorms to outlast the storm of the century, filling sandbags and working at the food bank – the Knights jumped at the chance to be productive in some fashion without football.\n“We had a number of guys here and a good piece of the team here, we didn’t want to sit on our hands and do nothing. We lifted both mornings and then we went and did things and then our players really answered the call. We didn’t make it mandatory but we told them we had some opportunities to go out and help people in the community and the guys responded in force,” said Frost.\n“I was with the group that did sandbags and most of those guys worked hard, hopefully, we made a little bit of a difference there. Sounds like they really worked hard at the food bank. Those are two small things, but when people are hurting and when there is damage in the area, we have an army of guys here and we’re going to be looking for ways we can help.”\nHurricane Irma afforded one of those rare moments when the pulse of the city around you trumps even the most sacred of days, a college football Saturday. It gave the opportunity to do better for the community, to strengthen the bond between the University of Central Florida and the city that supports it.\nThe benefits from such altruistic actions flow both ways in situations like this. Chemistry, camaraderie, and confidence are all birthed from moments like this.\n“Anytime you can go do something as a team that doesn’t have to do with football, I think it helps you,” he insisted. “Watching those guys work together, filling sandbags, was fun for me. Seeing which guys were working hard and which guys were helping each other, all of those things bring your team closer together. This team we have this year, I think is going to respond to any curveballs that are thrown a lot better than our team last year, and a lot of it has to do with how close-knit these guys are.”\nMaryland will be the perfect test, a redemptive shot at the team that brought UCF to its knees in a dogfight of a game, winning in overtime after stopping McKenzie Milton in his first start. This weekend, we find out if the bonds built during a category five storm are strong enough to withstand a favored Maryland team.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/09/rest-recuperation-and-recruiting-ucf-prepared-for-the-potential-complications-of-losing-their-scheduled-bye-week/'],"['ORLANDO, Fla. – For the second consecutive season, UCF is staring down the barrel at the potential of losing their allotted bye week in a wicked act of unfortunate circumstance.\nIn 2016 the Knights played a makeup game against Tulane in the tenth week of the college football season after a last-minute scratch in the shadow of Hurricane Matthew; in 2017 the program is in aggressive pursuit of adding a make-up game resulting from Hurricane Irma’s far-reaching influence.\n“We’re working really hard to try and find an eleventh game,” insisted UCF Athletic Director Danny White last week. “I don’t want this team – they’ve worked too hard – they deserve to play at least eleven.

When these two teams met in 2016 both were fledgling programs in transition – transitioning coaching staffs, schemes, recruit demographics and body types.\nMcKenzie Milton started under center for the first time in his collegiate career, fumbling the ball six times but keeping UCF competitive in a 30-24 overtime loss. He flashed promise and athleticism, but clearly had a ton of growing to do. It was, after all, an emergency decision to burn his redshirt in replacing the injured Justin Holman.\nHis stat line in that brutal loss went for three lost fumbles, completed 21-of-36 passes for two touchdowns and an interception, which by all means a decent performance, but one marred by a fair amount of mistakes from inexperience. He did lose three fumbles, but it could have been worse; McKenzie was actually credited for fumbling six times, UCF just fell on half of them.\n“Was it six fumbles? Sweet, fancy Moses,” recalled Coach Frost.\n“We watched the game from last year a bunch of times. I think overall as a team we played pretty well – well enough to win. We made too many mistakes and it cost us the ball game. We had fumbles on exchanges, we had tipped ball interceptions, McKenzie threw one backwards over his head for a fifteen-yard loss or something.”\nThis year McKenzie enters the game still in the afterglow of his last performance, a four-touchdown torching of FIU that stuck him with AAC Offensive Player of the Week for College Football’s opening weekend. He has a year of experience under his belt, countless tools around him and a better grasp on the playbook.\nIt would appear to be the perfect setup to take the sting from the raw wound of a tough-fought overtime loss. It would appear to be a path to redemption, especially with the consideration that Maryland will themselves be starting a true-freshman quarterback after their established starter went down with an early-season injury.\nPoetic, no? Not to McKenzie. He’s stepped away from the macro view of his career for a scoped down, single game mentality.\n“You can’t ever erase a loss, it was last year so I’m not really too worried about it,” said Milton “I’ve just got to take it one game at a time, so I’m not really dwelling on last year, I’m not looking at it like payback, I just want to be 1-0 at the end of this week.”\nA season removed from the game, Milton’s growth parallels the transformation both teams have undergone.\n“I think he’s kind of indicative of both teams right now,” UCF Head Coach Scott Frost said this week. “He’s a lot better player than he was when these two teams first squared off last year, but I think both teams as a whole are better than they were when UCF played Maryland last year. I expect a great competition and a whale of a game.”\nUCF and Maryland are now both well along in their transitory phases, garnering attention on the national stage – an easy feat when you rank out as the NCAA’s number one and two scoring offenses.\nMaryland is 2-0 and coming off a well-placed bye week, UCF is eager to truly begin the season after circumstance and will have fresh legs all around. Expect these evenly matched up-and-comers to put on a show on Saturday, but this time with established identities.', 'By: Daniel Wolff\nORLANDO, Fla.- UCF (1-0) takes on the Maryland Terrapins (2-0) this Saturday, following two consecutive weekends off due to Hurricane Irma. Last year the Knights lost to Maryland 30-24 in McKenzie Milton’s first career start, a double-overtime thriller.\nMaryland joined the Big 10 in 2014, and the program has been improving since.\nThis year they intend on making the leap into the national spotlight under the guidance of Head Coach DJ Durkin, who has gone 8-7 at the helm of the Terrapins since taking over in 2016. They are currently 2-0, and sit just outside of the AP top 25 poll while boasting the nation’s No. 2 scoring offense.\nHere are some keys to this Saturday’s game.\nTerrapin Offense:\nThe Running Game\nThe offense starts up front for Maryland. The offensive line has been impressive thus far, opening huge holes for their running backs in addition to protecting the quarterback. The team has rushed for 315 yards per game. Junior running back Ty Johnson leads the way, rushing for 257 yards on only 17 carries.\n“We don’t want (to play) someone who is averaging 100 yards a game, we want the best of the best, we want the heavyweight championship. You’ve got to beat the champion sometime, so it’s going to be a good one. I’m excited.,” Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander said about facing Johnson.\nKasim Hill\nTrue freshman quarterback Kasim Hill took over mid-way through the Texas game, after Tyrell Pigrome tore his ACL.\n“He’s big, he’s six three, 230 lbs, he can run the ball – against Towson he showed he could throw it pretty well, so I’m impressed with him and the way he’s handled himself,” said Chinander.\nThe offense hasn’t skipped a beat since Hill took over. It ranks 2nd in the nation in points per game and Kasim Hill has completed a whopping 84.2% of his passes. Most of those passes were against Towson, an FCS school, but UCF should not take him lightly.\n“I think they’re smart in asking him to do the things that he can do, he throws it well and he runs it well,” Coach Frost said.\nThe Knights’ Approach\nThe Knights’ defense is strong in the right places. UCF’s defensive front will need to play a big role. They will need to contain Ty Johnson from getting into open space. If they can force Maryland into passing downs, UCF’s pass rush could really fluster the true freshman.\nThe Knights will be looking to their decorated outside linebacker Shaquem Griffin to have a big day.\n“We have to tackle, our D-line has to get after it, we didn’t really get after FIU. We have to come out strong.,” Senior Defensive Lineman Tony Guerad said. “We didn’t do everything we could do, we did our assignments. Expect us to get after the QB this game.”\nMaryland on Defense:\nStrong Front Seven, Man Coverage on The Outside\nMaryland returned 6 out of 7 starters on the front seven this year. Last year this group struggled, but they have exhibited significant improvement in this young season. They held Texas to 3.16 yards per carry in week one, while sacking the quarterback five times.\n“They’re similar to our defense, they are very aggressive, they’ll be in the three-down front, four-down front, they’re going to blitz their linebackers and on the perimeter, they’re going to play man-to-man. “They’re going to lock up the outside guys and put pressure on the quarterback,” Offensive Coordinator Troy Walters explained.\nInside linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr anchors the unit, putting together 15 tackles, four for a loss, 2.5 sacks and a forced fumble in just two games. He flies off the film, and has impressed UCF coaches and players alike.\n“I see number one every special teams [play], so I know they’re tough kids. Not only are they good skill players, but also tough players. That’s impressive,” admitted Chinander this week.\nBoth McKenzie and Coach Frost mentioned the increased speed of this defense – stopping to mention Carter Jr independently – saying that the unit is improved significantly since the Knights had them in their sights at last meeting.\n“Their inside linebacker, number one, is pretty good. Their safety number four, he flies around pretty well too. Their corners are pretty good as well. They’re all around a pretty good defense, they’re a big ten team. They’re big, they’re fast, they’re physical, but we’ve just got to make plays,” explained McKenzie.\nDarnell Savage Jr was the other player mentioned in preparations this week, a talented 5-10 defensive back weighing in at just under 200 pounds who has an interception return for a touchdown this season.\nKnights’ Approach\nMcKenzie Milton is going to need to take chances down the field. Due to Maryland’s aggressive play calling, there will be plenty of plays in which receivers will be matched up one on one. UCF will need to take advantage of these opportunities. Look for Tre’ Quan Smith to make a couple of big plays down the field.\nThis will be a tough game for UCF. These are the type of games they need to win if they want to gain national traction.

For many, the results were unsurprising since they ran completely or virtually unopposed.\nSeats belonging to the College of Undergraduate Studies, the College of Nursing, the Rosen College, the College of Education and the College of Graduate Studies all saw their declared candidates win their seats.\nOne school, like the College of Optics and Photonics, had only one candidate—a write-in called Sean Isenberg, who won after receiving three votes. For undeclared majors, there were no candidates on the ballot.\nThe election also saw a decrease in voter turnout, with only 3,477 people voting for Senate candidates—about 30 percent fewer than last year. Jamal Mays, the Student Government Association’s assistant supervisor of elections, said that the reason for this was the scramble to reschedule after Hurricane Irma.\n“Originally, everything would have been closed down around mid-September, but due to a whole week being taken away from the elections we had to figure out rescheduling and after that, people who wanted to pursue Senate either disappeared or people didn’t get through the petition.”\nPotential candidates would have needed to receive a certain number of signatures to get their name on the ballot. They could have still written themselves in, but that considerably decreases that student’s chances of winning.\nIn the College of Engineering, for instance, Joshua Bolona, who ran for SGA president last year, declared his candidacy and received 384 votes, the most of any other candidate. Jad Shalhoub, his former running mate, was a write-in candidate in the same college. He only received two votes.\nIn the College of Business, only three students—Jeremy Batista, Spencer Lasday and Corey Marcous—were considered declared candidates. Nine candidates were write-ins, five of whom—Joshua Paul, Alex Teblum, Samuel Cooper, Lauren Phillips and Daniel Morris—won seats.\nThe number of write-ins in the College of Business, Mays said, is unprecedented, with only one or two write-in candidates for that college in previous years.\nAdvertising and outreach was also a factor in the dip in turnout. Mays promoted the election on the UCF class pages on Facebook, but that did not stop the turnout from being as low as it was. And due to Hurricane Irma, which forced UCF to close for 10 days, much of the news coverage was dedicated to the storm.\n“It was kind of a mess, but we tried to mitigate that by updating our Facebook as much as possible,” Mays said. “We definitely are going to learn from this election and we have a lot of things that we’re going to push for in Senate, so we highly encourage news organizations to follow up with us.”\nOne of those things is social media. This semester saw the election commission create a Facebook page to provide news and updates to “make sure everyone knows they can vote and run for their college seat.”\nDespite its problems, the election did see new faces come into Senate. Robert Sells, who served as the transportation coordinator last year under former SGA President Chris Clemente, won a seat along with Theressa Tong in the College of Undergraduate Studies.\nHis platform, in part, focuses on tackling what he calls “incumbent advantages,” namely banning campaign tickets during SGA elections. He also promised to “introduce policies to fight against nepotism in SGA.”\n“One of the first things I’m going to push for is campaign finance regulations because it’s absurd how much money any individual wanting to run for SGA president has to spend,” Sells said.\nKaren Caudillo, a DACA student who became nationally-known for her progressive activism, won a seat in the College of Sciences.\n“I’m not sure what committees I’m going to join, but I just want to make sure that organizations receive adequate funding and that everything is done ethically and responsibly,” Caudillo said. Another part of her platform is to push for greater sustainability on campus, beginning with having on-campus restaurants switch over to “compostable silverware, plates and cups.”', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – Just a few days after ascending to the main stage of college football with a No. 25 ranking, Head Coach Scott Frost isn’t letting his players buy into the hype. He has continuing to beat the same drum, impressing on his players that three wins over three games haven’t earned anything permanent.\n“We’re not going to talk about any of that stuff. In fact, I asked the players what their record was this morning and they knew the answer. It’s zero-zero. I asked them where we were ranked and they said we’re not,” said Coach Frost.\nThe old company line may sound cliché or hollow, but it might be the only course of action to keep his players rolling without letting off the gas.\n\n“It sounds corny, but they’re buying into that, and that’s what our mindset needs to be. Three wins doesn’t get you anywhere, its what we do from here, so we’re going to hit the reset button.”\nYou see, last year Scott Frost’s Knights were still learning how to win ballgames. They still hadn’t quite mastered the mathematical function that pushed teams into the land-of-no-return, losing four second-half battles – often in heartbreaking fashion.\nA closer look:\n30-24 L Maryland: UCF went wire-to-wire with the Terps in McKenzie Milton’s first career start, staying in the game with impact defense to overcome a freshman quarterback who struggled mightily with protecting the football. Milton’s late-game fumble in overtime sealed the deal for Maryland.\n26-25 L Temple: Coach Frost came into the post-game press conference absolutely heartbroken after Temple handed UCF a last-second win on their home turf. The Knights had the game in hand, leading 21-3 at halftime.\n31-24 L Houston: Greg Ward Jr. and soon-to-be-former-head-coach Tom Herman had Houston football positioned as the American Athletic Conference’s superteam when UCF came into town, but the Knights would prove to be first-half kryptonite – running up a 21-3 lead before surrendering four touchdowns in the second half.\n35-20 L Tulsa: Tulsa did not incite the same emotional meltdown that other late-game collapses did, but the Knights did hold the game even at halftime at fourteen apiece. UCF’s offense sputtered out in the third and fourth quarter, only managing to score six points in the game’s final frame.\nThings are different in year two of the Frost Era. UCF is smashing opponents in the second half, letting just three touchdowns slip by them after the intermission; they have outscored those three foes 62-20 as time wound down.\n“I think our play in the second half is due to confidence,” said Frost. “It’s due to our depth, we have better depth this year and I think we’re playing deeper into games. I also think it has to do with our focus. Last year we’d lose our focus, we’d get up on people and we didn’t play the same in the second half. Whether it’s depth, confidence or just commitment to what we’re doing, I’ve been really impressed with the third quarters we have put together.”\nUCF opponents are 9-0 in every other game they have played in 2017, and that includes wins over Texas and a shootout with Josh Rosen and the then-ranked No. 25 UCLA Bruins. Maryland looked every part of a power five program immediately after their shellacking at home, and Memphis was considered to be an American Athletic Conference favorite until their demise at the hands of Adrian Killins and company.\nThese are not pushover wins that UCF has accrued. As much as Frost may emphasize that the team isn’t getting too large of an ego boost from the early success, Orlando’s Hometown Team is expecting to win every time they take the field.\n“Everyone is hungry, so every practice is full of energy,” said running back Adrian Killins. “Guys are competing at every position so I feel sorry for the next opponent, because this team is out for revenge.”\nSmall improvements in the details have led to significant big picture growth. Simple things – a second year in the same system, a full off-season of strength training under visionary coach Zach Duval, a quarterback who has learned how to compete amongst the titans of the NCAA – have all paid enormous dividends.\n“To be honest with you, I think last year on defense – I don’t know about the offense so much – but on defense, we had the system in and it was the base system,” broke down UCF Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “We were out there calling calls that we thought would put them in the best position. Now we can install some systems within the system, so that the kids can get themselves in the best call.

He has continuing to beat the same drum, impressing on his players that three wins over three games haven’t earned anything permanent.\n“We’re not going to talk about any of that stuff. In fact, I asked the players what their record was this morning and they knew the answer. It’s zero-zero. I asked them where we were ranked and they said we’re not,” said Coach Frost.\nThe old company line may sound cliché or hollow, but it might be the only course of action to keep his players rolling without letting off the gas.\n\n“It sounds corny, but they’re buying into that, and that’s what our mindset needs to be. Three wins doesn’t get you anywhere, its what we do from here, so we’re going to hit the reset button.”\nYou see, last year Scott Frost’s Knights were still learning how to win ballgames. They still hadn’t quite mastered the mathematical function that pushed teams into the land-of-no-return, losing four second-half battles – often in heartbreaking fashion.\nA closer look:\n30-24 L Maryland: UCF went wire-to-wire with the Terps in McKenzie Milton’s first career start, staying in the game with impact defense to overcome a freshman quarterback who struggled mightily with protecting the football. Milton’s late-game fumble in overtime sealed the deal for Maryland.\n26-25 L Temple: Coach Frost came into the post-game press conference absolutely heartbroken after Temple handed UCF a last-second win on their home turf. The Knights had the game in hand, leading 21-3 at halftime.\n31-24 L Houston: Greg Ward Jr. and soon-to-be-former-head-coach Tom Herman had Houston football positioned as the American Athletic Conference’s superteam when UCF came into town, but the Knights would prove to be first-half kryptonite – running up a 21-3 lead before surrendering four touchdowns in the second half.\n35-20 L Tulsa: Tulsa did not incite the same emotional meltdown that other late-game collapses did, but the Knights did hold the game even at halftime at fourteen apiece. UCF’s offense sputtered out in the third and fourth quarter, only managing to score six points in the game’s final frame.\nThings are different in year two of the Frost Era. UCF is smashing opponents in the second half, letting just three touchdowns slip by them after the intermission; they have outscored those three foes 62-20 as time wound down.\n“I think our play in the second half is due to confidence,” said Frost. “It’s due to our depth, we have better depth this year and I think we’re playing deeper into games. I also think it has to do with our focus. Last year we’d lose our focus, we’d get up on people and we didn’t play the same in the second half. Whether it’s depth, confidence or just commitment to what we’re doing, I’ve been really impressed with the third quarters we have put together.”\nUCF opponents are 9-0 in every other game they have played in 2017, and that includes wins over Texas and a shootout with Josh Rosen and the then-ranked No. 25 UCLA Bruins. Maryland looked every part of a power five program immediately after their shellacking at home, and Memphis was considered to be an American Athletic Conference favorite until their demise at the hands of Adrian Killins and company.\nThese are not pushover wins that UCF has accrued. As much as Frost may emphasize that the team isn’t getting too large of an ego boost from the early success, Orlando’s Hometown Team is expecting to win every time they take the field.\n“Everyone is hungry, so every practice is full of energy,” said running back Adrian Killins. “Guys are competing at every position so I feel sorry for the next opponent, because this team is out for revenge.”\nSmall improvements in the details have led to significant big picture growth. Simple things – a second year in the same system, a full off-season of strength training under visionary coach Zach Duval, a quarterback who has learned how to compete amongst the titans of the NCAA – have all paid enormous dividends.\n“To be honest with you, I think last year on defense – I don’t know about the offense so much – but on defense, we had the system in and it was the base system,” broke down UCF Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “We were out there calling calls that we thought would put them in the best position. Now we can install some systems within the system, so that the kids can get themselves in the best call. The second year in the system, with second-year linebackers and safeties that really understand, [the system] they can roll the coverage, they can adjust the front to the best situation in that certain formation or that certain play.”\n“That’s the biggest buy-in right there, just letting the system work for the kids, and they understand now that if we let the system work for us, we’re going to know how to play certain plays and certain formations, so I think that’s helped them a ton.”\nMcKenzie Milton was tossed into the fires before he was even close to prepared.

For UCF senior Zack Levine, however, it meant combing through hours of Jimmy Fallon videos and learning guitar chords.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Levine, 20, posted an application video on YouTube for an internship position at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In the video, Levine travels all over the UCF main campus playing a guitar and expressing his qualifications to Fallon through song.\nLevine’s work on the video began as early as February when he wrote the first draft of the lyrics, incorporating plenty of references for Tonight Show fans to enjoy, such as name drops of announcer Steve Higgins an in-house band leader Questlove. The lyrics are sung over the music of Fallon’s 2012 song about the BP oil spill “Balls in Your Mouth,” with Levine only learning to play the guitar over the summer. When the time came to record his vocals, he called in a favor with friends in his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, who let him use their recording studio.\nAs for the video itself, Levine began by editing together clips of Fallon to match the lyrics he had written from him, including self-deprecating comments about Levine’s lack of job prospects as a Radio and Television major. Levine shot his portion of the video over Labor Day weekend with the help of fellow RTV student Josh Staniszewski. Taking advantage of the nearly empty campus, they were able to get plenty of shots of Levine performing at Memory Mall, the reflection pond, the Student Union, and even inside several class buildings.\nBefore deciding on the RTV major, Levine originally intended to study Film through the BFA program. When he was not accepted, he decided to pursue RTV instead, with the Cinema Studies BA program as a minor. He has held three production-based internships this year: a practicum learning course at UCF and internships at MoneyShow.com and Central Florida Hillel, the latter of which he currently holds.\nHis main passion is comedy, though, which began as early as high school. At UCF, he has performed at three improv comedy clubs and Knights Got Talent and been active in the registered student organization The Improv Academy. He also worked as a food runner at the Orlando Improv comedy club, which allowed him to meet such comedians as Jay Pharoah of Saturday Night Live and a personal hero of his, stand-up comedian Jo Koy.\nLevine hopes that working with The Tonight Show will be the first step in him working professional in comedy. When asked why he chose Fallon’s show over other late night shows, Levine said, “Fallon is simply the king of late night… He will go down as the GOAT in late night comedy when he retires… He is an influence to me as I’m sure he is to thousands of other students looking to get into comedy or late night.”\nIf Levine is selected, it won’t be his first time seeing Fallon. He got front row seats as an audience member in an April 2017 episode taped in Orlando in which Fallon interviewed Vin Diesel. “Getting to watch the show live was an unforgettable experience,” Levine said. “Fallon is just such a powerful presence. To be in the same room with him was incredible.”\nLevine said, “I hope, if chosen, I can represent UCF, and the city of Orlando to the best of my ability.”', 'The Line: Knights -17\nKickoff: Saturday 8:00 P.M, Nippert Stadium\nTV Broadcast: ESPNU\nRadio: FM 96.9/ AM 740\nORLANDO, Fla. — UCF (3-0) takes on the Cincinnati Bearcats (2-3) this weekend.\xa0 UCF is ranked 25th in the AP poll, coming off a huge win versus Memphis last Saturday.\xa0 Coach Frost has been downplaying all the hype, as one might expect.\n“I asked the players what their record was this morning and they knew the answer.

It was estimated that protesters outnumbered the group by about 10 to 1, according to officers on the scene.\nThe crowd gathered outside the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Thursday, not to wait in line to get tickets to see prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer, but to protest him being there to spread a rhetoric that many have called racist and xenophobic.\n“No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA!” they chanted over and over while holding signs that were covered with crossed out swastikas, messages of hope and humor poking fun at hate groups.\n“I would have felt like a hypocrite if I didn’t come out to protest,” said Collin Stewart, a freshman at the University of Florida.\nStewart went on to explain that he had never been a part of a protest in his life, but when he heard that Spencer was speaking on his campus, he felt compelled to start.\n“I wouldn’t say that it was my duty, but it was something that I felt was my moral responsibility to do”, Stewart said.\nMany of the protestors had\xa0similar feelings.\n“This is things you see in the news, not in your hometown,” said Gainesville resident Morgan Chardi. “The fact that it was local really motivated me to come out and make a stand.”\nThe protestors outside the Phillips Center slowly seemed to lose motivation to stay and started to trickle out of the designated protest area as the day went on.\xa0\nThe exhausted crowd gained a burst of energy almost instantly when a man with a shaved head and wearing a shirt with several swastikas walked out of the building.\n“Fuck you, you piece of shit scumbag,” one woman screamed.\nThe crowd quickly swarmed him like feeding piranhas to yell in his face and continued to do so as he walked off the premises.

Any time a suspected white nationalist would leave the building, protestors would swarm the attendee. This lead to attendees leaving with hoods up, covering their faces and at least one man asking to be taken into protective custody by the police.\n“He asked if he could be arrested,” said Jacob Tylec, an attending protestor. “He took the coward’s way out. The rest are probably still cowering inside because they are afraid to face the people that they spit hate towards.”\nOthers who slipped away into the crowd were much more bold. One woman who was seen with a group of suspected white nationalist was able to separate herself from the group being swarmed, long enough to give a Nazi salute. This gesture quickly lead to the crowd gathering around her.\nDespite the confrontational approach that many protestors took, the day remained almost completely non-violent.\nWhen demonstrators got up close to those they suspected to be white nationals, there was almost always a chant of “no violence” coming from those around them. There was a particular woman dressed in black, with a hat pulled low who seemed to be the only one yelling “kick their ass” while the other protestors where yelling “no violence.” The woman in black was then seen leaving with the woman who gave the Nazi solute.\nAs the night went on there was never that moment of chaos that many had anticipated, but tensions were high all day.\xa0\n\xa0', 'There is nothing that changes a person’s life more dramatically and emphatically than higher education, said President John C. Hitt during Tuesday’s annual State of the University address.\nHitt discussed UCF’s plans for the year, diversity and inclusion, UCF’s accomplishments and UCF’s faculty, alumni, and students.\n“If we want our students to be able to reach their full potential, they have to work in an atmosphere that is diverse and inclusive,” said President Hitt on why diversity and inclusion is important at UCF. Moderator Grant Heston, vice president for UCF’s communications and marketing, said to President Hitt “when [Hitt] first started at UCF, in terms of UCF’s student population, the diversity was about 15 percent; we are now at 46 percent this fall. What did that make [President Hitt] feel like?”\n“It makes me feel great, but also know we have a long way to go to achieve our goals so it’s a good progress along the way and I think we’re closer to where we need to be,” said Hitt. “But again we still have work to do.” In a new twist on things, President Hitt was asked questions by video from community members and UCF alumni.\nBarbara Jenkins, class of ‘83, ‘86, ‘96 and Orange County School Superintendent, asked what’s next for the downtown campus.\n“In early ‘18, we’ll start pouring concrete and moving dirt so there’s a lot of other work to be done and making sure we’re prepared programmatically for what we do when we get there,” said Hitt. “If you think about that downtown opportunity, it’s so phenomenal.”\n“Scale times excellence equals impact,” is what George Kalogridis, class of ‘76 and president of Walt Disney World resorts, asked President Hitt on the meaning and origin of that formula.\n“This phrase emerged from our strategic planning efforts led by our provost and executive Vice President Dale Whittaker and what it really says is that if you look at size and quality there’s a multiplicity relationship between them and that’s very important if it were just an additive relationship, you wouldn’t see the tremendous impact you could get with the application of scale and quality,” said Hitt. “What it’s really getting at is if you can combine good size with good quality, you get an enormous impact for the good and if you don’t understand scale is a multiplier of quality than you are missing the point. We so often encounter people that just because something is big, it can’t be good. To me it just recognizes the effect that scale really matters and size matters.”\nHitt spoke positively on UCF’s Athletic teams. He said Katie Abrahamson-Henderson has done a remarkable job coaching UCF’s women’s basketball team as well as mentioning the women’s soccer team, “last I saw they were ranked #8 in the country and had just beaten LSU.”\nOn UCF’s football team’s current winning streak, Hitt said it’s phenomenal. We’ve had our best start ever.\nDuring the address, there was the musical stylings of Jeff Rupert’s, a trustee chair, a Pegasus professor and director of UCF’s Jazz studies program, students as a way to show some of UCF’s arts.\nJeff Strange, president leadership council vice chair and first-generation college student, asked Hitt what UCF is doing to ensure all students are successful during their time at UCF and afterward.\nHitt said he was a first-generation college student and it was his father’s dream for Hitt to go to college, but his father passed away when he was 15. Hitt credits having access to education to be where he is now and UCF can offer the same opportunities to first-generation students that he received.\n“I would have never had the kind of opportunities that I have enjoyed as a faculty member, administrator, dean, vice president and president, the scope and scale of opportunity that one gets through accessing higher education,” said Hitt. “We have about 25 percent of our students who are the first in their families to go to college, that’s a good size number. We really have an opportunity through the work that we do with the first-generation students and members of other underrepresented groups, we’ve got a real opportunity to help them get to a point in life where they are going to have a much more fulfilling and stimulating life than otherwise.”', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – Option football is an ancient beast in the modern game, rarely seen amongst the vast hunting grounds of up-tempo spread offenses. Navy has ridden their standout system to five wins and video-game-like rushing numbers, sparking nostalgia in Coach Frost.\n“I love option football,” Frost said. “I lived it. I feel like option quarterbacks now are kind of like giant pandas, they only exist in zoos and military academies now.”\n“The reads and the plays, running with the ball and pitching last second – the timing of it, its just kind of different than anything else that most people ask their quarterback to do. You’ve got to have a tough kid who is smart under center and I think that navy has that. I can tell by his statistics that he is the one that makes it go,” Frost explained.\nWhat does that mean for the UCF defense? The easy answer against an option-read offense is pure ‘assignment football’. It means not missing your man, it means that missing your man can lead to catastrophe.\n“The thing that I don’t get it when people say – oh, this is a discipline game; this is an assignment game – it’s an assignment [game] every game,” explained Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “I don’t just tell them to do whatever the\xa0hell they want on every other play.”\n“I don’t understand how that’s different than regular football. It’s a different offense, absolutely, and there’s a few different wrinkles, a few different kinks for our guys, but it’s football,” he said.\nKeep it simple, do your job. UCF has long leaned on the strength of their defense in the Scott Frost Era, and it will need to be their backbone against the Midshipmen. With only a handful of passing touchdowns on the year and weapons that won’t surprise anyone, Navy is 5-1 on the strength of military execution.\nIn reading their opponent the Knights have gotten back to taking extra study sessions. The extra work was left out of the routine against Cincinnati, and the team admitted that the Bearcats had hit them with a few plays, a few formations that they had not recognized.\nThat kind of momentary lapse in preparation won’t happen anymore.\n“That’s one thing that we picked back up on last week,” said inside linebacker Chequan Burkett. “We know that for the rest of the season that extra meeting pays off. Going into this game, we’ll maybe have even more meetings to make sure we don’t have that drop off.”\nEven with the threat of an aerial assault slightly neutralized, the fast-over-physical Knights’ defense won’t change their identity too much.\n“I think you have to line up like you normally do,” said Chinander. “Our starters are our starters for a reason, we’re going to roll guys in like we normally do, everybody has a really good practice so far.”\nThe Midshipmen’s death-by-attrition battleplan doesn’t leave too many avenues for quick scoring drives in deficit games. A three-score margin is a death sentence with competent defensive plays.\nNavy will be tough and physical. Their offensive line and gritty quarterback do not allow many negative plays, and positive yards on the first two downs equate to short, highly convertible third downs. They will grind the clock, they will make murder McKenzie for any UCFast three-and-outs.\n“You see teams around the country have let downs once in a while,” said Frost. “You saw a few last week. Our guys came out ready to play on Saturday and I think that’s a good sign, we know the challenge we have ahead of us right now. This is one of the best teams in the league and we’re playing hem on the road.

Navy is always going to keep battling, so we knew we probably would have to fight until the end and it was a big win.”\nIn a game where Navy’s offensive clock control weighed heavy on UCF’s chances to score, Adrian Killins, Otis Anderson and Brandon Moore stepped in to save the day.\nKillins responded to Navy’s explosive 75 yard touchdown pass to tie the game at the start of the third quarter with a 79-yard jaunt down the sideline, collapsing the lungs of the Midshipman faithful. He finished the day with 122 yards and two scores on the ground.\n“He’s an eraser. He erased a tie game and made it a seven-point lead,” said Head Coach Scott Frost.\n“You know, you get into a close game and you really need some heart. You need to play together you need to have guys that are going to make plays when the game is on the line.”\nAdrian briefly left the game in one of the strangest football maladies of all time after the score; he collided with the Navy goat that stands ever vigilant on the sideline.\nOne more time: He was hit going out of bounds, and had to leave the game after a goat-on-athlete collision.\nBrandon Moore, who is facing the real possibility of significantly reduced playing time as Nevelle Clarke returns to the team next week, put on a show in Annapolis. Moore notched two tackles, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, two pass breakups and an interception to effectively end the game.\n“Bam just wrecked the kid,” said linebacker Pat Jasinski about the forced fumble.\nA shot heard ‘round the world, Moore’s fumble recovery came on the heels of McKenzie Milton’s biggest mistake of the game, an interception across the middle with plenty of time for Navy to seize control of the game.\nOtis Anderson laid the hammer down on Navy’s coffin. He had an incredible all-around day, totaling a score and 103 all-purpose yards, but it was the timing of his first career touchdown that made the difference. Anderson scored UCF’s only fourth quarter touchdown on a ten-yard run with just 3:30 left on the clock to set the final score at 31-21.\nThis was the first time that UCF has truly been tested. McKenzie Milton said that there was no panic and that the team was confident throughout, but Coach Frost admitted after the game that he felt like he had some time taken off his life after the win.\nUCF came, saw, and certainly didn’t conquer. They did come away with their sixth win, they did keep the magic alive, and they did remove themselves from the most unique offensive system they will face this season.\n“Sometimes you win and it’s easy, sometimes you have to battle,” said Frost. “Sometimes it’s not as pretty, but a win is a win. I love how this team kept fighting, I love how they’re playing together right now.”\nIt just didn’t come easy this time.', 'ANNAPOLIS – UCF clawed, scratched and won a war of attrition in Maryland’s capital on Saturday, beating the Navy Midshipmen 31-21 in an uncharacteristically tough game for the Knights.\nUCF has gone 6-0 for the first time in university history.\nThe Knights rushed for 247 yards as the Midshipmen led with 248 yards by game’s end.

The pair has been on the same staff four times over their career at three institutions, coaching together for five years before rejoining in 2015 at Oregon – a combined eight years running together.\n“When we were at Northern Iowa together we were roommates for a while,” recounted Chinander. “We just became friends and both of us were kind of lowly assistants back then, who knew he was going to be the head coach someday.

Sometimes you just have to take a job, or maybe you get a chance at a dream job and you don’t know people – but when you know people, whether it’s other assistants or the head coach – it makes things easier, makes the transition easier.”\n“I’ve never been a guy who has gone around looking for my next job. I think you’ve just got to the best at the job you have and then good things happen.”\nFrost understands that Power Five programs will have his staff under a microscope this offseason, and has recognized the UCF Excellence Fund started by Danny White as a preemptive step in retaining his valuable staff.\nChinander won’t have to go looking – major programs are going to have him in their sights. They will be able to pay handsomely for his services, too.\nFSU Defensive Coordinator Charles Kelly rakes in $833,000 a year. Virginia Tech’s Bud Foster commanded $925,000 in 2016 and sees a $25,000 increase every year. Everywhere you look in Power Five programs, top-level defensive coordinators are getting paid.\n“UCF has unlimited potential, and sometimes to reach that potential you have to take both steps forward and I think Danny White has been doing that since he’s been here, trying to push this program forward and this athletic department forward,” Frost encouraged.\n“If we’re going to keep those guys long term, we’ve got to make sure they have a reason to stay. There’s other things surrounding the program that I think, if we’re going to treat ourselves like a big-time football program, then we need to be able to match some of the people that are.”\nDanny White’s UCF Excellence Fund is out to secure annual commitments of over $1.5 million over the next five years.\nIn May Coach Frost signed an extension through 2021 that bumped his season base salary to $2 million per year and increased the pool for assistant coaches by $50,000.

He has developed into one of college football’s most explosive home-run threats, already setting and then breaking his own record of longest touchdowns from scrimmage in UCF history.\nHe has broken runs of 96 and 79 yards this season, matching the excitement generated from an 86-yard run his freshman year against No. 2 Michigan and a 100-yard kick return on the road against East Carolina.\nKillins, a local product out of Mainland Highschool in Daytona, drew interest from the Oregon transplant with astronomical high school track numbers.\n“I saw a guy a lot like I coached out west,” said Head Coach Scott Frost. “There’s not very many people in the country that run the 200 time that he did, but he was also a good football player. Our first signee was one of our best.”\n“He came to us pretty fast to begin with, he’s a very ‘twitchy’ fast kid,” recalled UCF Director of Sports Performance Zach Duval. “One of the things that we really put emphasis on was his strength. Obviously, you don’t ever see a kid who is really fast that is not equally strong.”\nBefore Duval and his crew could get his hands on Killins the athletic trainers had to fine-tune his body. Core control, stability and balance were the first things that Killins worked on as a freshman.\n“Picture a Ferrari going two hundred miles an hour down the track. Any little instability – if your front tire is down two PSI, it’s going to cause problems for you,” visualized Duval.\n“Speed magnifies a lot of issues. They did a great job of getting him symmetrical, balanced front, right, left, back and increasing strength in that stability.”\n“He is very unique,” explained UCF’s guru of growth. “I’ve never been around someone, not that small, but he’s definitely… his frame is not what you would normally see. He’s kind of built differently. That is new, I’ve never been around a guy like that. I’ve been around a lot of fast guys that were also big and that’s obviously what we’re trying to do with him. with all of our athletes the goal is to increase the size of their engine because a bigger engine creates more torque, more torque creates more velocity, more velocity creates more speed.”\n“Twenty-one years doing this job, seeing what the majority of freshmen come in and do compared to him, he’s just a different class.”\n“God blessed him with some natural ability,” Duval continued.\n“For a guy his size to be able to squat 500 pounds? That’s pretty impressive, but then again, when you watch him run, it makes sense, to be able to move your body that quickly with as much velocity as he has – he has to be able to stabilize each step and then explode off of each foot.”\n“Running is like plyometrics, you’ve got to have a lot of strength and power to do that. After last season he had some instability stuff from just what he does and that’s where the athletic training staff came into place.”\nDuval insists that Killins’ work ethic, not his speed, will be the most determinant factor the running back’s rise to the forefront of highlight reels around the country.\n“He’s not normal across the board, but how he approaches the day is a professional approach,” Duval boasts. “You don’t see that a lot with guys his age. He’s got a mindset about it, he doesn’t come in here and screw around, he doesn’t screw around in the training room and he has bought into Coach Frost’s system.”\n“I know he’s fast and everyone likes to talk about that, but how he approaches things and his mental ability to dial in and work hard, that’s probably the best part about him.”\nKillins leads UCF with 413 rushing yards this season and has five scores, both surpassing his freshman totals. During that first season with UCF he was banged up in the second half, putting together just 92 rushing yards and 109 receiving yards for the remainder of the season after the ECU game.\nThe speedy back has sung the praise of the strength and conditioning staff around him, insisting that the program has allowed him to stay on the field as a sophomore. To hear the other side of things though, Killins’ work ethic is the foundation for which a reputation for excitement has been built.\nThe fastest player in college football didn’t get his title on talent alone. His chance at greatness has clarified in Frost’s system, but the work put in behind the scenes will let Killins keep breaking the tape on Saturdays.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/10/the-ucf-excellence-fund-an-early-strike-at-keeping-scott-frosts-band-together/'],"['ORLANDO, Fla. – Success for an up-and-coming group of five football program is always a double-edged sword: the success of your program is great for growth and prosperity, but a young head coach with immense potential will attract the attention of established programs with deeper pockets.\nIt isn’t only the head coach at risk though, as promising coordinators or assistant coaches can be lured away by the same powers at large.\n“We have some really, really talented assistants – some guys that I wouldn’t want to do my job without,” insisted Frost on Monday’s weekly availability.\n“I think Danny’s leadership and President Hitt’s leadership have been tremendous, and I think they are very forward thinking in making a move to make sure that we continue the progress that we started.”\nUCF Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander has been coaching with Frost on and off since his stint at Northern Iowa in 2007. The pair has been on the same staff four times over their career at three institutions, coaching together for five years before rejoining in 2015 at Oregon – a combined eight years running together.\n“When we were at Northern Iowa together we were roommates for a while,” recounted Chinander. “We just became friends and both of us were kind of lowly assistants back then, who knew he was going to be the head coach someday. Seemed to work out pretty well.”\n2007-2008: Northern Iowa\n2010 -2012: Oregon\n2014-2015: Oregon\n2016-Present: UCF\nChinander left Frost once in that time span to learn at the NFL level, following Chip Kelly to the Philadelphia Eagles. When Kelly’s stint ended, it meant a return to the college ranks. Returning to Oregon was easy with his former roommate running the offense in Eugene.\n“Anytime in this business, you don’t want to go somewhere that you don’t know people. Sometimes you just have to take a job, or maybe you get a chance at a dream job and you don’t know people – but when you know people, whether it’s other assistants or the head coach – it makes things easier, makes the transition easier.”\n“I’ve never been a guy who has gone around looking for my next job. I think you’ve just got to the best at the job you have and then good things happen.”\nFrost understands that Power Five programs will have his staff under a microscope this offseason, and has recognized the UCF Excellence Fund started by Danny White as a preemptive step in retaining his valuable staff.\nChinander won’t have to go looking – major programs are going to have him in their sights. They will be able to pay handsomely for his services, too.\nFSU Defensive Coordinator Charles Kelly rakes in $833,000 a year. Virginia Tech’s Bud Foster commanded $925,000 in 2016 and sees a $25,000 increase every year. Everywhere you look in Power Five programs, top-level defensive coordinators are getting paid.\n“UCF has unlimited potential, and sometimes to reach that potential you have to take both steps forward and I think Danny White has been doing that since he’s been here, trying to push this program forward and this athletic department forward,” Frost encouraged.\n“If we’re going to keep those guys long term, we’ve got to make sure they have a reason to stay. There’s other things surrounding the program that I think, if we’re going to treat ourselves like a big-time football program, then we need to be able to match some of the people that are.”\nDanny White’s UCF Excellence Fund is out to secure annual commitments of over $1.5 million over the next five years.\nIn May Coach Frost signed an extension through 2021 that bumped his season base salary to $2 million per year and increased the pool for assistant coaches by $50,000. He and his staff have made an impact already in recruiting talent around the state, Chinander chief among those responsible for the talent influx on defense.\n“This is such a beautiful campus and the city of Orlando is the best college town in the state of Florida in my opinion,” insisted Coach Frost. “We’re building something pretty special here and there’s recruits everywhere around this.”\nFrost’s vision is coming together rapidly on the football field, but if UCF knows that this growth could become just a nice requiem from reality if their staff is poached from under them.\nConsider the excellence fund recognition that the threat is real.']"

It’s good – any time you can play less than your best and get a win it’s rewarding and it’s a good thing.”\nAustin Peay had treated their trip to Orlando the same way that most teams would a bowl game berth, complete with sightseeing and relaxation time. UCF powered their way through the scheduled bye week but appeared to be the team on vacation in the first half.\nThe Governors hit UCF for a gain of 74 yards, scored on a 91-yard kickoff return, and put the ball in the end zone from 35, 12, and 7 yards out. They gouged the Knights’ defense for 352 total yards, held onto possession for 32:11 and played with real fire.\nPure talent was the difference maker in this game. UCF has a stable of bigger, faster, stronger players that would not be denied. Mike Hughes scored effortlessly on a kick return, Titus Davis almost took an interception to the house and Shaquem Griffin didn’t let anything stop him from scoring on a loose ball down the sideline.\nTaj McGowan scored a pair of touchdowns, Dredrick Snelson came down with two of his own and McKenzie Milton completed 24-of-26 passes for 275 yards and three touchdowns. Even in their off-kilter performance, the nation’s No. 1 scoring defense found a way to get the job done.\n“I don’t know if I was ever uncomfortable, I just wasn’t real happy with how we approached it,” said Frost on the effort.\n“You can’t cheat the game of football. You’re either playing your hardest or you’re not. You’re either preparing as well as you can or you’re not. We didn’t tackle very well, we made mistakes, we weren’t disciplined.”\nThe mood after the game was almost somber in the press room. Interviews were shorter than usual, Coach Frost radiated with angry heat that had clearly not dissipated. It was the worst effort that UCF’s defense has displayed this season and can be worrysome with a stretch of three games leading into USF in which the Knights will be heavily favored.\nUCF will not have an easy time bouncing back against the tremendous SMU receiving corps. The Mustangs are coming off of a close win and are loaded at the No. 1 and No. 2 receiver slot, a recipe for disaster with a matchup against the weak link in the defense’s armor.\n“The score ended up being one sided but they played a great game and I give them a ton of credit,” insisted Frost.\n“It’s going to give us a lot to clean up and go to work on next week.”', 'The University of Central Florida piled on 73 points against Austin Peay Saturday night to mark the most points earned in program history.\nThe Knights defense lagged in the first two quarters and gave the Governor’s relatively open access to the backfield.

Trustee [Nick] Larkins, who is president of UCF’s Student Government Association, wrote to the Chairman [Marcos Marchena] expressing disappointment in not being selected for the search committee despite representations supposedly made in a previous out-of-the-Sunshine Discussion.”\nIn the letter, Hemlepp expressed his concern that the committee was selected without any public oversight raised questions regarding the members of committee.\n“Why is the student boy’s elected representative not on the committee? Why are there so few UCF Alumni? Why are so few students on the committee? Should Eastern Florida State College be represented?” the letter said.\nTo conclude the letter, Hemlepp explained why Knight News has an issue with the Board of Trustees conducting meetings via teleconference.\n“Conducting the meetings in that manner frustrates the public’s ability to comment on the search,” Hemlepp said. “In addition, Knight News requested information from UCF concerning how to attend or participate in these meetings, and to date it appears that request has been ignored.”\nRead Hemlepp’s full letter, below:\n20171106_Letter_to_UCF_re_presidential_search\nRead the email Trustee Self sent to BOT Chair Marchena:\nFrom: William Self [mailto:William.Self@ucf.edu]\nSent: Friday, October 27, 2017 7:06 PM\nTo: mmarchena@mgfirm.com\nCc: lcooper@mgfirm.com\nSubject: names for presidential search\nHi Marcos,\nAttached is a word document with four faculty names and a short description of the core reasons I am recommending them for the search committee.\nI will be at the game tomorrow if you would like to discuss, or you can call me at 321-[redacted] (cell) as well.

Each of these quarters will have a set budget created by the Financial Allocations for Organizations Committee.\nClubs and students will be able to request funding from the quarter in which their event takes place, and the money to fund the event will be pulled from that quarter’s budget.\nAccording to Bolona, this bill will work to ensure that the senate can fund clubs and students throughout the fiscal year.\n“We, as Senate, allocate upward towards $1 million per year for individuals and organizations to travel to conferences and host events on campus,” Bolona said. “Year after year, we run out of funds towards the beginning of the Spring semester.”\nBolona believes that this resolution will make it possible for clubs and students to receive funding when they need it.\n“They should expect to have the opportunity to receive funding in parts of the year that didn’t exist before,” Bolona said.\nWhile this new bill will allow students and clubs to get funding year-round, one potential drawback to this bill would be that the senate will have to be stricter with funding.\n“A point organizations should realize is the Senate will become a lot more stringent when allocating funds, as the budget they will be dipping in has been cut in fourths,” Bolona said.\nWhile this budget could be a negative, Bolona believes that the pros of this resolution outweigh the cons.\n“Overall, the resolution creates a year-round funding and fiscal responsibility balance that benefits the student body as a whole,” Bolona said.\nIf passed, this resolution could go into effect as early as January 2018.', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – Nevelle Clarke’s much-anticipated return to the Knights’ defensive backfield came against the unheralded Austin Peay Governors, a perfect time to\xa0reset from a half-season of Saturdays off.\nNot to say that the stakes weren’t low, but UCF scored a program-record 73 points against the Governors. Clarke transitioned from scout-team to game speed with relative ease, setting the stage for a showdown in Dallas against an SMU duo that boasted NFL talent on either side.\n“Nevelle had an unbelievable game,” said Coach Frost on Monday. “That was a big test for our defensive backs with the quality of wide receivers that they had.\n“Those guys had a huge challenge and I thought they were up to the task. Nevelle, being only his second game back, I thought he played at a really high level on Saturday.”\nIt should be reinforced that Courtland Sutton is a first-round talent averaging 15.7 yards per catch, and Trey Quinn leads the NCAA in receptions.\n“I was proud of him, stepping in there,” assured Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “It’s not like he was out there playing against me at receiver, he was out there playing some real legitimate NFL guys.”\nMike Hughes has been a pleasant surprise as the Knights’ most outstanding defender, but Nevelle was slotted to be UCF’s lockdown corner since his emergence last season. He has returned to full form, which would assume a ton of playing time in the season’s back end.\nThat doesn’t mean that Brandon Moore has lost his seat the table yet. Chinander said this week that they will do their best to get all three guys on the field at the same time and that all three are taking reps with the starters right now.\n“Right now, we’re rotating Bam, him and Mike all in there at the ones and we’re trying to get all three of them on the field in a lot of situations,” explained Chinander. “I think you’re going to see a good rotation.”\n“Mike and Bam have just had so many reps throughout the year that it’s going to be good to go Mike and Bam – have those two take a couple of series – then go Nevelle and Mike, Nevelle and Bam; I think it’s going to be really good for us as a team to get those guys some rest.”\nBrandon Moore has been heavily targeted as the No. 2 corner and as a redshirt freshman just getting established. With Hughes shining so brightly on the opposite side, it has been heavy fire for Moore as the logical weak link.\nHis standout game against Navy yielded a forced fumble, fumble recovery, tackle for a loss and interception – making it tough to remove his name from the conversation.\nMoore’s continued development does excellent things for the Knights’ number one unit, giving them flexibility with both coverage packages and in rotating fresh legs to the scene. He will continue to take significant reps and will still be in the mix, but expect UCF to go to Nevelle when the situation calls for just their best two corners on the field.', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – The second week of college football rankings are in, and UCF still lives among the lower echelon of the playoff committee’s rankings. UCF didn’t budge from No. 18 following a tight game against SMU, even though five programs ranked in front of them lost their games last week and only five unbeaten teams remain.\nCollege Football Playoff’s Committee immediately made an enemy in UCF fans everywhere. Many felt that No. 18 was too low to begin with, considering much more positive rankings in the season-long polls, but to not move in the second week – it seemed personal.\nIt is no secret to anyone that the group of five faces an uphill battle, as no team outside of the Power Five conferences has ever made it to the playoff. Shoot, is it even possible?\n“Yeah, I think it’s possible,” said Head Coach Scott Frost. “I don’t know if it will happen this year, next year, or the year after, but I think it’s possible. I look back to when Boise was playing really well, they threatened it a bunch of times.”\n“Hopefully someday teams like ours get a chance to play in some of those games. We still have a long way to go before any of that talk matters. We’ve got to win this weekend and the rest will take care of itself, but I’m sure the debate will get started.”\nIgnoring UCF made it clear: The Power Five rules. Even if the team finishes undefeated with an AAC Conference Championship under their belt, the playoff is beyond reach.\nThe Group of Five’s glass ceiling will require repetitive blows before it breaks, requiring a G5 school to continuously threaten the major contenders among the college football elite. To think that UCF is even relative in the conversation is mind blowing.\nMost people would have flat out laughed at you had the suggestion of a top-fifteen ranking arisen in April, but this team has proven to be better than what anybody on the outside predicted.\n“We take it as a challenge to step up and show them that we’re a lot better than they think we are,” said UCF offensive lineman Jordan Johnson. “We know that they lowballed us, but we try not to think about the rankings.”\n“We just go out and play football against the team that they line us up against.”\nIt isn’t just Johnson who understands the predicament his team his in. Heisman-Fringe Hopeful McKenzie Milton said this week there just isn’t anything to be done about it. Nothing changes in the short run.\n“Honestly, I have no idea (if it’s possible for a G5 school to make the playoff),” Milton said on Tuesday before the rankings dropped. “Like I said, that’s really out of our control. All we can focus on is winning games, and if we were to get that respect that would be awesome.”\n“That’s definitely a goal for this program, I think. I think we could reach that goal, but you never know. You never know what’s going to happen.”\nOne thing is for certain. We know it won’t happen this year.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/11/ucf-secondary-clarke-hughes-and-moore-all-splitting-first-team-reps-at-cornerback/'],"['ORLANDO, Fla. – Nevelle Clarke’s much-anticipated return to the Knights’ defensive backfield came against the unheralded Austin Peay Governors, a perfect time to\xa0reset from a half-season of Saturdays off.\nNot to say that the stakes weren’t low, but UCF scored a program-record 73 points against the Governors. Clarke transitioned from scout-team to game speed with relative ease, setting the stage for a showdown in Dallas against an SMU duo that boasted NFL talent on either side.\n“Nevelle had an unbelievable game,” said Coach Frost on Monday. “That was a big test for our defensive backs with the quality of wide receivers that they had.\n“Those guys had a huge challenge and I thought they were up to the task. Nevelle, being only his second game back, I thought he played at a really high level on Saturday.”\nIt should be reinforced that Courtland Sutton is a first-round talent averaging 15.7 yards per catch, and Trey Quinn leads the NCAA in receptions.\n“I was proud of him, stepping in there,” assured Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “It’s not like he was out there playing against me at receiver, he was out there playing some real legitimate NFL guys.”\nMike Hughes has been a pleasant surprise as the Knights’ most outstanding defender, but Nevelle was slotted to be UCF’s lockdown corner since his emergence last season. He has returned to full form, which would assume a ton of playing time in the season’s back end.\nThat doesn’t mean that Brandon Moore has lost his seat the table yet. Chinander said this week that they will do their best to get all three guys on the field at the same time and that all three are taking reps with the starters right now.\n“Right now, we’re rotating Bam, him and Mike all in there at the ones and we’re trying to get all three of them on the field in a lot of situations,” explained Chinander. “I think you’re going to see a good rotation.”\n“Mike and Bam have just had so many reps throughout the year that it’s going to be good to go Mike and Bam – have those two take a couple of series – then go Nevelle and Mike, Nevelle and Bam; I think it’s going to be really good for us as a team to get those guys some rest.”\nBrandon Moore has been heavily targeted as the No. 2 corner and as a redshirt freshman just getting established. With Hughes shining so brightly on the opposite side, it has been heavy fire for Moore as the logical weak link.\nHis standout game against Navy yielded a forced fumble, fumble recovery, tackle for a loss and interception – making it tough to remove his name from the conversation.\nMoore’s continued development does excellent things for the Knights’ number one unit, giving them flexibility with both coverage packages and in rotating fresh legs to the scene. He will continue to take significant reps and will still be in the mix, but expect UCF to go to Nevelle when the situation calls for just their best two corners on the field.']"

Instead, Kethi-Reddy wrote, they will be able to use the Black and Gold shuttle routes to “get closer to their classes more efficiently.”\nResidents living at UCF’s southern communities – Apollo, Libra, Hercules, Nike and Neptune – will have to move their cars from the Ferrell Commons parking lot, the lot shared by Libra and the Physical Sciences building and Garage B. They would only be allowed to park in the eastern and western lots of Academic Village and the Libra Garage.\n“This means those spaces where cars would sit, sometimes for weeks, are now freed up,” Kethi-Reddy wrote. “The lots will also make monitoring those cars easier, to prevent break-ins.”\nShuttle route 15 will also be modified to pick up students living in Arden Villas near campus.\nThe new policies, paired with other proposed projects, would ensure that “most traffic and parking congestion will evaporate” by next fall, according to Kethi-Reddy. It is part of his broader promise to “permanently fix the parking problem” by 2020.\nCommuters and residents alike regularly report problems finding parking on campus. The Orlando Sentinel reported in May that UCF sees 45,000 students, faculty and staff visiting the campus daily and compete for one of its approximately 18,000 parking spots.\nWhile the changes intend to concentrate residents into other lots to allow more room for commuters, there is already some concern about the inconvenience students living in Academic Village, Libra and Apollo will experience, according to a source familiar with the plan’s logistical implementation who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n“People in Libra and Apollo will have to cross Gemini to get to and from their cars with groceries or whatever else they may have,” he said.\nThe problem is compounded, the source said, by the fact that residents pay more for their parking permits than commuters – up to $50 more for annual hang tags, according to UCF Parking Services.\nNevertheless, the parking and transportation advisory committee voted unanimously to move ahead with the new policies.\nIt is unclear how much it will cost to implement them, but Kethi-Reddy said in the post that it is “near zero.”', 'ORLANDO, Fla. – No. 18 UCF fights to remain undefeated this weekend against the UConn Huskies in the battle-formerly-known as the Civil ConFLiCT, one of five perfect teams remaining under the scrutinizing gaze of the College Football Playoff Committee.\nThe Committee ignored UCF’s one-score win over the Mustangs in this week’s polls, cementing the Knights at the No. 18 spot for the second consecutive week.

He had been one of the few bright spots on this UConn team, second to only McKenzie Milton in the American’s leaders in pass efficiency.

Safety is truly a team effort, and it is through vigilance and partnership that we create a more secure community for each other.”\nSun enrolled as a nonimmigrant F-1 international student in an academic and cultural program at UCF that prepares international students for success at an American university, according to UCF.\n“Sun’s nonimmigrant status was terminated after he purchased the second firearm for noncompliance with regulations unrelated to the firearms purchase,” the university said in a press release. “As an F-1 international student, he was required to attend classes, which he did not.”\n“Ownership of both firearms became illegal once Sun no longer had legal nonimmigrant status in the U.S., and he was taken into custody\xa0Feb. 7\xa0by HSI and ATF for violations of the terms of his admission to the U.S. and potential violation of federal firearms laws.”\nOn March 21, an immigration judge ordered Sun be sent back to China after failing to comply with the terms of his non-immigrant status and will not be allowed back into the United States for at least 10 years.\n#HSI special agents are proud of our role in keeping the campus safe. https://t.co/aR9DV6SAXD\n— ICE Tampa (@ICEgovTampa) March 29, 2018\n\n“Law enforcement and the concerned community in this case, showed that the campaign for ‘See Something, Say Something’ is much more than just words,” said ATF Special Agent in Charge Daryl McCrary. “With partnerships between the community and law enforcement, sharing a common concern for the communities we live in, we can reduce violent crime, mitigate dangerous situations, and save lives.”\n“This is a case where successful communication at every level of law enforcement may have prevented another school tragedy,” said HSI Tampa Special Agent in Charge James C.
