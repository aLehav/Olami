The Governor opened up his brief remarks by saying that his campaign is making history by being the first campaign to, “have its headquarters in Florida.”  \nThe Governor turned Ambassador turned Presidential Candidate is vowing to campaign a clean campaign, telling his staff that “jobs and the economy are driving this campaign,” and that “civility means something.”  \nAs his campaign gets underway, having announced formally on Tuesday, he is courting the young people around the country to join his campaign.  He wants the young voters to understand that our main priority should be “debt and spending.” He pointed out that right now we are inheriting a $14.4 trillion debt, and it certain to continue to increase if we don’t get someone in the White House with his level of experience.\nThe Governor doesn’t only have experience as the head of the state, but also, as the former Ambassador to China.  After President Obama took office, he nominated Huntsman for the position due to his experience in the region, and the fact that he is also fluent in Mandarin Chinese.  \nAlthough Huntsman has mostly been touting his economic experiences as Governor of Utah, he clearly has experience in areas of foreign policy, which sets him apart from most of his other colleagues running for President.  He will be able to use his relationship and prior experience with China to bolster his case for President.  The Governor also served as Deputy Trade Representative under George W. Bush.\nWhen asked about how he plans to utilize the nation’s second largest University, he pointed out that they have a lot of young people already signed on to his campaign.  Analysts believe that Huntsman picked up a good portion of the young vote, when Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana decided not to seek the Presidency.\nThe Governor has announced that he will skip the Ames Iowa Straw Poll in August, which means that he will be setting his sights on New Hampshire as the first in the nation primary.  He pointed out that his campaign will take him from the Granite State, on to South Carolina and then Florida.  He hopes those states will help propel to a head-to-head battle against his former boss, and current President.  He has a tough battle in front of him; however, the Governor, and his family, seem like they are up to the task.\nStay tuned to KnightNews.com for all news related to the 2012 Presidential Campaign.

He passed the small “Occupy Tallahassee” encampment and three demonstrators stood on the sidewalk of Madison street, waving, as one made a cellphone video of the motorcade.\n   Gatekeepers at the Challenger Center, an IMAX theater and exhibit hall with a space theme, said 300 supporters attended the fund-raising event. One of them was Barry Richard, the attorney who argued President Bush’s case successfully in Bush v. Gore in 2000. Richard a former Democratic state representative from Miami, is an attorney practicing in Tallahassee and his wife, Allison, arranged the Challenger event.\n   “I think they’re going to get re-elected,” Richard said outside, before the vice president spoke. “He’s been an exceptional president, probably the best in my lifetime. I think people have a comfort level with the guy.”\n   Florida Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith of Alachua revved up the crowd, introducing Vice President Biden.\n   “People are excited about 2012 and I’ll tell you why they’re exicted about 2012, because we’ve got an administration that’s proven it knows what it’s doing, they know how to do it and we’re going to re-elect this administration, this president and this vice president.\n   “I’m going to cut the evening very short for everybody. I promise you, if you watch Florida you’re going to know how the nation goes, very early, and Florida is going to vote Democratic in 2012.”\n   Smith summed up by repeating something he said Biden says, “The most important thing about this campaign: If you want to know in 2012 what we’ve got to say, it’s very simple – General Motors is hiring and Bin Laden is dead.”\n    The Vice President began by calling out for former US Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Monticello, who was defeated in 2010 after switching his vote and supporting national health care. Boyd was not there or did not respond in the tightly packed crowd. Biden also thanked Allison Richard and Rod Smith.\n   He repeated the stuff about unemployment when he and Obama took office. Citing Smith’s introduction, he said, “Osama Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive. It’s a metaphor, it’s a metaphor for our foreign policy and our domestic economic policy”\n   He said the American people don’t mind sacrifice to restore “the middle class promise” of a job, homeownership and sending kids to college.\n   “But I’ll tell you what Americans don’t like in my neighborhood, where I came from, and I suspect in yours, they don’t like being taken for suckers. They don’t like being taken for suckers,” he said, drawing laughter and applause. “They’ve been asked to give and give and give. They’ve been asked to keep their wages stagnant, they’ve been asked to cut back on a whole bunch of things and they’ve done it.\n  “They look around and they think there’s a big chunk of society out there that isn’t in on the game.”\n   Speaking of “simple basic fairness,” Biden said “I think the American people are tired of being tired.”\n   “They’re tired of diminished horizons,” he said, adding that he and Obama recently met with CEOs and other top execs from Seimen’s, DuPont, Ford, Masterlock, and other “major, major companies.”  He said the business trend is that “millions and millions of jobs will be coming back home from abroad.” Biden said American companies realize that “the safe bet” for protecting intellectual property and other business advantages is to manufacture in the US.\n   He said economic productivity had “been a race to the bottom” under Republican administrations, with companies trying to find cheap labor overseas. He said the chairman of Ford told him the automaker is investing over $16 billion in plant and equipment, creating over 12,000 jobs in the US. He said Masterlock moved to Mexico and China and is now returning to Milwaukee.\n   “Mitt Romney says the best way to deal with foreclosures is to let everything hit the bottom.” (The crowd muttered loudly) “No, no, no, no – by the way, from purely a dollars and cents standpoint, he could get ready to argue that, that’s right out of the business school manual. But guess what? We’re not reorganizing and purchasing companies, we’re trying to rebuild a country.”\n   He said the GOP candidates are showing true colors in debates and that the DNC ought to sponsor 19 more so the voters can see them.\n   “For the first time, the Republicans are not – as we say, to use a football metaphor – they’re not hiding the ball. They’re saying exactly what they believe. For real – no, it’s good – it’s good because for the first time we can have an honest debate. These guys aren’t out there saying, ‘We’re compassionate conservatives, we want to fight to protect Medicare and Medicaid …’ They’re just being straight up, saying what they believe.”\n  “Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, I think they’re slightly different, and I mean this sincerely. I think it’s more about obstructionism for them. For them, their actions say what they really believe.”\nPoor people have no habit of working\n  “These are the same guys who are calling the president a ‘food stamp president’ – a thinly veiled, I don’t know what it is, but it’s inappropriate. It’s inappropriate.”\n   He estimated that Super PACs will spend $200 million to $800 million “to go after Barack.” He said the Democrats can’t compete with money but need volunteers, “to put the best ground game in the history of presidential politics back on the ground. We can’t match their multi-millionairs writing $2, $5, $10, $20 million checks, but we can match every dollar they put out there with somebody on the ground.”\n   He concluded by quoting Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, a friend from their U.S. Senate days, who was governor 1991-98 (he died in Dec. 12, 1998), “I didn’t come here to stay, I came here to make a difference.”\n   “Ladies and gentlemen, we got a long road ahead. But here’s what I know – with your help, we’re going to stay four more years and we are going to make a difference.”\n   As the crowd applauded, Biden shouted his thanks and called out, “God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Keep the faith. We’re gonna do this.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2012/02/vp-joe-biden-visits-tallahassee-fsu/'],0.06250089406967163,0.08583352714776993,0.09689175337553024

There\nare hundreds of speculations as to how we’ve gotten ourselves into this mess, but\nthe fact of the matter is if we don’t figure out a solution soon, it is the current college\ngeneration that is going to have to pay the price.

He got his first college degree in China, yet was not exposed to much science, so he did not realize he liked the current field he is working in until he came to America.

Half of cancer patients will be treated with x-rays, and Su explains how using modern techniques will often damage good tissue around the cancerous area, so he is working to create less-damaging and more effective techniques.\n“It’s hard for you to differentiate a cancer cell with a normal cell,” Su said. “When you can kill a cancer cell, it will often cause damage to a normal cell, so it definitely is a challenge.”\nResults have been good and as expected so far, and he is quite motivated and honored by the award he received.\n“I’m really honored because the awards are usually for top-notch universities, like Harvard or Yale,” Su said. “The first time, I thought I should try it—the worst answer is they say no. And I still think we have a chance, because in this country, they are fair, as long as you have a good idea.”\nSu offers some personal advice to prospective nanoscience students, motivating them to push themselves to do their best.\n“I think for nanoscience students, they should definitely open their minds for opportunities,” Su said. “Whatever you can do depends on what you are dreaming, what you want to achieve.

Students could enjoy cookies and coffee while watching the premiere screening of the documentary Beneath the Helmet: From High School to the Home Front by Jerusalem U.\nDeputy Company Commander, Aviv Regev, who is featured in the film, was present during the screening, and afterward spoke to students about the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and answered any questions they had about the film and about Israel.\n“The film was produced over a 2-year period. We followed the soldiers’ lives during their 8-month training period, both in—and out—of the army. That was followed by an extensive post-production period,” Wayne Kopping said, the director and editor of Beneath the Helmet.\nKopping’s documentaries have been seen by over 40,000,000 people worldwide. His work has been featured on CNN and Fox News, as well as in The New York Times and countless other publications and blogs.\n“As Eilon Kohan, one of the recruits we feature in the film tells us, kids his age in just about any other country are thinking about what college to attend, which parties to go to, and where to travel. But as a soldier, he’s having to crawl over thorns, realizing that he may be called to put his life on the line to defend the\xa0country,” Kopping said.\nKopping said he found it remarkable to witness that this process didn’t leave the soldiers bitter and angry, but rather, filled with courage and a selfless desire to serve and ‘give back, just as those who came before them took a stand to protect the nation.\nThe audiences often have insightful questions, he said, and who better to answer them, than those soldiers and officers who’s lives are depicted onscreen.\n“Over and above all else, these soldiers are some of the coolest people you’ll ever meet, so who wouldn’t want to come out to a screening to meet them?” Kopping said.\nDuring his time in the service, Regev was in charge of 120 soldiers, logistics in training, at the time of the film. Meaning, all of the soldiers seen in the film were his soldiers.\nWhen he was 16, he was tending to his family’s orchards when a missile hit near him launched by a terrorist group in the second Lebanon war.\n“I realized that for 16 years I had been living peacefully and happily without a worry or care in the world, thanks to the soldiers who were protecting me and my family and that in a few years it would be my turn to do the same,” Regev said.\n“Try to think of it, when was the last time you did something that you thought was impossible that there was no way to finish it?” he said to the audience. “It doesn’t happen very often.”\n“It’s something that I think is really unique of the Israel Defense Forces, we train our soldiers to pass these mental and physical barriers to realize that nothing is impossible.” At the end of the soldier’s training, as featured in the film, the soldiers are required to walk a distance of 57 miles.\nAt the age of 21, his skills and motivation allowed him to climb the ranking ladder to become an officer of a platoon. It was at the age of 23 that he became deputy company commander, the age at which he was featured in the film.\n“[The film crew] was my biggest worry. The camera man thinks it’s nice to shoot the guns when they’re firing towards the camera, very creative,” Regev said, making the audience laugh. “But they were able to capture the process that we go through, especially in training.”\nHe explained the responsibilities of being a commander at a young age, and all the sacrifices made and decisions that carry the lives of so many others. Regev did not lose any of his soldiers under his command and he did not have to kill anyone during his time in the service.\nAfter finishing his service in Nov. 2013, Jerusalem U approached him and asked if he would be interested in representing the film in the United States.\n“As you can imagine after 5 years in the army it was not on the top of my to-do list,” he said.\nHe then told them politely no, and later found himself crossing China by himself. He traveled 2,000 miles from north to south, and hiked a few hundred miles in New Zealand. It was during that time that he met a lot of teenagers from over a dozen countries who were were interested in his story and asked him many questions.\n“The problem is that these questions were based on propaganda and lies and misconceptions. And that was when I realized there was this whole other war going on in the international media and on campuses,” Regev said. “And once I understood this that there’s not only a physical battlefront but a verbal one I felt like I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and watch.”\nIt was for this reason that he decided to represent the film in the states; to share his stories and to answer any questions about Israel that students may have.\nRebekah Kanefsky, 19, is a senior majoring in Psychology.\n“The club is pro-Israel and aims to educate students and the Orlando community about Israel,” she said.\nKanefsky is the event coordinator for knights for Israel, and first got involved in the club because she knew the current club president in high school, and had introduced her to Knights for Israel when she came to college.\n“I am really passionate about Israel and advocating for it, so that’s why I wanted to get involved,” she said.\n“I liked [the film] because it was an effective reminder that Israeli soldiers are human too. The Israeli people just want their children to come home safe and the soldiers are very similar to you and I in many aspects,” Kanefsky said.\n“Other pro Israel groups around the country also are screening [the film] and I think it’s an interesting documentary that makes students feel supportive of the soldiers.

Since then, he has remained a film icon and influenced countless people to take up martial arts as a hobby. If it weren’t for Bruce Lee, 24-year-old UCF karate team coach Colton Woodard may have never found his passion for karate or have been selected to represent the United States at the World Karate Federation (WKF) championships in Okinawa, Japan.\nWhen William Woodard, Colton’s father, got his ACL and MCL injured during high school while playing football in the early 70s, he was told by doctors he would never play any sport again but refused to obey those rules and was inspired while watching Bruce Lee to become a martial arts expert. At age 17, he began training, winning competitions and saw that even as a cripple, he could beat others and was in fact able to do a sport. Since then he has travelled internationally, taught karate for over 40 years and become the president of the National Karate Kobudo Federation (NKKF) as well as the vice president of Kuniba Kai International.\n“I didn’t have to do karate but fell in love with it as well when I went to Okinawa as a teenager and watched my dad compete,” says Colton. That’s something that inspired me as an american. To perform at an olympic level and really step up my game and represent our country athletically.”\nColton got a real passion, greater respect and understanding for karate while in Japan seeing how it was different than in America. Since then, he has made it his mission as an american to be really good at karate and become a world competitor. He is ecstatic that karate is in the final approval process of being added to the Olympics for 2020 and hopes to be able to compete in the upcoming games.\nOn November 28-29, Colton will represent the US in the Karate 1 Premier League in Okinawa, Japan along with three other representatives from California. He first had to place in state representing Florida AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) Karate and was then put into a national selection pool where he was selected.\nKarate has been a part of Colton’s life since he was about two or three years old. He won his first world championship at age five and since has won AAU state championships multiple times competing in places such as Chicago, Las Vegas, North Carolina, New York and more.\n“I’ve been competing every year and getting close you know, getting runner up but I got second place and then you get placed in a selection pool for the USA national team and I got placed in the selection pool a couple of times so when I actually got selected for the USA team this year, I was like ‘Wow, no way! This is finally coming true all these years later,” says Colton.\nWhen he found out he made the USA team, he knew that nothing was going to hold him back and it had been something he was saving up for overtime. Selling possessions such as guitars, he says that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity because he never knows if he will qualify again. As a karate teacher in three different schools, this will also add to his resume and give him many great experiences he might not have otherwise. If Colton wins in the Male Kata (floor routine) and Kumite (fighting), he can never compete as an amateur again because WKF is a professional circuit.\n“Money can’t buy that kind of experience. You can’t buy your way into qualifying for a tournament,” says Colton.\nHe knows money will always come back and many of his friends and family have helped him along the way as well as UCF’s OSI by paying his registration fee to compete.\nColton is going to Japan alone but is meeting with his coach, Soke Kozo Kuniba, whom he first met when he was eight. Although they have a bit of a communication barrier, they still understand each other well enough since Colton knows a bit of conversational Japanese and knows karate terms. Kozo Kuniba speaks a bit of English as well which helps them communicate.\nColton’s WKF competitors range from ages 19-35 and are the best of their countries.\n“I might be the nicest guy in the world, but as soon as my feet step in that ring, it’s just business. I’m here to work. I got to do my job. Afterwards, man, I’ll shake your hand and we can be friends, I’ll buy you a beer but when we get in the ring, I got to do my job, you got to do yours and only one of us is going to win,” says Colton.\nUCF karate team coach Colton Woodard will represent the United States at the World Karate Federation championship.Photo by Katrina Poggio.\nThe competitions are always a challenge he says but it is very rewarding because when he wins, he realizes all the matches he had to overcome and there is a great comradery that comes with that realization as well.\nWhile in Okinawa, Colton will train a few days before with Kozo Kuniba as well as be introduced to many grandmasters his coach knows.\nWith the Karate Team at UCF, he wants to do a seminar at UCF with the grandmasters he is meeting in Japan where all students can come meet them and get their autographs. There will hopefully also be a free clinic with them where attendees can learn first hand from masters of the art.\nColton aspires to make a competition team at UCF with avid athletes that will train seriously and compete in the AAU karate league traveling for state and national competitions. So far, there are 28 official members signed and he hopes to take about 12 competitors to the four state qualifying competitions held in Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Fort Pierce.\nAs the founder of the Karate Team at UCF, he is happy showing the community different skills which many people charge for in places he likes to call McDojos. These places are workout kind of martial arts instead of the samurai art form that has been passed down from teacher to student over hundreds of years. He hopes to keep karate as original as possible and wants to inspire others to preserve the art but also strive for excellence and to focus on the competition aspect of karate.\nBesides the Karate Team at UCF, Colton also teaches in Ocala Karate Dojo and Socrates Preparatory School. Collectively, he has 100 students ranging from ages four to 56.\n“It really is a passion of mine because I get to see results. It’s not always a fast thing but this past year, our team from Ocala, we had 26 state champions, 16 national champions and named top 20 schools of the United States for the fifth year in a row,” says Colton. That’s a really big feat for us and i’m hoping to get that same level of competition, the same accomplishments, here at UCF this coming up year. Bring that same kind of training and dedication to our school.”\nAs a referee for the state of Florida competitions, he has gone through training where he has a good base knowing what judges are looking for. Training takes a lot of dedication and patience but shows overtime.\nGrowing up, Colton was never forced to do martial arts and neither was his brother, Dalton. They both still share the same love for karate although Dalton now lives as a blues guitarist in New York.\nEven though he competed in multiple competitions throughout his life, Colton never missed school due to karate but says he truly lived like the real karate kid. After school, he would finish his homework and then train in the Dojo his father built behind their house. Sometimes he trained so hard and was so tired that he would pass out and wake up with a blanket on him that his parents placed.\n“Colton has always been the Karate Kid. He trains for perfection. He is a dynamically motivated individual, and succeeds at whatever he sets out to do,” says William Woodward.\nNow Colton is a junior at UCF studying pre-clinical health sciences with goals of becoming a surgeon and hopes of continuing graduate school right at UCF. Besides karate, he has always had a deep interest in the medical fields and was inspired to become a surgeon when he had to get five stitches on his finger after slicing it with a sword he was cleaning.\nHis main goal besides becoming a surgeon is to win a medal for USA and to compete well into his 30s until his body can’t take it anymore or doctor’s say he cannot.\n“I feel like everything is finally coming together at the right point of my life,” says Colton. “I feel like i’m at the peak of my athletic abilities as well.”\nColton is one step closer to making his dreams a reality with the upcoming WKF competition and is not just going against the USA this time, but against the world.\n“I loved going to tournaments as a kid and have competed my whole life. I loved the thrill of being there and having a crowd screaming and going against people that you knew were top quality martial artists. I still have that same excitement,” Colton says. “You know, you get those butterflies if you know the guy’s awesome. If you know he’s from Macau or Japan or China or Taiwan or he might be from Africa or Sweden or Iran and you know nothing about this competitor but you know he’s a black belt and he’s the very best of his country. Knowing that, I get this super excitement going and hey, I might not win but I’m going against the very best and that’s something I can always say for the rest of my life.”\nPhotos by Katrina Poggio.']",['https://knightnews.com/2015/10/ucf-karate-coach-to-compete-in-world-karate-federation-competition/'],0.2776561379432678,0.16908693313598633,0.1467149406671524

There might be an add or two as this semester starts,” Frost said. “Florida is obviously one of the richest recruiting grounds in the country and I think we’d be foolish not to do the majority of our recruiting right here around home.”\nFrost met with the media on Thursday to give an update on what he has been doing in his first month on the job as head coach of the UCF football program. The biggest questions posed to Frost surrounded the development of his coaching staff and the strides that the new regime has made in attracting recruits.\n“We want kids to want to come here,” Frost said. “To be honest with you, I’m not as concerned if they have four stars or five stars or two stars after their name. I want the right guys, I want the right type of character guys and the right type of athletes.”\nThe Knights’ new defensive coordinator Erik Chinander also made it clear that the program needs to recruit from within and focus on the vast talent crop that the state of Florida has to offer.\n“When we were at Oregon, obviously there is somewhere between 5 and 15 division one recruits per year,” Chinander said. “But now you’ve got everybody in your backyard, so I don’t have to get on planes every night and I don’t have to take red eyes. I drive to Tampa and I stay in town or I drive down to Miami, it’s going to be awesome.”\nChinander is just the latest hire for the Knights who now have most of the staff in place heading into the 2016 season. Frost got the ball rolling early on when he brought on quarterbacks coach Mario Verduzco and assistant coach Troy Walters.\nHowever, a good portion of the staff was not revealed until Wednesday when the team officially added Chinander, offensive line coach Greg Austin and director of player development Marcus Castro-Walker. The 41-year-old head coach admitted that the staff selection process has been somewhat slow, but the pacing was necessary to find the right person for each spot.\n“I think the players deserve to have the right people coaching them,” Frost said. “I’ve gotten a lot of the people that I wanted to come in here and coach at UCF and everybody has been really excited about it. We’ll finish up the staff whenever I am sure that we have the right people in here.”\nWhile it has been hammered home that the Knights will look a lot different this coming season between the almost entirely-new staff and style of offense, questions still remain regarding players on the current UCF roster and how they can fit into this fresh and fast program.\n[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”79256″]\n“I think there is plenty of talent on this team to make a lot of strides to get where we want to get,” Frost said. “It’s going to be a learning process for everybody and we’ll cater a lot of what we do to the talent that is on the team right now, but I’ve got a lot of confidence in the guys in this building already.”\nWith National Signing Day less than a month away, UCF fans should look forward to seeing what Frost and his new staff can add to the crop of young talent that the team will bring over from last season.\nPhoto by Jean Racine']",['https://knightnews.com/2016/01/scott-frost-press-conference-in-state-recruiting-and-staff-selection-have-been-critical/'],0.13415353000164032,0.046231843531131744,0.05561903864145279

UCF has used a 4-3 defense under the O’Leary reign, but Chinander is confident that he has the talent on the roster and the potential to get the right talent in the State of Florida to run a multiple defense.\n“We’re going to play an aggressive style of defense,” said Chinander. “I know there’s a lot of talent in this state, a lot of talent currently on the roster.

On Wednesday, that was replaced by a poster labeled “Breaking Stereotypes,” balsa wood, and permanent markers.\nHosted by the Dems’ Asian-American Caucus, the event did exactly as advertised. Participants wrote their most hated statement attributed to their race and literally broke that stereotype in half.\nThe purpose, as described by caucus leaders, was to promote inclusiveness within the community by dispelling, in part, what is known as the model minority myth. Often used to describe Asians, the “model minority” is defined on a distributed flier as one “whose members are most often perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average.” The term, the flier said, is used to counter calls for government action to reduce racial discrimination.\nFrom pursuing STEM careers–a stereotype “broken” by political science and art history student Pratyush Goberdhan–to the common trope that Chinese students perform well at math, are some examples of misconceptions made about Asians that perpetuate the model minority.\nAlso, contrary to popular belief, Asians, which comprise six percent of the UCF student population, come from nationalities as far west as Turkey and as far south as Indonesia. Devi Mody, another co-founder of the Asian-American Caucus and the treasurer of the Dems, confronts the misconception as an Indian-American.\n“Let me tell you, people in middle school–like, do they not realize that India is in Asia?” Mody asked with a chuckle. “India’s in Asia, therefore making us Asian. People have fought me on this, and I’m like ‘Google a map and you will see.'”\nIndeed, many Asian students who participated in “breaking” their stereotypes did not fit the mythical profile, such as Sarah Siraj, a Pakistani student activist who wrote “Muslims are terrorists” on her board before splitting it in two.\nMany stereotypes are considered paradoxically positive while possibly having negative implications, and some come as a result of confusing continental separation with racial profiles, but others range into the purely negative. An example of this is that Asian men are not masculine enough, an idea which Stephanie Slater, a co-founder of the caucus and a Chinese-born criminal justice student, said may be because of other cultural and physical misconceptions.\n“People don’t think they are manly because ‘they don’t stand up for themselves, they’re not openly masculine,'” Stephanie Slater, a Chinese-born criminal justice student and a co-founder of the caucus, said. “They are shorter, which doesn’t help. And I think it’s because Asians are smart, so when you see them doing math all the time or engineering, you don’t typically see them as Superman.”\nSlater herself breaks the trope of the homogeneous Asian family. While she was born in China, she and her twin sister were adopted by American parents and grew up in the United States with an English-language last name.\nHaving gone to school in Florida, she was taunted by her appearance and was called “chink,” a racial slur against Chinese people particularly and one which, she said, many Americans see nothing wrong with saying.\xa0She does, however, continue to learn more about Chinese culture and customs, something which she feels is part of the Asian-American experience.\n“It’s very different for me because I grew up American, but to me it’s about being proud of where you come from, and I am proud of being Chinese,” Slater said. “When people ask me what I am, I say Chinese. I assume people know I am also American.”\nAsian-Americans, while they were the primary target of Breaking Stereotypes, were not the only ones who sought to do so. One black student broke a board with “Watermelons” scribbled across it. A Colombian dispelled the stereotype that he sells cocaine. And another student confidently split a board with the words, “I shower with my hijab on.”""]",['https://knightnews.com/2016/02/asian-american-students-seek-to-break-stereotypes/'],0.5949487686157227,0.7589704394340515,0.4677225351333618

Show us you’re ready to learn,” teacher and UCF environmental sustainability graduate student Nadeska Concha says to her students every Friday morning, as she prepares to demonstrate the process of pollination and its importance.\nConcha is an instructor at UCF’s Creative School for Children, a learning facility “dedicated to creating an educational environment that provides opportunities for children to discover, explore, grow, and develop to their own unique potential,” according to the school’s mission statement.\n“In order to become lifelong learners, young children need to be provided with concrete meaningful experiences to help them develop a positive self-esteem, skills in problem solving, creative thinking, self-reliance, and interpersonal communications.”\nLocated on-campus just north of UCF’s leisure pool, the school is providing new concrete, hands-on experiences with its new garden area, where the 3-5 year-old children now embrace the outdoors daily and learn the processes of our ecosystem.\nConcha, or Miss Nadeska, begins her 45-minute pollination lesson this week by reading Elle McGuinness’s children’s book Bee and Me to the Early Experience 3 (EE2) class, reassuring students that bees help our environment as they “transfer pollen back to flowers in order for the plant to grow, reproduce, and form seeds, nuts, or fruits,” according to The Guardian newspaper.\n“Bees are important to flowers,” Concha said. “We don’t need to be scared.”\nNext, she draws flowers on an orange poster board where the students stick pollen (flour) onto the plants. The children role-play as either bees or butterflies to show how there is nothing to be afraid of.\nThe students “buzz” and play around the garden soaking in all of the informative fun.\n“More pollen please,” the children plea in unison.\nFinally, Miss Nadeska shows students the garden area’s blossoming papaya tree, which came about from pollination.\n“The students’ minds are so open,” sophomore elementary education major and Creative School volunteer Ashley Kovarik said. “Their minds are sponges, and they are a joy to work with.”\nSophomore business major Brandon Calma volunteer echoes Kovarik’s sentiment. “I love the kids,” he said. “I am so pleased they are eating up our new outdoor lessons we implemented this semester.”\nThe Creative School for Children is a licensed child care and pre-kindergarten school with 140 students enrolled. The children of UCF students, UCF faculty and alumni are given first priority for enrollment, and any available seats go to children of surrounding Orlando communities.\n“Every 4 year old child has the right to free pre-k,” director Amy Hesse said. With 15-20 students per class, the school’s government funded V-PK grants children a safe, happy, and diverse learning place.\n“We are a melting pot here as a lot of UCF’s international students’ children are enrolled at the creative school,” Hesse added. “We have had students from over 60 countries including Russia, Korea, China, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.”\nThe school’s fearless leader expresses her excitement about the facility’s newest garden addition.\n“I have been the director here for 2 and a half years, and I am so proud of the progress we’ve made,” she adds. “One year ago, the outside area was a sandbox, and now we are as green as can be.”\nSidebar: UCF’s Creative School for Children is looking for new volunteers to help the children reconnect with nature in their “Nature Explore Workshop” on Saturday, April 9 from 9 a.m to 4 p.m. with a lunch break.

Despite the odds, Frost built up a 6-5 record that\xa0should\xa0have been at least 9-2, as the Bulls have built.\nFour out of the last five losses came when UCF was either leading or tied at the half – three of those losses where the Knights led by more that one score – but crumbled in the second half.

That’s not to say that Milton is the only one at fault – the UCF offensive line has occasionally faltered in giving Milton those few extra seconds to find an open receiver.\nCalls to put in former starting QB Justin Holman were met with a stark no from Frost in Monday morning’s press conference, who plans on sticking with Milton, barring any unusual circumstances.\nIf Milton can improve his explosiveness as part of the ‘UCFast’ mantra, then USF should concede touchdowns no-problem.\nIf UCF can restore their run game, however, then USF will have reason to be concerned.\nIn the wake of a chance to get their first 10-win season since 1997, the Bulls have a desire to succeed and are favored considerably but won’t see the same scoring margin as last-time-out at Bright House.\nA trophy with a base and detachable key were revealed on Sunday to go to the winner of the noon game.

Coach Frost said that for the most part the depth chart has been set – with the exception of cornerback and offensive guard. Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander said as recently as Tuesday that the competition in the secondary will battle on until game day on Thursday.\nDefensive Backfield: All four of UCF’s starting defensive backs left the program in the offseason – a loss of 11 interceptions, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 242 tackles. New\nLinebacker: Headed into the spring football game, it looked like UCF had lost a ton of depth inside with the losses of Mark Rucker, Demeitre Brim, and Chequan Burkett. Luckily enough for UCF, Burquett’s decision to leave team didn’t last for long and he was welcomed back with open arms.\nShaquem Griffin remains cemented on the outside but lost a partner in crime, Errol Clarke – leaving a big gap on the other side of the field. With opponents likely to give huge attention to Shaquem, it frees up a massive opportunity for Titus Davis and position transfer Shawn Burgess-Becker to step up and eat.\nWide Receiver: Tre’Quan Smith is an absolute stud. His play in the offseason became a regular kind of special, where he continuously was said to separate himself head and shoulders from the crowd. The trick is the rotation behind him.\nOffensive coordinator Troy Walters said that UCF will have to use a receiver by committee approach, but that Emmanuel Logan-Greene has looked sharp all through camp. Expect blocking-specialist Cam Stewart to start the season on the outside, but Greene could quickly play his way from the slot into a more featured role.\nOffensive Line: Bookend tackles are nice to have. Really nice to have. They just don’t account for a system with pulling guards and constant high-tempo. Jordan Johnson stepped up last year at right guard but is making the cross-over to center while Freshman Sam Jackson has impressed enough to get the chance at Guard alongside Chavis Dickey headed into week one.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/08/official-ucf-depth-chart-update-and-podcast-knights-preseason-football-wrap-up/'],0.12014611810445786,0.08397694677114487,0.04841852933168411

The 325-lb defensive lineman made waves his freshman year with stellar play and viral videos – squatting the weight of small cars to the delight of Knights fans everywhere.\nThe hype train only built speed over the offseason and the sophomore is poised to build off his first year at UCF in a big way but in a different position. Hill was moved inside this offseason to nose guard in a transition officially announced through the release of UCF’s depth chart on Friday.\nIt is a move that will draw attention up the middle of the defense, help stuff the run in a big way, and free up some of the playmakers around the defense – the most excited of whom may be Jamiyus Pittman, who was able to bump out to defensive end in a corresponding move.\n“I’m happy with what I’m working with,” said Pittman about the guys around him. “I think I can depend on everybody on the front seven – I can depend on my secondary [too], it’s just… I’m confident that we’ll go out and ball out on Thursday.”\n\xa0\nPittman started eight games in 2016 at nose, racking up a pair of sacks and 28 tackles while fighting through countless double teams – a formidable task for the generously listed six-foot-nothing lineman.\n“It gets me one-one-ones now,” gleefully explained Pittman. “No more helmets to the ribs. I’ll be out there working my magic like I was supposed to be [doing] last year.”\nHis partner in crime across the line, Tony Guerad, had double-digit tackles for a loss last year and notched 3.5 sacks of his own. The duo will get plenty of opportunities to wreak havoc this year, and it isn’t just Trysten’s move. Depth across the board will play a significant factor, and not just because this staff finally pieces to match the roles they carved out in this system, but because it lessens the problem of fatigue in the fourth quarter.\n“I expect more production out of those guys this year,” said Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “I expect them to run the show a little bit. With that being said, there are guys that can come in and spell them. It’s a little different than last year, last year we played those guys a little more as they clearly rose to the top of the depth chart.”\nUCF still boasts the reigning AAC Defensive Player of the Year and has great depth at outside linebacker by all accounts.

We’re exhausting all options. We want to make sure that we get an eleventh game, and we’re working, we have a lot of irons in the fire trying to figure it out.”\nThe idea that UCF could replace that bye week does seem to be more and more of a concrete eventuality than a marginal pipe dream, but as fans in Orlando know all too well, nothing is certain until your opponent takes the field. With the hope slowly emerging for another game gaining ground as an eventuality, the program has begun to mentally steel themselves for the challenge ahead.\n“It’s not ideal,” said Head Coach Scott Frost about the potential change. “I liked where our bye week was when I saw the schedule came out.”\n“The good thing this year compared to last year is that last year the bye week got changed on us last minute, so we didn’t get a chance to give our kids any time off. There was no time to recover physically, there was no time to get rested, the one benefit this year compared to last year is these guys had about five or six days off. That should help us. We’re going to have a long stretch here of ten straight games – hopefully, if we get another game scheduled.”\nChallenging or not, there isn’t a player or coach on the team who would tell you that they would rather turn in for an extra week of rest than fit an opponent, any opponent, into the mix. The benefits of getting in the game are huge for every square inch of the program, even beyond the hashmarks.\nPlaying an eleventh game that week brings back suspended players Nevelle Clarke and Tristan Payton back a week earlier. It appeases season ticket holders to some extent for the loss of the Georgia Tech game. An eleventh game also provides an outstanding opportunity to further another run at bowl-game eligibility.\nThere’s just one place off the field that the game might hurt – recruiting. Coaches normally take that time to do some of their more extensive in-season recruiting, visiting kids that are far from local and checking out a couple of games. It’s\n“We’ll have to get out on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday night and go see some games,” said Offensive Coordinator Troy Walters on making up the time. “So, we’ll make adjustments and keep rolling, but first and foremost, we’ve got to win games,” he continued.\n“We’ll find ways to recruit, it’s easier to recruit when you’re winning games. That’s the key and that’s the focus – to win football games.”\nDefensive Coordinator Erik Chinander had similar comments about the situation, and added on that the proximity of UCF’s heavy in-state recruiting focus is a huge boost for situations like this.\n“Obviously we couldn’t go out during the hurricane, all the schools were closed so you’re going to lose a week on the road for recruiting, but fortunately being in the state of Florida, most of the players that we want come from the state of Florida, so we can get a lot of them here to a lot of our games,” Chinander explained.\n“When we were other places, we were flying across the country during our bye week. Here we’re driving to Miami, we’re driving to Ft. Lauderdale, we’re driving to Tallahassee, so I think we can get those kids here and then maybe on a Thursday night or Friday night for games we can get there and see them.”\nNothing is a better teacher than experience, and for the Knights, Hurricane Matthew’s stopover during the First Frost is keeping anyone from hitting the panic button.\n“That’s a little bit above my head right there,” admitted Chinander. “It’s for the head coach to have a plan and I know he’s going to have a great plan for us moving forward. He’s been in situations like this where we play a lot of games in a row, some of us have been to the NFL where sometimes you play twelve games in a row. To me, I don’t really care. I don’t really care when our bye week is, I don’t care if we get one, I just want to play.”\nFor now, we can only wait for official word on the status of UCF’s scheduled bye week, making for what could be a very important lazy Saturday in October.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/09/rest-recuperation-and-recruiting-ucf-prepared-for-the-potential-complications-of-losing-their-scheduled-bye-week/'],0.4171190857887268,0.5556226968765259,0.3857174515724182

Last year the Knights lost to Maryland 30-24 in McKenzie Milton’s first career start, a double-overtime thriller.\nMaryland joined the Big 10 in 2014, and the program has been improving since.\nThis year they intend on making the leap into the national spotlight under the guidance of Head Coach DJ Durkin, who has gone 8-7 at the helm of the Terrapins since taking over in 2016. They are currently 2-0, and sit just outside of the AP top 25 poll while boasting the nation’s No. 2 scoring offense.\nHere are some keys to this Saturday’s game.\nTerrapin Offense:\nThe Running Game\nThe offense starts up front for Maryland. The offensive line has been impressive thus far, opening huge holes for their running backs in addition to protecting the quarterback. The team has rushed for 315 yards per game. Junior running back Ty Johnson leads the way, rushing for 257 yards on only 17 carries.\n“We don’t want (to play) someone who is averaging 100 yards a game, we want the best of the best, we want the heavyweight championship. You’ve got to beat the champion sometime, so it’s going to be a good one. I’m excited.,” Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander said about facing Johnson.\nKasim Hill\nTrue freshman quarterback Kasim Hill took over mid-way through the Texas game, after Tyrell Pigrome tore his ACL.\n“He’s big, he’s six three, 230 lbs, he can run the ball – against Towson he showed he could throw it pretty well, so I’m impressed with him and the way he’s handled himself,” said Chinander.\nThe offense hasn’t skipped a beat since Hill took over. It ranks 2nd in the nation in points per game and Kasim Hill has completed a whopping 84.2% of his passes. Most of those passes were against Towson, an FCS school, but UCF should not take him lightly.\n“I think they’re smart in asking him to do the things that he can do, he throws it well and he runs it well,” Coach Frost said.\nThe Knights’ Approach\nThe Knights’ defense is strong in the right places. UCF’s defensive front will need to play a big role. They will need to contain Ty Johnson from getting into open space. If they can force Maryland into passing downs, UCF’s pass rush could really fluster the true freshman.\nThe Knights will be looking to their decorated outside linebacker Shaquem Griffin to have a big day.\n“We have to tackle, our D-line has to get after it, we didn’t really get after FIU. We have to come out strong.,” Senior Defensive Lineman Tony Guerad said. “We didn’t do everything we could do, we did our assignments. Expect us to get after the QB this game.”\nMaryland on Defense:\nStrong Front Seven, Man Coverage on The Outside\nMaryland returned 6 out of 7 starters on the front seven this year. Last year this group struggled, but they have exhibited significant improvement in this young season. They held Texas to 3.16 yards per carry in week one, while sacking the quarterback five times.\n“They’re similar to our defense, they are very aggressive, they’ll be in the three-down front, four-down front, they’re going to blitz their linebackers and on the perimeter, they’re going to play man-to-man. “They’re going to lock up the outside guys and put pressure on the quarterback,” Offensive Coordinator Troy Walters explained.\nInside linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr anchors the unit, putting together 15 tackles, four for a loss, 2.5 sacks and a forced fumble in just two games. He flies off the film, and has impressed UCF coaches and players alike.\n“I see number one every special teams [play], so I know they’re tough kids. Not only are they good skill players, but also tough players. That’s impressive,” admitted Chinander this week.\nBoth McKenzie and Coach Frost mentioned the increased speed of this defense – stopping to mention Carter Jr independently – saying that the unit is improved significantly since the Knights had them in their sights at last meeting.\n“Their inside linebacker, number one, is pretty good. Their safety number four, he flies around pretty well too. Their corners are pretty good as well. They’re all around a pretty good defense, they’re a big ten team. They’re big, they’re fast, they’re physical, but we’ve just got to make plays,” explained McKenzie.\nDarnell Savage Jr was the other player mentioned in preparations this week, a talented 5-10 defensive back weighing in at just under 200 pounds who has an interception return for a touchdown this season.\nKnights’ Approach\nMcKenzie Milton is going to need to take chances down the field. Due to Maryland’s aggressive play calling, there will be plenty of plays in which receivers will be matched up one on one. UCF will need to take advantage of these opportunities. Look for Tre’ Quan Smith to make a couple of big plays down the field.\nThis will be a tough game for UCF. These are the type of games they need to win if they want to gain national traction. Most sites have UCF as a slight underdog going into Saturday.\nExpect this game to be as thrilling as last year’s matchup.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/09/scouting-report-the-maryland-terrapins/'],0.9703984260559082,0.40070441365242004,0.6858561635017395

Nah you know, I’m not even proud, I’m happy for them because they’ve put in a lot of work and they’ve done everything we’ve asked them to do. It’s fun when you put a process in front of people and they follow the process and they reap the rewards for it,” said Head Coach Scott Frost after the game.\n\nUCF won every battle on the field. They outgained the Terps in total yardage 428 – 197. They held the intimidating Maryland rushing game to only 42 yards, forced two turnovers but didn’t commit any, and won the battles in the trenches with five sacks to none allowed.\nMaryland suffered a huge loss early on when true-freshman quarterback Kasim Hill left the game with what appeared to be a serious injury, never to return again. Hill’s exit was a crippling blow for the offense, who seemed to sputter out almost instantly.\n“I’m broken hearted for them and Kasim,” said Frost. “He’s going to be a great player, to see anybody go down on a football field isn’t what you want to see. That certainly took the wind out of their sails.”\nThird string quarterback Max Bortenschlager took over and was met with physical brutality almost instantly. His line couldn’t protect him from five UCF sacks, he couldn’t find time to locate open receivers, and he was clearly shaken up by the threat of the Knights’ pass rush.\n“I felt like this dude was shaky. Like, man, if he sees us trying to come after him with all we’ve got, no human in their right mind is gonna be able to just sit there comfortably. So, whenever he saw us and I saw how happy feet he got, I knew we’ll get to him a couple of times today,” said Jamiyus Pittman, who got into the backfield for two of the five sacks.\nThe defense didn’t just nullify the aerial assault of the Terrapins, they dominated the ground game; UCF held the UMD rushing game to 1.1 – yes, 1.1 – yards per rush. It was no easy feat against a team that was averaging over 300 yards a game headed into Saturday.\n“I’m not even going to lie, I feel great about that because it is hard. I could see why they do gash people because that’s not a normal scheme. You really have to study it and play your assignment or they will do what they’ve been doing to other people,” analyzed Jamiyus.\nA two-deep group of both linemen and ‘backers got together before the game to go over film on their own, spending hours as a unit without their coaches to get better.\n“Yesterday after walkthrough when we walked by the defensive meeting room and the two-deep of our linebackers and [defensive backs] were in the room with the call sheets, making calls and watching film on their own and making all the calls they’d have to make based on what they thought [Erik Chinander] would call,” explained Coach Frost.\n“That’s rare. Nobody asked them to do that, they did that for two hours before they got on the bus. That’s the kind of commitment level we have right now and like I said, I’m proud to coach them.”\nIt’s the kind of commitment level that exemplifies the growth of UCF. Just a year ago, players were crushed after an overtime thriller at home ended in a loss. This year, this matchup, UCF was clearly better prepared, clearly more motivated.\nMcKenzie Milton is the obvious exemplification of this, transforming from a six-fumble performance a season ago into 178 passing yards, a touchdown, 94 rushing yards and zero turnovers. He led UCF to a 5-for-5 display in the red zone and kept his cool throughout, even if the offense came out a bit rusty.\n“I thought he played really well,” said Frost. “He didn’t have as many stats as he had week one, but he had some key plays in some clutch situations. I thought some of the third down completions he made were big. Some of the throws he made when we needed a play to [Michael] Colubiale, to Jordan Akins, to Tre’Quan [Smith], that really changed the game and then his runs on third down.”\nTo be sure, this was a huge test for the program. A Power 5 opponent on the road on the heels of two impromptu bye weeks is a setting straight from hell for most coaches. This team displayed their maturity and growth on Saturday by not giving up an inch.\nThey will need to roll with this momentum next week, as conference play starts against Memphis at home. Coach Frost told the team after the game that they weren’t done yet, that this was just the beginning. It is exactly the message that the players expected, exactly the message they wanted to hear.\nThe big wins don’t stop in week two.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/09/power-five-who-ucf-wins-38-10-in-total-victory-over-maryland-terrapins/'],0.9297378659248352,0.5419259071350098,0.4643833041191101

The Knights had the game in hand, leading 21-3 at halftime.\n31-24 L Houston: Greg Ward Jr. and soon-to-be-former-head-coach Tom Herman had Houston football positioned as the American Athletic Conference’s superteam when UCF came into town, but the Knights would prove to be first-half kryptonite – running up a 21-3 lead before surrendering four touchdowns in the second half.\n35-20 L Tulsa: Tulsa did not incite the same emotional meltdown that other late-game collapses did, but the Knights did hold the game even at halftime at fourteen apiece. UCF’s offense sputtered out in the third and fourth quarter, only managing to score six points in the game’s final frame.\nThings are different in year two of the Frost Era. UCF is smashing opponents in the second half, letting just three touchdowns slip by them after the intermission; they have outscored those three foes 62-20 as time wound down.\n“I think our play in the second half is due to confidence,” said Frost. “It’s due to our depth, we have better depth this year and I think we’re playing deeper into games. I also think it has to do with our focus. Last year we’d lose our focus, we’d get up on people and we didn’t play the same in the second half. Whether it’s depth, confidence or just commitment to what we’re doing, I’ve been really impressed with the third quarters we have put together.”\nUCF opponents are 9-0 in every other game they have played in 2017, and that includes wins over Texas and a shootout with Josh Rosen and the then-ranked No. 25 UCLA Bruins. Maryland looked every part of a power five program immediately after their shellacking at home, and Memphis was considered to be an American Athletic Conference favorite until their demise at the hands of Adrian Killins and company.\nThese are not pushover wins that UCF has accrued. As much as Frost may emphasize that the team isn’t getting too large of an ego boost from the early success, Orlando’s Hometown Team is expecting to win every time they take the field.\n“Everyone is hungry, so every practice is full of energy,” said running back Adrian Killins. “Guys are competing at every position so I feel sorry for the next opponent, because this team is out for revenge.”\nSmall improvements in the details have led to significant big picture growth. Simple things – a second year in the same system, a full off-season of strength training under visionary coach Zach Duval, a quarterback who has learned how to compete amongst the titans of the NCAA – have all paid enormous dividends.\n“To be honest with you, I think last year on defense – I don’t know about the offense so much – but on defense, we had the system in and it was the base system,” broke down UCF Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “We were out there calling calls that we thought would put them in the best position. Now we can install some systems within the system, so that the kids can get themselves in the best call. The second year in the system, with second-year linebackers and safeties that really understand, [the system] they can roll the coverage, they can adjust the front to the best situation in that certain formation or that certain play.”\n“That’s the biggest buy-in right there, just letting the system work for the kids, and they understand now that if we let the system work for us, we’re going to know how to play certain plays and certain formations, so I think that’s helped them a ton.”\nMcKenzie Milton was tossed into the fires before he was even close to prepared. He took a beating that can be attributed to both his heart-stopping, athletic brand of football and an offensive line that was, at times, suspect at best.\nHis 1:1 touchdown-to-turnover ratio as a freshman struck a deep, dark chord of worry for many fans watching his development seemingly stall midseason. Milton notched ten passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns, threw seven interceptions and lost six fumbles.\nNothing makes a young quarterback look like a golden god more than a chest-thumping, cleat-clearing bunch of big men along the offensive line that can erect a wall that the Knights’ Watch (see what I did there?) would be proud to stand behind.\nUCF’s line hasn’t allowed a single sack through three games. One more time: UCF has not allowed their scrambling, pants-on-fire, improvisational jazz artist of a quarterback to eat dirt in 2017. Not even once.\n“Some of the things that I think were weaknesses on this team last year are turning into strengths and they’re turning into strengths pretty fast. I’m really proud of that O-Line for how far they’ve come,” said Frost about the unit.\nBlack magic has taken the question marks of summer and fortified them into staunch pillars of strength for the undefeated Knights. The offensive line is hanging numbers that rival any in collegiate football.\nThe defense, heavy with inexperience brought on by seven new starters, ranks as a top ten unit and has forced the nation’s highest turnover margin.\nUCF’s secondary lost every single starter and has recorded a touchdown, notched five interceptions from three of their new starters alone, and is locking down the opposition to 225.7 yards per game with a total of three touchdowns across the season.\xa0 Three.\nIt is not only that UCF has blown their opponents out of the water by scores of 61-17, 38-10 and 40-13. It isn’t just the +2.33 turnover margin, a hot streak from the offense, a show put on by the defense or extenuating circumstances brought on to their opponents via injury. There isn’t one clear element that anyone can point to that explains the rise of UCFast Football.\nThe single, undeniable fact about football in Orlando this season? You can bet with confidence on the UCF Knights.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/10/the-early-season-dominance-of-ucf-football-is-no-fluke-orlandos-hometown-team-is-for-real/'],0.5372341871261597,0.8132861852645874,0.8210999965667725

Our formula has been working to this point, making us a better football team. I think they understand if we stick to that, that gives us our best chance,” Frost said Monday afternoon.\nThis UCF has grabbed the attention of this city, and the country.\xa0 Frost continues to preach short term goals, and Cincinnati is next on their agenda.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/10/cincinnati-scouting-report-ucf-arrives-in-the-queen-city-with-a-target-on-their-chest/'],0.89898681640625,0.4301140010356903,0.4814225137233734

But 50 points? Yeah, we’re putting up 70.”\nUCF is the number one ranked scoring offense and eighth in total offense per game, so expect a scoring barrage by the Knights.\xa0 ECU made huge changes after week two, promoting Robert Prunty to defensive coordinator.\xa0 Head Coach Scottie Montgomery believed this change could help spark a turnaround. Robert Prunty has rotated in younger guys, even taking a couple kids off their redshirt, trying anything to ignite a spark for this defense.\nThey certainly need it, so far, they have given up nearly 600 yards per game.\n“I think that Coach [Robert] Prunty has done a good job of reducing what we do. I’ve never seen so many cornerbacks in position to make plays and now we’ve got to grow them to the point of where they actually make plays.,” Scottie Montgomery said about changes Prunty has made to ECU’s defense.\nThe bright spot of this struggling program has been the quarterback, Thomas Sirk. Sirk has taken over the starting job, and has looked solid. He has provided some excitement for ECU on that side of the ball with his arm and his legs. Provided 9 touchdowns for the school in his limited time under center.\n“They have as good of a passing attack as anybody in our league. Our defense is going to have to be ready for that,” Coach Frost stated on defending the Pirates. “We’re going to have to get after the passer, the pass rush. We’re going to have to defend well on the back end”.\nThe receiving corps hasn’t skipped a beat since losing Zay Jones to the NFL draft last year.\xa0 They have four receivers with over 200 yards, Senior Davon Greyson leads the way with 31 receptions, 535 yards and 5 touchdowns.\n“This quarterback, last year I think he almost looked to Zay Jones in the passing game,” said Coach Chinander. “This guy is dealing the ball all around this year, so sometimes it’s a little easier when they have ‘the guy’. You eliminate ‘the guy’ and let everybody else beat you. Now, this guy is dealing around, I think he’s doing a great job.”\nThis game should have some extra excitement around it, even with ECU underperforming this year.\xa0 It’s homecoming week, so expect Spectrum Stadium to live up to its proclaimed nickname “The Bounce House” on Saturday night.\xa0 It is also a conference opponent, and at 1-2 they are still tied for 3rd place.\xa0 Don’t expect this team to roll over on Saturday night.\xa0 They have always been a solid program, and they will play a tough game.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/10/scouting-east-carolina-a-leaky-defense-could-sink-the-pirates-ship/'],0.5102207064628601,0.11977343261241913,0.10142914205789566

Navy has ridden their standout system to five wins and video-game-like rushing numbers, sparking nostalgia in Coach Frost.\n“I love option football,” Frost said. “I lived it. I feel like option quarterbacks now are kind of like giant pandas, they only exist in zoos and military academies now.”\n“The reads and the plays, running with the ball and pitching last second – the timing of it, its just kind of different than anything else that most people ask their quarterback to do. You’ve got to have a tough kid who is smart under center and I think that navy has that. I can tell by his statistics that he is the one that makes it go,” Frost explained.\nWhat does that mean for the UCF defense? The easy answer against an option-read offense is pure ‘assignment football’. It means not missing your man, it means that missing your man can lead to catastrophe.\n“The thing that I don’t get it when people say – oh, this is a discipline game; this is an assignment game – it’s an assignment [game] every game,” explained Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “I don’t just tell them to do whatever the\xa0hell they want on every other play.”\n“I don’t understand how that’s different than regular football. It’s a different offense, absolutely, and there’s a few different wrinkles, a few different kinks for our guys, but it’s football,” he said.\nKeep it simple, do your job. UCF has long leaned on the strength of their defense in the Scott Frost Era, and it will need to be their backbone against the Midshipmen. With only a handful of passing touchdowns on the year and weapons that won’t surprise anyone, Navy is 5-1 on the strength of military execution.\nIn reading their opponent the Knights have gotten back to taking extra study sessions. The extra work was left out of the routine against Cincinnati, and the team admitted that the Bearcats had hit them with a few plays, a few formations that they had not recognized.\nThat kind of momentary lapse in preparation won’t happen anymore.\n“That’s one thing that we picked back up on last week,” said inside linebacker Chequan Burkett. “We know that for the rest of the season that extra meeting pays off. Going into this game, we’ll maybe have even more meetings to make sure we don’t have that drop off.”\nEven with the threat of an aerial assault slightly neutralized, the fast-over-physical Knights’ defense won’t change their identity too much.\n“I think you have to line up like you normally do,” said Chinander. “Our starters are our starters for a reason, we’re going to roll guys in like we normally do, everybody has a really good practice so far.”\nThe Midshipmen’s death-by-attrition battleplan doesn’t leave too many avenues for quick scoring drives in deficit games. A three-score margin is a death sentence with competent defensive plays.\nNavy will be tough and physical. Their offensive line and gritty quarterback do not allow many negative plays, and positive yards on the first two downs equate to short, highly convertible third downs. They will grind the clock, they will make murder McKenzie for any UCFast three-and-outs.\n“You see teams around the country have let downs once in a while,” said Frost. “You saw a few last week. Our guys came out ready to play on Saturday and I think that’s a good sign, we know the challenge we have ahead of us right now. This is one of the best teams in the league and we’re playing hem on the road. I’m not worried about that with this team, this week.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/10/ucf-just-needs-to-keep-things-simple-in-battling-with-extinct-navy-option-offense/'],0.5283777117729187,0.1255965530872345,0.18787416815757751

Clarke transitioned from scout-team to game speed with relative ease, setting the stage for a showdown in Dallas against an SMU duo that boasted NFL talent on either side.\n“Nevelle had an unbelievable game,” said Coach Frost on Monday. “That was a big test for our defensive backs with the quality of wide receivers that they had.\n“Those guys had a huge challenge and I thought they were up to the task. Nevelle, being only his second game back, I thought he played at a really high level on Saturday.”\nIt should be reinforced that Courtland Sutton is a first-round talent averaging 15.7 yards per catch, and Trey Quinn leads the NCAA in receptions.\n“I was proud of him, stepping in there,” assured Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander. “It’s not like he was out there playing against me at receiver, he was out there playing some real legitimate NFL guys.”\nMike Hughes has been a pleasant surprise as the Knights’ most outstanding defender, but Nevelle was slotted to be UCF’s lockdown corner since his emergence last season. He has returned to full form, which would assume a ton of playing time in the season’s back end.\nThat doesn’t mean that Brandon Moore has lost his seat the table yet. Chinander said this week that they will do their best to get all three guys on the field at the same time and that all three are taking reps with the starters right now.\n“Right now, we’re rotating Bam, him and Mike all in there at the ones and we’re trying to get all three of them on the field in a lot of situations,” explained Chinander. “I think you’re going to see a good rotation.”\n“Mike and Bam have just had so many reps throughout the year that it’s going to be good to go Mike and Bam – have those two take a couple of series – then go Nevelle and Mike, Nevelle and Bam; I think it’s going to be really good for us as a team to get those guys some rest.”\nBrandon Moore has been heavily targeted as the No. 2 corner and as a redshirt freshman just getting established. With Hughes shining so brightly on the opposite side, it has been heavy fire for Moore as the logical weak link.\nHis standout game against Navy yielded a forced fumble, fumble recovery, tackle for a loss and interception – making it tough to remove his name from the conversation.\nMoore’s continued development does excellent things for the Knights’ number one unit, giving them flexibility with both coverage packages and in rotating fresh legs to the scene. He will continue to take significant reps and will still be in the mix, but expect UCF to go to Nevelle when the situation calls for just their best two corners on the field.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/11/ucf-secondary-clarke-hughes-and-moore-all-splitting-first-team-reps-at-cornerback/'],0.7807632684707642,0.08803483843803406,0.1005413830280304

UConn doesn’t provide much more fuel to stoke the fires of progress but will present Orlando’s Hometown team the opportunity to put on a dazzling show in their first of two final regular season home games.\nUConn Quarterback David Pindell\nHuskies’ quarterback Bryant Shirreffs is out for this one, still navigating his way through the concussion protocol. He had been one of the few bright spots on this UConn team, second to only McKenzie Milton in the American’s leaders in pass efficiency. He has posted a 14-5 TD:INT ratio and has completed 65.8% of his passes – a significant loss for a team only rushing for 132.6 yards per game.\nJunior quarterback David Pindell was 3-4 for 37 yards in relief of Shirreffs last weekend, not leaving much on the tape.\nAAC-Worst Pass Defense\nMcKenzie Milton and company will be facing an FCS-level pass defense in the UConn secondary. Giving up a conference-worst 378.6 yards per game, and leading the highway to defeat with 28 surrendered passing touchdowns, the Huskies’ glaring weakness is in the second-level defense.\nIn their four conference losses, UConn has allowed opponents to score 37, 41, 49 and 70 points – 20 points per game more than they scored in the defeats.\nUCF Defensive Back Competition \nNevelle Clarke has all but stolen the starting gig from Brandon Moore, who has seen a drop in playing time to accommodate the returning talent. Defensive Coordinator Erik Chinander said this week that even Hughes’ will be affected by Clarke’s return as the team rotates all three backs with the number one unit.\nThis means getting all three on the field in obvious passing downs as well. Moore has come on as of late, but no longer does UCF have to suffer if a team is able to take advantage of the redshirt freshman’s youth. UConn’s damaged passing attack serves up a feast of opportunity to separate from the pack.\nClear Mind, Total Focus\nCoach Frost celebrated the birth of his first child this week to widespread attention across the fanbase. He had been a wreck in Dallas in anticipation of the pregnancy, saying that it affected his playcalling and that he was ready to hand the duty over to Coach Walters.\nThe anticipation and distance were the drivers of anxiety for the Head Coach, and he has said the anxiety has completely dissolved.']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/11/what-to-watch-for-ucf-hosts-uconn-in-the-battle-formerly-known-as-the-civil-conflict/'],0.2222316563129425,0.07515989243984222,0.032815203070640564

At today’s presser we got the defense, including the face of UCF, Shaquem Griffin.\nShaquem Griffin Versus Auburns O-Line:\nMonday is a big game for Shaquem Griffin’s draft stock. It’s going to be interesting to see how he matches up against an elite offensive line like Auburns. One thing is for sure, Griffin already has the respect of The Tigers.\n“Auburn has a really good O-line, and it’s going to be a really fun experience come Monday. Just to get praise like that, it means a lt.\xa0 It shows that I’m doing something right,” Shaquem said humbly after being informed Austin Golson called him the best pass rusher he has faced all year.\nAll the players continued to praise Shaquem when questioned about UCF’s defense.\n“Number 18, Shaquem, he does a great job. I feel like they feed off him, his energy and passion,” Auburn wide receiver Ryan Davis commended Shaquem’s leadership.\n“They like to shoot gaps and get back in the backfield and wreak havoc. 18, it begins with him; they have other players that do it well, but it begins with him,” standout running back Kerryon Johnson stated.\n\xa0\nDealing with Kerryon Johnson \nAuburns junior running back has been their focal point this year. Kerryon Johnson has rushed for over 1300 yards, on 5 yards per carry, adding in 19 total touchdowns. Slowing him down would play a huge role in a UCF victory New Year’s Day.\n“He definitely presents a lot of issues, and I have nothing but the most respect for him. The whole scheme is going to present problems for the linebackers, the defensive backs.\xa0 But in this kind of game, when you have a lot of time to prepare, I think it’s about us,” Coach Chinander said in front of his defensive leader.\n“Watching him on film, he can make good cuts and break tackles, so as a defense, you have to really rally to the ball and make sure we support each other,” Shaquem followed up with his usually togetherness, family oriented, response.\n“He’s an NFL guy, so I think we need to gang-tackle him, I think it’s going to take effort every play just bringing him down,” AAC hero Tre Neal said.\n\xa0\nAdjustments\nAs most of you know UCF’s defense has struggled in recent games, giving up 1,406 yards in the last two games. Some major changes will need to be made if UCF plans to compete on Monday.\n“Memphis was the No. 2 team in the country on offense coming into the football game and USF is a good football team as well.\xa0 We made some adjustments.\xa0 They exploited some things in the scheme that we haven’t seen before,” Coach Chinander said, downplaying the poor play of his defense the past couple weeks.\n“I don’t know if we adjusted.\xa0 The last couple games, we made metal errors, and we went back and fixed those,” Jamiyus Pittman relayed Chinander message with confidence.\n“You have to make adjustments as the season goes on because you know, offenses kind of copy cat each other.\xa0 If one team hits you with this or that and it’s successful, the next week you’re probably going to getting it, too,” standout linebacker Pat Jasinski on the adjustments football calls for week to week.\nAuburns size\nAuburn plays in the big bad SEC, and the size that they are going to bring is worrisome to UCF.\xa0 It’s unclear if UCF will be able to keep up in the trenches.\xa0 UCF’s players don’t seem concerned.\n“Sizing up somebody I don’t think, is the most important thing.\xa0 If you can play, you can play.\xa0 It doesn’t really matter how big you are.\xa0 It’s what happens on the field and in between the lines,” Pat Jasinski with some inspiring words for anyone in the world who is under sized.\n“They put on their pads and pants the same way we do.\xa0 It’s football.\xa0 It’s two different types of football, but it’s still football,” Tre Neal said about the differences in the style of play of the two conferences.', 'ATLANTA, Ga. – UCF football defensive coordinator Eric Chinander and linebacker Shaquem Griffin spoke to media on day two of press conferences in Downtown Atlanta.\nHere’s what the pair had to say looking back not only on the dream season of 2017 but also the transition from the 0-12 season two years ago:\n\nStay tuned with Knight News for more on the 50th CFA Peach Bowl right here in Atlanta.']","['https://knightnews.com/2017/12/auburns-size-versus-ucfs-speed-and-finesse-knights-notebook/', 'https://knightnews.com/2017/12/shaquem-griffin-talks-dream-season-and-auburn-challenges-this-weekend/']",0.16323670372366905,0.17230365797877312,0.10764709208160639
