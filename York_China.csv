I want to understand better the underlying issues that have caused labour relation issues in the past.”\nNew rounds of negotiations and consultations will be taking place throughout the coming weeks.\nA failure to come to an agreement regarding bargaining and negotiations in November 2008 resulted in classes being cancelled and campus shutting down for the duration.

PIPPIN LEE\nWhile York’s director of food services Anthony Barbisan said the $7.5-million contract has provided York with funding to run student organizations and provide stadium upgrades, there is no desire on the university’s part to pursue another exclusive contract.\n“We have no appetite to pursue another agreement,” confirms Barbisan. “We’ve chosen not to pursue it based on community feedback […] the campus retailers will be in charge of their own beverage supply.”\nUp until the contract expiration date, on-campus merchants were not allowed to sell beverages competing with brands owned by Pepsi.\nIced tea sold on campus had to be Lipton Brisk; water, Aquafina; energy drinks, Gatorade.\nThis leaves the fate of the numerous vending machines across campus in question.\n“I’m not sure what will be\xa0happening to them, but the food vendors won’t be affected [by the contract ending],” says York Federation of Students (YFS) president Vanessa Hunt. “The benefit to students will be that they will have the option of more than one brand of beverages on campus.

It will be determined at that time whether the provided evidence is substantial enough to proceed to trial.\nWhen questioned on the status of his client, Dickson’s lawyer Robert Nuttall replies that “nobody likes to be locked up on a first-degree murder charge.”\n\nDickson — who once attended York and was part of the McLaughlin College Council — was charged in connection with the death of international student Qian ‘Necole’ Liu in April.\nLiu was found dead in her basement apartment home in the Village with no signs of trauma or sexual assault, despite being unclothed from the waist down.\nLiu’s parents collected her remains following the autopsy and funeral service.\nDickson made a brief appearance in court August 16.

This training is essential so that staff don’t go wild.”\nShoukri admits that despite speculations the goSAFE program would be scaled back, the program will continue to remain on campus and may even evolve further as safety measures are put in place.\n“I know I have heard about how the university is held liable with goSAFE, but I am committed that this service will continue to exist and will be expanded,” he says. “Legalities aside, our number one issue is the safety and security of our campus.”\nShoukri also says further safety efforts are under way in the Village.\n“I’m counting a lot on the Town and Gown Committee that we created, which involves representatives of the municipal government and the university staff,” he said. “We want to put pressure on the city to make sure they’re implementing their bylaws.”\nRead More: What do students have to say about this issue?\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMike Sholars\nEditor-in-Chief\nAs of September 12, the Michaelangelo’s food stand located in the Fine Arts Building will reopen as a Starbucks.\nThe stand closed for good at the end of April, marking the end of a business that had operated in that same location for over 20 years.\nThe Fine Arts Building will see more lattes and less lasagna. PIPPIN LEE\nAnthony Barbisan, director of food services, says the decision was based on the results of surveys conducted over the past two years to gauge student interest for new food opportunities on campus.\nAlthough the Fine Arts location is under new ownership, the main Michaelangelo’s cafeteria in the basement of Atkinson is still going strong.\nAtillio Perrone, who has co-owned both locations with business partner Miguel Arce since 1999, says he was surprised to receive the closure notice late last April. He says he was under the impression the location was on track for a contract extension and possible renovations.\nDue to significantly lower amounts of foot tra\x10ffic, the Michaelangelo’s Fine Arts stand usually shuts down every summer.\n“All of a sudden, they said ‘the Dean wants the Starbucks there, and that’s all there is to it,’” Perrone says. He cites a string of possible reasons for the delays, such as the 2008 strike. “They’ve been putting off my contract renewal for three years.”\nBarbisan confirms Perrone and Arce were notified late April. He\xa0notes such a time frame is standard for establishments that close during the summer.\nPetal Foods, the corporation that oversees Michaelangelo’s, will remain in their Atkinson location until the end of the 2011–2012 school year, confirms Barbisan. At that point, “an open proposal bidding for the location” will take place, he says.\n“We’ll be consulting with the community [on this matter],” says Barbisan on the process of potentially choosing a replacement establishment for the location.\nHe says that, alongside everyone else, Arce and Perrone would be welcome to bid for the new contract for the Atkinson space.\nNow with just one property to concentrate on, Perrone and Arce are exploring new ways to bring business to their Atkinson location. Perrone discussed plans from hosting Frosh Week events to hosting dances and pub nights.\nThey are optimistic that they are offering something hard to come by on campus: real Italian food.\n“Where else can you get that?” asks Perrone. “We feel that we’ve been treated unfairly. It’s like we’ve had our legs taken out from under us.”\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nThough students are beginning to settle on and off campus for the new school year, the university is seeing a decline in student residence applications, raising questions of further potential residence closures.\nStong Residence. PIPPIN LEE\n“It’s clear that residence applications are dropping, so the number of students living in residence is decreasing heavily,” says vp students Rob Tiffin. “Which is, of course, what happened with Founders [residence].”\nAfter the closure of Founders residence last year, the university commissioned a report dealing with housing at York. This report will be available to the public mid-September.\nWith the construction of the York subway stop, he explains, students would have even more housing options available to them on and off campus.\n“[Our next step] is a consultation process that will review the demand of housing at York and housing in general from every angle possible,” says Rob Castle, senior advisor to the vp finance and administration at York.\nHe elaborates that a consultation process must occur before any decisions are made regarding residence closure.\nCastle confirmed no residences will close this year.\n“The rumors that residences will be closing is really just a case of bad broken telephone,” Castle says.\nWinters Residence. PIPPIN LEE\nPresident Shoukri also confirmed that the university was not considering any residence closures.\n“Just to be clear here, this rumour is totally unfounded.” he says. “I don’t know where this rumour is coming from. That said […] I’m concerned with the long-term interest of the university. Residence is very important, and […] we need to create an environment that will keep the students here.” He explains that he has asked finance and administration to complete a long-term review of residences at York.\nNevertheless, assistant director of residence life Ian Crookshank, who reviews residence life at York, admits residence closure “might be something [the university] is considering.”\n“The complex one area residences [like Stong and Winters] have a high deferred maintenance cost,” says Crookshank, referring to the high costs associated with keeping the residences open.\nHowever, he cites the importance of residence buildings in student experience and student life.\n“If the university does close residences it will have a huge impact […] students receive a network of friends and support from residence dons and co-ordinators,” says Crookshank.\nVarious housing options will continue to become available to students as the subway construction continues, says Chris Wong of the York University Development Corporation (YUDC).\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nCompiled by News Department\nYork’s new shuttle buses—implemented as part of a safety initiative for students living in the off-campus Village residential area—will be available in the fall semester.\n\nThe shuttle buses, which carry up to 60 passengers per shuttle, leave Vari Hall and take a 20-minute express route or an east and west route that serves 11 designated stops and two additional request-only stops in the Village. The east and west routes will depart every half-hour, and the express will depart every 15 minutes with the last departure from Vari Hall being at 1:40 a.m.\nThrough the east and west routes will not operate during holidays and weekends, the shuttle will still be running during these times.

One in a hundred Canadians will experience epilepsy at some point in their life, so the support is becoming ever crucial. With that in mind, Torontonians got the chance to guiltlessly watch as all kinds of street performers put their lives at risk (so long as they pitched in a donation).\nScotiabank’s 12th annual BuskerFest was more than just entertainment this year; this time around it was more aesthetically pleasing and thoughtfully artistic than ever. Here’s a compilation of interesting performances.\nClose Acts, XL Insects. LESLIE ARMSTRONG\nChildren crying, teens pointing and laughing, and adults snapping their digital SLRs at the whole scene. The XL Insects, a roaming performance act originating in the Netherlands with the Close Acts theater company, swarmed the streets in front of the Flat Iron building, terrorizing and fascinating with their silver bug eyes and their brightly coloured red and blue bodies. They screeched and dipped their menacing pincers into the sea of people who were just trying to cross the street to use the washroom facilities. Think Cloverfield — but substitute pesky flies in place of gigantic spiders.\nPyromancer. LESLIE ARMSTRONG\nWe all have a pyromaniac friend out there, but Pyromancer is what happens when that friend gets a little out of hand. Also from the Netherlands, our subject hopped around the stage in a majestic gold cloak, muttering unintelligibly in Dutch, and projecting flames from his mouth. He kept the flame alive by spitting what seemed to be straight vodka (hopefully not lighter fluid) into his fires. The show was finishing, and just as we were about to label him a nutcase, he charmed us by blowing fire-kisses to the crowd.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nChalky. LESLIE ARMSTRONG\nNot so flashy and overbearing like many of the other performances, our very own Canadian from Ottawa, Chalky, sat on the sidewalk, reproducing famous historic portraits using nothing but chalk (you guessed it). The result is a smooth, well-blended depiction of the real thing, and all from a man who looks like he could be one of the spectators, clad modestly in cargo shorts and a t-shirt. Chalky’s art will stand the test of time, but unfortunately, not the test of rain showers and pigeon droppings.\nKate Mior.

City council is simply trying to find what services are essential to Torontonians and to find efficiencies.”\nAlastair Woods, vp campaigns and advocacy for the York Federation of Students (YFS), agrees city service cuts—especially to transit and bike lanes—will have a huge impact on students.\n“We have a lot of students who travel from all ends of the city,” he says. “Any cuts to the TTC—whether it be in routes or whether it be in the number of times [buses] come or whether it be in the actual infrastructure—will end up hurting students in the end.”\nFourth-year York student Sean Dimnik depends on his bicycle to get around the city. The notion of less bike lanes worries him.\n“It would limit my mobility,” he says. “My primary resource is my bike in terms of transportation.”\nWoods also addresses the concerns of students who rely on childcare.\n“I think the common misconception is that students are 18 or 19 years old and don’t always have kids to take care of,” he says, “but that’s not entirely true.”\nTanya McFayden, vp gender issues for the Graduate Students Association, has a child in the Lee Wiggins Childcare Centre at York.\n“I know many people in my life with children who end up putting them in childcare they don’t feel comfortable with,” she says. “They put them into unlicensed daycares and into home daycares simply because they need a spot and they have to work.”\nIf she didn’t have a spot, says McFayden, she would not be able to pursue her graduate studies.\nHudson says the massive outcry from residents across the city has resulted in city council delaying some service cuts, such as those to public libraries.\n“[People] here today are demonstrating for two reasons: one is a bit of a celebration because it looks like some of the cuts that were on the table […] before have been delayed or will be, at the very least.”\nHowever, Palacio believes there won’t be any radical changes.\n“[In reality], there won’t be any closures to city libraries in Toronto […] and the city is still going to provide daycare services,” he explains. “What we’re asking is simply for the province to subsidize the additional funding that we need to provide the 2000 additional spaces [to daycare].”\n“The main thing is that we’re in a crisis right now, and we have a chronic financial problem and deficit of $470 million dollars,” Palacio points out. “In the last administration, nothing was done. But this administration has taken the fortitude to stand up to the challenge and get a review of city financing.”\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nTamara Khandaker\nStaff Writer\nAs the memories of Frosh Week 2011 fade away, groups of students participating in a campus walking tour have the chance to learn about the “unofficial” side of York.\nDisOrientation 2011, a week-long series of events organized by the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG) and their allied organizations, attempts to introduce students to the political history of York. The event, which serves as an alternative to traditional orientation, centres around issues of social and environmental justice.\nThe Radical Walking Tour, the first event, took students on a walk through campus, focusing on places of political significance at York.\n“We start off by looking at the governing structure and how York is managed,” says tour guide Imran Kaderdina. York’s mission statement “speaks of having a community that values freedom, social justice, and accessible education, but those are not always upheld by the university through its actions.”\nKaderdina also explains where many of York’s building names came from.\n“The buildings are often named the way they are because of donations, which come with strings [attached] that many students don’t know about,” he says.\nParticipants ranged from students to faculty to community members.\n“It’s a pretty diverse group,” says Aruna Boodram, volunteer and programming coordinator at OPIRG York. “I’d say it’s for people who want to learn more about the issues happening around their community and around the world.”\nViola Huang immersed herself in DisOrientation activities all week—including the walking tour and a screening of Slingshot Hip Hop, a film presented by the Toronto Palestine Film Festival—and hopes other students will show more interest in politics.\n“I can understand this indifference to a certain degree when I think of all the busy schedules students have here,” says Huang. “I think it is pivotal for students themselves to get engaged in politics, to know what’s going on, and to educate themselves.”\nKaderdina also believes it is important for students to be engaged in campus politics.\n“I think it’s impossible for students to stay politically neutral,” says Kaderdina. “If the students aren’t engaging with the university, they are essentially supporting the status quo.”\nDisOrientation events—which include workshops, film screenings, and a free concert—are being held every day until October 1.\nForthcoming are a workshop on the decriminalization of sex work, a discussion on Canadian immigration, and a workshop on alternative media.\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nHufsa Tahir \nStaff Writer\nAlmost a month after it was taken down by York management for “health and sanitary reasons” a new Goddess of Democracy statue may soon see the light of day.\nThe York University Student Centre (YUSC) has allocated a spot for the new statue—which commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre in China—near the Treats Coffee Emporium located in the Student Centre.\nDesign plans are currently being developed by Bruce Parsons, fine arts professor at York.\n“I’m working on six or seven drawings right now,” Parsons reveals. Once done, he says, the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC) will decide on the best one before a design plan is reviewed and approved by the Student Centre.\nThe height of the statue, Parsons adds, will depend on cost. Bronze, the preferred material, costs more than alternatives like aluminum. Though there are cheaper and quicker alternatives, he feels they will not be a creative, long-lasting solution.\nCheuk Kwan of the TADC is hoping a bronze statue will be approved.\n“The Goddess of Democracy is the most symbolic icon of the Tiananmen Massacre,” he says. “Thus, it must be both prominent and identical to the original, both conditions laid down by the TADC to emphasize the statue’s historical significance. It can’t just be any art piece [or] abstract statue of remembrance.”\nParsons estimates construction may take up to six months.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJeson Khan\nContributor\nIf there is anything to remember about the Nas concert at York, it’s that Nas never disappoints—and when he does, he makes up for it.\nNas was initially a no-show due to illness at the Yorkfest concert scheduled for September 21. This was not much of a surprise to some York students.\n“I was actually expecting him not to come,” says first-year biochemistry student Ali Khan. “This man is a legend. He is like the walking Jesus of New York, and [if he doesn’t] show up in Toronto and specifically at York University […] you can expect that.”\nRegardless, Khan and other students went to the concert on Wednesday to see other artists, including Shawn Desman and Danny Fernandes.\nWhen it was announced that Nas would be unable to perform, many students began to leave, recalls Zuha Vance, first-year biomedical student.\n“The organizers informed us that Nas wasn’t coming, and everyone left,” she says. “Like ‘screw that’ […] it [was] raining.”\nThe following day, Nas tweeted “#Yorku sorry about yesterday, I was ill. BUT Fri 23 Sept I will def be there at #Rexall @yorkfest2011 @YFSlocal68” informing followers of his intention to hold a “Redemption” concert.\nDespite the initial fall-through, the York Federation of Students (YFS), which organized the concert event, was determined to get Nas to perform at York.\n“We had to make sure those students got to see Nas,” explains Monirul Pathan, vp campus life. “Within roughly 13 hours, we did a lot of concert class talks, and making sure the word went out\n[…] we had to manage space, security, and venue. It was quite hectic.”\nAlmost 3,000 people attended the make-up concert.\nAs student Khan puts it, the concert itself was “insane”.\n“He is a legend; you got a legend.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nSamantha Osaduke\nStaff Writer\nDespite being over 20 kilometres apart, York and Ryerson University have entered into a partnership this fall to exchange grad school students for select studies.\nThe Reciprocal Interdisciplinary Studies Opportunity will allow York’s Osgoode Hall Law School students to take courses at the Yeates School of Graduate Studies at Ryerson, and vice-versa.\nThe exchange—which will combine York’s legal expertise and Ryerson’s applied education—will be launching this fall semester. A limited number of students each semester will be allowed to enrol in courses at the host university, but will pay tuition to their home university.\nThough the courses are complementary, Ronda Bessner, assistant dean of the JD Program at Osgoode, encourages students to take advantage of the opportunity and the expertise of the partner university.\n“A maximum of five students [from each institution] each semester from Osgoode and from Ryerson-Yeates will be permitted to enrol in designated courses,” she notes.\nSelected students will be allowed to register for up to one full year or two half-year courses from a list and will get transfer credits based on a “pass” or “fail” on their transcript.\nOsgoode students are impressed by the new exchange and commend the positive addition.\n“Given that a law degree is so transferable, it definitely makes sense to give students access to some other areas of study that are likely to have some crossover with law,” says first-year law student Laura Fraser.\nHowever, she doesn’t think commuting downtown is practical for her.\n“I can’t see myself enrolling in Ryerson courses just because of the proximity issue, “ Fraser says. “Being at York all day, I don’t know how feasible it would be to commute all the way downtown for a single credit.”\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nCatch up on what’s going on this month in just 90 seconds!\nRead by Editor-in-Chief Mike Scholars\nProduced by Multimedia Editor Philip Darlington\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThis is what we do at Excalibur – an insider look into Excalibur’s weekly operation.\nFeaturing all editors at Excalibur Publications\nProduced by Phil Darlington, Multimedia Editor', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMultimedia Editor Philip Darlington recalls his experience at Cirque du Soleil’s TOTEM, an aerial acrobatics show that illustrates the story of the birth and evolution of the world.\nProduced by Philip Darlington, Multimedia Editor', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nThe Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O) released a report card last week grading each party based on promises and platforms, giving the New Democrat Party (NDP) the highest grade of B+ overall. The NDP took top marks for its promises on tuition fees, student debt, funding, and research.\nThe Liberal party, however, maintains that the attractive planks of the NDP platform have not been properly accounted for.\nAccording to a media release sent out on September 26, the Liberals state that “according to the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the NDP have promised that, if elected, they will raise the per-student funding to more than the national average. That’s a $1-billion promise. Every year. But in the costing document the NDP released yesterday, there wasn’t a single penny set aside to back up that promise.”\n\nChairperson for the CFS-O Sandy Husdon, however, points out that all parties have made unfounded promises, and that this doesn’t change the NDP’s grade on the report.\n“What the NDP stated to us when they made that promise was that, if elected, they would talk to each of the institutions about what kind of funding shortfall they have and what kind of funding they need and to develop a framework to get that money to the institutions,” she says.\nOverall, Hudson says the goal of the CFS-O report cards are to “boil down […] what the crux of these parties really are.”\n“We think it’s really important for students to know how the election will be affecting them, and what kinds of things can and might change as a result of the election.”\n\xa0\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/09/28/goddess-of-democracy-returning-to-campus/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nHufsa Tahir \nStaff Writer\nAlmost a month after it was taken down by York management for “health and sanitary reasons” a new Goddess of Democracy statue may soon see the light of day.\nThe York University Student Centre (YUSC) has allocated a spot for the new statue—which commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre in China—near the Treats Coffee Emporium located in the Student Centre.\nDesign plans are currently being developed by Bruce Parsons, fine arts professor at York.\n“I’m working on six or seven drawings right now,” Parsons reveals.

Eke.\nNo one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.\nWhat parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.\nRoom 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.\nFrom the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.\nThe campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.\nHer pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off. \xa0Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.\nShe heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”\n“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”\n“No, she never goes anywhere.”\n“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”\n“Did you notice in English lecture…?”\nEke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.\n“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.\nShe blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.\nDuring her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.\n“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.\n“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”\nAt six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.\nHis arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.\nEke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.\nJoining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.\nBut this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.\n“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.\nWith her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.\n“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.\nHer hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.\nKnock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.\nThe door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.\n“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”\n“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.\n“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.\n“Do I know you, girl?” he said.\nShe grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nKezia-Danielle Weerasooriya\nContributor\n\nCozy contentment seeps through\xa0the night as cars slosh along the slick streets. Mom sits at the dining room table with a phone pressed to one of her large ears. She runs through a list of birthday guests, talking loudly in her overexcited Filipino way. The warm wind flutters the blinds and the smell of cassava cake drifts under my nose. The TV blares from the living room. My eight-year-old sister Naomi—Ate, meaning big sister in Tagalog—makes arts and crafts upstairs. I play with my sister Jillian, who will turn three tomorrow, May 20. I will turn seven in October.\nTogether, we created a game we call “Rocketship.” I lie on my back with my arms and legs in the air, bent at strange angles, like a dead beetle. Jill clambers onto my shins, pressing her feet against mine and holding my hands for balance. Her long, thick hair tickles my arms. Her small hands are squishy and her brown eyes are bright.\n“One, two, three!” I say, and catapult her off of me onto the green and white linoleum. She lands clumsily on her bum.\n“Again!” Jill beams, her teeny teeth gleaming. She climbs onto the launch pad and prepares for blast off. I count.\n“It should be backwards,” she says matter-of-factly.\n“Yeah, okay. But that means you should be backwards, too,” I say. This time I hold her feet and she holds mine. “Ready?

Mom pats us both.\n“Now go get ready por bed!” she says.\nJill and I pivot and bolt out of the kitchen, streaking through the dim living room between the huge TV and a dozing Dad. His moustache quivers. We galumph up the grey-carpeted stairs on all fours like dogs. The china cabinet rattles. We enter my room and flop onto my small bed, which creaks and groans under the weight of two bodies. Posters of puppies cover my walls. I shift aside a heap of blankies and stuffed animals and lie down in the dead beetle position. Then I fling Jill off my legs and she soars through the air before she lands on her knees at the foot of my bed. She throws her hands out in front of her, her face dangerously close to the rails. My purple Doodle Bear fixes her with its button-eyed stare.\n“Wait!” I say. I place a pillow beside my bear, against the white bars that almost smashed her face. “Now you have a target.”\nThis time, the rocketship lands on the landing pad. We giggle and squeal with delight.\n“ES-STOP ES-SCREAMING!” Mom yells from downstairs. We ignore her and continue our game. Jill climbs onto my legs again. This time, I hurl her off of me as hard as I can.\nTime slows down.\nThe pillow shifts.\nAnd then red spurts everywhere.\nI lock eyes with Jill, her sweet face pale and contorted and covered in blood. Her dark hair sticks to her cheeks, tangled. My eyes bulge. An infinite second of stunned silence stretches on.\nSuddenly, Ate stomps out of her room, a foam slipper in one hand. She throws out her chest importantly and irritably pouts out her lower lip.\n“Will you guys be qui—MOM!” Her eyebrows shoot up higher the longer she holds the word. I wait, frozen.\nMom is already in the doorway, her eyebrows contracted and her eyes wide and worried. Her eyes sweep over the scene, over the blood on my sheets, on my clothes, on my pillows. Blood gushes from a gap in Jill’s mouth where three of her top front teeth had been. Tears form in Mom’s eyes as she grips fistfuls of her hair and screams. She steers Jill out of the room. As if I’m sleepwalking, I shuffle down the hall after them. Dad strides into the bathroom to help clean Jill up.\nMy vision blackens and blurs as I watch the sink water turn pink. Mom lets out high-pitched, hysterical sobs. Her hands tremble as she moves around the cramped bathroom. Jill fidgets. Dad keeps his calloused brown hands steady as he slumps over Jill.\nHe wipes the smears of red from Jill’s face and puts rolls of gauze in her mouth. Dad’s eyes are weary and his curly hair has lost its shine. Jill finally starts to cry. The gauze gives her squirrel cheeks. Dad murmurs to Jill and pets her hair.\n“I kanat beleeb it. It’s nine o’clock at night and we’re going to da hospital,” Mom rages to Dad.\nI hobble back to my room and sit on the edge of my bed, dizzy and clammy and shaking. Mom follows me. She screams and scolds with unintelligible words, and I cower. Tears slip silently down my cheeks. Flecks of red splotch my Doodle Bear, complementing the blue scribbles.\nFor a long time afterwards, the three black X’s in Jill’s gums haunt me every time she smiles. The stitches float in the darkness behind my eyelids, disembodied, glowing white.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJeff Zimmer\nCopy Editor\n @copyoverlord\n\xa0\nFor those who missed it,\xa0on February 18 there was\xa0a shooting in the York\xa0community. A shot was fired inside an apartment residence on Assiniboine Road, and fortunately, the grad student inside was unharmed.\nWhat bothers me is the lack of security we have in our community. For a campus of almost 65,000—a population big enough to rival small towns—we don’t have a police department on site.\nYorkton, a tiny city located in east-central Saskatchewan with a population of roughly 17,200, has a better source of protection than students here; they have the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) nearby. It’s honestly surprising that York doesn’t have a detachment of Toronto police, given our notoriously problematic location near Jane and Finch.\nWith an active police force on campus, we would surely see a dip in crime. I acknowledge that we have the York security patrolling the entire community alone, but they cannot do this alone. With the added extension site of Toronto police, they would offer far more presence to our community.\nLet’s face it, we’re basically a city with a shopping mall, but even in my hometown of Mississauga, we have a police station—it’s located within the shopping centre of Meadowvale. Then there’s another two in the area to boot. So why can’t our community benefit from another form of protection?\nWe have the emergency towers dotting the campus and York security, and if we don’t have Batman or any similar vigilante, we should most definitely have a Toronto police branch on site.\nI don’t fear many things, but as an individual incapable of stopping bullets with my face, I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m going to fear a person with a 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Unless York offers bulletproof vests to students with our tuition, I regretfully fear that without vigilantes or armed security, our rather large community will continue to suffer through its ongoing trend of crime.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJack Hostrawser\nLouis realized he was staring. His\xa0gaze drifted through the bent spider web in the windshield, down the hood, and off into the twinkling embers on the plains below. Over the lake, another anvil flickered silently and the sun seemed to shear off the air itself. Calvin was down there, watching the coverage of his dad on TV. Louis had done a bad thing and now his son and the rest of the city were learning of it in high definition, with surround sound. Far away, his story was\ninterrupting sitcoms.\n“Now what?” he said, for the sound of it. Aluminum and iron, injectors and water pumps, all ticked and cooled beneath deep, dented green. Nothing. Nothing to say, nothing worth saying. He sat and wondered in his car on that tarmac ledge between the caves of damp coniferous and the vast potential below. He couldn’t stay here; he was prey. He’d ditched a chopper, for Christ’s sake. No one ditched the chopper.\nThe road hugged the edge of the escarpment, damming up the heavy moss of the forest. The moaning trees twisted in the grip of the cold front, pushing the storms east. A dandelion seed barrelled in through the window and settled on the dashboard. It probably wanted an autograph.\nSoon he realized that he needed to piss. He might have held it all day—he hadn’t been paying attention. He slithered from the car, his cartilage creaking as the rear strut did. The sheet metal there deflected inwards to conjure police-issue ram bars. He tried to cross the wire fence that girdled the ditch but it was loose with age and wavered as he stood\non it. He imagined falling and shooting himself and the image brought hints of irony to his mouth.\nHe’d never owned a pistol, and he was wary of it. He also noted that wedging it in the front of his pants was probably not helping, but it stayed.\nLeaping, he pushed his foot into the post and it crumbled under his soles. He started to swear then hit the ground hard. Finishing the curse and tossing in several others, he brushed the mud and needles from his hands, revealing the fine wisps of scarlet meteors across the butt of his palm. The throbbing pain along his side persisted but he repressed it, breathing deep to pull in the howl of the wind and chill the blood that wept from his hand, stigmata of an unconvincing Christ.\nHe moved into the forest until the rush of it surrounded him. If the car were spotted, he at least wouldn’t be caught with his fly down. By now, the warmth of his body had begun to flow back into the grip of the pistol and the metal seemed to fuse with skin until he pulled it out to avoid shooting his dick off.\nAs the sodden evening shivered, he loitered. The smells of exhaust, gunsmoke, and blood were gone from his nose but they were dusted across his brain. And suddenly he was strolling in the woods.\nSitting on a dry log, he thought about smiling and stared some more. The storm had saved him\nearlier. Lucky break. Now the humid air chilled him and drew his thoughts to warmer places. He thought about shooting himself, for prudence’s sake. There wasn’t really a choice but he held up the gun anyway, taking it in his hand and cycling the action. The unused bullet flew silently into the moss. As he levelled the sights, the setting sun risked a glance through the ragged clouds and dripping leaves, igniting the crooked birch and forging little diamonds on its paper dress. Fate, babe. Bang.\nThere were holes in the back of the Mustang. Little ones where the patrolman had aimed. He doubted that it was protocol to open fire during high-speed pursuits, but the holes had no comment. He had a thought and dove to the pavement to check for leaks: clear, red, green, brown. Now would be too soon—he’d made it this far and he wasn’t done yet. Satisfied, he wiped the oily road water from his palms and lowered himself back into the leather bucket seat.\n“You’re still with me, right?” He was talking to a car. The breeze sent the little fluff of dandelion flying out the window. Some sign.\nCalvin had called the Mustang Stacy. He realized again that he hadn’t said goodbye.

In fact, half of those students were taking extra years to finish their studies.\nSome York students, like sixth-year theatre and English student Garett Oliver, disagreed with the idea of a three-year undergraduate degree program, saying that the quality of education would only suffer as a result.\n“That hasn’t really worked in the past,” he says. “They did it with high school by removing grade 13. It’s looking at it more as getting a piece of paper with your name on it saying whatever program you’re in rather than actually learning something, which should be the function of post-secondary education.”\nOn the other hand, several students commented in favour of\xa0a condensed three-year undergraduate program, saying they would rather jump-start their careers and save some cash on the way.\n“It would be done faster. I can get out of here and start my career. I’m a musician,” says Cecile Eugene, a third-year music major. “As soon as I’m done, I can get on the road and tour. But because it’s a four-year program, I have to stay here for four years instead of three. Plus, all these extra courses\xa0I have to take—like humanities and social science—won’t help me be a musician.”\nSome students have actually seen how the three-year programs work overseas, and are quite taken to the idea. Venessa Lao, a second-year accounting student, sees the move as a good thing for students. She says that in countries like Australia, a lot of her friends finish\xa0their studies abroad in three years.\n\xa0“It would be a benefit for students financially,” she says. “I have friends who are basically taking loans that they have to pay off the minute they graduate.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nBut who ended up with the harder job?\nHufsa\xa0Tahir\nStaff Writer\n @excalweb\nPresident Mamdouh Shoukri swapped his suit and tie for a letterman jacket and backpack, joining the throngs of students on the Square One GO bus to York. This day marked York’s—and Canada’s—first-ever President for a Day event.\nThe lucky York student who won a day in Shoukri’s presidential seat is Rabia Sajun, a third-year biochemistry and education student whose winning contest entry included three ideas for improving student life: expanding Steacie Library, reducing class sizes, and enhancing campus safety.\n“It’s been super busy,” Sajun describes her day. “I’ve been in a lot of meetings. I met vp Rob Tiffin about disability. I’m interested in accessibility services for all students. I met vp Brewer about campus safety.”\nShe also talked to vp academic and provost Patrick Monahan about class sizes, and about improving student engagement in classrooms.\nWhile Sajun sat through several meetings, Shoukri spent his day in a lecture on molecular biology and in a physics lab. Sajun serves as the co-president of the Chemistry Society, and Shoukri sat in for her office hours, selling students old lecture notes and professor-approved sample copies of old tests for $15 a packet.\n“I’ve had a chance to talk to students there, learn more about the university and about their concerns,” he says.\nThe one negative of the day for Shoukri, however, was when he visited a very crowded Student Centre for lunch. The lineup for the microwaves especially dismayed him.\n“I wouldn’t do that if I was a student. I’d give up on warm food,” he remarks. “To be honest, maybe building a new Student Centre will take time, but doing something about the microwaves should not.”\nFor Shoukri, the event was a way of engaging with the student population, something that he didn’t expect would happen on such a high level.\n“Fact is, I walk through campus all the time and talk to lot of students,” says Shoukri. “But they want to talk to me more now, probably because I’m not wearing a suit, I’m wearing this—” he gestured to his letterman jacket—“They’re probably more comfortable seeing me trying to reach out to them.”\nSajun highly approves of the President for a Day campaign and believes it should be a recurring event.\n“I think this idea was a really interesting experience to get a behind-the-scenes look into what is involved in implementing something,” she says. “The admin is doing its best to better student life, and this gives students a better behind-the-scenes look.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n“There’s been a terrific increase in interest this year” -McMillan\nJacqueline\xa0Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\n@jackieperlin\nThe world-famous TEDx talks are about to begin their second round at York.\nThe Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED) Conference is set to take place March 10 at York’s Glendon campus.\nThe talks are part of a number of globally-occurring conferences that are owned by the private not-for-profit Sapling Foundation, which began in 1984 and aims at addressing a number of issues within science and culture.\n“There’s been a terrific increase in interest this year,” says Ross McMillan, one of the co-curators of the event.\nMcMillan adds that the event has already received many more applications from students eager to participate in the talks than the 100 spots available.\nSome of the speakers set to present at York include a student talking about her research on domestic violence and aboriginal women, and a York vice-president presenting his take on how universities are changing to meet the demands of the future. Past presenters in the talks include figures such as Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, though they were not at York campus.\nAll speeches fall within the overall theme of this year’s conference, “Impact Matters.” Speakers are encouraged to highlight their stories about making differences in their communities.\nRoss calls the event a “one day symposium,” where participants will spend the entire day listening to the twelve speakers and watching two performances.\n“It’s really a cross-section of the York community,” says McMillan, who notes that organizers are looking to cultivate an audience from all walks of life that can not only attend, but also engage in talks with other participants who they would not normally interact with.\nThe last day to send in an application is February 29.

For her, the actions of the university are impeding upon the negotiation process causing no agreements on key proposals.\n“Without this leverage, we are concerned that the Employer will continue to stall through conciliation, talking in circles while our contracts continue to be eroded by inflation,” states the update. “Rather, the Employer’s stance remains unchanged: reduce your\xa0demands to fi t within our financial mandate and maybe then we can talk on some of these issues,” it continues.\nRobert Castle, senior advisor\xa0to vp fi nance and administration,\xa0is adamant that the university is\xa0doing everything in its power to\xa0reach an agreement with the union\xa0and says that negotiations thus far\xa0have been positive.\n“We’ve had good work done\xa0with the union,” he says.\nCastle notes that the university\xa0received over 170 proposals from\xa0the union in November of last\xa0year, so it is only reasonable that\xa0the process is taking time.\n“There’s been a lot of work done\xa0through our negotiations […] it’s\xa0hard to see how we’re not taking\xa0this situation seriously,” he says.\nCastle also says the university is\xa0pleased to go into the conciliation\xa0process.\n“We’re perfectly happy going\xa0into conciliation and we don’t\xa0see the conciliator as leveraging\xa0for either party. It’s a third party\xa0independent voice to help us to\xa0get to an agreement,” he says,\xa0adding that the university does in\xa0fact expect a detailed review and\xa0discussion of all the proposals.\nOnce a conciliator is appointed\xa0by the Ministry, the individual will\xa0reach out to both parties to continue\xa0with the negotiation process.\xa0Nevertheless, CUPE says that\xa0having a strike mandate does not\xa0mean that the union will strike.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/arts/2012/02/29/the-professor/'],"['Damian Mangat\nStaff writer\nShe could blame her name, her first name. Eke.\nNo one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.\nWhat parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.\nRoom 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.\nFrom the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.\nThe campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.\nHer pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off. \xa0Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.\nShe heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”\n“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”\n“No, she never goes anywhere.”\n“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”\n“Did you notice in English lecture…?”\nEke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.\n“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.\nShe blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.\nDuring her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.\n“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.\n“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”\nAt six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.\nHis arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.\nEke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.\nJoining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.\nBut this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.\n“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.\nWith her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.\n“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.\nHer hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.\nKnock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.\nThe door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.\n“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”\n“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.\n“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.\n“Do I know you, girl?” he said.\nShe grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.\n ']"

The ancient Greeks considered libraries to be “healing places of the soul.”\nLiterature is a worldwide phenomenon that developed differently over time and regions, but there is one concept that unifies them all—the belief in the power of words and poetry to treat and heal people.\nAristotle discussed the concepts of using poetry for both insight and catharsis, referring to its ability to condense and state things that we usually would not speak of in daily conversation. Sigmund Freud wrote: “Not I, but the poet discovered the unconscious.”\nHe was a keen advocate of symbolism, which is used quite widely in poetry and its ability to refer to the much more abstract concepts of thought in an almost tangible form.\nPoetry is still being used as an effective tool in cognitive therapy for helping patients cope with their psychological issues, having been found to be effective in treating elderly people who suffer from dementia.\nIn an article published in the Journal of Poetry Therapy, Marvin Wexler found that in older populations, memorization of poetry has been shown to prevent dementia and slow down the onset of Alzheimer’s.\nRhymes and jingles are more effective because their cadence is easier for the elderly to pick out and remember. In nursing homes, the act of regularly reading poetry to seniors and having them participate in rhymes and songs generally had a positive influence on subjects who exhibited symptoms of mental illness.\nWriting poetry from the point of view of a person’s mental illness as if it were a person allows them to view their depressogenic beliefs in a more detached manner. This is not to say that poetry in and of itself is enough to aid in complete healing and full recovery, but rather that it promotes better mental health.\nPoetry also helps the elderly recall past experiences, in turn helping them with memory and integration.\nFor a person with Asperger’s Syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder, who is more of a visual thinker, poetry can be used to help them visualize communicative issues through metaphors. This helps them understand and act upon matters that they can improve on.\nMany of us memorized poems in our early years and for good reason: poetry has been shown to improve children’s reading capabilities, memorization abilities, development of potential for self-expression, as well as an understanding of rhythm and bring about emotional intelligence.\nPoetry provides the antidote to a culture that is constantly racing against time and discarding anything found to not be useful. At a time where the aged are being put in nursing homes and left behind, it serves as a soothing balm in its need to be slowly read in order to be absorbed and understood, its deep philosophical approach to life and its relevance to the vast array of emotions these elderly have experienced throughout their lifetime.\n“When I read poetry it unlocks a different part of my brain. The reason being is that I have to look within to understand what the words mean,” says Fatema Ali, a third-year biology student. Poetry can help make logical and figurative connections, forcing them to actively think, which may help with memory disorders and impaired reasoning.\nSome say that poetry is now becoming extinct in a culture where modern technology is being consumed at an increasing rate. But if one looks at the other side of the coin, the influx of technology, especially mass communication and social media, has greatly expanded the extent to which poetry can be shared and read. Social networking sites such as Tumblr and Instagram have many accounts completely dedicated to poetry. In a way, social media is both the problem and the answer, as it is now much easier to access poetry online and virtually anywhere.\nThe beauty of poetry as a promoter of mental health stems from its volatile nature. It can be imbibed and etched into one’s memory, yet developed and produced in a simple form by someone who desires to create it. It can also function as a powerful symbol through metaphors and conveys stories in its own unique form.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nWhen you step into an art show, it’s like stepping into another world.\nThat’s what Marcia Villeneuve evokes with her art show Surreal Spaces. Recipient of the 2016 Willowdale Group of Artists Painting Award, which is awarded to distinguished upper-year visual arts students at York, Villeneuve is adept in creating beautiful stories through paint.\nStepping into The Gales Gallery, one isn’t quite sure what to feel as the installations are disorienting. As visitors enter the room and move from art piece to art piece, Villeneuve’s brilliance becomes evident as the space transports visitors from reality into a delightfully surreal world.\nAt first glance, the magical aura of Surreal Spaces appears to be contradictory to the minimalist style of Villeneuve’s art. The exhibit features only a few paintings slapped up onto blank white walls. Surrealist artists typically make use of unexpected juxtapositions, surprising elements and shocking reworkings of mundane objects.\nVilleneuve cleverly achieves the contradiction between philosophy and dream, and expectation and reality through the critical engagement of space.\nFor Villeneuve, surrealism takes on a different meaning, symbolizing what is not normal.\n“I like to put objects in a space that doesn’t make sense or where they don’t really belong there,” says Villeneuve.\n“Like with all the dark images, giving them properties that they wouldn’t normally have. You’d never see a rainbow tree that’s glowing at night.”\n“I get most excited about painting things that look realistic but have a surreal element,” shares Villeneuve. She sparks surrealist interest by playing with what visitors expect to experience when they enter Surreal Spaces versus what it is, resulting in a duality of transformation.\nThe stripped-down style of the exhibition forces visitors to engage more intimately with each work. The brushstrokes, colour scheme and subject choice become emphasized in the cumulative masterpiece that is Surreal Spaces.\nEven though all the paintings share a realistic theme, no two are alike. Every painting is unique because of its complex colour patterns and where it takes you. Each painting tells its own story, but depending on the eye of the beholder, that story changes.\nThe three paintings all together, referred to by Villeneuve as a triptych, is a final realization of months of hard work.\n“This triptych represents the places I call home. My entire life I have been moving back and\xa0forth between Toronto and North Bay. While they’re very different spaces, they have some similarities, including very similar beaches, so I chose to connect these two cities with an image of a beach in the centre panel.\n“I wanted to add a surreal element by making the spaces look connected as a whole while also playing with the different times of day,” said Villanueva.\nSurreal Spaces ran until Thursday, January 26, but those unable to experience the exhibit in person can visit Villeneuve’s website for an online gallery.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nSome families bond over sports, some over movies. But one thing that is known to bring people together is food. Whether homemade or takeout, dining has a way to fill our stomach with grub, our hands with new foods and our memories with new experiences.\nThat’s where Tinuno restaurant hopes to thrive.\nHailing from the northwestern Luzon region in the Philippines, Gerald Aquintey, co-owner of the restaurant, says the name Tinuno came from its direct translation from his native language of Ilocano, meaning grilled.\nMost Filipino restaurants are usually takeaway, while Tinuno encourages customers to dine in because of their unique eating style called Boodle Fight.\nBoodle Fight involves using your bare hands to eat food spread out on banana leaves. It has roots from the Filipino military, as utensils were not offered to their soldiers during Boodle Fights. Water jugs were placed on each sides of the banana leaves spread for soldiers to use to wash their hands before and after their meal. The term fight in the word indicates that every man is for himself during the feast, which means that you try to eat as much as you can before the food runs out.\nThe spread includes white rice, grilled foods and fruits piled on top of a banana leaf. It is usually set up on a long table where everyone has a space and a chance to eat as much as possible. Filipino soldiers do not start eating until they are signalled to do so.\nHowever, in Tinuno, the setting is much calmer and relaxed. Once you enter, you are greeted with a smile and are shown to a table with banana leaves spread out. You will not be forced to eat with your hands, however you are encouraged to do so. There is no signal to follow, and people do not fight each other for the food. Tinuno simply follows customary restaurant protocol where waiters bring your food to your table and place it decoratively.\nThe restaurant’s setting also successfully invites you in with its historical pictures of Filipino elders, Filipino traditional clothing, a definition of Boodle Fight and soldiers actually eating in Boodle Fight style.\nInterestingly enough, the restaurant was actually a laundromat before its Boodle Fight.\n“All the laundry started to break down, so we decided to convert it into a restaurant because it would have cost the same amount of money for us to replace the equipment,” says Aquintey.\n“The Boodle Fight was actually accidental. It wasn’t supposed to be part of the business; we were supposed to be just a take-out place. Then, a couple of [customers] requested to do Boodle here, so we did that for them, and from there, it just got big.”\nThe combination of grilled food and the Boodle Fight resulted in quite a successful restaurant.\n“The Filipino [student association at York] has come here a couple of times already,”says Aquintey.\n“So have [the Filipino student associations from] Ryerson and U of T.”\nQuickly gaining popularity, Tinuno was able to expand their space.\n“We took over one of the rooms in the second floor. We might even take over the whole building, we’ll just see how it goes,” says Aquintey.\nWith their popularity, they were also invited to be one of the food vendors for the ASEAN Festival at Ryerson, an event celebrating Southeast Asian cultures, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Laos and Thailand.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nEvery year since 2010, Bell Canada hosts a campaign with the primary goal of creating a conversation about mental health in Canada.\nIn 2012, 2.8 million Canadians over the age of 15 reported symptoms consistent with one or more mental health illnesses or substance use disorders, according to Statistics Canada.\nMany who live with mental illnesses are not vocal about their conditions because of the stigma they fear they may face.\nThe Bell Let’s Talk campaign was created with these notions in mind, and aims to educate the public on the magnitude of the problem and how they can become active listeners and supporters.\nBell will donate 5 cents towards mental health initiatives for every text, tweet or Instagram post that includes the hashtag #BellLetsTalk and for every view of their official Facebook videos. People can also participate through Snapchat by using the Bell Let’s Talk geofilter.\nAll proceeds are donated to various relevant organizations within Canada.\n“I feel like Bell Let’s Talk is more of a means to publicize than actually raising awareness. I had heard of a thing called Bell Let’s Talk but had no idea what it meant or wanted to achieve. The donation part might be legitimate but in my opinion, it isn’t effectively named. The aim of trends is to educate people who were unaware of the issue. The “ALS Ice Bucket Challenge” effectively describes what it sets out to do, whilst also raising awareness. When you hear about it, you’re curious and want to find out what it is. When you hear Bell Let’s Talk, the first thing you think is that it’s probably another one of Bell’s events.” ? Samandeep Singh | 20 | Software Engineering\n“It is important to realize that mental health is every bit as important as physical health. The isolation of mental illnesses from physical conditions like having the flu only serves to perpetuate the notion that people should be ashamed for wanting to care for their brain—their entire body’s command centre. Influential organizations should make further attempts to emulate the #BellLetsTalk campaign that fights to end the stigma while raising millions for important and necessary research.”\xa0 ? Yun Lin\xa0| 21 |\xa0Human Rights and Equity Studies\n“Bell Let’s Talk brings awareness to issues that people don’t take time to address in their daily lives. We become so engulfed in our schedules, sculpting that perfect life, that we become lost in our stress and anxieties. We forget to take care of ourselves and take a minute to reflect and acknowledge what causes the stress in our lives and what affects our mental health. Often we suffer in silence and become unknown to those around us. It is important to talk to someone. Make yourself heard and reach out for help. I think that the Bell Let’s Talk campaign helps drive these principles home.”\xa0? Suman Dhillon\xa0| 21 |\xa0English and History\n“Raising money for small organizations, or well-known organizations, doesn’t provide enough funding for it to make a positive impact. Focusing on one day does raise a type of awareness, but it just serves to promote Bell as a company. The marketing strategy and distribution could be managed [more efficiently] to provide a better mental health awareness day.”\xa0?

A police officer can always say they are investigating a particular crime,” she told the CBC.\nPolice are still able to gather personal information during routine traffic stops, when someone is being arrested, detained or when a search warrant is executed.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nMental illnesses cannot be perfectly encapsulated in words. Every breath is a cliffhanger. Not knowing what is causing these emotions is like being lost without a map. The ground is like sand, shifting under each step, ready to give way. You’re taking shots in the dark, looking for solutions anywhere—through anything. But treatment is tentative and you just want the feeling to stop. The feeling that it is always all or nothing. It is physically and mentally draining and it gets easier to sink and shatter under the weight that is holding you down, pulling you down.\nThere are some illnesses you cannot see, and often with mental illness, there is no clear visible ailment. Due to this lack of perception of immediate and physical harm, there is a stark contrast that exists between the care, treatment and understanding that is applied to mental as opposed to physical illness. There are a number of reasons why individuals may suffer with their mental health and a number of treatments available to those seeking relief. However, mental illness and mental distress extends over a wide variety of people.\nAs the number of those suffering from mental health problems continues to grow, the introduction of therapy animals, or animal-assisted therapy, progressively integrates itself into the field of mental health.\nTherapy animals are used in a number of settings, from hospitals to schools and even in the home.\nIn a therapeutic context, animals may help provide and induce comfort and companionship for people who may feel scared, overwhelmed, lonely, depressed, experiencing PTSD, anxiety or are in pain, with few to no side effects.\nPetting an animal can release hormones and endorphins in your body, such as oxytocin and serotonin, which have a calming effect, helping to lower blood pressure and stress levels. People want to connect with other living things, and human-animal interaction is a form of nonjudgmental social support.\nThis form of treatment alone could be enough for some people experiencing new symptoms of a mental health problem that they wish to combat, or it can reduce the amount of medications an individual coping with mental illness may need.\nAlthough therapy pets are most commonly dogs, almost any animal can be considered an emotional support animal and registered. Whether through pet ownership or registration of a certified service animal, these relationships may offer an antidote to the plethora of symptoms that present themselves. From rabbit to guinea pig, hedgehog to cat or horse to parrot, this form of therapy is an inclusive approach that fosters connections and serves to benefit individuals both physically and emotionally.\nAnimal companionship is often viewed as an informal source of comfort and relief, however, it is time to credit this relationship for all that it is worth. Animal-assisted therapy is an undervalued form of treatment because of its informal nature and simplicity. While the list of benefits for this alternative treatment is ever-growing, the list of side effects that are common in pharmaceutical drugs continue to persist. If there is a potential for hope and less invasive and threatening treatment options, let it exist.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\nAt one point or another, almost everyone has been in “the zone.” It’s a great feeling. Everything you do clicks: your awareness sharpens and your movements become natural—free-flowing, yet precise. You feel unstoppable. In the field of positive psychology, this is what is known as a flow state.\nWhen implemented via meditation, it is a way to take your craft to the next level.\nFirst introduced by Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his exploration of the phenomenon in Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, a flow state is most easily described as a completely focused state. Much like how a musician focuses on only the next few notes of their intricate technical piece, or how a painter loses themselves in the blending of their colours, the key to enter flow is to focus on nothing else but the immediate task at hand.\nOftentimes, flow states are achieved when the challenge of the task aligns perfectly with one’s current skill level.\nSome keystone features of flow states include a loss of reflective self-consciousness, a sense of personal control, deep harmony and peace with the environment. Studies also show that the promotion of such mind states lead to lower levels of depression and anxiety.\nHowever, prospective artists need not dive into a creative frenzy to enjoy these benefits themselves. At the heart of the flow state is actually one of the oldest and most empowering practices known to man: what is known in Buddhism as mindfulness meditation.\nOne of the central motivations behind Csikszentmihalyi’s research was the question of what exactly inspires long-lasting happiness. It wasn’t money or possessions, nor was it dependent on relationships. It was being in flow, and the longer you find yourself in this state, he concluded, the happier you are. In essence, this is the practice of mindfulness meditation: keen interest in your immediate here and now. Dancing, acting, painting and many other forms of art inspire healthy daily and mental patterns.\nIt should come as no surprise that positive psychology research also finds a direct correlation between a daily practice of meditation and improved artistic capability—promoting a whole host of mental benefits, including: enriched relaxation, greater emotional stability and clinical aid for mental disorders such as anxiety, depression or attention deficits.\nDaily meditators find that when writing, listening to music or creating art, they often lose themselves in the moment, becoming so absorbed in their work that it feels effortless, like one fluid act. This is because they have trained their mind to disconnect from their incessant stream of thinking. At its core, meditation functions to reduce irrelevant—oftentimes unwanted—thoughts by promoting internalized attention.\nThe next time you engage in any activity—artistic or otherwise—heighten your consciousness.\nBefore you know it, you will have entered into one of the most fruitful, pleasant upward spirals that will not only create some of your best work, but will also keep you in tune with your mental state.\n\nAt one point or another, almost everyone has been in “the zone.” It’s a great feeling.

To lighten up your days during the autumn, here are some new songs sure to lift your mood. From Wyclef Jean to Dvsn, I’ve compiled a playlist that will make you ponder life, but also put you in the mood to get down and groove.\nNF, “My Life”\nThe Michigan-based rapper NF continues to open up about his life on his newest album, Perception. The song “My Life” speaks to his sister about her substance abuse, which made it difficult to connect to her at a higher level. Nevertheless, his love for her is present as he continues to raise her up and motivate her to live a better life—all the while, taking listeners on a crisp, flowing wave over a hypnotizing and enchanting beat.\nGiggs, “The Essence”\nNathaniel Thompson, famously known as Giggs, continues to produce much for the world stage. Hailing from across the pond in London, England, his roots are easily recognizable and represented in his distinct sound. “The Essence,” which comes off of his most recent mixtape, Wamp 2 Dem, follows an introspective line of thinking, expanding on the situations he’s faced, the work he had to put in, and the chance breaks that enabled him to get to the position he’s in now. The production lets his story roll easily, giving you a glimpse into his life before fame.\nClairmont The Second, “Stories”\nA Toronto native based in the Weston Road area on the west side, Clairmont The Second brings a refreshing sound to the Canadian hip hop landscape. “Stories,” a track from his second album, Lil Mont from The Ave, pulls us into his hectic life. Its smooth flow over a hard beat paints a picture of the ups and downs of life—after overcoming one challenge, a new one arises.\nWyclef Jean, “Double Dutch”\nNo introduction needed—Wyclef Jean has blessed our audio experiences from his days with The Fugees and now to his independent projects. His most recent work, Carnival III: The Fall and Rise of a Refugee, does not falter under this reputation. The song “Double Dutch” builds on themes of survival, whether through illegal means, or by surviving the illegal acts governments impose on their populaces. The beat will bring you back to childhood with its cadence of two skipping ropes used for Double Dutch. Infused with a deeper message, you can’t help but enjoy this masterpiece.\nDamian Marley, “Here We Go”\nDamian Marley released his fourth solo studio album earlier this year. Despite having a bit of a gap between his last collaborative project, not to mention his last solo project, he brings forth every ounce of energy into this one, reminding us that he’s still very much in the game. “Here We Go,” the first song after “Intro” on the album Stony Hill, establishes this with a masterful blend of both production and characteristic wisdom. Using his signature style, he paints a picture of where he personally finds flaw in the music industry today and why his resurrection is very much necessary.\nSabrina Claudio ft. 6lack, “Belong to You (Remix)”\nSabrina Claudio’s most recent album About Time deals with the interlacing of time and love. She graciously includes a bonus track expanding on her original track “Belong To You,” which she remixed with the help of 6lack. While the original track tricks you into thinking she’s talking about someone else and then tying it back to herself, the remix gives the impression that love takes two. They expertly mesh their voices together in consideration of the piece’s rhythm. You realize that you can’t help but start moving—and vibing to it—effortlessly.\nJhene Aiko ft. Big Sean, “Moments”\nJhene Aiko’s most recent album Trip literally takes us through a trip through what has been going on in her life. She tells us about the present, catches up with her past, and how she looks forward to potential future ventures. This is elevated further through an intoxicated perception, as many of her songs allude to on the album. “Moments,” a collaboration with Big Sean, takes the concept of a love song with an air of honesty and relatability. With Big Sean enhancing it with his word play, all over a beat, the song is made easy on the ears—and dance moves.\nDvsn, “Mood”\nThe Canadian R&B duo Dvsn, comprised of Daniel Daley and Nineteen85, dropped “Mood” on September 5, which is a nod to their debut album, Sept. 5th. The song has an excellent use of diverse piano melodies and extended vocals, making you feel as though you’re falling deep into a heavy, blissful dream.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nNilou\xa0Alizadeh | Contributor\nFeatured image:\xa0Smoothie?

The paper, entitled “Decomposing the Value Effects of Sustainable Real Estate Investment: International Evidence.” Her co-author is Dr. Erkan Yonder, an assistant professor of Finance and Real Estate at Ozyegin University in Istanbul, Turkey, who is a co-recipient of the award.\nDevine comments that she does “the majority of her research on the financial implications of green and environmentally certified real estate investment.”\nHer goal in this line of work, “is to inform the industry of the operational details of environmentally conscious buildings, so as to encourage greater investment in the field.”\nYonder says: “From a corporate perspective, real estate and Real Estate Investment Trusts are unique.” To him, environmental sustainability can be achieved through green real estate.\n“Real estate is essential for the environment—it can aid in attempts to decrease resource consumption and daily carbon dioxide emissions,” he states.\nBoth of these researchers attempt to study the implications of sustainable infrastructures on the real estate market, as well as the implications of such buildings upon potential buyers.\n“Green certifications, such as LEED and Energy Star, maintain a certain level of environmental efficiency and sustainability for real estate,” says Yonder.\nThe paper investigates the impact of investment on the value, performance, profits, and costs of producing environmentally-conscious real estate, concluding that the way to sharpen awareness within the industry is through entailing standards on environment-based reporting.\nBoth researchers analyze the benefits of sustainable infrastructures on a social, economical, and environmental level.\n“Our findings demonstrate that these institutional investors buy and hold more of the stocks of real estate companies with sustainable investments. Thus, greenness in real estate investment is equivalent to both environmental and business maintenance,” comments Yonders.\n“My co-author, Dr. Erkan Yonder is also an early career academic with a background in real estate finance and specialty in sustainable and environmental real estate research. We find that we collaborate quite well, as we both have complementary research strengths.

What do you picture yourself doing? When many of us think about playing sports, the first thing that comes to our minds are the highly active motions of running, jumping, dodging, or tackling. Although plenty of us find comfort in these strenuous motions, there are several others who would rather put their energy into something that requires less stress on the body—perhaps, something that requires more emphasis on mental focus, calmness, and form.\n“I’ve been doing archery for four or about five years now,” says Charles Objero, a fourth-year psychology major and executive member of the York Lions Archery club. “I started all the way back in high school—it’s kind of funny how I got into it. Back then, my girlfriend did archery as an after-school club and I’d normally wait for her. The coach saw me just sitting there and offered me to come try out and shoot. Ever since then, I was hooked.”\nThe Lions Archery club consists of students who have taken an interest in the unique and satisfying sport of archery. With their practices held in an indoor shooting range located in the Tait McKenzie Centre, the objective of the group is to help members learn the basics of archery and develop their shooting skills in a friendly and accepting environment.\n“We welcome everyone regardless of their skill level. In the very beginning of the year we start off as a recreational sports club, gradually becoming competitive to get ready for the IUAT (Inter University Archery Tournament), which is held around the middle of March. Our club provides coaching and all the equipment necessary for everyone to start shooting,” Objero adds.\n“We normally focus on the Olympic recurve style of shooting. Our practice times are Mondays from 8:00 p.m to 10:00 p.m., Wednesdays from 6:30 p.m to 8:00 p.m., and Saturdays from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. Our practices run in the evening to accommodate those who have classes in the morning. Attendance isn’t mandatory if you join. People can come in freely, whenever their schedule permits them—however, I highly encourage members to come to all practices to get themselves ready for the competition. We hold two in-house competitions—one near the end of November and one around February—here at York, which are only open for club members. It’s to promote competitiveness and help archers improve their skill.”\nWhen looking at it in the realm of athletics, archery is not quite seen as a conventional sport. Rather than putting incredible amounts of stress on several parts of your body, archery requires a more focused approach, emphasizing a still calmness over a variety of constant fluid motions, being similar to hockey or basketball. Much like the purposes of yoga or meditation, archery is used as an agent of inner peace for students who need an outlet for their stressful, demanding lives as university attendees.\n“Archery has been beneficial to me because it’s a really good stress reliever; you shoot your stress away. For me especially, it helps me clear my mind and has helped me find inner peace,” Objero says.\nInstead of looking at it as a part of the realm of athletics, Objero sees archery in a different light, one closer to the realm of creativity and aesthetic.\n“It’s like art for me. Shooting an arrow is similar to painting your target on the canvas. It promotes the mentality that nothing is ever perfect and there is always room for improvement.”\nWhen looking toward the future of the club, Objero has ambitious hopes for a sport that eventually breaks out of the “competitive club” title in universities and becomes something much bigger.\n“Archery is a growing sport. Most of the universities in Ontario have their own archery club. All the universities are helping each other to make archery an official OUA varsity sport, rather than just a simple sports club. So hopefully in five year’s time, we’ll be an official OUA Varsity sports team,” he continues.\nSo, if you are ever craving the nickname of Hawkeye or Katniss amongst your friend groups, or are simply looking for an outlet to relieve the stresses of university, the Lions Archery club always has its doors open. The target is a blank canvas, waiting for you to paint it with your arrow.\nAll waivers and information on practice times for the York Lions Archery club can be found on their Facebook page, Lions Archery. They are always looking for new members, so make sure to give them a try before the season ends! \n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/health/2017/10/31/kombucha-magic-in-a-bottle/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nNilou\xa0Alizadeh | Contributor\nFeatured image:\xa0Smoothie?

This allowed the Lions to increase their lead.\nDespite having shot 37 per cent from the field—five per cent less than Western—York took a 34-25 lead into the break.\nThe third quarter saw an explosion of offense on both ends, as both teams managed to score over 20 points in the frame.\nHolding a 56-46 lead going into the fourth quarter, the wheels fell off for the Lions on both ends of the floor. York allowed the Mustangs to score a staggering 27 points in the frame, while only being able to muster 11 points themselves. In a half that saw the Mustangs shoot 58 per cent from the field, York only hit on 25 per cent of their shots. While Western had three players score 10+ points in the half, only one Lion, Lindsay Shotbolt, was able to score in the double-digits, as she recorded 15 points in the half.\nThe result was a 73-67 victory for the Mustangs, who were led by the performance of Puklicz, who fell just short of a double-double with 29 points and eight steals in the win. Shotbolt and Clarke scored 19 and 16 points respectively in the loss.\nAfter a 70-63 loss to Western on Friday, the men looked to snap their five-game losing streak on Saturday against a 2-5 Lancers team that had defeated the Lions last year by a score of 83-78.\nThe Lions got off to a hot start in the game, outscoring the Lancers 20-12 in the first quarter. Leading the way was Lion Gene Spagnuolo, who netted 14 points on 5 of 6 shooting in the first half.\nDespite stumbling on the offensive end in the second quarter, the Lions managed to go into the half with a four-point lead thanks in part to their defense, which limited the Lancers to just 26 per cent shooting in the half.\nThe Lions continued this effective defensive play in the second half, but failed to create many scoring opportunities down the stretch, as they only managed seven field goals on 37 attempts in the half.\nThe one bright spot for the Lions was guard Prince Kamunga, who scored 18 of York’s 25 points in the half.\nDespite poor performances on the offensive end for both teams, the difference in Saturday night’s game came down ball handling, as the Lancers outscored the Lions in points off turnovers 23-9.\nThe result was a 65-61 victory for the Lancers, who handed York their sixth-straight loss on the campaign.\nBoth teams look to end their semester on a high note before the break, as they take on the Queen’s Gaels in Kingston on Wednesday.

He told her to expect a call from the police. A few minutes later, she got a call from someone claiming to be from the police department, who she alleges told her to pay $3,000 for a lawyer.\nDoing as she was told by Anderson, Dheenadhayalan then made a series of wire transfers via Western Union and iTunes gift cards. She was told to make more payments to the Ontario Court of Justice via iTunes, and to wait at home for the local authorities to sign the relevant paperwork to close the case.\nHowever, when she returned to her home, Dheenadhayalan received another call from Anderson, telling her because it was the evening, she would have to wait until the next day for the authorities.\nThe following day, Dheenadhayalan alleges she was told that her case was approved, but in order for the Supreme Court to release documentation, she was told she must pay the remaining $2,000—$1,200 through Western Union and $800 via iTunes. As the hours passed, nobody arrived to her home with the paperwork. She tried to call Anderson, but the call did not go through.\nFearing that something was wrong, Dheenadhayalan googled the Immigration website and realized there were numerous warnings about scams. Following her shock, Dheenadhayalan filed a report with 31 Division (at 41 Norfinch Drive) the following day.\n“I provided the police with all the details; which included the receipts, showing all the payments that were made. The police mentioned that the chances of getting the money back are very low; however, they will try their best to track the individual,” adds Dheenadhayalan.\nMaijura Ra, also a fourth-year Economics student, says: “Hundreds of people continue to be affected by various fraud cases. It is unfortunate that it is the most vulnerable whom are targeted (seniors, students, international students, et cetera).”\n“We would like to urge international students to stay connected to the campus community, by visiting the York International Student Office, meeting student leaders and counsellors, and learning about services available to students, both on- and off-campus,” Ning says.\n“Students are also asked to be cautious about protecting their personal information and not make hasty decisions but instead, reach out to university support staff for advice.”\nRares Pateanu, an Information Technology (IT) professor at York, says: “As someone who has spent over 35 years in progressively more senior roles in IT, I am deeply aware of the enormous change IT has brought into our lives. Unfortunately, as my student Rakshitha Dheenadhayalan has recently experienced, not all those changes are positive.”\n“In my courses, I often emphasize how important it is for all of us to be aware of the potential pitfalls of technology, and to be ever so vigilant in defending ourselves against the many fraudulent activities perpetrated on people by unscrupulous use of technology,” he adds.\n“I think it is a very important topic that still does not have sufficient exposure, particularly in the student population. Students often think they are too savvy regarding technology matters to be taken in by fraudsters.”\nRa says: “Many stories do not become publicized due to privacy concerns. However, I believe it should be mandatory to share such stories in order to bring out awareness.\n“This could have happened to anyone.”\nWith files from Rakshitha Dheenadhayalan\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAdeela Asghar | Contributor\nFeatured image:\xa0Here are some tips from your fellow undergrads on how to keep yourself motivated and hit the gym. | Courtesy of Pexels\nWe all know how crucial it is to get a daily dose of exercise—whether or not we’re willing to make time for it is a different story. Health Canada recommends 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week for adults aged 18-64. Despite exercise being so important for our health, there’s always an excuse we make for ourselves for not doing it.\nMany individuals often provide the reason for not exercising as lack of motivation and enjoyment. Let’s face it—an elevated motivation is a key determinant in whether you will exercise or not. Having a high drive and sense of pleasure can help you exercise consistently, get you in shape, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.\nIf a lack of motivation and enjoyment are what’s keeping you from staying healthy, here are a few tips of encouragement to stay active, as told by your fellow Yorkies:\n“I believe by setting and tracking your goals constantly, it will help you stay motivated constantly. Your goals do not have to be achieving certain body percentage, as many factors such as genetics, environment, and culture can affect our ability to gain or lose body weight,” says Karam Ali, a second-year Biology student.\nThese goals can range from going jogging for 50 to 60 minutes daily, to performing intense workouts for up to 20 minutes, or cutting down your six-mile running time by a few minutes. If you work out to attain these goals on a regular basis, you are less likely to stop when you know you can easily achieve your goals.\nExtrinsic motivation pulls more weight in your workout regime than you might think. Looking up to others plays an important role in keeping you motivated, so if you’re struggling to find inspiration, your answer may lie in online motivational quotes.\n“I would suggest using inspirational quotes to help you get motivated, because if you see someone successful, it will motivate you to be the same,” says Shahrukh Afza, a fourth-year Social Work student.\nPost them around your house to remind you of your goals, and that if a certain person can attain their goal, then so can you.\n“I suggest finding buddies to go to the gym with. I often go with my friends from university, which helps me stay motivated and exercise regularly, especially when I don’t feel like it,” says Zainab Kham, a second-year Biomedical student.\nThis will help you enjoy your exercise and work out harder, as you will have someone with similar goals to you.\n“Going to the gym with someone is always fun and can be used as motivation to help you stay active,” he adds.\nThe particular person does not have to be your friends or family—it could be anyone you know, including someone from your neighborhood, co-workers, or people you stay regularly in touch with online, which will help you push your limit everyday and encourage you to stay on track and pursue a healthy lifestyle.\nTake time out to go to the gym.\n“After some time, it become a habit and you just don’t feel right if you miss out on gym days. That also helps to bring me back to the gym if I have to stop during midterms, or other times when I am really busy,” says Ahsan Al Lawati, a fourth-year Kinesiology and Health student.\n“I want to build my body and stay healthy. I’ve also noticed that I feel a lot better and am better focused on my studies when I work out, so I make it a point to take time out and go to the gym.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nDennis Bayazitov | Assistant News Editor\nFeatured image:\xa0The event benefitted filmmakers, photographers, models, and further new talent alike. | Courtesy of Antonio Garcia Photography\nFriday November 17 marked the opening of the third annual Open World Toronto Film Festival (OWTFF)—held in the Alliance Francaise Spadina Theatre, just north of the Maddy—lacing together a celebration of aspiring Toronto film talent, musical performance, multimedia coverage, and international filmmakers sharing their lessons from the industry, for the industry.\n“Students are young. They are fresh,” says Sabine Mondestin, OWTFF president and founder. \n“What I love is to be able to give them that platform to be able to experience the festival feel, to be able to know what it is like to showcase their film and to have that experience. We have granted free access to all university and college students.”\nUpon entry, festival-goers could not help but notice the red carpet laid out before them with an OWTFF backdrop ringed by a wave of fluttering flashes as photographers and videographers captured the night’s invited talent. Downstairs in the basement, a professional makeup studio was assembled to have everyone feeling celebrious.\n“I attend so many other events in Los Angeles,” Mondestin explains. “What I really like there is that feeling of ‘Oh my God, I’m a star!’ so I really want to give students that same treatment. [The filmmaker’s] film is there, and they get the star treatment: the paparazzi-style pictures—this is something that people like.”\nMondestin says she uses this unique framework to also recognize new photographers. “[Student photographers] don’t all have careers, but they are talented. They send us their portfolios and say: ‘I really want to take pictures in front of the red carpet.’”\nOver the course of three days, the festival featured 17 films and provided a space for directors, producers, actors, models, film reviewers, and multimedia professionals to all network and share their processes. Screened movies were selected from submissions to FilmFreeway and the official OWTFF website.\n“We’ve been travelling around and, you know, Canada is a bit behind on this compared to Los Angeles,” says OWTFF Director Steve Lareau. \n“Over there they really know how to market their movies, but here—not so good. We are inspired quite a bit by Los Angeles in this business model.”\nThe 2017 film selection featured short student films, documentaries, animated shorts, music videos and experimental films from Toronto, New York, Japan, and Turkey. Films included The Kidnapping of a Fish, Poison in the Water, The Oasis Affair, \xa0Nights of Contrition, Princess Eun Hwa, The Box, Voice of Grace, Frapuccino, Approaching, Finding Hope, and Echo Park Blues.\n“There have been lots of movies we’ve seen over the years that have been excellent, but we think that even more people should see them—to bring some light to those talents,” adds Lareau. “Every year, as soon as we’re done with a festival, we start to find new talent for next year, and we really try to find those little diamonds.”\nThe festival further featured a conference, moderated by Alina Christensen, on financing and filming in—and co-producing with—China alongside James Nan Guan, a Chinese producer who has worked on films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drago, among others. \nChristensen, a York Theatre alumna, says she was particularly impressed with Nan’s eagerness to share his knowledge. “It was clear to me that despite all the experience he has, he was still very humble and passionate about cinema, wanting to connect with likeminded artists here in Canada.”\nNan forecasted that the Chinese film industry will soon surpass Hollywood’s.\n“The Chinese population is much greater [than America’s],” Nan noted on stage, speaking with her. “Toronto’s is three million; Beijing’s, 23 million. If even 10 per cent of China sees a movie, that’s already more than all of Toronto.”\n“He answered every question with confidence and in plenty of detail, and he even threw in some humour too,” Christensen adds. “His charisma kept the audience attentive and focused.”\nOWTFF further invited critics and reviewers to offer feedback to the featured talent.\n“Film festivals offer a great opportunity for young filmmakers to network and meet industry professionals,” says Maziyar Khatam, a Toronto filmmaker who had his own movies screened. “It’s a good chance to have your film screened in front of an audience and to receive feedback on your work. \n“The technical aspects of [OWTFF’s] films—the cinematography, editing and music—were astounding. My favourite film from the festival was Bakemono, a 48-minute Japanese experimental film.”\nThis is the festival’s third year running. “We try to add one day every year,” Lareau mentions. “The first year we did one; the next year, two; and this year, we did three.”\n“It’s easy to remain in your university bubble, especially at a school like York which is located away from the downtown core and where everything you need is on campus,” Christensen notes. “It’s a really good idea to get out there and begin creating a network outside of your own school, which allows you to meet industry professionals as well as other students.”\nAfter all, this is what Mondestin aimed to create.\n“The main thing we want to accomplish is to showcase talented filmmakers who have the talent, but don’t have the name,” she says. “It’s hard to get into festivals if you don’t have a name. \n“And I’m all about glamour.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAkashdeep Singh | Contributor\nFeatured image:\xa0Logic’s track “1-800-273-8255” raises much-needed awareness on suicide. | Courtesy of Pitchfork.com\nWith the release of his latest album Everybody this past May, 27-year-old rapper Logic (born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II) touched upon a variety of issues such as politics, social media, race, and most importantly, suicide. His song “1-800-273-8255,” the title itself being the phone number for America’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL), portrays a conversation between an individual who has called the lifeline and the operator on the other end, who tries to convince the former why they shouldn’t take their own life.\nSuch sensitive topics such as suicide must be approached carefully, and it’s rare to hear mainstream songs grappling with the issue. However, Logic has attempted to promote awareness and create discussion regarding the struggle between life and death due to feelings of isolation. \nInspired by conversations that he’s had with fans who have told him that his music has saved their lives, the rapper created a song specifically for that purpose, which has had a tremendous effect on mainstream music’s landscape. With assistance from two other talented artists, Alessia Cara and Khalid, “1-800-273-8255” quickly became his most influential track to date.\nThe track has seen incredible success, with over 100 million views on the official music video, and nearly 350 million streams on Spotify. Combined sales and streaming numbers for the track gave Logic his first-ever platinum record, which would later become triple platinum, and would then go on to break into the Top Three on Billboard’s Hot 100. It was recently nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Music Video.\nBut this isn’t the only impact that the song has had. In the weeks following it’s release, the NSPL saw a 27 per cent rise in calls and an additional 400,000 visits to their website over the following months. During the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), Logic performed the song live and had many survivors of suicide join him on stage for what became an emotional and powerful display of unity and hope. It showed us that we aren’t alone, and that unity is crucial for someone experiencing suicidal thoughts, or other serious mental health issues.

They are fresh,” says Sabine Mondestin, OWTFF president and founder. \n“What I love is to be able to give them that platform to be able to experience the festival feel, to be able to know what it is like to showcase their film and to have that experience. We have granted free access to all university and college students.”\nUpon entry, festival-goers could not help but notice the red carpet laid out before them with an OWTFF backdrop ringed by a wave of fluttering flashes as photographers and videographers captured the night’s invited talent. Downstairs in the basement, a professional makeup studio was assembled to have everyone feeling celebrious.\n“I attend so many other events in Los Angeles,” Mondestin explains. “What I really like there is that feeling of ‘Oh my God, I’m a star!’ so I really want to give students that same treatment. [The filmmaker’s] film is there, and they get the star treatment: the paparazzi-style pictures—this is something that people like.”\nMondestin says she uses this unique framework to also recognize new photographers. “[Student photographers] don’t all have careers, but they are talented. They send us their portfolios and say: ‘I really want to take pictures in front of the red carpet.’”\nOver the course of three days, the festival featured 17 films and provided a space for directors, producers, actors, models, film reviewers, and multimedia professionals to all network and share their processes. Screened movies were selected from submissions to FilmFreeway and the official OWTFF website.\n“We’ve been travelling around and, you know, Canada is a bit behind on this compared to Los Angeles,” says OWTFF Director Steve Lareau. \n“Over there they really know how to market their movies, but here—not so good. We are inspired quite a bit by Los Angeles in this business model.”\nThe 2017 film selection featured short student films, documentaries, animated shorts, music videos and experimental films from Toronto, New York, Japan, and Turkey. Films included The Kidnapping of a Fish, Poison in the Water, The Oasis Affair, \xa0Nights of Contrition, Princess Eun Hwa, The Box, Voice of Grace, Frapuccino, Approaching, Finding Hope, and Echo Park Blues.\n“There have been lots of movies we’ve seen over the years that have been excellent, but we think that even more people should see them—to bring some light to those talents,” adds Lareau. “Every year, as soon as we’re done with a festival, we start to find new talent for next year, and we really try to find those little diamonds.”\nThe festival further featured a conference, moderated by Alina Christensen, on financing and filming in—and co-producing with—China alongside James Nan Guan, a Chinese producer who has worked on films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drago, among others. \nChristensen, a York Theatre alumna, says she was particularly impressed with Nan’s eagerness to share his knowledge. “It was clear to me that despite all the experience he has, he was still very humble and passionate about cinema, wanting to connect with likeminded artists here in Canada.”\nNan forecasted that the Chinese film industry will soon surpass Hollywood’s.\n“The Chinese population is much greater [than America’s],” Nan noted on stage, speaking with her. “Toronto’s is three million; Beijing’s, 23 million. If even 10 per cent of China sees a movie, that’s already more than all of Toronto.”\n“He answered every question with confidence and in plenty of detail, and he even threw in some humour too,” Christensen adds. “His charisma kept the audience attentive and focused.”\nOWTFF further invited critics and reviewers to offer feedback to the featured talent.\n“Film festivals offer a great opportunity for young filmmakers to network and meet industry professionals,” says Maziyar Khatam, a Toronto filmmaker who had his own movies screened. “It’s a good chance to have your film screened in front of an audience and to receive feedback on your work. \n“The technical aspects of [OWTFF’s] films—the cinematography, editing and music—were astounding. My favourite film from the festival was Bakemono, a 48-minute Japanese experimental film.”\nThis is the festival’s third year running. “We try to add one day every year,” Lareau mentions. “The first year we did one; the next year, two; and this year, we did three.”\n“It’s easy to remain in your university bubble, especially at a school like York which is located away from the downtown core and where everything you need is on campus,” Christensen notes. “It’s a really good idea to get out there and begin creating a network outside of your own school, which allows you to meet industry professionals as well as other students.”\nAfter all, this is what Mondestin aimed to create.\n“The main thing we want to accomplish is to showcase talented filmmakers who have the talent, but don’t have the name,” she says. “It’s hard to get into festivals if you don’t have a name. \n“And I’m all about glamour.”\n ']"

The artificial moon could save the city of Chengdu $174 million when providing light for only 50 square kilometers.

It does affect their circadian rhythms, although I’m not sure anyone has shown it is costly for them.”\n In regards to his own subject species, he describes that they “adjust [their] reproductive schedule to the lunar cycle (laying eggs at the time of the full moon). I suspect this kind of facility would interfere with that kind of cycle, because the light periodicity associated with the lunar cycle would disappear.”\nMills further notes that light pollution produced by cities is “a huge problem for migratory birds,” as countless birds have died colliding with commercial office buildings, houses, and apartment buildings, which are often kept lit at night. The best course of action to prevent this from happening is to remember to turn off all lights that are not in use, or use curtains, even when it’s dark outside.

Periodontitis — the stage after gingivitis — results when so much bacterial plaque accumulates on the surface of the teeth that subgingival pockets are formed between the tooth and the gum. With time, the tissue and bone that hold the tooth and gum together deteriorate until the tooth falls out. In those who have reached this stage, P. gingivalis is highly prevalent.\nFascinatingly, researchers have also found the bacterium in the brains of people who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease.\nLeading the research behind this bewildering connection is a pharmaceutical company called Cortexyme. Using mice, they have shown that the subjects given the bacterial infection of P. gingivalis suffered neurological damage — the kind seen in human Alzheimer’s cases.\n\xa0Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, P. gingivalis, and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis,” said Dr. Stephen Dominy, co-founder of Cortexyme and lead author of the paper.\n“This demonstrates the potential for a class of small molecule therapies to change the trajectory of disease.”\nAs strange as this may sound, there have already been a few studies conducted that link oral and mental health. In 2016, a study was conducted that determined those with both Alzheimer’s and gingivitis experienced a more rapid neurodegeneration. Even more astonishingly, the Herpes Type I virus, an STI, has also been linked to Alzheimer’s.\nIt should be noted that more research is required before it can definitively be determined that one disease causes the other. Though an individual may have Alzheimer’s, he or she may also have been avid brushers; though an individual may have lost all of their teeth, he or she may be in perfect mental health.\nA list of preventative measures that one can take to avoid developing the neurodegenerative disease can be found at alzheimers.net. Some of the suggestions include: quitting smoking and drinking; engaging in social activities; giving your brain daily challenges, exercise, a good diet, and managing stress effectively.\nRemember, this may seem like a possible problem too far in the future, but the bad habits you develop as a young adult may stay with you into your later years.

Microdosing is the act of taking drugs such as acid, DMT, mushrooms (psilocybin), or MDMA in very small quantities over the course of a period of time. This method has become the new form of treatment in the fight against depression and anxiety.\nMany are hailing microdosing as the miracle cure, but how can one be sure that one isn’t just needlessly subjecting the brain to mind-altering drugs on a daily basis?\nIn spite of what the general consensus may be, the information behind this phenomena is slim to none. A review in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, written by a team of researchers hoping to define and analyze medicinal microdosing (specifically that of psilocybin) more sufficiently, found little in the way of actual solid data. As such, they feel that it is too early to say anything definitive on the subject.\nDr. Kim Kuypers of the Maastricht University in the Netherlands, the first author of the study, told MedicalNewsToday:\n\xa0Patients might feel attracted by those reports to try it but may actually not be helped by it. We try to emphasize the lack of scientific proof that microdosing is indeed effective in combating certain symptoms and hope that this will give impetus to new lines of research in this area.”\nBut what is microdosing exactly? Professor David Nutt, the Edmond J. Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, is the senior author of the review. After researching the ins and outs of microdosing, Nutt and his team define the phenomena by three main characteristics: very low doses that neither cause perceived change in the imbiber nor impair any normal functioning; multiple, scheduled dose times over a period of time; and a desire to enhance one’s self though microdosing. The amount itself, the ‘microdose,’ is defined as “approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth of a recreational dose.”\nAs for the lack of information related to microdosing, Nutt told MedicalNewsToday that the legalities of the substances are the main deterrent to gathering relevant data, but he and his team hope that the recent publicity will be of use in removing the red tape.\nKuypers holds the same sentiment: “This review is timely as a lot of hope is generated by positive media reports about alleged effects of microdosing.”\nSo, before you pop a few mushroom caps to write your next exam, remember that the data simply isn’t available yet and anecdotal evidence is hardly evidence at all without an empirical approach.\nAs Nutt and his team put it: “Rigorous, placebo-controlled clinical studies need to be conducted with low doses of psilocybin to determine whether there is any evidence for the claims of microdosing.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nVictoria Strassler | Copy Editor\nFeatured image courtesy of Pixabay\nThe holiday season can be far from winter nights sitting by the fireplace sipping hot cocoa. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a medley of holidays or none at all, December is often regarded as the “ideal” time of the year. It is a month typically free from university classes and full of non-stop gift-giving and quality time with family and friends.\nHowever, for some, this period is far from being “the most wonderful time of the year” – but why is that? Why is this time of year, synonymous in society with glee and relaxation, often not experienced by many in such a joyous way?\nSome may categorize themselves as having the “holiday blues” during the holiday season.\nAccording to Gordan Flett, Personality & Health professor, the holiday blues is “the idea that a substantial proportion of people feel sad and depressed during the holidays. It also suggests someone who is quite lonely and isolated from others.”\nWoo Kim, International Student & Scholar Services associate director at York, says the holiday blues may be experienced for various reasons for some international students in particular.\nKim describes that an international student may be in a mundane mood because “they may not be going home over the December holidays and won’t get to see their family and friends. This may lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, at least temporarily.”\nAparna Mehta, third-year English student at York, explains how she was impacted during the past holiday season when she was unable to visit her family in Delhi, India.\n“The holiday season tends to be a time for family. As I was unable to travel back home and be with my family last year, I did feel a little unhappy and homesick.”\nKim also explains how “for other students, this may be their first, or one of their first, winter. If they’re from a country where the weather stays fairly mild or hot in winter and stays sunny, the early darkness and grey winter days may cause them to feel less energized and ‘blue.’”\nSarah Irwin-Gardner, York’s Graduate Student Wellness Services manager, lists some factors that generally may impact students’ well-being during the holiday season. One factor Irwin-Gardner mentions is “feeling pressure to produce or experience a ‘perfect’ holiday.” Cassandra Carcasole, third-year English student, describes how she feels this expectation Irwin-Gardner describes.\n\xa0The holidays do cause some stress for me because there are so many things on my mind. I also feel like I need to buy everyone the perfect gift, so there’s always some pressure there,” Carcasole says.\nBrian Villa, third-year Business Administration student, also has experienced this type of pressure. “My stress derives more from what to do on Christmas so that everyone will be happy.”\nIrwin-Gardner discusses how the holiday season may affect a student because they tend to “manage multiple demands on one’s time.” Such demands may include balancing time for holiday shopping and social gatherings with time for final exam and assignment preparation, on top of working a part-time job.\n“Other than being a student, I work two part-time retail jobs. Right now, it’s definitely a lot. I don’t have any days off,” Carcasole says.\n“I am able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments, but it is not easy and definitely not the ideal situation.” Villa adds.\nCharles Matthew Mishiyev, second-year history student, explains how becoming accustomed to a hectic routine is his key to balancing a hectic season.\n“I am somewhat able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments because I have worked in retail during the holiday season for two years and have adapted to it,” Mishiyev says.\nAdelaide Dolha, third-year Devised Theatre student, recalls her experience working in retail during the holiday season.\n“Last year when I worked in retail, I had more hours due to more people being needed and these were 5 a.m. shifts. I even had one on Christmas Eve which made me tired for the rest of the day.”\nAnother factor Irwin-Gardner adds to the list of potential reasons for stress during the holidays is an “increase in academic pressure and the effects of working intensely leading up to the holidays.”\n“I am able to balance my schedule as I usually start preparing for the holidays only once exams are done,” Dolha adds.\nIrwin-Gardner also lists “feelings of isolation or feelings of loneliness” as a contributing factor for one’s holiday blues. Silsila Bahrami, fourth-year communication studies student, shares her feelings of discontentment with this time of year.\n“I do not typically enjoy the holiday season. I am not a fan of the cold weather and I usually feel left out of the festivities, as my family does not celebrate the holiday season. I try to keep myself busy during this time period, but it is difficult when most people are away and/or celebrating while I am at home.”\nOther factors listed by Irwin-Gardner include: “Distance from loved ones; increased financial demands/pressures; change in routine; missing loved ones who are far away or no longer alive; seasonal effects on mood (SAD), and difficult or distressing family dynamics.”\nIf you feel as if you may have experienced, or are currently experiencing, the holiday blues, there are other students at York, and in the country, who share your discontentment. But, how many students do the holiday blues impact?\nUnfortunately, there has not been any research conducted that has established a relationship between the holiday season and an increase in stress and unhappiness among students, according to Flett. Nonetheless, there are still students who may feel a sense of unhappiness at one point during the holiday season due to the aforementioned potential factors.\n\xa0I look at the holidays as a time for relaxation and enjoyment for some people, but potentially hellish for others. It is a difficult time for any student who is preoccupied mentally and emotionally with not having done well in the fall term or who is returning to a less than optimal interpersonal situation or who is just feeling isolated and lonely,” Flett explains.\nFlett also further supports the factors listed by Irwin-Gardner as to what could contribute to the holiday blues.\n“It is more stressful for those who are focused on happier times in the past and why aren’t they so happy now. Or, for someone who is overly focused on comparing their holiday experience to the idealized accounts of life over the holidays provided by other people. Also, some people really buy into the notion of the perfect holiday season and they can exhaust themselves and others by trying to live up to an idealized image of how it should be or could be. Others are disquieted because they are so work-obsessed, they don’t know how to respond during times when the focus should be on rest and replenishing oneself.”\nLouise Hartley, York’s Psychology Clinic director, comments on how marketing is also a contributing factor for those experiencing the holiday blues. Marketing has surrounded us with a narrative of how the holidays “should be,” despite it being unattainable for some.\n“The holiday season can be difficult for anyone because there are these expectations built in through the excessive advertising – that this is a ‘happy’ time of year.”\nSo, how can one cope with the holiday blues?\nMayo Clinic shared 10 tips to coping with stress and depression during the holidays. The Mayo Clinic staff recommended that if you are experiencing the holiday blues for any of the aforementioned reasons, you should try to do the following: “acknowledge your feelings; reach out; be realistic; set aside differences; stick to a budget; plan ahead; learn to say no; do not abandon healthy habits; take a breather, and seek professional help if you need it.”\nIf you often feel lonely during the holiday season or you feel yourself feeling in such a way in the next few weeks, registered psychologist, Dr. Ganz Ferrance explained to CTV News that “if you are isolated from your family, find other ways to connect with people. Make time for friends or volunteering to help combat loneliness.”\nKim provides information on how York students will be able to connect with other students staying in the city to avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness this holiday season.\n“International students who aren’t going home and staying in Toronto may want to connect with other international students staying over the break or with domestic students who live locally. This year, York International will be running a few events and outings in the city for any international students staying in Toronto so they can connect with other students staying over the break.”\nThe Mayo Clinic staff put it best: “Don’t let the holidays become something you dread. Instead, take steps to prevent the stress and depression that can descend during the holidays. Learn to recognize your holiday triggers, such as financial pressures or personal demands, so you can combat them before they lead to a meltdown. With a little planning and some positive thinking, you can find peace and joy during the holidays.”\nIt is very important to reach out for support if you have concerns about your mental health or wellness during the holiday season or at any point during the year.

Images of students marching to American Embassies or toppling statues of some tyrant comes to mind when we think of student activism. This is inherently wrong.\nIn young students who, for the first time, hear their voices in society, they develop an impulse to correct the oppressive ways of the old. Our education, which bores us to death, does not fulfill us intellectually; this produces a loud and boisterous beast of a mob that overtakes all rationale.\nWestern civilization owes its success to free discourse and debate. In fact, this is the exact notion that universities should aim to do — this is the only value that we as students should learn. If someone honestly believes in a cause, or in the case of the events of last week’s events, against a cause, they should not chant and try to silence others. This will only regress us to the barbaric past we are trying to avoid.\nIf you believe someone’s message is wrong and/or detrimental, then prove it. Set up a booth, and call people to hear the facts.\nThere needs to be a shift in the understanding of student activism.

Then, students and supporters will come together and write to the governments who are committing said human rights violations to try to invoke change.\nThe event garnered a good amount of attention last year, sending out just under six million letters and messages from over 200 countries.\n“The past years, we’ve had to send out over a hundred letters,” Abdel-Maksoud says, discussing the York extension’s impact. “In the years I’ve seen the event happen, it has attracted a lot of attention, so we’re glad about that, and it really helps because it seems like such a small thing but it makes a big difference.”\nAnd the event has made a difference. In 2014, film director Oleg Sentsov was arrested by Russian authorities on charges of plotting terrorism acts. Amnesty International, alongside other human rights organizations, took to his side to defend him and label the accusations by the Russian court as fabrications.\nAfter being released on September 7, 2019, Sentsov thanked activists and people who wrote letters during his incarceration.\n“I brought two bags. The second contained 22 kilograms of paper, mostly letters. I did not throw a single one out. I brought them all and kept them, as they are so dear to me. There are books, notebooks, a big pack, 15 of them. They are completely filled with writing.”\nAbdel-Maksoud says the letters are not directly connected to the remediation of these human rights violations; however, they could be a factor that help individuals around the world.\n“Those letters, because they are so personal, you can write them to the people facing that injustice or the government itself. It really makes a difference because people get to read, people that are in solidarity with them, and governments get to see how much people want these injustices solved,” says Abdel-Maksoud.\nYork students attended for their own personal reasons, and explained how they were touched by specific cases that Amnesty International was working on.\n\xa0I, myself, wrote to the case about people arrested for helping refugees in Greece. They volunteered for a rescue mission, and were arrested. Although they’ve been released on bail, they are pending charges,” says fourth-year communication studies student, Olivia Graham.\n“This seems like such a small thing, and people always seem to think that writing letters and signing petitions are small actions. It’s the most basic form of mobilization for your rights and the rights of others,” says Abdel-Maksoud, urging others to attend the Write for Rights event.\nThe official event by Amnesty International will take place on December 10.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2019/11/28/from-york-to-hong-kong/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nMatt Render | Contributor\nFeatured Image: Many York students from Hong Kong have been called back to York out of concern for their safety back home. | Courtesy of Fatema Ali/Excalibur\nWith protests surging in Hong Kong, many residents have had their lives put into danger.

A study published this past August set out to discover the effects of taking very small doses of LSD (a phenomena now known as microdosing) in relation to productivity, depression, and other mental health issues. These aspects were investigated after long standing anecdotal reports.\xa0\nThe study gave 27 volunteers a placebo, as well as actual LSD, on separate days while monitoring their brain-derived neuropathic factor (BDNF) blood plasma levels every two hours.\xa0\nThe study found that at a dose of five micrograms of LSD, BDNF increased and peaked after four hours, while 20 micrograms also saw an increase with a peak time of six hours.\xa0\nWhat exactly is BDNF, you may ask?

BDNF production and release is activity dependent, which means that properly functioning neurons produce more BDNF, which in turn maintains the healthy neuron and its synapses. It is important for both supporting the survival and health of existing neurons, as well as encouraging growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses,” says Vine.\xa0\nBDNF also plays key roles in learning, memory functioning,\xa0 and neuroplasticity — the capacity of our brain to rewire itself. This is fundamental to depression and neurodegenerative disorders like dementia, all of which are tied to a decrease in BDNF levels.\xa0\nSo, with all this research done and anecdotal stories recounted, does LSD really give its users any support when it comes to the busy workday or the distress of mental health issues? The answer is: maybe.\xa0\nIn the aforementioned study, a 10 microgram dose of LSD had no effect on BDNF levels, even though a five and 20 microgram dose did.

For the first time ever, York will be offering remote global internships in Winter 2021. Several international universities have also made remote study options available for York students.\n“These are offered through our direct partner organizations, and they may or may not include a program fee — most of them do not,” said International Internships Assistant Natasha Pursun, at a Global Internships Q&A session. “The selection process is handled by both York International and the organization.”\nThese remote internships are three months long, and interested students can apply directly to York International. Short-term remote internships are also available and will be offered year-round through external providers.\xa0\nCurrent remote opportunities include fields like accounting, marketing, non-governmental organization (NGO) management, and conservation, in countries such as China, England, France, Japan, Portugal, and Peru.\nWhile these internships no longer provide students with a physical international work experience, they still retain the financial benefits. Students are eligible for a funding of up to $3,000 for these opportunities.\nDepending on the travel situation, there may still be some international opportunities available in summer 2021. However, they will not be hosted through direct partners like the remote opportunities.\n“These are organizations we’ve partnered with through faculty connections here at York,” said Pursun. “We reached out to faculty members here at the university and we asked them for any connections they had in the field, either working with other organizations or working with other universities.”\n\xa0 \xa0 “Obviously it was upsetting, having the trip cut off and flying home, but at the same time the situation was getting really scary in Europe, and Canada had it better under control in that sense.”\nIn terms of educational opportunities, many international universities have pivoted to virtual learning as well. While summer 2021 opportunities have yet to be posted, fall/winter virtual opportunities currently listed include the European studies program at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, and the Winter Abroad program at South Korea’s Yonsei University.\nFourth-year Schulich iBBA student Meena Shanmuganathan can speak to the benefits of her own exchange term this year: “I loved my exchange experience, it was a fantastic time. I really got to discover independence in a new country, in basically learning the language and everything I had to do there. I did get to travel alongside the South of France, I went to Aix-en-Provence on exchange.”\nHowever, Shanmuganathan’s experience was cut off early due to the onset of COVID-19.
