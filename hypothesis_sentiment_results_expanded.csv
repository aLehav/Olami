Here at KnightNews.com, we decided to take an inside look to see what exactly goes on at a Jewish wedding. It was held on Saturday, Sept. 12 in the Venue (the old UCF Arena). Hundreds of students poured in wearing their semi-formal wedding attire ready to bring the Venue to life.\nOf course, like most weddings, there is a bride and groom, they say their vows and exchange rings and get wedding dress alterations. We all know that part. But what about a wedding where the to-be-married couple steps on and shatters a glass to symbolize their union? Yea, that really happens. Anyway, as that ceremony finishes, the bride, groom and guests make their way over to the dance floor and buffet. As we spoke with many of the guests, the number one most important part of a Jewish wedding, in these students’ opinions, was the quality and quantity of food. Yes, you heard us: the quality of the food was paramount, more so than the love shared between the bride and groom. Of course, this is not the belief shared by the religion, but just those young and new freshmen who go to every possible event where free food is served.\nThere were many single UCF students and, believe us, there was plenty of mingling. We caught a few kissing scenes, but decided not to publish them on the site. Instead, they were sold to Girls Gone Wild. That is entirely a joke–they were NOT sold to anyone.\nAs we moved through the wedding crowd, we were able to meet a few girls who shed some light on why people should get married, one very sweaty sophomore and even a few girls who seemed to never stop talking–we eventually cut their interview short in an effort to save film for the rest of the story.\nAll in all, the event was quite enjoyable, and the students all clearly had a blast. First Hillel had a Bar-Mitzvah, now they had a wedding and who knows what is next? Maybe next year there will be a circumcision. Only time will tell.\nMazel Tov!\n…oh yea, and about that broken glass…well, we will just assume was half full.\n________________________________\nEvent photos are available online:\nhttp://www.definedentertainment.com/orlando-pics/main.php?g2_itemId=74577']",['https://knightnews.com/2009/09/my-big-fat-jewish-wedding/'],0.8554498553276062,0.02847675047814846,0.047572944313287735

At the same time their loved ones are likely interested in seeing what the early stages of this semester has brought their students. \nWell as a part of a yearly tradition the university provides a chance for family members and students to reunite and get informed about the plethora of on campus services and activities with Family Weekend 2010. Family weekend offers three days chock full of activities with an emphasis on facts, food, fun and most importantly family!\nThe events commenced at 10 o’clock this morning with bihourly tours of the UCF Health Center running until 2 in the afternoon. Aside from various informative lectures regarding Off-campus housing, Study Abroad and Shabbat Service as well as a showcase of the renovations to the Library Friday offers various recreational activities for students and their families. Highlights include the Welcome Reception at the Reflecting Pond where attendees will get a chance get acquainted with faculty members as well as enjoy a delicious meal provided by Wackadoos as well as “The Experience” which will show off the talent of UCF’s minority population. \nThe fun extends all the way over to the Rosen Campus of Hospitality management where ventriloquist Lynn Trefzger will perform a show free of charge for UCF students and their family guests. Capping off the Friday night activities is a chance for families to experience one of the university’s monthly Late Knights events with the theme “Around the World”. After Late Knights you would be well served to rest up for another full day of activities at UCF.\nThe line-up of events for Saturday September 11th is just as extensive and exciting as the Friday opening. On tap for day two is another series of meetings concerning academics and other programs at UCF including a workshop on experiencing UCF as a student of color. Also, the families of students active in the LEAD program are encouraged to take part in the LEAD Scholars Brunch in the Pegasus Ballroom. \nLater in the day don’t miss a chance to learn more about the various academic departments at UCF with showcases from the Rosen College of Hospitality Management as well as the Colleges of Education, Health and Public Affairs and Engineering and Computer Science. Open Houses will also be held by the Burnett Honors College and College of Sciences. \nPerhaps the main attraction of the day though, comes as the Knights football team takes on the Wolfpack of North Carolina State at 7:30. But there will be plenty of pregame activities to keep students and their families occupied before filling up Brighthouse Networks Stadium for the game. MSC and NPHC are hosting a tailgate event including music, free food and give aways while ticket holding families can attend the UCF Family Weekend Tent Party featuring games, a catered menu and more giveaways, both events will take place at the Memory Mall in front of the Arena.\nSunday the 12th not only marks the hopeful celebration of a Knights football victory but, sadly, the conclusion of Family Weekend 2010.  On the final day families are treated to a choice of three delicious brunches. The Campus Activities Board is hosting their CAB Family Weekend Funky Brunch, which will include an appearance by Mr. and Mrs. UCF along with a live DJ, tons of activities including a family game show and of course free food. On the Rosen Campus is the Rosen Family weekend brunch where families with reservations can enjoy brunch with the Dean. Last but not least is the Bagel Brunch Wrap Up, hosted by University of Central Florida Hillel in the Key West Ballroom located inside the Student Union.\nUCF Family Weekend 2010 looks to be a wonderful opportunity for Knight family members of all ages to get a taste of the UCF experience.  Family weekend also provides a wonderful opportunity to showcase its topnotch Academic staff and facilities as well as how fun and exciting it is to be a Knight.\nFor more information and a full schedule of events check out this link:\nhttp://parents.sdes.ucf.edu/familyweekend/index.php']",['https://knightnews.com/2010/09/ucf-opens-its-doors-for-annual-family-weekend/'],0.8282023072242737,0.20172154903411865,0.33256611227989197

That way, it’ll be easier for your family to find you in the crowd. You know there will be a lot of other students graduating with you, but it’s only a four hour affair, right?\nFor anybody who’s been to a graduation ceremony before, you know that the fun doesn’t start until someone is reading names off a card while you’re rushed across the stage to pick up an empty certificate folder and stumble down the other side, blinded by the photographer you didn’t even know was taking your picture. And that’s it. You’re done.\nBut I digress. On Dec. 12 and 13 you will be participating in a time honored ceremony that brings pomp and circumstance to the toil and trouble you’ve endured learning how to think, how to create, how to research and how to find truth and meaning in the tiniest details.\nIf it’s been a while since your last commencement ceremony (or if you just want some insight into what’s going on), here’s the breakdown on what can expect to happen at UCF’s Fall 2014 Graduation Ceremony:\nEach ceremony begins an hour-and-a-half before anybody gets up on stage to speak. This means you need to find a parking spot an hour before that. Keep in mind, UCF wants you park in C, D, and F; but you know better than that. The campus roads are going to be filled with stressed out parents and crazy aunts and screaming kids all rushing to find Gemini Boulevard and missing their turns and freaking out because they need to get a good seat. You’ve been at this campus long enough to know that the easiest place to park will be H and I. Plus that gives you a chance to stop at Starbucks before you trek down Memory Mall.\nUCF is not lining up by GPA, nor alphabetically. You, along with a swarm of other students you’ve never seen before, will be rounded up and lined up according to your school. Where you stand in the line determines where you sit for the ceremony. Front of the line equals front seat, etc.\nI’ve heard it said that the best place to sit is in the back. That way once it’s your turn to cross the stage, the whole thing is over and you’re free to go. Compared to crossing the stage early and then you’re stuck for another hour waiting, wondering if your family got a good picture of you stumbling across stage, laughing because the announcer doesn’t know how to pronounce your friend’s name or crying because you your hair was in the way when the photographer took your picture. Once you’re sitting down, the fun begins. You’ll hear from faculty and staff, the Valedictorian, and a special guest speaker.\nOn Friday, Alan Ginsberg will be guest-speaking to graduates of the College of Education and Human Performance, the College of Health and Public Affairs, and the Rosen College of Hospitality Management. Alan Ginsberg is a big-time donor to UCF and many Central Florida establishments. According to his bio-page on the Lowndes Attorney page, he’s donated millions of dollars to the Rollins Hamilton Holt School, is active in UCF’s Jewish studies and its Hillel Foundation, but what he is might be best known for is his $4 million dollar donation to UCF’s College of Medicine.\nSaturday’s commencement ceremony is graduating students from the College of Medicine, the College of Optics and Photonics, The College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Business administration. But you lot will be hearing from guest-speaker Beverly Seay, a chair on the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s deans advisory board, STEM advocate and member of the UCF Board of Trustees.\nThe College of Arts and Humanities, the College of Nursing, the College of Sciences, the College of Graduate Studies, and the Office of Undergraduate Studies will all be graduating on Friday afternoon. That’s Friday the 12th. You, my fellow graduates, will have the privilege of listening to the 2012 Orlando Magazine’s 46th most powerful person in Orlando – a man best known for being Central Florida’s very own Olivia Pope. He is a founding member of the UCF Board of Trustees, is on the Board of Directors for ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, and is the CEO of Knob Hill Companies, and was the Senior Vice-president of Corporate Affairs for Darden Restaurants.\nBut it doesn’t really matter who you get to listen to. You’re graduating. After it’s all done, take the back roads off campus. Keep away from minivans and make your way safely to the nearest bar that doesn’t have the word “knight” in its name.

1968,UCF,2016-09-02,journal_data/txt/UCF/2016_09_02.txt,"['\nA young woman attends a sexual morality conference at the Student Union, listening intently.\nIn front of her, a panel of religious leaders discusses their views on gender equality, homosexuality, and transgender visibility. It’s an odd topic, to be sure, but one that she said she finds fascinating. She studiously takes notes throughout.\nWhen asked why she was personally invested in the conference, her answer was simple.\n“I’m gay and I want to be a rabbi,” she said. “So I want to promote a better cultural understanding within religion.”\nKayla Symonds, a sophomore religion and cultural studies major at UCF, is the president of BAGELS+, a club for Jewish members of the LGBTQ+ community. BAGELS+ (an acronym for Bisexual, Asexual, Gay, Exploring and Lesbian Students) is a part of Central Florida Hillel, a Jewish cultural center for college students in the Central Florida area. As president of BAGELS+, Symonds plans events such as celebrations of Jewish holidays and scriptural readings.\n“There’s a lot more of us than you’d think,” Symonds said.\nAccording to Central Florida Hillel’s mission page, UCF has the third largest Jewish student population outside of Israel, with an estimated 6,000 Jewish students attending. UCF is also well-known for its LGBTQ+ inclusive\xa0environment – it’s the only Florida school to make Campus Pride’s Top 50 LGBT-Friendly List as of 2014. The combined support from the Jewish and LGBTQ+ community made UCF the perfect environment for BAGELS+ to flourish.\nSymonds began working at Central Florida Hillel as a community engagement intern. She found her niche in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community after recognizing the need for more involvement.\n“I’ve always found the struggles of the Jewish community and the LGBTQ+ community linked,” Symonds said. “Anti-Semitism and homophobia are two issues we still face today. And being a member of both communities means being a minority within a minority.”\nSam Friedman, director of community relations at Central Florida Hillel, also recognized the importance of BAGELS+.\n“One of the things we’re most proud of is forming BAGELS+,” Friedman said. “We pride ourselves on being a center for the community, and the community means everybody.\nFor Symonds, Judaism is the foundation of her identity. She keeps her diet kosher, has a mezuzah (a scroll with Hebrew verses from the Torah) on her door, and observes Shabbat. A common misconception, she said, is believing that her religion conflicts with her sexuality.\n“When people find out that I’m gay and Jewish, they ask, ‘do you really believe in it [Judaism]?’, and the answer is yes. Yes, I am gay. Yes, I am religious. And yes, I am observant.”\nHomosexuality is a divisive issue within the Jewish community. The more conservative Orthodox Judaism generally disapproves of homosexuality, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism are more tolerant. Central Florida Hillel is firmly LGBTQ+ friendly.\n“Some Jewish organizations say that homosexuality is expressly forbidden in the book of Leviticus,” Friedman said. “But Abraham, the first Jew, was known for welcoming every guest that came to his tent. You can’t be like Abraham if you’re not going to welcome everybody.”\n“In Judaism, we have an expression: two Jews, three opinions. So a lot of different people will say a lot of different things,” Symonds said. “I firmly believe that it is up to you to interpret the text, and for me, the text embraces my identity.”\nAfter graduating UCF, Symonds said she plans to spend a year in Jerusalem before attending Hebrew Union College to continue her rabbinical studies. The college has campuses in Cincinnati, Jerusalem, Los Angeles and New York, but Symonds said she’s not sure where she wants to study just yet.\n“It depends on how things go with my girlfriend. We’re looking at schools near her,” Symonds said.\nSymonds said her faith in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community was reaffirmed in February.\nSymonds is active on Tumblr, and read the story of a German transgender woman who wanted to convert to Judaism. Her rabbi warned her that the beit din (a group of rabbis that oversee the conversion process) might require her to compromise her gender identity.\n“I thought that I might be able to help, so I emailed a friend who works with French Jewish LGBTQ+ organizations,” Symonds said. “My friend ended up forwarding the email to Frank Giaoui, the president of the World Congress of GLBT Jews. And he emailed the former president. One thing led to another, and they found a beit din that would help her convert.”\n“Seeing so many people respond was affirming,” Symonds said. “We have another expression: he who saves one life saves the world entire. I truly believe that.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2016/09/jewish-lgbt-club-leader-reaches-minorities-within-minorities/'],0.8391502499580383,0.46421852707862854,0.6402342319488525

Check back periodically for further updates.\nStudents woke up alarmed Monday morning after seeing multiple fliers put up by a white nationalist group called American Vanguard, which took credit for them on social media.\nThe fliers featured white men and women on a black backdrop with slogans like “WE HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST” and “FREE YOURSELF FROM CULTURAL MARXISM.” Each had the information for the group’s social media pages.\nAt least 27 copies were found on nine buildings around campus, including 10 in the John T. Washington Breezeway, four on the Student Union, and two on the ROTC building–according to an independent count by Knight News.

But police spokeswoman Courtney Gilmartin said in an e-mail to Knight News that a “review” is currently underway.\n“Yesterday UCFPD removed about 30 of these posters from various campus buildings, including classroom buildings, parking garages, and the Student Union. It is difficult to say how many were posted total, since others were likely taken down before UCFPD could recover them,” she said.\nCommunity leaders have already begun speaking out. Central Florida Hillel issued a statement on Facebook calling on students to report “racism, xenophobia, and discrimination.”\n“Central Florida Hillel (CFH) was disheartened to see these posters on campus today. While we respect everyone’s constitutional right to free speech, particularly speech that we disagree with, we are concerned that the messages in these posters could lead to divisiveness and hatred on campus,” it said.\nIt continued: “Freedom of speech does not include incitement to violence and this concept has been implicitly upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n“CFH is opposed to racism, xenophobia and discrimination and will continue our opposition to these concepts no matter who is promoting them on our campuses.\n“We will remain aware and vigilant in the face of these recruitment techniques and as always we ask of everyone, “if you see something, say something.”\nThe Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Florida this afternoon addressed the fliers and also called on the public speak against racism.\n“The Nazis called for rule by an Aryan elite in Germany, excluding all others. This poster found hanging on a wall at the University of Central Florida is eerily reminiscent of the rhetoric and imagery that they used. Now more than ever we must STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT against all appeals to racism,” the statement said.\nAmerican Vanguard responded to UCF Hillel on Twitter, saying: “We never said anything about hate, but if you deny us our right to exist, you are an enemy that must be defeated.” The group also shared a screenshot of the Holocaust Memorial’s statement.\nEven though the group claims not to have said anything about hate on their fliers, its online manifesto explicitly espouses white supremacist ideas, including calling for “total war” against a “System (sic)…that blatantly works against White Americans, the very race that built this country in the first place.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2016/11/white-supremacist-group-takes-credit-for-on-campus-fliers/'],0.37770333886146545,0.9135482907295227,0.5795048475265503

For UCF senior Zack Levine, however, it meant combing through hours of Jimmy Fallon videos and learning guitar chords.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Levine, 20, posted an application video on YouTube for an internship position at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In the video, Levine travels all over the UCF main campus playing a guitar and expressing his qualifications to Fallon through song.\nLevine’s work on the video began as early as February when he wrote the first draft of the lyrics, incorporating plenty of references for Tonight Show fans to enjoy, such as name drops of announcer Steve Higgins an in-house band leader Questlove. The lyrics are sung over the music of Fallon’s 2012 song about the BP oil spill “Balls in Your Mouth,” with Levine only learning to play the guitar over the summer. When the time came to record his vocals, he called in a favor with friends in his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, who let him use their recording studio.\nAs for the video itself, Levine began by editing together clips of Fallon to match the lyrics he had written from him, including self-deprecating comments about Levine’s lack of job prospects as a Radio and Television major. Levine shot his portion of the video over Labor Day weekend with the help of fellow RTV student Josh Staniszewski. Taking advantage of the nearly empty campus, they were able to get plenty of shots of Levine performing at Memory Mall, the reflection pond, the Student Union, and even inside several class buildings.\nBefore deciding on the RTV major, Levine originally intended to study Film through the BFA program. When he was not accepted, he decided to pursue RTV instead, with the Cinema Studies BA program as a minor. He has held three production-based internships this year: a practicum learning course at UCF and internships at MoneyShow.com and Central Florida Hillel, the latter of which he currently holds.\nHis main passion is comedy, though, which began as early as high school. At UCF, he has performed at three improv comedy clubs and Knights Got Talent and been active in the registered student organization The Improv Academy. He also worked as a food runner at the Orlando Improv comedy club, which allowed him to meet such comedians as Jay Pharoah of Saturday Night Live and a personal hero of his, stand-up comedian Jo Koy.\nLevine hopes that working with The Tonight Show will be the first step in him working professional in comedy. When asked why he chose Fallon’s show over other late night shows, Levine said, “Fallon is simply the king of late night… He will go down as the GOAT in late night comedy when he retires… He is an influence to me as I’m sure he is to thousands of other students looking to get into comedy or late night.”\nIf Levine is selected, it won’t be his first time seeing Fallon. He got front row seats as an audience member in an April 2017 episode taped in Orlando in which Fallon interviewed Vin Diesel. “Getting to watch the show live was an unforgettable experience,” Levine said. “Fallon is just such a powerful presence. To be in the same room with him was incredible.”\nLevine said, “I hope, if chosen, I can represent UCF, and the city of Orlando to the best of my ability.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2017/10/ucf-student-hopes-to-sing-his-way-into-a-late-night-internship/'],0.5810015797615051,0.30642038583755493,0.03127729520201683

On the backs of the students, were white stickers proclaiming, “Never Forget,” a phrase that became unanimous with holocaust memorial by Elie Wiesel, a holocaust survivor. \nThese students were marching In observance of Yom Ha’Shoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Nu Delta chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi organized ‘We Walk To Remember’ on Thursday at the University of Central Florida. AEPi chapters across the nation partnered with B’nai B’rith International, a Jewish service organization, to stage similar marches throughout college campuses.\nAttendees held signs emblazoned with the Star of David, as well as slogans such as “We Remember” and another quote from Wiesel, “To forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.” Others wore Israeli flags draped over their shoulders, and a gay pride flag with a Star of David was held at the front of the procession.\nThose participating were given small flyers to hand out, explaining the reasoning behind their silent walk. It highlighted the atrocities of the holocaust, not only to Jews but also to the millions of others who perished.\nParticipants walked silently from the John C. Hitt Library to the CFE Federal Credit Union Arena, where a small service was held. During the service, speakers encouraged attendees to never forget those who were lost, and 11 candles were lit in remembrance of the lives lost during the holocaust.\nSpeakers included Rabbi Ethan Paris, Dr. Kenneth Hanson, the program director for Judaic studies at UCF and Andrew Weil, the executive director and CEO of Hillel Central Florida. Paris led the crowd in a recitation of Kaddish, a Jewish prayer typically recited for the dead.\n“This is something we really can’t forget,” Said Harrison Faerman, the Jewish Identity Leader of AEPi. “Don’t just remember that we did [this] today, we’re going to do it again, and again, and again, because if we don’t do this… then we forget.

Weil now said he was wrong.\nWeil is the Director of Central Florida Hillel Center for Jewish Life. Hate crimes have risen in the U.S. by 21 percent since 2013, according to the FBI. Weil attended the Synagogue that experienced the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation that killed 11 people and injured seven. The mass shooting, Oct. 7 2018, was the deadliest attack on Jews in American history.\n “As a college student in the 80s I told my dad the whole concept of anti-Semitism is over,” Weil said. “That Armageddon that swept across Europe during WWII burns out that kind of small thinking, and people are not cosmopolitan.”\nWeil now said he was wrong about anti-Semtism being over.\n“My dad said anti-Semitism flows it goes up and it goes down, and it’s going to come back,” Weil said. And look 30 years later it came back.”\nLast month on Christmas morning anti-Semitic graffiti was found on campus south of the University and Alafaya intersection.\nNirit Gelfer, an Israel Fellow at the Hillel Center for Jewish Life at UCF, said she was surprised to hear the news.\n“I was surprised that I saw it on campus because I did not feel any anti-Semitism from the moment I moved here,” Gelfer said. “It is unfortunate for me to know that there is still such hatred in our times. I’m thinking that any hatred directed at a particular group should be condemned.”\nAccording to the FBI There were 973 hate crimes against Jews reported in the U.S. in 2017. Anti-Semitic hate crimes were 58 percent of all hate crimes against a religious group, and 13 percent of all hate crimes in 2017.\nWeil said anti-Semitism derives from emotion not reason. Some examples of anti-Semetic ideologies are the Nationalist Socialist, which was the political ideology of Nazi Germany, or the Ku Klux Klan, an American White Supremacy hate group.\nThe increase in hate crimes against Jews isn’t only in the United States. Hate crimes against Jewish people in Canada grew by 24 percent in the last two reported years. In 2016 178 Jewish hate crimes were reported, compared to 221 crimes in 2017, according to Canadian Hate Crime Stats.\n“If someone is filled with hatred, and hates Jews, it doesn’t matter if they’re rich or poor, successful or not, alive or dead,” Weil said.\nMark Winton, a UCF criminal justice associate lecturer who researches hate crimes, said hate crimes are transparent and punishable by law. But the complex part is hate speech where individuals can be radicalized online is a big issue, Winton said. The digital age has allowed many individuals to become radicalized online.\n“Hate speech is protected under the First Amendment regardless of how radical someone’s speech may be or foreshadowing of hate crimes,” Winton said. “Until an individual or group makes a clear threat, law enforcement is not required to get involved.”\nAccording to Pew Research Center, people of the Jewish faith make up almost 2 percent of the U.S. population as of 2014.\nStephen Holmes, a UCF criminal justice associate professor who researches and studies murderers, said he believes people are increasingly targeting places of worship because attacking a place of worship sends a strong message.\n“If you can’t be safe there, you can’t be safe in any public area,” Holmes said. “Places of worship are a rich target area for people who harbor hate because they send a clear message of fear.”\n“We’ve had shootings in a lot of places but a church or a synagogue is a place people go to worship,” Holmes said. “A place [where] you should be protected.”\nWeil remembered instances of discrimination he said he had faced in his youth where on a rare occasion someone would tell him “Jew you down,” which he described as a negative stereotype of Jewish people’s bargaining habits. Weil also said he had an experience where an individual threw pennies at him. However, Weil stated one memory sticks out to him the most.\nWeil said he remembers when he was younger an encounter he had while opposing a Ku Klux Klan rally in Georgia, where he participated as part of a large counter-protest.\nWeil ended up in the same restroom as a KKK member, who was dressed in a full robe and Capirote hood, he said.\nThe KKK member, with his young son by his side, asked Weil how he was doing, Weil said.\nWeil said he responded with, “I’m good, how are you?” that he remembers the moment as “normal.”\n“I’m thinking to myself, how ironic — here we stand together at the urinal … and he was completely nice to me,” Weil said. “And then after, he turns right and went toward his group, and I went toward my group. And we yelled and they yelled, and I’m thinking, ‘but back in the bathroom … ‘”\nWeil said we are living in an extremely polarizing time, and that people are becoming more comfortable to being intolerant or discriminatory again.\n“We’re living in very challenging times, where America is ripping itself apart,” Weil said. “We’re seeing it in both political parties, where anti-Semitism has been dormant but has never really gone away.”\nHolmes, echoing the sentiment raised by Weil’s father, said that the current amount of hateful speech is a part of unpredictable “waves” within society’s evolution and that it’s normal to see a steep rise and a steep fall in hate crimes as humanity evolves.\nWeil said the key to dismantling the mindset of prejudice begins with ending generalizations of other people.\n“Hatred begins when you say, ‘those people’ — that’s when you know you are wrong,” Weil said. “Everything that follows after that sentence is wrong. The mere notion of ‘those people’ ignores the human individuality in everyone.”\nWeil said he describes himself along with the Jewish population of UCF and Orlando as resilient in the wake of hatred.\n“There was a significant amount of fear in the community around the time that this happened,” Weil said. “Since then, the community has been galvanized and together with generous support from other communities. There is a great feeling of optimism over the almost overwhelming outpouring of support for Jewish people in the United States that has really been reassuring.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2019/01/ucf-jewish-leaders-discuss-hate-crime-increase-after-christmas-day-incident/'],0.2972997725009918,0.7560662627220154,0.3683413565158844

A full room of UCF Jewish students gathered close together in Hillel’s Rabbi Israel Abisror’s living room to hear the story of her parents who survived.\n“I still have nightmares,” Beckman said. “I never heard my father scream. But I knew he screamed every night. His dream was that they were chasing the kids and he had to protect us.”\nBeckman’s father Philip, 94, was born in Krakow Poland in 1924, he was one of six siblings who survived out of 13. Beckman said her father was 14 when the Holocaust started and his parents wanted to send him to the countryside, but he snuck into the ghetto to be with his dad. The Ghettos were so crowded he had to sleep on the floor in the hallway which put him on the front line.\n“He talks about how he had to move bodies, and how scary it was because he would watch them take their last breath,” Debora Beckman said.\nDebora Beckman said her father dodged death countless times. He recalled one day being part of a large group, the two groups were separated one half was to be killed and one was to work. Beckman said her father didn’t know it at the time, he took a guess and snuck to the side that was to work.\nThe group he snuck into had to do grueling jobs while malnourished, including carrying heavy rocks a specific way up 180 steps or intense lashings. These lashings left him 80 and 50 percent deaf in his left and right ear. Her father experienced some mornings people getting shot at random and there was a time he was almost shot.\nDebora Beckman shared her perspective on being raised by survivors.\n“The unsettling feeling is always there,” Debora Beckman said. “There was always a little sadness in them, and a little joy because they survived it.”\nJonah Keen, a junior statistics major, shared why he attends events like this.\n“The number of Holocaust survivors are dwindling,” Keen said. “It’s very important to me to hear firsthand accounts before it’s too late to hear them.”\nMitchell Bloomer, a resource teacher at the Holocaust Center in Orlando shared why he believes sharing personal stories of Holocaust survivors is important.\n“I think remembering the persecution is important,” Bloomer said. “I think it’s important to see how persecution of any group of people, expands our community of concern outside to all people.”']",['https://knightnews.com/2019/01/holocaust-survivors-daughter-shared-her-fathers-survival-story-to-ucf/'],0.8481692671775818,0.08308789879083633,0.10136976838111877

Weil said the trip also had a variety of religious denominations such as Greek Orthodox, Baptist, and Catholics. Weil said he plans on offering this trip every year.\n\n“The idea of the trip is to provide a three-dimensional experience in Israel for senior student leaders,” Weil said. “We don’t want to just show a Disney World version of all the things that make Israel wonderful. We also want to have the conversations on the challenges that Israel faces.”\nGray said he came to the trip with an open mind and just wanted to learn and experience as much as he could.\n“We were at the Golan Heights, which at one point was ISIS [Islamic State] controlled territory, and IDF [Israeli Defense Force] soldiers at the border of Israel and Lebanon and would allow ISIS soldiers who were injured in the country and give them free medical care,” Gray said.  “It was the beauty of the humanity in it; that these people can be at war in one minute and helping each other the next.”\nGray said the trip allowed them to hear both voices at the table firsthand without the media. A moment that came as a surprise to them was when they were able to speak to the Deputy Prime Minister of Palestine Ziad Abu Amr and hear his perspective.\n“Just having that discussion with him and talking about their view of America, because of America’s support for Israel, and of how America has interjected was very eye opening,” Gray said.\nMills shared a memorable moment when they had listened to a speaker from the Southern District in Israel.\n“She talked about how she had grown up in a very high missile territory, and there were bomb shelters within every 60 seconds that you could run too,” Mills said. “She talked about her house getting bombed in the middle of the night.

She said the takeaway for her was even though there are vast differences between the two sides this as a major step forward for community growth and unity.\n “Schools are at the true core, and it’s how you change the conflict,” Mills said. “Because not only are the parents interacting the children are as well.
