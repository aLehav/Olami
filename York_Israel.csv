The spot is a security risk due to poor lighting, according to a student-conducted safety audit released Oct. 3.\nThe safety audit, completed by students in the faculty of environmental studies, highlighted the areas around the HNES building that lack adequate security measures to protect students.\nThe audit suggested the university improve the building’s security prevention measures by installing more appropriate lighting, as well as by defining pathways, fixing broken lights and installing emergency phones outside the building.\nAngela Clasadonte, a third-year political science student, agreed with the audit, noting there is not enough lighting in some campus areas.\n“I think there should be more lighting. It is very dark at night on campus and I think we need more security at night in places that are not well lit.”\nThe female student who was robbed at the HNES building was walking with a friend while two male suspects allegedly snatched her purse and fled. Police are looking for two black males, both wearing black clothing and aged 17 to 18 years old.\nTinku Chowdary, a first-year business and society major, is concerned about walking around campus at night and is worried that York security isn’t prepared for the winter. “A lot of people have classes until 10 p.m. and at winter, it gets dark early, so [York] should increase security during wintertime,” said Chowdary.\nThe most recent incident occurred on Oct. 24 while a male student was walking near the Williams Small Centre and two males grabbed his cell phone and fleed the scene.\nAccording to Toronto police, two suspects were located and later arrested and charged, but police will not release the suspects’ names. Police found a replica handgun on them.\nAccording to York security, another student was allegedly assaulted and robbed by three male suspects Oct. 19. The incident occurred around 8 p.m. on the lower floor of York’s Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) building. A York female community member was sitting on the bench by herself, with her Blackberry cell phone placed beside her. The three males allegedly shoved her, took her Blackberry and ran. Police are still looking for the suspects.\nThe victim described the males as black and wearing black jackets and baseball caps.\nA male student was robbed of his cellphone Oct. 22 while he was waiting for the VIVA bus on the station near the Ontario Archives building. According to York security, the suspect is described as male, six-foot-two, approximately 20 to 25 years of age and wearing black sweatpants.\nToronto police and York security are still determining whether there are any connections between these incidents.\nYork security has advised students to be more aware of their surroundings and vigilant of people when talking on their cell phone or walking in isolated campus areas.\nThe Toronto police are looking for male suspects in relation to all the robberies that have occurred.\nPlease contact York Security Services at 416-736-5333, or Toronto police, Division 31 at 416-808-3100, if you have any information on these robberies.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nCassandra Chin\nCONTRIBUTOR\nThe Ontario New Democratic Party counted York University among the several Ontario universities allegedly spending public funds – almost $500,000 worth on York’s part – on lobbyists, hired private-sector advocates paid to sway provincial government policy.\nAccording to York, however, that money was not spent on lobbying the government, but on consulting firms to help secure assets and information for future York projects.\nIn an Oct. 5 press release from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the Freedom of Information request filed by the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) showed York spends more funds on private lobbying groups than any other university in the province.\nAccording to a statement released by York Oct. 6, the university had contracts with three companies registered as lobby groups – the Counsel Public Af- fairs (CPA), the Devon Group and EcoNexus – but hired them as consultants, not lobbyists.\nAlex Bilyk, York’s director of media relations, said York hired these firms as consultants because York didn’t have the resources or staff to head these projects.\nKrisna Saravanamuttu, president of the York Federation of Students (YFS), said of the money spent on consultants that, since the CUPE 3903 strike, which shut down the university during the 2008-2009 academic year for almost three months, “York has been crying poor.”\n“Where in the world did York find almost $500,000 to fund these lobby groups, when really lobbying is the job of the senior administrators and a properly composed Board of Governors?” he said.\nBilyk said that the university has a budget to hire consultants and that York did not go over that budget.\n“Perhaps Saravanamuttu has not read [York’s Oct. 6] statement and maybe he does not understand how the university works,” said Bilyk.\nAccording to York, from Jan- uary to June 2010 The Devon Group provided strategic coun- sel and guidance for additional venues for the upcoming Pan Am Games 2015, which resulted in the letter of intent York offered event organizers regarding the university’s willingness to host some of the activities.\nThe statement further explains that from February 2008 to January 2009, the university worked with the CPA in looking at potentially establishing a medical school at York. Bilyk said CPA helped York put together a business plan for the York medical school.\nThe York statement also said that CPA assisted with labour relations during that time.\nYork hired EcoNexus from 2008 to 2010 to focus on creating a research project on climate change and environmental research. The York statement also said that project lead Karan Kraft Sloan is a registered federal lobbyist; however, in this instance, she was not lobbying the government.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nBrittany Goldfield-Rodriguez\nEDITORIAL INTERN\nGlenn Ulrich remembers when Jordan Hanley generously gave his number four Georgina Ice hockey jersey, which he wore for several years, to his little brother when he joined the team, due to a lack of jerseys.\n“That is just the kind of a guy he was – very generous,” said Ulrich.\nUlrich, president of the Georgina Ice hockey club, said that Hanley’s parents, teammates and the whole community is in “utter shock” over the death of the 23-year-old York student. Hanley, a fourth-year kinesiology student and a passionate hockey player for the past four years, died Oct. 11.\nUlrich said that after Hanley died, his family decided to keep him on life support to preserve his body, so that his organs could be donated to the Trillium Foundation.\n“Jordan was the type of guy who would come up to you from across the room and say ‘hi,’” he said.\nHanley was also involved with his church in Keswick. Ulrich describes Hanley as an “extremely giving” person who was heavily involved in his community. The funeral took place on Oct.\n15 and, according to Ulrich, more than 500 people came out to say final goodbyes to Hanley.\n“It was a very moving and emotional day for everyone. Keswick’s community really came together for Jordan,” he said.\nEveryone at the funeral was wearing green ribbons to symbolize their support for organ dona- tion to the Trillium Foundation, Ulrich added.\n“It’s a big loss for our community of 18,000 people.

The individuals were also provided with an auditory clip where a 20-second passage was spoken in English.\nFollowing this exercise, the subjects were questioned on the visual and auditory-only models, both separately and in conjunction.\nAlthough people diagnosed with prosopagnosia relied upon the auditory clip to recognize faces, this did not apply to recognizing objects. The study suggested that the human brain uses two separate neurological areas when identifying\xa0 people and objects.\nWith files from YFile\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAlexandra Posadzki\nCUP ONTARIO BUREAU CHIEF\nTORONTO (CUP) – Two Ontario universities are teetering on the edge of a strike, with faculty unions at both schools voted overwhelmingly in favour of walking off the job.\nOn Oct. 1, the Faculty Association at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont. voted 87 percent in favour of a strike, Helen Connell, the associate vice-president of communications for the university, confirmed. The union represents more than 1,400 full and part-time faculty members at Western.\nJames Compton, president of University of Western Ontario Faculty Assocation, said the key issue for faculty is a series of proposals put forth by the university that centralizes administrative control over yearly faculty reviews and make them subject to performance management techniques that are counter to scholarly practices.\nThese proposals would have a centralized board overseeing faculty reviews, rather than the reviews being considered individually within each discipline. Tenured professors who receive a bad review in one area, for instance, could be disciplined or even dismissed.\n“This would weaken the role of peer evaluation and collegial self-government,” said Compton. He adds that the proposal would weaken the tenure system, which is a major support of academic freedom.\n“Professors that have precarious employment are going to be less likely to speak out and do research and teaching on controversial topics than they would otherwise,” noted Compton.\n“And that is bad for the university, it’s bad for students, it’s bad for classrooms, it’s bad for the broader community, because that is the ma- jor public good that’s produced by the university. It’s what separates universities from high school.”\nWestern also faces the prospect of a staff strike after the union, representing close to 1,200 administrative and technical staff, voted 95 percent in favour of a strike on Oct. 5 and 6, said Deborah Novakowski, the union president.\nNovakowski said the staff union’s chief concern is job security.\nMeanwhile, professors at Carleton University in Ottawa voted 88.5 percent for a strike mandate on Oct. 4 and 5, the union’s website asserts.\nJason MacDonald, director of communications at Carleton, said the university does not believe that the union has the right to strike in this round of bargaining, however.\nMacDonald said that according to the current collective agreement, the union should have filed their intent to reserve the right to strike three months before their contract expired, something they didn’t do.\nIn the event that an agreement cannot be reached, the parties should proceed to binding arbitration, said MacDonald.\nNeither Western nor Carleton would divulge whether or not classes would be cancelled in the event of a strike, which has left many students anxious.\nNicole Lippay, a fourth-year English student at Western, is scared that a strike might prevent her from graduating.\n“I’ve worked so hard to get this far,” said Lippay. “And now at the last possible minute they’re going to go on strike?”\nLippay rents a room in a house in downtown London. If a strike does occur, she will have to continue to pay for that room–even if she wants to go home to Uxbridge, Ont. to work. She will also have to scramble to find somewhere to stay if the semester gets extended, as her lease is up at the end of April.\nLippay is concerned that a condensed semester would sacrifice the quality of education that she will receive; however, she also sympathizes with the faculty’s issues around academic freedom.\n“Most of the professors I’ve had are very passionate about what they talk about. They talk very freely about what’s concerning them, and they make an effort for students to get involved in the discussion,” said Lippay.\nNegotiations at both universities are ongoing. Connell said that Wester has several negotiation dates set, including Nov. 1 and 2, when both sides will meet with the provincial mediator who has been appointed to assist them in reaching a settlement.\n“I believe there’s a lot of good will on both sides to reach an agreement,” said Connell.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAntonella Cangelosi\nContibutor\nYork student Zina Rakhamilova feels the reason students are stuck waiting for access to the public computers may be because of the new Scott Library renovations, unveiled to the York community Oct. 20.\n“I need computers, especially in-between breaks,” said Rakhamilova, a second-year psychology student.\n“Before, when we had all the computers here, it was a lot easier [for students].”\nAccording to Mark Robertson, an associate university librarian, the old computers from the second floor have been relocated temporarily to the fourth and fifth floors of Scott Library, as 120 new computers will be set up in separate sections all around the second floor to replace the 100 old ones.\nRobertson said that to increase student workspace the layout of the second floor has been widely expanded.\n“There will be a possibility of additional renovation that would add even more seats and computers to the library,” he said.\nAccording to Robertson, this particular project is still pending due to lack of funding.\nDale Findlay, a first-year student in the second entry-nursing program, said that she does not feel she was informed about the new changes.\n“I’m not too sure what they are doing with the renovations,” said Findlay. “I haven’t really been informed of anything, but hopefully they will be able to expand the study area to make it more suitable for students to study.”\nAisha Mohamoud, a first-year health studies, likes the renovations.\n“[Students] have a lot of space to study with groups of people, they have space to eat, space to chill, sit down,” she said.\n“I think it’s a good idea. I liked it when I came in.”\nAccording to Robertson, the library is planning to place signs on the second floor to keep students informed about the changes.', 'New renovations at the library have students looking for computers.

David Noble mailed a letter to the university’s president, Mamdouh Shoukri, about York’s policies on student club activities, he received an official response from the administration, as well as several unsolicited press releases from on and off campus Jewish groups.\nNoble, whose original letter to Shoukri alleged the Hillel@York Jewish student group serves as, “in effect, an agent of a foreign government,” said he was “dismayed” after having gone over the content of the response letter.\n“It is the right of any community member to express his or her view within the law and without fear of intimidation or harassment,” wrote Rob Tiffin, vice-president students at York, in a letter to Noble dated Oct. 21. “This extends to the members of a student organization such as Hillel.”\nNoble, who is on sabbatical this academic year, is not satisfied with the response. “They’re not answering the question,” he said.\n“It’s much more than disappointment. I’m dismayed.”\n“[York] is continuing to endorse Hillel’s acting as a de facto agent of a foreign government,” Noble added.\n“The significance of Tiffin’s letter is that the university has now moved from a tacit endorsement […] that any state that wants to establish themselves using a student organi- zation as a lobbying agency is now officially sanctioned. That’s what that letter means.”\nTiffin’s letter noted that, according to Presidential Regulation 4, a “student organization” is defined as a group of students who voluntarily congregate with common interest, and may include “organizations formed for purposes of carrying forward a particular activity, cause or project” and not necessarily associated with an academic discipline.\nBrandon Crandall, president of Hillel@ York, insisted his club does not work for any governmental organization and is in full compliance with university rules and regulations.\n“We’ve been on campus as the primary voice for Jewish life and for non-Jewish students who are interested in Judaism and Jewish culture,” he said. “We hold no political alliances with any parties […] we firmly deny being agents of a foreign government.”\nNoble’s take on Hillel@York’s activities was apparently inspired by a Facebook group called “Israel Affairs – Hillel @ York,” moderated by Jennifer Cogan Diamond, who, according to the Hillel of Greater Toronto website, is the Israel Affairs Program Associate for the Toronto organization.\nNoble attached a screen capture of the group’s front page to his initial letter. The group’s description begins, “We are the advocates for Israel on York campus.”\nWhen asked about the “Israel Affairs” Facebook group, Crandall explained that the group is indeed involved with Hillel@York, but that their support for Israel is historically rooted in the Jewish faith.\nMeanwhile, several Jewish and Israeli groups both on and off campus expressed disdain for Noble’s interpretation of Hillel@York’s activities. Sammy Katz, managing director of the Canadian Network for Israel Affairs and former president of Hasbara at York, felt that Noble was unjustified in condemning Hillel as serving as an agent of a foreign government. “Supporting Israel on campus does not mean that you are acting on behalf of a foreign government,” Katz said in an Oct. 20 press release.\n“Rather, students and organizations that support Israel on campus are supporting democracy, human rights, equality and peace.” Aaron Rosenberg, president of B’nai Brith OnCampus York, felt that Noble’s claims were isolating Jewish student groups on campus.\n“Numerous groups and a large number of students at York University […] stand behind the democratic Jewish State of Israel,” said Rosenberg in a statement made to Excalibur.\n“[Noble] continues to make a mockery of this university’s claimed policies of inclusion. Should this be tolerated at our proudly multicultural university?”\nNoble is still pursuing a defamation lawsuit he filed in 2006 against Hillel of Great- er Toronto, as well as several other Jewish groups and the York University Foundation, for $19 million in relation to press releases they’d issued about a pamphlet he’d distributed in 2004.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nYuni Kim\nAssistant News Editor\n \n(Excalibur Archives//Pippin Lee)\n \nMinutes after poll booths were closed and ballots counted Oct. 25, Rob Ford was declared the next mayor of Toronto.\nSome Torontonians were torn between the two main mayoral candidates, Rob Ford and George Smitherman, but a number of stu- dents, like Jacob Wylde, knew exactly for whom they were voting.\n“I voted for Rob Ford because he knows what’s wrong with this city,” said the third-year kinesiology student. “He knows how to fix the city’s [debt] problem. Toronto is in an amazing amount of debt, and no one else who was running talked about it.”\nSome remained unsure of who should get their vote until the last minute. When asked before the election, third-year English major Janette Parucha said for her the decision would come down to either Smitherman or Pantalone.\n“I’m leaning away from Rob Ford,” she said. “I’ve heard bad things about Ford, but I’m not sure who I’m going to vote for.”\nWhile many students were torn between the three candidates, others expressed disinterest in the municipal elections.\n“I don’t really have a reason for why I’m not voting,” said Em- manuelle Bakos, a first-year sociology student. “I’m just not really involved in political aspects of things, so I don’t really know much about what is going on.”\nVanessa Hunt, vice-president of campus life for the York Fed- eration of Students (YFS), said the student union did not endorse any particular candidate, instead opting to educate the student body about the mayoral candidates.\n“We provided students with information about issues that we feel relate to students […] related to public transit, sustainability and housing,” she said, encouraging students to be informed about candidates before casting their ballot.\n“From what I’ve seen and heard, students are very involved at the municipal level,” said Hunt. “It’s about making sure that you’re informed so that when you go to the polls to make a decision, you really know who you’re voting for instead of just voting for a candidate because you’ve heard of them.”\nYFS president Krisna Saravan- amuttu was optimistic about the changes Toronto may see under Ford over the next four years.\n“I hope that Rob Ford will maintain the great things about Toronto,” he said. “We hope that […] he will work towards an in- clusive environment for everyone in the city.”\nWith files from Lexee Hoene and Brittany Goldfield-Rodriguez\n ', 'ask yourselves the question\nwhy did the biggest bofoon and ridicule on city councill for the last 5 years get the most votes of any politician in canada…  EVER.\nKrisna is not optimistic.

It was designed by a group of people that must sincerely believe that the Apple Store, a bright, chairless room, is the height of architectural majesty, and that scrolling red LED displays are the future of information technology.\nThe computer room has been scrapped; in its place you’ll find a pleasantly lit area containing five booths sitting about eight people each, a random smattering of chairs and a couple of truly confusing arrow-shaped table-chair things.\nThe arrow forms a circle, and in the middle is a single plastic chair. York U has gone avant-garde, and it has no room for plebeians who cannot understand its newly acquired taste.\nAside from getting rid of the easy-to-access computer room that easily housed the better part of 100 desktops and replacing it with a series of tiny coffee booths, what else has happened in the library?\nThe Learning Commons included expanded renovations into previously inaccessible parts of the library, with additional seating in rooms with names like “The Salon” and “The Collaboratory.” Coll– wait! You mean, it’s like a laboratory, in which you collaborate? Brilliant! Give these people a million dollars! That already happened? Well played, Scott Library. Well played.\nI understand the motivation behind the renovations; our dear university is starting to show its age, and kids don’t like studying in outdated, “unhip” areas. Personally speaking, I refuse to write an essay if I’m not in a limo driven by supermodels.\nPublic relations is a huge part of attracting new students to any post-secondary institution, and I have no doubt a few ethnically diverse press photos of students laughing and studying in The Salon will help sway student interest.\nThey wanted to make something new and shiny, and they succeeded. The greatest triumph of the Learning Commons, however, is how it now perfectly reflects the York University experience as a whole.\nThey took a straightforward, easy-to-comprehend area and turned it into a labyrinth – a convoluted waste of money and resources.\nIf that doesn’t scream York, I don’t know what does.\n(Natalie Livshitz)\n ', 'Right on Mike!!\nI laugh everytime I see that space.

The abortion debate is definitely one of the most emotionally charged debates that exist, but there’s apparently nowhere for people to hear and learn about the issues surrounding it anymore.\nIt is frankly unacceptable that several pro-life, tuition-paying students at Carleton University were arrested because they refused to take their protest signs into a closed classroom.\nThese students have the right to a peaceful protest. A protest, by definition, is an expression or declaration of an opposing view. Protesting in a closed classroom isn’t really a protest, now is it?\nUniversity campuses are paid for mainly by the government, and by student tuition. Thus, the campus belongs in part to the students and the government. It seems funny that government-given rights seem to be the ones getting trumped by an administration that is not part of either group.\nAs students, we are challenged to think outside the box, develop our own opinions and listen to those of others, no matter how ridiculous they may sound to us. Heaven forbid we put this into practice and actually try to spread a message to a broader audience or show our disapproval with something going on around us.\nThe fact is, the abortion debate is rarely ever mentioned inside classrooms today. As many of my previous university professors have said, they just don’t want to get into something as emotionally charged as that.\nIf we can’t talk about it in the classroom, and we can’t talk about it out of the classroom, where can we talk about it?\nErin Stewart\n\nRe: “Pro-life students arrested at Car- leton,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nI am appalled to hear pro-life students were arrested at Carleton University Oct. 4, 2010 after attempting to put up a pro-life display on campus. What is this saying to a generation of students who are supposedly in an environment where education and learning are embraced? Pro-life groups on university campuses all over the country are constantly being silenced while groups of the opposite view are openly embraced. Universities should be allowing an atmosphere where students can freely debate those issues that can be hard to face. Why reject all ideas that are different than those of a popular view?\nJust because a view isn’t widely supported in certain arenas, doesn’t mean that it should be swept under the carpet. Canada was built on equality and freedoms. Most take things like freedom of expression and freedom of speech for granted until they are put in a position like these students were. For the sake of this nation, we need to take a stand against this type of injustice.\nRachel Barrett\n\nRe: “YFS Schulich director accused of harassment,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a student from the Schulich School of Business, I would like to commend Gregory Kay for his efforts to try to represent our faculty, which is already underrepresented at our university, at the Canadian Federation of Students annual general meeting. I read in the article that Kay tried to apply to attend the meeting and was refused by another member. This makes me question Jeremy Salter’s comments on the lack of tension between him and Kay, especially since there was controversy surrounding the disqualification of Kay and other members during last year’s election process.\nIn addition to the concerns surrounding Kay’s case, I find it strange YFS board members are not permitted to share information discussed in meetings with non-members. I agree that this demonstrates a lack of transparency in our university’s student union, which is supposed to be working to represent us. I do hope that this issue gets resolved and Kay’s name is cleared, as I have always known him to be an excellent representative who does his best to serve the constituents he represents.\nAlicia Gutierrez\nRe: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a Jewish student at York University, I am offended and insulted by prof.

By attacking and isolating the Jewish student group, Noble is making a campus that’s already toxic and unwelcoming for Jewish students a more poisonous environment.\nBeing a Jewish student in Canada means many things to me. It means broadening my horizons and gaining knowledge. It does not mean feeling ostracized by students and faculty. It does not mean professors using the classroom as a podium to reveal their personal political leanings. It does not mean Jewish students hiding their religion, ideas and opinions for fear their professor will grade them lower.\nIt is the responsibility of the administration and faculty to ensure students feel safe, something they have failed to do.

That’s what that letter means.”\nTiffin’s letter noted that, according to Presidential Regulation 4, a “student organization” is defined as a group of students who voluntarily congregate with common interest, and may include “organizations formed for purposes of carrying forward a particular activity, cause or project” and not necessarily associated with an academic discipline.\nBrandon Crandall, president of Hillel@ York, insisted his club does not work for any governmental organization and is in full compliance with university rules and regulations.\n“We’ve been on campus as the primary voice for Jewish life and for non-Jewish students who are interested in Judaism and Jewish culture,” he said. “We hold no political alliances with any parties […] we firmly deny being agents of a foreign government.”\nNoble’s take on Hillel@York’s activities was apparently inspired by a Facebook group called “Israel Affairs – Hillel @ York,” moderated by Jennifer Cogan Diamond, who, according to the Hillel of Greater Toronto website, is the Israel Affairs Program Associate for the Toronto organization.\nNoble attached a screen capture of the group’s front page to his initial letter. The group’s description begins, “We are the advocates for Israel on York campus.”\nWhen asked about the “Israel Affairs” Facebook group, Crandall explained that the group is indeed involved with Hillel@York, but that their support for Israel is historically rooted in the Jewish faith.\nMeanwhile, several Jewish and Israeli groups both on and off campus expressed disdain for Noble’s interpretation of Hillel@York’s activities. Sammy Katz, managing director of the Canadian Network for Israel Affairs and former president of Hasbara at York, felt that Noble was unjustified in condemning Hillel as serving as an agent of a foreign government. “Supporting Israel on campus does not mean that you are acting on behalf of a foreign government,” Katz said in an Oct. 20 press release.\n“Rather, students and organizations that support Israel on campus are supporting democracy, human rights, equality and peace.” Aaron Rosenberg, president of B’nai Brith OnCampus York, felt that Noble’s claims were isolating Jewish student groups on campus.\n“Numerous groups and a large number of students at York University […] stand behind the democratic Jewish State of Israel,” said Rosenberg in a statement made to Excalibur.\n“[Noble] continues to make a mockery of this university’s claimed policies of inclusion. Should this be tolerated at our proudly multicultural university?”\nNoble is still pursuing a defamation lawsuit he filed in 2006 against Hillel of Great- er Toronto, as well as several other Jewish groups and the York University Foundation, for $19 million in relation to press releases they’d issued about a pamphlet he’d distributed in 2004.\n ', 'Right on Mike!!\nI laugh everytime I see that space.

The abortion debate is definitely one of the most emotionally charged debates that exist, but there’s apparently nowhere for people to hear and learn about the issues surrounding it anymore.\nIt is frankly unacceptable that several pro-life, tuition-paying students at Carleton University were arrested because they refused to take their protest signs into a closed classroom.\nThese students have the right to a peaceful protest. A protest, by definition, is an expression or declaration of an opposing view. Protesting in a closed classroom isn’t really a protest, now is it?\nUniversity campuses are paid for mainly by the government, and by student tuition. Thus, the campus belongs in part to the students and the government. It seems funny that government-given rights seem to be the ones getting trumped by an administration that is not part of either group.\nAs students, we are challenged to think outside the box, develop our own opinions and listen to those of others, no matter how ridiculous they may sound to us. Heaven forbid we put this into practice and actually try to spread a message to a broader audience or show our disapproval with something going on around us.\nThe fact is, the abortion debate is rarely ever mentioned inside classrooms today. As many of my previous university professors have said, they just don’t want to get into something as emotionally charged as that.\nIf we can’t talk about it in the classroom, and we can’t talk about it out of the classroom, where can we talk about it?\nErin Stewart\n\nRe: “Pro-life students arrested at Car- leton,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nI am appalled to hear pro-life students were arrested at Carleton University Oct. 4, 2010 after attempting to put up a pro-life display on campus. What is this saying to a generation of students who are supposedly in an environment where education and learning are embraced? Pro-life groups on university campuses all over the country are constantly being silenced while groups of the opposite view are openly embraced. Universities should be allowing an atmosphere where students can freely debate those issues that can be hard to face. Why reject all ideas that are different than those of a popular view?\nJust because a view isn’t widely supported in certain arenas, doesn’t mean that it should be swept under the carpet. Canada was built on equality and freedoms. Most take things like freedom of expression and freedom of speech for granted until they are put in a position like these students were. For the sake of this nation, we need to take a stand against this type of injustice.\nRachel Barrett\n\nRe: “YFS Schulich director accused of harassment,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a student from the Schulich School of Business, I would like to commend Gregory Kay for his efforts to try to represent our faculty, which is already underrepresented at our university, at the Canadian Federation of Students annual general meeting. I read in the article that Kay tried to apply to attend the meeting and was refused by another member. This makes me question Jeremy Salter’s comments on the lack of tension between him and Kay, especially since there was controversy surrounding the disqualification of Kay and other members during last year’s election process.\nIn addition to the concerns surrounding Kay’s case, I find it strange YFS board members are not permitted to share information discussed in meetings with non-members. I agree that this demonstrates a lack of transparency in our university’s student union, which is supposed to be working to represent us. I do hope that this issue gets resolved and Kay’s name is cleared, as I have always known him to be an excellent representative who does his best to serve the constituents he represents.\nAlicia Gutierrez\nRe: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a Jewish student at York University, I am offended and insulted by prof. David Noble’s remarks against a Jewish student group at York. By attacking and isolating the Jewish student group, Noble is making a campus that’s already toxic and unwelcoming for Jewish students a more poisonous environment.\nBeing a Jewish student in Canada means many things to me. It means broadening my horizons and gaining knowledge. It does not mean feeling ostracized by students and faculty. It does not mean professors using the classroom as a podium to reveal their personal political leanings. It does not mean Jewish students hiding their religion, ideas and opinions for fear their professor will grade them lower.\nIt is the responsibility of the administration and faculty to ensure students feel safe, something they have failed to do. York is perceived as unfriendly because of the actions of people like prof. Noble.\nMarlee Mozeson\nRe: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a Jewish student in York University’s community, I am offended by prof. David Noble’s remarks against a Jewish student group at York. In particular, I disagree with his calling on president Shoukri to end York’s support of Hillel due to the club’s advocacy on behalf of the state of Israel. Comments such as these, especially from the university’s so-called “noble” and “elite,” have no place in any university, and more importantly, incite intolerance and hatred, which is all too common at York University.\nNobility is not something received at birth, it is a virtue earned through the tolerance and respect of others.

But what their production lacks in special effects and intricate set design, it makes up for in content, creativity and chemistry.\nFor those who, like me, are unfamiliar with Arthur Miller’s classic, the play is about an overworked salesman, Willy Loman, who places too much pressure on himself and his children to achieve great things. His problem is that the great things are always measured monetarily, and achieving them always rests on a hope and a prayer. In the end, he commits suicide in the faith that his son, who, ironically, realizes what is truly valuable, will do something great with the insurance money.\nSoulpepper’s production featured a huge range of interactions between the play’s characters, especially Biff and Willy Loman. Through flashbacks and fast-forwards, we see these two characters in loving embraces, at each others’ throats, and crying in each others’ arms, all within minutes. These transitions were seamless and easy to follow, and the relationship between characters in each scene was as believable as in the next. Soulpepper’s being a family business probably lends itself to that level of chemistry.\nEven though it was written over 60 years ago, today’s evolving professional world is the perfect context for Death of a Salesman. Its themes reflects the increasing need for workers to “sell themselves” to employers and the individual and familial pressure that ensues. Death of a Salesman explores this pressure through the salesman, but we can all say we have experienced something similar, either through work, school or a combination of both.\nThe play also critiques the ambitions of parents who place too much pressure on their children to be great people. Willy Loman has the best intentions at heart when he encourages his sons, but doesn’t realize he is encouraging the pursuit of an unrealistic goal. Willy’s son Biff admits “I’m a nobody,” rebelling against this in a way that resonates with many people’s experiences.\nThrough a combination of its universal themes and brilliant performance, Soulpepper’s production of Death of a Salesman feels anything but dated, especially in a world where everyone feels like a “nobody” sometimes.\nDeath of a Salesman is being performed at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in the Distillery District until November 20.\n ', 'Great production. I’ve seen a few Soulpepper shows in the past (all of them great) and they don’t always have small sets.

(Oleg Makaed)\n ', 'YFS just loves pursuing their own political agendas to cause division on campus.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nKarlene Ooto-Stubbs\nThe Martlet (University of Victoria)\nVICTORIA (CUP) – When Cory Dohlen entered the first year of his primary education practicum, he was shocked that there were five other men in his class of 29 – not because there were so few men, but because there were so many women.\nDohlen’s feeling has seemingly become the norm in universities worldwide. The increasing trend of girls outnumbering boys in post-secondary institutions is not abnormal.\nFemale enrolment in Canada has been steadily increasing over the years, sitting at 58 percent in 2008-2009 according to Statistics Canada.\nThis trend is escalated by an increasing number of males dropping out of universities worldwide. Tony Eder, a director for the University of Victoria’s Institutional Planning and Analysis, explains the exact number is difficult to track because there is no way of concluding whether it is a leave of absence or a more permanent decision.\nJamie Cassels, vice-president academic at the University of Victoria, believes there’s no answer for this phenomenon.\n“For almost 22 years, it’s been like that: a female population that is at about 60 percent versus 40 percent for males. And it varies. It’s interesting that it’s not getting worse. The question for me is, is it even a problem? If it is a problem, are there barriers and problems at the university level or is it happening somewhere else?”\nOne theory suggests the gap between males and females begins in elementary school due to the fact that the vast majority of elementary teachers are female, and the mentoring position teachers have at such a young age.\n“If you look at the [gender divide] of teachers in secondary schools, it’s roughly 50-50,” explained Cassels, whereas in elementary schools, males make up approximately 20 percent of the teaching staff nationwide.\nIn Dohlen’s primary education program, only 20 of the 140 students were male.\nCassels believes social values and milieus are what influence children to attend university.\n“The most important determinant of whether or not a student goes to university is based on what is talked about around the dining room table – essentially, social values,” he said. The second most important, according to Cassels, is the\xa0students’ second home – school.\n“Those images of what you’re going to do, most of the literature shows, gets fixed in your head in late elementary and middle schools. By the time you’re in high school, you pretty well know what pathway you’re on. So if gendered messages are happening in elementary school, that’s where it’s most likely to be influential,” said Cassels.\nSome experts suggest that the solution to this gap is bringing in more male teachers. Based on his own personal experience, Dohlen agrees.\n“Sometimes, in the courses I had to take for the program, the instructor would refer to the teacher as ‘she,’ as in ‘this is what she would be doing in the classroom,’” he said. “So the program’s a little more biased that way, because it caters to the majority.”\nJo-Anne Lee, a women’s studies professor, doesn’t believe bringing more males into the education system will change the gender gap.\n“Why is education considered a female occupation? We have to address the gender bias in education, which reflects the gender bias in society at large,” Lee explained. “Looking after young kids is seen to be an essential female nature. I think we need to look at popular culture and the messages of popular\xa0culture and masculinity.”\nLee explained that while these constructions of gender are at play in our society, the gender of elementary teachers doesn’t matter.\n“So what if we put men in primary education? They will become feminized in elementary school — they’re not seen to be ‘real guys’ because ‘real guys’ don’t do that. There’s a culture of masculinity in our culture that tells boys that it’s okay to be jocks, but men today are rewarded for their brawn and not their brain power, at least in high school.”\nLee further emphasizes the gender gap is not the biggest problem facing universities and society as a whole, noting that in Canada, women are still paid less than men for the same job, which she says is a prominent issue in the education system.\nAffirmative action programs are a common solution to the gender gap found in universities. To combat the concern, the University of Victoria’s engineering program has a student recruitment program where attracting women is at the top of the agenda. Cassels is clear that this does not include “preferential admission policies or categories” for women, but rather encouragement to enter the engineering department.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nRecruitment Manager\nThe York Lanes Health Clinic, run by Appletree Medical Centre, recently fired the clinic’s last practicing chiropractor, Amy Lavigne, who said she was given no logical reason for her dismissal.\n“[Clinic administration] said that [chiropractors] were diverting resources from patients, and that the health care patients are suffering,” said Lavigne.\nAppletree is a private medical corporation that took over management of the York Lanes clinic on March 1, 2010.

In fact I don’t go [there] if I have a medical issue – I will wait and go to my family doctor at home.

If we were to follow that logic, that means I wouldn’t be able to respond to an email or pick up a phone call until our monthly board meeting,” he argued.\nAlex Bilyk, York’s director of media relations, confirmed the YFS hired five Toronto police officers\xa0at a cost of approximately $3,500 while York provided five of its own security officers for $2,400, a total of $5,900.\nSaravanamuttu said he could not comment on the security costs because they have not yet been finalized.\nAccording to Bilyk, in addition to the five officers already provided, Toronto police 31 division made their own assessment and decided to send an additional 15 officers for the event.\nToronto Police Constable Trish Mills, 31 division community relations officer, was not available for comment at the time of the publication.\nKay argued the YFS should never have spent any money in bringing in such a controversial figure to the campus.\n“I think the YFS was founded to promote unity and they’re clearly not accomplishing that goal,” said Kay. “They knew this would be very divisive.”\n“These aren’t the average views of the York population and for […] the YFS to advance their own political agenda through bringing in George Galloway appals the mainstream student body and is a huge misappropriation of student funds,” he added.\nSaravanamuttu maintains that aside from the money spent on security, no student funds were spent to host the event.\n“I think Kay may be unaware of or simply choosing to ignore the fact that the YFS made no financial contribution to have Mr. Galloway speak at York University,” said Saravanamuttu.\nHe also stated the money made from selling tickets for the event were donated to the Canadian Peace Alliance for their upcoming anti-war convention in March.\nGeorge Galloway spoke at York Nov. 16.

Take a look at the big package. We are listening to students.”\nWhile some remain sceptical about the effectiveness of the OSAP app, others hope it will help them stay on top of government loans and personal finances.\nSobia Subedar, a fourth-year communications major, said she has been using OSAP for two years and has accumulated roughly $10,000 in student debt.\n“I would like [the app] too, just to keep track of everything,” she said, adding that a mobile app would help her stay better organized with her finances.\nMilloy said the majority of OSAP-reliant students have two main concerns: affordability and accessibility to information.\n“All things were done to make life easier for students,” Milloy said of the several recent changes made to OSAP, including the early availability of applications as well as the waiving of interest fees during the six-month grace period after study completion.\n“Obviously an app is a way to reach students and young people are the most familiar with technologies and using them.”\n ', 'Fantastic. Students can know their gargantuan debt with the touch of their ipod or ipad. Perhaps Mr. McGuinty might want to consider a more comprehensive approach to provide affordable education.\nDespite what students want to believe, the deficit that the McGuinty government is running is going to affect students. With a growing public debt, the costs associated with financing its debt will increase, thus taking a bigger piece of the budget.\nStudents should take note and demand their government reduce the deficit and the debt in the long run, to provide a more sustainable Ontario for the future.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nRecruitment Manager\nWith the impending closure of Founders College residence, some students are contesting the decision stronger than ever.\nYork administration confirmed the residence was set to close after the 2011 winter semester due to revenue loss. Some students, however, are vehemently opposed to this decision.\nRobert Cerjanec, president of the Founders College Council, sent out an email early last week to the Founders community. The email outlined reasons why the residence should remain open for at least another year.\nCerjanec pointed out doing so would allow students and the York administration to thoroughly study the consulting report – a report which analyzes York’s student housing statistics – which will only be available in the spring.\n“It’ll give a better analysis of housing at York and what York can do to boost the amount of people coming into residence,” said Cerjanec.\nHowever, Gary Brewer, v-p of finance and adminstration at York, said the closure of Founders residence is simply to support an “operating efficiency.”\n“At this point, the decision to take Founders off the list [of residences] for the upcoming year was based on the decline in applications for the residence at York,” said Brewer, who pointed out that Founders residence is home to the single largest vacancy level in all of York.\nCurrently, the vacancies in Founders College residence represent a $1.2 million loss in revenue for the university.\nCerjanec responded by stressing the difference between losses in revenue and a net loss.\n“A loss in revenue doesn’t mean a net loss to the university,” said Cerjanec. “It just means they’re not getting in as much revenue.”\nCerjanec said the Founders community is planning on holding an open forum on Feb. 9 to discuss the pending closure. The forum will invite York administration to hear the concerns of the Founders community.\nHe also added that a letter-writing campaign directed towards the York administration is being organized, saying the community is adamant about keeping the residence open after this semester.\n“Our [Founders] community is simply not happy with it,” said Cerjanec.\nWith files from Excalibur archives and Yuni Kim\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Sergeant Benjamin Anthony believes war with Iran is certain.\n“I firmly believe that the time will probably come when Israel launches a strike on Iran,” said the heavy machine gunner, explaining Israelis are not willing to see Iran become a nuclear power.\n“Our actions and deeds have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with politics, they’re merely the consequence of the universal desire to survive.”\nAnthony came to York Jan. 24 as a part of his North American campus tour in support of his pro-Israeli advocacy organization, Our Soldiers Speak.

You may want to slap a brace over your chin — unless, of course, you prefer picking your jaw up off the floor every few minutes.\nWhile this year’s Auto Show was admittedly not as big or impressive as previous years’ exhibitions, it is still a ton of fun, with hundreds of hot new cars for the auto buffs, some classics that you’ll stare at for hours and some outright oddities that’ll intrigue just about anyone. Here’re five of the coolest things I saw at the show.\n1. Dancing electric car-loving polar bears (Nissan) [above]\nIt takes some logic to explain what, exactly, the bear is there for (car with no emissions equals no melting ice caps — equals happy polar bear?) but whatever the reason, he sure grabbed the media’s attention at the Nissan Leaf booth. It’s not every day you see a ten-foot mammalian predator hug a hatchback, I suppose.\n(Nicholas Maronese)\n2. Three-seat 750-horsepower Canadian-made supercars\xa0 (HTT Plethore LC-750, in the Concorsa Exotica)\nI’m really digging the new Quebec-made HTT Plethore, which’ll be coming out next year. It’s got a three-seat layout with the driver centered in front of the passengers (the scissor doors don’t make it that much easier to get in). If this $495,000 Corvette-powered version doesn’t please, HTT president Sebastien Forest notes there’s a 1,300-horsepower model in the future.\nYou’ll find the car in the new Concorsa Exotica supercar exhibition on the 100 level of the North MTCC — it’s parked across from the vintage Lamborghini Miura and down the way a little, by the Aston Martin Rapide.\n(Nicholas Maronese)\n3. 1886 Benz Motorwagen three-wheelers — that work (Mercedes-Benz)\nOkay, fine, it’s a replica, but the 1-hp tiller-controlled Motorwagen — recreated to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the automobile, as designed by Carl Benz — is still pretty neat. I’m thinking of taking up Mercedes Canada president Marcus Breitschwerdt’s offer to take me on a test drive — at a whopping 8.8 miles an hour. (“Where we’re going, we don’t need they didn’t have roads!”)\n(Nicholas Maronese)\n4. Growling V-8 Chevrolets and Pontiacs (Icons: Camaro and Firebird)\nThe Shelby exhibit last year blew me away, but these vintage and new Chevys aren’t hard on the eyes, either. The spotlight marque this year is General Motor’s Mustang-fighter, the iconic Camaro and Firebird. Examples include the legendary KITT Knight Rider Trans Am; a replica of Burt Reynold’s Pontiac from Smokey and the Bandit; and replicas of the new and old Camaros from the recent Transformers movie franchise.\nCall me a car nerd, but I’ll skip those attention whores and go drool over the (also flashy) 1969 Camaro Indy Pace Car, thank you. Mmm, orange stripes never looked so good.\n(Nicholas Maronese)\n5. Unboring press conferences (now with 400 percent more auto enthusiasts!)\nThis is really just a peeve of mine: after four years of attending the show’s media days, you sort of begin to memorize the basic script each manufacturer’s executive reads off at their respective press conference podiums. (Unfortunately, they haven’t — a lot of them seemed to use teleprompter-style screens.) Honda started off like that, but then mixed it up by introducing us to four Civic assembly plant workers, including welder Jamie (pictured) who shared his story of what it’s like to work on, drive and tinker with Hondas — no script required. Why don’t more manufacturers just let auto enthusiasts, y’know, enthuse?\nThe Canadian International Auto Show runs February 18 through 27 in the Metro Toronto Convention Centre near Union Station. For more information, check out www.autoshow.ca\n ', 'I really wish there were more arciltes like this on the web.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n \nRonald H. Neal  \nStaff Writer\nThere’s nothing like controversy when it comes to trade season with the Maple Leafs.\nIt’s almost impossible to avoid, and impossible to stop, and with these last few days, for fans, it has definitely stepped up to the plate. \nIt all started when Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke announced he was sending defenceman Francois Beauchemin back to the Anaheim Ducks in a trade for Joffrey Lupul, defenceman Jake Gardiner and a conditional 2013 entry draft fourth-round pick. Some turned their heads in anger, but most understood his decision.\nAnd who can disagree?\nFor one, Beauchemin was expendable. As the roster stood, we already had one too many players like him (i.e stay-at-home defencemen who rarely, if ever, put the puck in the net). When you consider players like Schenn and Komisarek and the stable of very young and eager defencmen in waiting, we could afford to part with Beauchemin. Many people probably adored him personally, but people can get over that.\nBut this trade was also a steal because we got some great players in return.\nIn Joffrey Lupul we get a former first round draft pick with a lot to prove. He is anxious to win and is hungry for success after being drafted seventh overall in 2002 with little to show for it. Despite his lack of early success, he is an undeniable threat that’ll give beleaguered coach Wilson a few more options up front.\n  Before Lupol, we had a problem: one solid and consistent offensive line, anchored by unsung Kulemin and Grabovski, and nowhere to put Phil Kessel. Now we have two serious threats to opposing teams and a more balanced roster. It was a calculated risk with little downside, and for Lupol alone it was worth it.\n  The other upside, of course, is the draft pick and prospect Jake Gardiner. Given the often-publicised sentiment Brian Burke is in the player development business, one could almost be excused for thinking these assets were the real steal in the trade. In today’s National Hockey League (NHL), a draft pick is as good a currency as any, and Gardiner is expected to be top four one day. \n  Overall, the first trade picks were something everyone could agree on, but then Monday came and it was a different story.\n  In an apparent attempt to outdo even himself, Burke followed up what many considered a dumb move by trading key off-season acquisition Kris Versteeg to the Philadelphia Flyers for a first and third-round pick in this year’s draft. \n  This trade has sadly been met with mixed results. Many believe Versteeg is an integral part of our team moving forward, and at only 24 and having just come off a Stanley Cup run with the Chicago Blackhawks, it was easy to see why. Unlike the last deal, which seemed to be in line with team policy and a step towards the playoffs, this trade seemed to signal the team’s demise and betray the thoughts of a general manager who doesn’t believe. Philadelphia’s first place positioning means our picks will be on the low end, and that does not help.\n  Despite early criticism, though, this is yet another brilliant move, and here’s why.\n  Admittedly, I liked Versteeg and had even committed to him being in the Blue and White for some time. Despite the emotional attachment, though, one cannot escape the fact that he wasn’t working in Toronto. \n  Despite his age, potential and early success, Versteeg never managed to find a home beyond the third line, and could never seem to capture the stride that saw him hoist the Cup last spring. Burke recognized this and made a move when Versteeg’s value would arguably never be any higher as a Maple Leaf. \n  Burke essentially called a mulligan on a decision he made last summer. Take solace in the fact the man has a plan and is not afraid to correct even his own mistakes. \n  Despite a season of strife on the ice, this is a step forward for the Maple Leafs. Rest easy, Leafs Nation – we are still in good hands.  \n ', 'Nice blog!  I like your analysis of fansaty categories in addition to the players themselves.

It is York’s money, and it is York’s ethical obligation.”\nLapointe said the university’s investment philosophy is inherently flawed.\n“As long as our university remains invested in companies that profit from war crimes, it continues to make a mockery of its stated commitments to human rights and social justice,” she said. “‘Active engagement’ is a very\nslow and ineffective tool [and it’s] not possible at all when the company’s main business is to manufacture weapons which are, by definition, death machines.”\nOmar Dominguez, chair and co-founder of the Coalition of Universities for Responsible Investing, said York is on the right track.\n“Issues like military spending are bound to be controversial,” he said. “But if you divest from these companies, it really leaves you out of an opportunity to negotiate with the companies and try to address your concerns.”\nNevertheless, Dominguez appreciated SAIA’s efforts to include students in these discussions.\n“We encourage universities to combine the university trustees – who are ultimately responsible for these decisions – with faculty who have expertise on the very issues, to include the views of students, who are some of the beneficiaries, and to include multiple stakeholders,” he said of his coalition’s goals.\nPound-Curtis also pointed out that since they switched investment managers in late February, York is no longer investing in Hewlett-Packard or Northrop Grumman, and that they have not invested in Lockheed Martin since August 2010.\nIn fact, York is currently invested in only one of SAIA’s four target companies, BAE Systems, via the university’s pension fund.\n“We’ve about a million dollars [in BAE Systems] out of our total pension fund, which is $1.4 billion dollars – it’s insignificant,” said Pound-Curtis. “We will have a discussion with our investment manager to ask if they’d considered any of the facts [of SAIA’s report].”\nLapointe emphasized that York has not yet promised not to reinvest in these companies.\n“Pound-Curtis has not addressed any of the three demands of our divestment campaign,” she said.\nAnne Bayefsky, a political science professor at York University who specializes in international human rights, thinks the campaign is wrongheaded because of its focus on Israel as an apartheid state.\n“Israel, like all states, is entitled to the rights of self-defense,” she explained. “Efforts to deny Israel’s right to self-defense are, in fact, the inverse of the declared intention of people concerned with apartheid because it would deny the Jewish people a homeland where they can find protection and security.”\nIn their report, SAIA compares Israeli policy to apartheid South Africa, citing a study, “Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?” by the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. But Bayefsky thinks the evidence points in the opposite direction.\n“Everyone should be concerned about human rights, but we have to take a good hard look at the facts,” she said. “The evidence clearly indicates that Israel – a country where one-fifth of the population is Arab with full democratic rights and representation at the highest levels of Israeli society – is not an apartheid state.”\nTo read SAIA’s full report, “Holding York University Accountable,” visit\xa0 www.toronto.saia.ca.\nWith files from Brent Rose and Yuni Kim\n ', 'Am I seeing things, or is there a hideous misuse of the possessive apostrophe in the title?\nHi Harrison! Long time?!\nNot a hideous misuse if you pretend that “group’s” is supposed to be followed with “policy”.\nIs it just me or does excalibur give wayyyyyyy too little space to any group that stands in solidarity with Palestine in their paper? One and a half sentences from a SAIA spokesperson and half an article of b.s from the admin and blatant lies from a “professor” at York, Who’s obviously working with Hillel.\nIs it a prerequisite for editors that they must be in love with Israel? Maronese, in his piece does a bad job hiding his bias and clear attempts to mislead readers. The group in this article is not asking for divestment from companies that they “feel” vioates international law. These findings have been made by experts of International law: academics, UN investigations, Amnesty International, Human rights watch have found Israel’s actions and the bodies that support it are in constant violation of international law.\nExcalibur, readers are tired of this open love for apartheid.\nI agree, Steve. Just google the professor Anne Bayefsky. She is a pretty outspoken Israel sympathizer. I understand that the writer of the article felt that they were balancing SAIA with this professor, but it’s actually unbalanced.\nUsing a professor’s (expert’s) comments against a student group’s comments is not leveled. Why not get Dr. Rahnema to comment? After all, he only teaches the most popular course on Israel/Palestine Relations in all of York. Or any other political professor who specializes in Middle East Politics?\nThe end of this article is atrocious. Bayefsky’s blatant apologetics are just embarrassing and shouldn’t be taken seriously at all. They’re clearly tacked on and they completely divert focus away from rest of the piece.\nAlso, the most verbose lead in existence\nUm… since when is a country democratic when it has already titled itself as a “Jewish State”.

According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.\nWhen the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed\ninformation.\nThe new by-laws have left some York students furious.\nIt’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.\n“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”\nMany students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.\nCouncillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.\n“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.\nHe urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.\n“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”\nPeruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.\nStudents that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.\nThe university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.\n“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.\nAccording to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.\nWith the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from\xa0 8 am and 8 pm.\nYork currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.\nWith files from Amelia Ruthven-Nelson\n ', 'To those of you who read this – you CAN take action.

(David Foster)\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe UVSS has officially endorsed the “no” side, implying the current board believes it is not in the best interest of students to continue to be\npart of the CFS.\nCoccola said he was aware there was going to be a number of people flown out to campaign for the CFS during the\nreferendum.\n“It’s happened at every school [that votes to defederate from the CFS] […] it’s quite common, so it doesn’t surprise me at all that Jeremy’s here,” he said.\nCoccola also suggested York students should reflect on the fact their student union executive director had flown out to “campaign on the other side of the country, something that arguably doesn’t affect York students.”\n“This is a referendum for UVic students. Why would someone from York be able to speak to the issues that UVic students are facing?” questioned Coccola. “Not all issues are the same across the country, despite what people say.”\nWhen asked about whether the YFS covers the expenses for its members to travel to other campuses during a CFS referendum, Saravanamuttu responded via email, “The answer is no.”\nSaravanamuttu couldn’t comment on who did, in fact, pay for the trip.\nAccording to UVic student David Foster, there have been attempts for many years to break from the CFS.\n“We don’t get a lot of value for our money, and the money could be better used in another way or even just by putting it back in our pockets,” said Foster. “This year we’re using even less of the CFS services than we ever have.”\nHe explained that UVic students do not use the CFS health plan, website services, and, since they found a company that could produce yearly handbooks at a lower cost than the CFS, even the handbook service has gone unused.\nKarstens-Smith added that the referendum has been a long time coming for the university.\nThe original petition to begin a referendum was circulated by a number of students and began in 2009, but was declared invalid by the CFS because of a counter-petition started by the former UVSS.\nAccording to Coccola, both petitions were submitted to CFS, which used the second petition to deny a referendum, although there was no way to tell which petition was signed first or whether students knew what type of petition they were signing.\nThe issue was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada in November, where the judge ruled the petition valid.\nNevertheless, the CFS began claiming the UVSS owed a debt to the CFS from the ’90s to the tune of\xa0 $129,000. CFS bylaws state that student unions cannot have a referendum if they owe any outstanding membership fees.\nNevertheless, the court granted and set a date for the referendum on the basis that the debt was released by the CFS two days prior to a court date.\n“The judge ruled it prejudicial and said they could not submit the affidavit and that they should’ve done so sooner – they had plenty of time to do so,” said Coccola.\nThe campaign period for the referendum started March 21 while the voting period started March 29 and ends March 31.\nWhile Excalibur obtained a photo of Saravanamuttu on the UVic campus, Karstens-Smith said that Salter avoided all photos.\n“Is he trying to hide the fact he’s here or something? Because we can definitely confirm that he is,” stated Karstens-Smith via e-mail.\nExcalibur attempted to reach both Salter and Saravanmuttu by phone, text and email regarding these issues but did not get a comment from them as of publication.\nSalter has a very strong tie to the CFS, and received an ‘A’ in a report card-like document accidentally released by CFS-British Columbia about three years ago. The document ranked CFS members based on loyalty, and recommended which members would be well-suited to advocate at universities holding a CFS defederation referendum.\nWhen\xa0 Salter was president of Continuing Education Students at Ryerson (CESAR), he helped along the referendum to make CESAR a permanent member of the CFS. He was also the former Northern Ontario Commissioner for CFS-Ontario, while he served as the Lakehead University Student Union president.\n ', 'Jeremy Salter also came to the University of Regina to campaign for the ‘yes’ side last October. We questioned then, how can the Executive Director be gone from work, campaigning in Saskatchewan for three weeks?\nThanks for the coverage, Excalibur! Happy to say that your students will be returning to their home campus shortly, as UVic voted overwhelming to defederate, removing the CFS and their representatives from our campus. Kindest regards from the west coast, from a ‘NO CFS’ side supporter.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nHufsa Tahir\nContributor\nTAHIR: Why the name “SlutWalk”? Wouldn’t people find it offensive?\nTEEKAH: If folks were to try and bury this story and shove it under the carpet, all that does is replicate and increase the power words like “slut” have. We want to confront this power and change it. By calling it SlutWalk, we are acknowledging his comment – and want to open up dialogue. We can take concepts “slut” points to – women having sex, who should have sex and what kind of women there should be – and completely rework these concepts in the interest of an actual gender-equal world.\nTA: What’s the aim of this event?\nTE: One of our main aims is to reappropriate the word “slut.” We are also looking for increased transparency, accountability and greater anti-oppression training for police. We are coming to this with a politic that can mean different things for different people who attend the march.\nTA: Some might call it an overreaction to blame the entire police force for a reckless comment made by one officer.\nTE: When a police officer puts on the uniform of the police force, he is not a lone person. For York and the Toronto police to select this officer to come and speak for “campus safety awareness” events, they are sending him as a rep of the Toronto police. Police officers are the result of police culture and training. Either the culture indirectly supports his point of view, or the training does not do a good enough job to train out of them this ignorance.\nTA: How important is SlutWalk Toronto?\nTE: We are not doing this event to say, “Fuck the police.” We are looking to have a dialogue with them, to open up real interaction between them and the community they serve. We want to improve their approaches toward minority groups, and make change for the better. This march is one of the steps in that process. We’ve had enough of these cases. It’s time to do something real and tangible about them.\nTA: What kind of changes to attitude are you looking for?\nTE: It’s easier to blame the victim than to look at the larger picture. Why are we telling women to police their bodies, to stay indoors, to dress in certain ways while men have absolutely none of this “policing” on them? Victim blaming actually works to support the rapist. How can you say that a rapist is ever “justified” in raping? We need to start looking at the larger picture – sexism in different places – and how these sources that spawn things like rape are not being addressed.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMatthew Goulet\nContributor\nPeople all live with viruses, most of them benign; when these harmful tunes infect the brain, the average listener displays no signs of being completely subsumed by unexceptional music. They’re sort of like the sonic version of the human papillomavirus: symptoms don’t always show up, though the results can be deadly.\nBut creating public awareness for devastating viruses is not my intention – it’s to establish awareness in regard to the rapid spread of bad music (in most cases anything that falls under the umbrella of “mainstream”) and its ultimate destruction of formerly genuine bands.\nInstrumental band Scale The Summit at one of their tour stops in Austin, Texas. (Prosthetic Records)\nLet’s scale the summit of reason, shall we? To back up my salvo of accusations and labels, I’ve formed an armada of alternatives, a formidable flotilla of funk and folk that will freak your frontal cortex. My smart bomb comes in the form of an unorthodox, independent-minded group of people that helped build up a genre and simultaneously smash it down with complicated chord progression, sporadic melodies and overall awesomeness.\nScale The Summit is out with their latest album, The Collective.\nFormed in 2004, Scale the Summit has peaked on many music charts and weathered many attacks from their perch, but they’re far too high up this mountain of musical mastery to notice the petty criticisms from down here. Ass-kissing, you say? Maybe, but the accolades are well deserved.\nWhat sets Scale the Summit apart from other bands in the same metal subgenre is their lack of vocals. ‘Instru-metal’ is their brand of vocal-free metal, and they make up for the vocals elsewhere. The music literally speaks for itself, and lacks nothing in the frontman department.\nEven more astounding is how young the band members are. Their average age is just 22, so they’ve many years ahead to develop as a band. If they’re at this level now, imagine their progress in five, 10 or 20 years.\nTheir stylistic elements are peculiar and wonderful. The music is hard with moments of softness, always maintaining a level of complexity even in simple harmonies. It maintains a happy atmosphere, something metal bands before them have seldom achieved. Songs like “Gallows” should be listened to on headphones while walking down a sunny street. Certain parts of the songs scream uncertainty, while the mood is cemented in the very atmospheric quality of “Colossal,” the opening track of The Collective.\nWhereas many bands have to rely on sound editing to get their cohesive, unified quality, Scale the Summit has it on their own. It’s a quality that makes for outstanding live performances: all of the musicians are constantly on the same wavelength.\nTaking time to savour The Collective is a transcendental experience of self-reflection, comparable to the effects of psychedelic drugs. Many fans of the band have described their music as a journey, a form of exploration both musically and personally for the individual; drifting into oneself after listening to the entire album is easy. Scale the Summit’s music lends itself to introspection, and that’s why critics have coined the term “adventure metal” to replace the tired old horse that is “progressive metal.” I’m not knocking the “prog,” but change is good.\nEveryone’s level of musical knowledge and fondness is different and we listen to music for different reasons. For those unseasoned listeners, your level of critical listening isn’t the same as that of a professional. You may not pick out the minuscule elements of each song, but you don’t need to be an expert to enjoy expertly performed music.\nWhat is bad music? What is good music for that matter? The subjectivity is the attraction to the medium – what’s certain is that The Collective will take you on a musical journey through passages of the mind rarely ever examined, without ever having to leave the comfort of home.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nPaul McLaughlin\nContributor (This Magazine)\nNina Arsenault has spent a fortune changing her appearance from male to female. The 37-year-old used to work in the sex trade, but now supports herself as a playwright, performer and motivational speaker to queer youth. Her one-woman show, The Silicone Diaries, recently had a second highly successful run in Toronto, was later performed in Montreal and will open in Vancouver next year.\nMCLAUGHLIN: Where did you grow up?\nARSENAULT: In Beamsville, Ontario in the Golden Horseshoe Trailer Park. It was a really tight knit community. My memories of it are just great. But we moved when I was about six to a house in Smithville. It was very difficult to make friends because I was so feminine. Growing up in the trailer park and going to school with those kids, they always knew how girlish I was. With everyone on top of each other you have no choice but to accept people. [Then I moved and] being the new kid it was very, very difficult to make friends. I have been a bit of a lone wolf all my life.\nNina Arsenault, who holds a York graduate degree in theatre, supports herself as performer. (Tony Fong)\nM: In The Silicone Diaries you talk about seeing a female mannequin in a store at age five. What was it that affected you that day?\nA: I think just the harmony and symmetry of the face spoke to me. I knew that I was a girl inside but I had this boy body. Then, for my visual gaze to rest upon a face that was a sculpture of a woman’s face, I just seized on that as a child. It affected me, the perfection of it.\nM: When did you decide to begin plastic surgery?\nA: About age 23, but I didn’t have my first procedure until I was 25.\nM: What did you have done?\nA: At first, just transsexual procedures to feminize myself. It got to a point where I looked as much like a normal woman as I possibly could; however, I still had masculine features. It was really traumatic on a daily basis to see those features. So I made the decision to really push the cosmetic procedures, knowing I would no longer look natural, that I would start to look plastic and artificial.\nM: Like a mannequin?\nA: Yeah. But I can’t say at the beginning of the journey I was trying to look like a mannequin or a Playboy bunny. I was just trying to be a woman.\nM: Did you literally have 60 surgeries?\nA: There were actually more. Some were just procedures, like a lip injection.\nM: When was the last one?\nA: In 2006.\nM: How much did they cost?\nA: Upwards of $200,000.\nM: How did you afford that?\nA: I was working in the sex trade and made an incredible amount of money so quickly there.\nM: Men like “shemales”?\nA: Yeah. In terms of supply and demand, there just aren’t a lot of us, but there’s a lot of interest. The first day I put my escort ad in the paper, I had 250 calls. I don’t think that’s something that’s spoken about that openly amongst otherwise heterosexual men. I could have worked from morning until night if I had wanted to.\nM: What was it like working in the trade?\nA: It was physically very tough. And I only did oral, no fucking.\nM: A lot of transgender women work in the sex business. Why is that?\nA: It’s one of the few places you can get work and feel safe. If you’re visibly transgender you’re going to be one of the most disenfranchised and disadvantaged people in culture.\nM: You have two graduate degrees, right?\nA: I do. But it’s tough to get straight work. You can’t imagine the amount of transphobia out there.\nM: How long have you been out of the trade?\nA: About three years. I support myself now as a performer.\nM: In the play you mention that you have had your testicles removed. But you kept your penis.

Neal \nStaff Writer\nIncreasingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, you’ll find doctors and health care professionals turning to the ancient disciplines of meditation to deal with mental health disorders.\nMeditation is the most well-known – and certainly one of the most thoroughly studied – forms of medicine practiced by the Tibetan Buddhists for centuries.\xa0 Personified by the dignified and solemn Dali Lama for over 25 centuries, meditation has become a method of refining and exploring the inner self, probing and navigating inner space in much the same way we have preferred to examine our outer.\nSpending just a few minutes to mediate can help you relive stress that comes from a busy scheduel. (SXC.HU)\n“The monks, we believe, are the Olympic athletes of certain kinds of mental training,” said Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist from the University of Wisconsin who, as part of a select group of scientists and scholars, travelled to Dharamsala in 2000 to attempt to dissect problems of distress and human suffering.\nHe analyzed 150 ordinary brains and compared them to the brain of a monk, and discovered a monk’s brain was simply more active on the left, which represented happiness. “This is tantalizing evidence that these practices may indeed be promoting beneficial changes in the brain,” concluded Davidson.\nZindal Segal, a psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health who uses meditation to treat patients with mood disorders, finds that though we may never be able to reach the same heights as Buddhists who spend 10,000 hours sitting and meditating by just spending time clearing out minds we may be able to feel better.\n“We’re talking about paying attention, we’re talking about returning wherever our minds are to this present moment. These are things that we all have. We don’t have to earn them, we just have to find a way of clearing away the clutter to see that they are already there,” said Dr. Segal.\nThe key to meditation is to slow the mind down and examine one’s thoughts and thinking processes and connect that to the present moment. “[Meditation is] a way of training yourself to pay attention in the present moment without judgement [as] to what your experience is,” said Dr. Segal in a Globe and Mail article.\nThe health benefits are still very much debated, but researchers have found that meditation is good for relieving stress, and dropping blood pressure. This form of medicine changes someone’s attitude from sour to positive and can go a long way especially in our busy lives. “Meditation is a set of practices that have been around for more than 2,500 years, whose principal goal is to cultivate these positive human qualities, to promote flourishing and resilience […]” said Davidson.\nAt first glance this may seem simple, but it has been shown to be just as effective as antidepressants in treating and preventing depression relapse, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThe next time you are feeling blue, or stressed over exams, you shoulder consider your inner strength before popping a pill.\nWith files from The Globe and Mail\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nKate Hudson\nProduction Manager\nFinal exams may drive you to the edge of sanity, but compared to what Norio Ota, director of Japanese studies at York University, went through at his Japanese high school, our academic lives are a cakewalk.\n“When I was going through the entrance examinations, it was called ‘the exam from hell,’” said Ota. “I had to work until two to three in the morning every single day because I had to study for ten or twelve subjects at the same time, and then get up 6:30a.m. and go to school.”\nHe could tell I was shocked. Ota shook his head with a dismissive smile, “I wasn’t exceptional. Many people had to study the same way. We had a saying: If you sleep for four hours, you will fail the entrance exam. You have to sleep only for three. Seriously.”\nIt’s difficult for me to imagine an educational culture so different from my own.\n“Well, many people went through this in Japan at those times. We thought about dying, and all those things, because the pressure was just enormous.”\n“It was okay for me because I thought of it as one hurdle I had to overcome.”\nDecades later, Ota still works until 2 or 3 am many days of the week, teaches overtime, trains high school teachers across Canada via videoconferencing, and recently helped coordinate a new Japanese language program at Havana University.\nHis peaceful smile, balanced demeanour and humility gave me the impression of self-awareness, dedication, and a man truly in love with his work.\n“I feel appreciated by other people\xa0– I think that’s a source of work ethic for me,” said Ota. “It’s not just culturally ingrained. I love what\nI do.”\nA certain school of Western psychologists, however, might use a different word to describe his behaviour.\nWorkaholism.\nWork·a·ho·lic (n. circa 1968)\nThe term workaholic has been used informally to refer to white-collar and public service workers who ‘work too hard’ since it was coined in 1968 by American psychologist Wayne Oates.\nHowever, there has been much academic discussion about what the term actually means in a clinical context, and considerable difficulty reaching a consensus.\nSome early studies in workaholism looked at workers’ attitudes toward their jobs, while others focused on their behaviour, i.e. the number of hours worked per year. For example, Mosier (1983) defined a workaholic as someone who works more than 50 hours a week regardless of his psychological condition; Cherrington (1980) defined a workaholic as having an “irrational commitment to excessive work”; Machlowitz (1980) focused on the workaholic’s positive enjoyment of work.\nLater studies attempted to place workaholics on a spectrum of “work involvement, a feeling of being driven to work, and work enjoyment”, differentiating between workaholics who enjoy their work and those who resent it.\nThe ‘Japanese Work Ethic’\nThe Japanese have a reputation for outworking their Western counterparts. But do the numbers support anecdotal evidence like professor Ota’s high school entrance exam experience? Is Japan a nation of workaholics?\nAt Japan’s economic peak, the numbers indicated a resounding yes. In 1980, Japanese worked an average of 2121 hours a year while Canadians and Americans both worked just over 1800. To put that in perspective, if you took two weeks of vacation, you would have to work about 8.5 hours every day – not including breaks – to meet the Japanese average.\nWhile cultural collectivist attitudes are sometimes cited, Ota explained there is a clear economic explanation for this phenomenon.\n“For a long time, until the beginning of the bubble economy, many [Japanese] worked for the same company until they retired. That was the source of loyalty in the company. These people worked really hard because they identified with the company.”\nOverworking was such a serious issue that a word, kar?shi, was coined in the late ’80s to describe death or suicide attributed to work-related stress. Kar?shi prompted the Japanese government to begin research initiatives and enact legislation to force workers to take holidays.\nToday, the problem is less severe, but over 10,000 continue to die from kar?shi every year – almost as many causalities as the March 11 earthquake crisis this year.\nWhite collar workers and high level executives are among the most vulnerable. Even pre-university students, who are exposed to high levels of stress, are affected by kar?shi; Japanese students have one of the highest suicide rates for their age group in the world.\nBursting the Bubble\nWesterners continue to view Japan as a workaholic society, but the trend may be changing.\nIn 2009, Japanese workers laboured an average of 1714 hours a week – only 15 more than Canadians – and actually less than American workers, who worked 1768.\nThis statistic forces us to rethink typical stereotypes about cultural pre-dispositions and look at economic factors in defining trends in\noverworking.\n“After the economic bubble burst, what happened was that Japanese companies started laying off and firing people, so the so-called life-time employment system has collapsed since then.” said Ota. “Many people felt the same way I did: ‘Why should I spend my whole life working for a big corporation?’ A different value orientation was introduced. Not all at once, but gradually.”\nWhile Japanese workaholism may be subsiding, for Canadians, there are no signs the problem is going away. Since workaholics tend to be high-functioning members of society, their problems often go unnoticed.\nBryan Robinson, PhD., author of the best-selling Chained to the Desk, thinks the subject is, at least in some ways, taboo.\n“Cultural attitudes towards workaholism have changed very little,” said Robinson. “In a downturn economy, where people are desperate for jobs, they don’t want to talk about working too much.\xa0 Plus, with the advent of wireless technology, electronic devices are invading personal time more than ever before.”\nA lot of the problem is awareness.\n“People still don’t get how damaging work addiction is. It continues to be praised and misunderstood, especially in a time when many people don’t have jobs.”\nAccording to Robinson, university environments are particularly at risk, and desperately need to take action.\n“Universities are notorious for enabling work addiction with huge expectations and very few boundaries […] Universities and any workplace at risk for burnout should be encouraging self-care among faculty, not expect multi-tasking, which only activates the stress response, and they should hold seminars on the dangers of overworking and the damage done to marriages and children.”\nRobinson found it hard to think of a North American campus he could hold up as a positive example. “I don’t know of any who are doing it right,” he said.\nA Positive Outlook\nIn a very personal moment, I described my own struggle with workaholism to professor Ota. I spend up to 15 or more hours a day working at Excalibur as a designer, a writer and a manager, an ethic that differs little from the way I’ve approached my work since middle school.\nDespite all of this negativity, not everyone views intense commitment to work as a bad thing. The key to staying healthy and balanced for an intense worker, he said, is passion and\nhumility.\n“I used to think I worked for self-satisfaction; it was only after an important person in my life died that I realised, actually, my life is not for myself. When you can feel your life is not for yourself, all negative feelings like anger, jealousy, everything disappears. Once you reach that stage, you keep your peace of mind.”\nI told him maybe this was true, but my drive to work sometimes took over the rest of my life.\n“You are part Japanese, remember,” he laughs, referring to my one-quarter Japanese background. “It’s in your blood!”\nCompiled by Chloe Silver and Kate Hudson with files from oecd.com\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nYork is changing the way students are affiliated with their colleges.\nUnder the old regulation, residence students were automatically affiliated with whatever college residence they moved into – if a student lived in Winters College during first year and moved to Vanier residence, their college affiliation would be automatically switched from Winters to Vanier. Even if students submitted a form to maintain their original affiliation, a glitch in the system would prevent the request from being realized.\nThe university has now fixed that glitch, and students may now successfully choose to remain with their original college after their first year, even if they decide to move residences.\n“The bigger issue is after first year, should you still be forced to be affiliated with whatever college you live in or whatever college you choose?” said Founders College Council president Robert Cerjanec. “Under the current system, it almost tells you indirectly that if now you live in Calumet, you should be involved in Calumet. But you don’t have any connection with Calumet. You have a connection [with your original college].”\nVp students Rob Tiffin explained that the student information system would automatically change any college affiliation requests back to the college of residence due to a system pre-programming.\n“Even if students could change, or request a change, we discovered it was slipping students back into [the college affiliation of the residence they were living in],” he said.\xa0 “We are going to make certain that that doesn’t occur [anymore].”\ntudents must go through the registrar’s office to request to change college\naffiliation.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nYork housing is planning a commuter floor in Tatham Hall at McLaughlin College.\nThe second floor of the college residence will be converted into a floor for commuter students to rent out for a night during the school year.\n“[It will] offer York undergraduate students an overnight accommodation option,” said Debbie Kee, director of housing services. “The rooms will be available for students who plan to stay on campus late to study, or for students who are anticipating bad weather and do not want to commute.”\nKee said that the floor would include 16 single rooms and four double rooms, a total of 24 beds.

It is York’s money, and it is York’s ethical obligation.”\nLapointe said the university’s investment philosophy is inherently flawed.\n“As long as our university remains invested in companies that profit from war crimes, it continues to make a mockery of its stated commitments to human rights and social justice,” she said. “‘Active engagement’ is a very\nslow and ineffective tool [and it’s] not possible at all when the company’s main business is to manufacture weapons which are, by definition, death machines.”\nOmar Dominguez, chair and co-founder of the Coalition of Universities for Responsible Investing, said York is on the right track.\n“Issues like military spending are bound to be controversial,” he said. “But if you divest from these companies, it really leaves you out of an opportunity to negotiate with the companies and try to address your concerns.”\nNevertheless, Dominguez appreciated SAIA’s efforts to include students in these discussions.\n“We encourage universities to combine the university trustees – who are ultimately responsible for these decisions – with faculty who have expertise on the very issues, to include the views of students, who are some of the beneficiaries, and to include multiple stakeholders,” he said of his coalition’s goals.\nPound-Curtis also pointed out that since they switched investment managers in late February, York is no longer investing in Hewlett-Packard or Northrop Grumman, and that they have not invested in Lockheed Martin since August 2010.\nIn fact, York is currently invested in only one of SAIA’s four target companies, BAE Systems, via the university’s pension fund.\n“We’ve about a million dollars [in BAE Systems] out of our total pension fund, which is $1.4 billion dollars – it’s insignificant,” said Pound-Curtis. “We will have a discussion with our investment manager to ask if they’d considered any of the facts [of SAIA’s report].”\nLapointe emphasized that York has not yet promised not to reinvest in these companies.\n“Pound-Curtis has not addressed any of the three demands of our divestment campaign,” she said.\nAnne Bayefsky, a political science professor at York University who specializes in international human rights, thinks the campaign is wrongheaded because of its focus on Israel as an apartheid state.\n“Israel, like all states, is entitled to the rights of self-defense,” she explained. “Efforts to deny Israel’s right to self-defense are, in fact, the inverse of the declared intention of people concerned with apartheid because it would deny the Jewish people a homeland where they can find protection and security.”\nIn their report, SAIA compares Israeli policy to apartheid South Africa, citing a study, “Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?” by the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. But Bayefsky thinks the evidence points in the opposite direction.\n“Everyone should be concerned about human rights, but we have to take a good hard look at the facts,” she said. “The evidence clearly indicates that Israel – a country where one-fifth of the population is Arab with full democratic rights and representation at the highest levels of Israeli society – is not an apartheid state.”\nTo read SAIA’s full report, “Holding York University Accountable,” visit\xa0 www.toronto.saia.ca.\nWith files from Brent Rose and Yuni Kim\n ', 'Am I seeing things, or is there a hideous misuse of the possessive apostrophe in the title?\nHi Harrison!

According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.\nWhen the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed\ninformation.\nThe new by-laws have left some York students furious.\nIt’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.\n“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”\nMany students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.\nCouncillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.\n“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.\nHe urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.\n“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”\nPeruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.\nStudents that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.\nThe university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.\n“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.\nAccording to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.\nWith the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from\xa0 8 am and 8 pm.\nYork currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.\nWith files from Amelia Ruthven-Nelson\n ']"

Contrary to cyberbullying fears, the blogosphere provides teens “with a safe area for self-exposure.” Blogging can “improve self-image, increase self-confidence, and gather friends.”\nThe study says blogging is considered ideal for anyone who is stressed, depressed, and anxious.\nPsychologists have recommended writing in the past as a method of emotional venting and problem solving. Writing, the authors of the study say, “influences the emotional state, as well as the social behavior of the writer.”\nBut blogging is different from writing in a journal. “Online writing enables free expression, easy rereading and editing, and convenient communication with others,” the study goes on to say.\nBloggers are in control of the interpersonal conversation online. Teenagers can modify their thoughts and decide if they would like their blog to be open to other peoples’ posts. The interpersonal sharing with others helps teens reduce their social stress.\n“The virtual environment gives [teens] a feeling of privacy and a sense of protection from exposure[…]or physical contact,” the study says, “which might be threatening in face-to-face encounters.” Bloggers can hide personal information from family and friends, but can engage in conversations with strangers who can give them advice.\nGenerally, teens are confident sharing their feelings online due to the anonymity and invisibility of the internet. Instead of seeing others’ reactions by sharing their problems publicly, they can focus on the content.\xa0 Because of this, blogging is a bigger release for teenagers.\nIn the study, a total of 161 teens participated, with 124 girls and 37 boys. They were asked to rate themselves by their level of self-esteem, peer relationship, and interpersonal activities. During the study, experts evaluated “the participants’ social–emotional condition” by reading their blog posts.\nIn total, participants were\xa0rated on 30 posts. The first and second group posted messages in their blogs on “their thoughts and feelings concerning their social\xa0circumstances and interpersonal relationships.” The first group opened their blog to others, the second did not. The third and fourth groups wrote “about any subject they wished.” The third group opened their blog to the public where the fourth group\xa0did not. To balance the study, a fifth group served as a control by writing entries in their personal diaries.\nUnlike diarists, the study shows that, “online writers describe their writing process as a dynamic dialogue.”\nBlogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter combine public and private worlds. Writers can construct identities online. By constructing their own identity, teens can manage the intimate details they choose to share or withhold from others.\nBloggers, the researchers imply, are in control even if their situation is spiralling out of control-—a comforting thought whenever a blog is updated.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \ningredients\n3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes\n1/3 cup diced celery\n1/3 cup finely chopped onion\n3/4 cup diced cooked ham\n3 1/4 cups water\n2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules\n1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste\n1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or\nto taste\n5 tablespoons butter\n5 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n2 cups milk\npreparation\nMix the onions, celery, potatoes, water, and ham in a stockpot.

John Janas, Ron Maloku, Alex Curci, and Mike Mclnroy present a shared ability to use the media of illustration, animation, and drawing to create powerful, interesting, and ultimately effective works. The exhibition, currently running at the Samuel J. Zacks Gallery, presents works with an expressive, attention-grabbing style.\nCo-director of the gallery, Stas Guzar, explains that what interested him in hosting this exhibition was to bring recognition to up-and-coming artists.\n“I feel as though drawing and illustration don’t get the attention they deserve, and can get lost amongst the other mediums,” Guzar explains. To him, each artist’s work is special in its own way.\nComic-book-style pieces are among the works Guzar focused on for the show. He was drawn to the works of Curci because of his ability to use this style and present, as Guzar describes it, “a duality in the image of technology and raw organics.” Located along the western wall, his ink and watercolour work presents many abstract concepts and depicts futuristic technologies.\nThe works of Janas, located along the southern wall, consist of pop-cultural icons in watercolour and comic book visual narratives. The calm colour scheme in contrast with the vibrancy of the bold black lines appeal to the viewer.\nMclnroy’s work further adds to the show’s atmosphere with his cartoon style and effective use of bold black ink. He presents interesting and humorous subjects in his works, including a modern-day take on the Three Little Pigs.\nPresented along the northern wall are captivating images produced with India ink in an expressionistic style. The works of Maloku are powerful because of the unsettling feeling they create within the viewer.\n“I particularly like the raw emotion these images create,” comments Guzar. “I find them effective in creating this raw emotion as a result of the loose stylistic essence Maloku used to produce them.” These works are powerful and appealing as a result of the grotesque images which captivate and intrigue the viewer.\nGuzar describes the exhibition as “more conceptual than visual.” The works as a whole are effective because they are relatable on a universal level.

Contrary to cyberbullying fears, the blogosphere provides teens “with a safe area for self-exposure.” Blogging can “improve self-image, increase self-confidence, and gather friends.”\nThe study says blogging is considered ideal for anyone who is stressed, depressed, and anxious.\nPsychologists have recommended writing in the past as a method of emotional venting and problem solving. Writing, the authors of the study say, “influences the emotional state, as well as the social behavior of the writer.”\nBut blogging is different from writing in a journal. “Online writing enables free expression, easy rereading and editing, and convenient communication with others,” the study goes on to say.\nBloggers are in control of the interpersonal conversation online. Teenagers can modify their thoughts and decide if they would like their blog to be open to other peoples’ posts. The interpersonal sharing with others helps teens reduce their social stress.\n“The virtual environment gives [teens] a feeling of privacy and a sense of protection from exposure[…]or physical contact,” the study says, “which might be threatening in face-to-face encounters.” Bloggers can hide personal information from family and friends, but can engage in conversations with strangers who can give them advice.\nGenerally, teens are confident sharing their feelings online due to the anonymity and invisibility of the internet. Instead of seeing others’ reactions by sharing their problems publicly, they can focus on the content.\xa0 Because of this, blogging is a bigger release for teenagers.\nIn the study, a total of 161 teens participated, with 124 girls and 37 boys. They were asked to rate themselves by their level of self-esteem, peer relationship, and interpersonal activities. During the study, experts evaluated “the participants’ social–emotional condition” by reading their blog posts.\nIn total, participants were\xa0rated on 30 posts. The first and second group posted messages in their blogs on “their thoughts and feelings concerning their social\xa0circumstances and interpersonal relationships.” The first group opened their blog to others, the second did not. The third and fourth groups wrote “about any subject they wished.” The third group opened their blog to the public where the fourth group\xa0did not. To balance the study, a fifth group served as a control by writing entries in their personal diaries.\nUnlike diarists, the study shows that, “online writers describe their writing process as a dynamic dialogue.”\nBlogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter combine public and private worlds. Writers can construct identities online. By constructing their own identity, teens can manage the intimate details they choose to share or withhold from others.\nBloggers, the researchers imply, are in control even if their situation is spiralling out of control-—a comforting thought whenever a blog is updated.\n ']"

Photos by Jonathan Kim\nKristianne C. Anor\nContributor\n\nStepping into the Schulich Charity\xa0Association’s (SCA) fashion show was like stepping into another world. The green and purple lights, the techno music, and the number of people gathered in the room gave off a futuristic feel, which fit the forward-thinking purpose behind the show itself.\nHosted by the Schulich Charity Association (SCA), the SCA fashion show at The Underground on January 19 showcased the creative talents of York’s alumni and current students.\nJamal Yehia, the SCA’s director of internal logistics, noted that apart from their goal to  ensure that everyone had a good time, the fashion show was there to raise money.\n“In terms of raising money, each dollar raised contributes to helping another person’s life,” says Yehia. Every year the SCA, composed primarily of business students, tries to pick one different charity to fund-raise for. This year they picked Ornge, an organization that provides medical transport such as airplanes and helicopters to patients both in the air and on the ground.\nThroughout the night, bubbly co-hosts Rob Testa and the current SCA president Lamisse Younis, attempted to entertain the somewhat unresponsive audience, by telling jokes and performing magic tricks. Unfortunately, while the content of their skits was meant to be humorous, the delivery appeared to be highly staged and overly rehearsed. The transparency of Testa’s try-hard quirkiness coupled with the classy sophistication of Younis, however, provided a balance of personalities that made their run-of-the-mill routine satisfactory.\nSeveral local York talents performed during the fashion show: singers Bianca Boldisteanu, Prachi, New Dimesionz Dance Crew, illusionist/magician Rob Testa, Jordan Woods and Sasha Ortega, and the talented and graceful Dia. While most of the acts were forgettable, the only act that really stood out was Dia. Her song and dance routine of “Quando, Quando, Quando” and her rendition of Adele’s “Someone Like You” were absolutely beautiful.\nBackstage at the SCA fashion show, things were hectic and busy as half-naked models were running around, trying to race deadline. “It’s crazy back here trying to change,” says one model who was wearing a stunning summer dress designed by the Shweta.\nWhen it came to the fashion designers, the show’s co-directors, James Ious HyunJun Kim and Mariam Siha went for versatile and striking designers.\nUpon reviewing the overall show, the performances were unique in their own way. And though there were some awkward moments, the SCA charity fashion show was successful in the sense that it was able to raise money for charity and also in the sense that young local York-bred talents were given the exposure they truly deserved.\nHere are the hits and the misses\nMighty Clothing by Richard Park\nRichard Park’s collection included a variety of promo unisex T-shirts, which the young designer later admitted that he did not want to originally present at the fashion show. “I gave these shirts to the models, and I’m like ‘Here. Take them. Do whatever you want with them.’”\nAnd his models certainly did whatever they wanted with them. The male and female models came out with different variations of the same T-shirt—ripped, cropped, cut, and tied. Thus, not only was this hot designer’s talent being showcased, but his selected models’ creativity was also under the spotlight. “I just wanted them to have fun with them,” says Park. Park’s line can best be described as comfy, but trendy, with just the right amount of urban flavour, similar to a hipster Drake.\nSolace by Shweta Wahi\nThis adorable and experienced designer wins my award for the most versatile designer of the night. “I’m really stepping out of my comfort zone with these looks! I usually stick to solid colours!” says Wahi. Her work included a vivacious variety of original and colourful designs from cute spring and summer dresses featuring sexy corset backs to more risqué pieces like the leather jumpsuit, also featuring a sexy corset back. This designer managed to capture the perfect Jekyll and Hyde outfits in juxtaposing cute, yet sexy and sophisticated looks. Solace designs could best be described as boho-chic.\nEmily Kowalik by Emily Kowalik\nThe artistic creations of Emily Kowalik were were well-received by several members of the female audience. Her collection included a variety of long and short skirts, as well as blouses with daring and sexy backs. This designer’s strength was certainly her eye for mixing the right fabrics together to create an artsy, yet elegant ensemble. The only weakness is that the designer failed to establish a wide range of colour. Most of her looks were pale shades of pink, brown, and beige.\nSophisticated without being straitlaced, her collection was certainly one of the most original and most classy showcases of the night. Her looks embodied the perfect amount of class and chic. Kowalik’s line can best be described as a feminine/classy American Apparel.\nPadinaBondar by Padina Bondar\nPadinaBondar’s spectacularly funky, yet classy designs perfectly capture a retro-chic aura. Bondar’s inventive and innovative designs perfectly expresses the term “new age vintage.” Her short and long evening gowns were simultaneously adorable and breathtaking.\nThe designer demonstrated a wide colour range that very few of the other designers had chosen to pursue. Padina Bondar’s line is part refined, part rave, part flirty, part bold, but a whole lot of fun. Her showcased selection includes highly detailed and embellished embroidery that she masterly tailored into whimsical and feminine evening attire. Padina Bondar’s line can best be described as funky-class.\nFabio Potere by Mohammed Islam\nNext down the runway, we were introduced to Mohammed Islam’s collection of men’s sweaters. Apart from his collection of beautiful male models, Fabio Potere left a disappointing impression. Proper, but a bit pretentious, preppy with a twist of hipster, this collection really did not offer much variety in terms of gentleman attire, except for the leather tie. The leather tie, which surprisingly worked very well with the rest of the banal sweaters and cardigans, was the only jaw-dropper. Islam’s line can best be described as metropolitan day-wear or sexy Harry Potter, if you prefer.\nAnonymous by Anonymous\nDark, yet alternative; Anonymous’ designs were very original. The designer principally employed monotonous shades of black, white, and grey and constructed some of the most creative, yet simple designs for men and women. Anonymous’ designs gave off a very goth-like, underground look.\nShowcasing both men’s and women’s fashion, Anonymous’ designs offered a fair range of grungy, yet chic apparel. The Anonymous line just looked comfortable—a casual comfort that had exuded just enough elegance that the clothing could pass for a night out on the town. Unfortunately, about fifty per cent of Anonymous’ showcase was wearable, whereas the other fifty per cent? Well, let’s just keep that half anonymous. Anonymous designs could best be described as threadbare, but fashion-forward.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAward-winning filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici’s documentary about terror bombing in Israel is about conflicts everywhere\nJasmine Saroya\nContributor\n\nFor many, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just another conflict of many.

But members of the challenging party have alleged that there are a number of flaws in the election process.\nMandy Yang, who ran for director of Schulich with the slate Free York University (FYU), approached Excalibur with concerns regarding the way polls were run, and a number of students have backed up her claims.\nYang says that there was potential for double voting, and that there were instances in which students were given fewer ballots than there were slots.\nVivian Chen says she initially voted for Yang, who is a friend of hers. A few days later, she was stopped by a York United candidate in Central Square who asked her if she would vote. Chen says she informed the candidate that she had voted for Yang already, but the candidate said she didn’t know who Yang was and insisted that Chen vote for her. Chen asked if she could vote for just one slot, and the poll clerks allowed it. She was not asked if she had already voted.\n“I feel like there was a lack of administration. It didn’t happen properly,” she says.\nWhen Chen told Yang that she voted twice, Yang thought she would see for herself if this was possible. After removing her campaign gear, she went to a poll in the Lassonde Building to vote for a second time.\nUnlike her friend, she was asked whether or not she had already voted. Yang said no, and the poll clerk allowed her to proceed.\nHowever, the election’s chief returning officer (CRO), Cécile Des Vignes, says it is extremely unlikely that any individual was able to vote twice or receive only one ballot.\n“The margin of error was less than one per cent,” Des Vignes said in an email. “This could not have had any impact on the outcome of the elections.”\nHowever, students Yuanyou Ma and Stefan Gatti-Cavanagh both say that they had difficulty voting for their own colleges. Ma was not given a ballot for her college, Calumet, and Gatti-Cavanagh had to go to a second polling station to be able to vote for his college, Vanier.\n“They didn’t seem prepared very well,” says Gatti-Cavanagh, “I’m not sure if they were scamming everyone, I’m not sure what to feel.”\nHamid Osman, the YFS executive director, says that it is almost impossible for this to happen. He explains that the only confusion that arises when it comes to voting is when a student has a common name. But in these cases, the ballots are put into an envelope, and later cross-checked against their information.\nAnother student, Sangeung Jung, is also confused as to whether or not her vote was counted. She says the poll clerk could not find her name in the database, and she was given two envelopes to hold her ballots. This is done when someone has a common name, but on York University’s database, she is the only Sangeung Jung.\nRegardless, Osman expressed confusion as to why Yang did not approach Des Vignes when she ran into these problems.\n“I don’t understand why she would go to Excalibur first before coming to file a complaint with the CRO,” says Osman, who confirmed that Yang had not filed any formal complaints with Des Vignes. “If there were any issues, the CRO would have caught onto it,” he says. “It’s interesting that no one else from her team contested this.”\nHowever, Yang is not the only person on the FYU slate who believes the process is flawed. Jonathan Jupiter, FYU president, says that he has noticed many problems which may deter students from running against the incumbent party in the future.\n“At the end of the day, anyone campaigning deserves a fair election,” he says.\nHe does not think students were made aware of the fact that elections were happening, let alone taught how to vote correctly.\n“A spoiled vote means that someone who doesn’t understand how to complete a ballot has voted, someone who was not educated about the process,” he says.\n“People put up banners for Nas, for Frost Week, and Welcome Week. Why aren’t we promoting elections?” he asks. “Why can’t there be a display board of all candidates? Students aren’t aware enough.”\nJupiter also says that a lack of resources made campaigning considerably more difficult for FYU.\nNevertheless, Jupiter says he congratulates York United for their successful campaign.\n“York United worked hard and did a great job, and I don’t want to take anything away from them. But I do want to improve on elections,” he says. “Why should we run when we don’t have a chance? That’s the message they’re sending out.”\nWith files from Leslie Armstrong and Yuni Kim\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nRepresentatives from Students in Support of CUPE 3903 and JUST SAY NO TO STRIKE share their thoughts on the bargaining process\nYuni\xa0Kim\nNews Editor\n@YuniKimchi\n\xa0\nStudents in Support of CUPE 3903\nMy name is Farshad Azadian. I’m one of the activists and a spokesperson for the group. I’m a fourth-year undergraduate psychology major.\nJUST SAY NO TO STRIKE\nI’m the co-founder of JUST SAY NO TO STRIKE. I’m a York graduate student, and part of CUPE 3903 Unit 3.\n\xa0\nSupport CUPE\nWe want to prevent the strike.\xa0The administration at the university tried to drive a wedge between students and workers last time, waited it out for several months, and allowed McGuinty to step in. This divide between students and workers resulted in a prolonged strike. None of the academics\xa0want to be on strike. They have bills to pay, too. Students and workers should be united to make the university listen. Shoukri makes nearly half a million each year. Give the workers a better deal, that’s our demand. Workers are expecting job security, and that’s unacceptable?\nSAY NO\nOur purpose is to provide students with information about the strike process that is not biased in a way that the CUPE updates are. They say things like “someone at the table is forgetting to bargain!” in their language. When they talked about the strike mandate vote, they told people just to vote yes. They never ask people to question or present alternatives. If you’re a client, we’re the ones signing their cheques. CUPE 3903 are employees, but also students. We are also encouraging students to prevent a strike before it happens.\n\xa0\nSupport CUPE\nI was at U of T, and I transferred during the period of the strike. Actually at U of T, our union was bargaining as well. We ran a similar campaign to support CUPE 3902, and we pressured the admin. Students and workers were together. We collected up to 1,400 online and paper petitions, we brought it to the university […] at U of T, we prevented a strike. But at York, you had this strike that harmed education, hurt the workers, and you had stepping on labour rights.\nSAY NO\nI suppose if all the students decided to side with the union, the university would give in. But\xa0if the students sided with the university […] I think it works both ways. Union members could have done a better job not polarizing students. If they want to block the road, that’s fine. But I don’t want to talk to them. I remember one time I drove up to the entrance [during the 2008 strike], and one union member didn’t stop knocking on my window until I opened it, and she gave me her spiel. It’s not a good way to get students on your side. CUPE 3903, as opposed to U of T’s CUPE 3902, has had a lack of skills as far as communicating with the community. They come off as abrasive and off-putting.\n\xa0\nSupport CUPE\nWe’ve got a lot of support.

The winners were announced March 26, after the polls were closed and ballots counted.\n“All the candidates more or less played fair and stuck to the rules outlined to them in the YFS Elections Bylaws,” said chief returning officer, Cécile Des Vignes in an email to Excalibur. She noted that while a number of demerit points were handed out for reasons such as using unapproved campaign material, there were no disqualifications, marking this the first YFS election without a single disqualification, according to YFS executive director Hamid Osman.\nEvery candidate running on the YU slate for executive and director positions won their seat, including the three returning members of the executive team: Vanessa Hunt, Alastair Woods, and Robert Cerjanec.\nHunt, who is returning for her second term as YFS president, says that the win is a reflection of the hard work and effort her slate put\xa0into the election.\nShe says that many of the YFS’s main priorities will remain unchanged going into next year, such as issues with safety and student space topping the concerns.\nThe implementation of the remaining Metropolitan Action Committee on Violence Against Women and Children (METRAC) recommendations—specifically with reference to the mandatory women’s studies or equity class—is a major element.\nWhile this is something the YFS has been working towards over the past year, the recommendations that have yet to be addressed prompted Hunt to throw in her bid for a second time.\n“That is part of the reason I wanted to come back,” she says, explaining that the YFS has engaged in “heavy duty” research to support the implementation of an equity or women’s studies course, and that they intend to bring their research and work to the university and have the York senate approve the recommendations.\n“We’re all very excited and happy, but also very humbled,” says Hunt of their win and the YU slate’s upcoming challenges, noting the strong support she received from students during the campaign period.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAll exams to follow regular schedule as of now, says York admin\n\xa0Hamid\xa0Adem\nStaff Writer\n@excalweb\n\xa0\nWith CUPE 3903, the union representing teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and contract faculty legally allowed to strike as of April 12 if an agreement is not reached, many students might be facing exam schedules.\n“The university is in the process of figuring out a plan B if needed,” says a representative from the Registrar’s Office. “We haven’t been given any details yet, but when we do know it will be up on the York website.”\nJoanne Rider of York media says as of now, exam schedules remain the same.\n“We are meeting this Thursday and Friday with the union and the conciliator again, and will continue to provide regular updates,” she says. “So with respect to the question about backup or alternative schedules, currently all academic activities are proceeding as planned.”\nDespite the fact she may not get her grades on time, third-year English major Stephanie Mckechnie feels that CUPE 3903 has the right to go on strike for wages and benefits.\n“You need to do that kind of thing to get results,” she says. “The administration knows the student body will be really upset by it, so they would be more willing to give in to the bargaining.”\nHowever, not everyone holds the same view as Mckechnie when talking about the potential strike. Caroline Ruccella, a first-year student, understands the predicament but still feels stressed about the situation.\n“I’ve been terrified as hell for the past few months, and know all my major exams are happening.

Although it may sound like a fusion of Spike Jonze’s Adaptation with Federico Fellini’s 8½, Braff is quick to point out that, although depicted from a writer’s perspective, the film is more about “creative block” in general, something that “everyone can relate to.”\nFor Braff, creative block is a universal concept. Whether at home or at school, writing screenplays or writing essays, the process of formulating thoughts into tangible results is an everyday struggle, and in the enterprise to overcome, we often alienate those around us.\n“When you sit down with your notebook, it’s just you and your notebook,” says Braff. “There’s nothing else in the world except those two things. And when you’re absorbed into your world, it’s very difficult to bring someone else in and to see anything other than what’s in your focus.”\nBraff insists that his philosophy background has helped him see and approach the film differently.\n“In a lot of cases, a person only sees things one way,” says Braff. “Philosophy allows you to think outside the box and see different viewpoints.” Because he was taught to look at things differently and from varying perspectives, Braff describes how he can add fresh, creative, and unconventional insight. The result, he says, is a more nuanced and layered film.\nIn the making of Framed, however, Braff had a very different story to tell. He says the film was a byproduct of his mantra for seizing the day and the begetting of a beautiful friendship with the film’s director, John Virtue.\n“The only reason this film was my project and the director’s, is because I’ve known the director for a long time and we’re good friends,” Braff explains. Virtue sent him a copy of the script while he was in Japan at the time, and he instantly liked it. Braff replied by saying the pair could turn the script into something meaningful.\nIn way of offering advice for budding filmmakers, Braff says that if a friend comes up to you with a good idea for a movie, give them five to 10 minutes.\n“If someone approaches you with a great idea, don’t say you’re too busy for it. Take a moment and look at it,” suggests Braff. “Framed all started because a friend sent me a document that he had written out of fun.”\nTo Braff, having fun is what\xa0life, and university, is all about. University, he says, should be about meeting people with great ideas and adding your own creativity on top of that. If he wasn’t at York, Braff admits, the process of making a film would never have crossed his mind.\nBraff says networking is the most important thing.\n“At the end of the day, it’s who you know and how you know them,” he says. “Six degrees of separation ends up working for you.”\nHis personal convictions and hard work have paid off, culminating in a confirmation email from the Cannes Film Festival that booked him, his director, and their film, a ticket to France.\n“It was the best day of my life,” Braff says.\nBut just because he has booked a ticket to Cannes, it doesn’t mean Braff will be taking a break from his producing duties. Along with his upcoming exams, his schedule is full.\nHe and Virtue are currently in the process of securing venues to screen their film with at the TIFF Lightbox—and on campus—before they embark for Cannes.\nOn top of that, Braff sees Cannes as a great opportunity\xa0to generate interest for the film and to connect with possible distributors, producers, and other eminent members of the film industry. When asked whether or not he thinks Framed will win any awards, Braff says that producing the film was an achievement in and of itself.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nPurniya\xa0Awan\n\nStaff Writer\n@excalweb\nAccording to calendars created by the Mayans (an advanced Mesoamerican civilization that existed from 2000 BCE until their destruction by the Spanish in 1697 CE), the end of humanity will come December 21, 2012 when some catastrophe is predicted to demolish the world. Many theorize that the end of the world will come from astronomical events, from a “killer” solar flare to a huge asteroid.\nOthers, like Young, however, theorize that the end of humanity may just come from a nuclear war.\nYoung started preparing for Doomsday after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, even after peace was maintained. His thoughts on surviving things like nuclear war stayed with him throughout his childhood and even now.\n“I wrote a short story when I was 12 about my age group in school withstanding the Soviet invasion,” says Young who has read about hundreds of wars and deadly disasters. “So things like that were on my mind as I grew up.”\nYoung is not alone though. The preparation-centric fiction he writes and publishes on the internet has a readership of well over 10,000 and the number of people who have started preparing seems to be increasing as days go by.\n“There are thousands upon thousands of other people doing their best to get ready for anything from a loss of a job, to medical emergencies, all the way up to Doomsday,” says Young.\nThe amount of people preparing for the end has grown big enough that there is a network dedicated to helping them known as the American Preppers Network (APN).\nThe network defines these “preppers” as a group of people who have started preparing for Doomsday, or TEOTWAWKI—The End of the World as We Know It. There are “preppers” in the United States and in parts of Canada, Australia, and Italy, according to Tom Martin, founder and chief visionary officer of the APN\nThe network already has over seven thousand “likes” on their Facebook page and has gained the attention of organizations like the BBC and Popular Mechanics.\nThe way Young and Martin both see it is that the world right now is not very sustainable, whether you look at it from a financial point of view or an environmental one. The radical weather patterns and the frequent occurrences of natural disasters around the world indicate to them that something big is going to happen which will either destroy the world or change the world that we know today.\nWhich is why Young says that it’s important to be prepared for not only “Doomsday,” but for accidents and disasters which can occur at any time.\nWhile Young does not believe the popular Mayan prophecies about the world ending by the end of this year, he does however, believe that several natural cycles are reaching either peaks or lows, depending on the type of cycle, with the sunspot cycle one of the key ones, indicating that some bad natural disasters will occur.\nWhen asked what kind of advice Young has for university students, he suggested that we forget about preparing for “Doomsday” for the moment and make preparations for basic human needs first.\nMartin’s advice reflected the views of Young: “Students need to learn how to budget and manage their finances since things like credit cards and loans will not be useful when a disaster strikes. Students should learn how to make their own meals and make sure they have enough food stocked up for at least three months.”\nSome preppers may follow the Mayan calendar, but they all have one common goal: to be prepared on a daily basis just in case they are faced with a natural disaster of some sort.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMatthew Danton\nContributor\nThe streets are decrepit in Aida, a Palestinian refugee camp located just two kilometres north of Bethlehem.

They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.\nWhile both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.\n“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.\nVanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.\n“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”\nThe BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.\nAs of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.\nThe campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.\nMembers of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012. They celebrated the YFS’s endorsement after the meeting at around 1:45 p.m. with a march around campus, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “victory.”\nThe Graduate Students Association at York endorsed the BDS campaign on November 16, 2012, as have other student organizations including the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association and the University of Toronto Graduate Student Union.\nHillel at York and Hasbara @ York condemned YFS’s endorsement of the BDS campaign on behalf of York’s undergraduate students and issued a statement through the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.\nIn the statement, Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara @ York, says Hasbara is “extremely disappointed” that the YFS passed this resolution. He alleges the YFS is “blacklisting and boycotting Israelis.” Lax also alleges the YFS’ resolution is “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”\nCherkasov says as a union representing the interests of 55,000 undergraduates, the YFS should not take a political stance on an issue that does not affect all students on campus.\n“I understand that we all have our personal opinions, but the fact that [the YFS] took a stance on a very touchy issue for Israeli and Palestinian students, I think that was inappropriate,” says Cherkasov. “Now, they have marginalized a group of students and created a hostile environment because they adopted the BDS movement.”\nLax echoed Cherkasov’s opinion, saying the YFS should not take a political stance that could divide the campus.\nHe says 4,000 students have signed a petition against the GSA’s endorsement of BDS, created in November 2012 by Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York.\n“It showed a substantial amount of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.\nHusein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.\nShe says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she would be happy to meet with them to discuss it.\n“Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important,” says Husein.\nHusein says to remain silent on issues of basic equality is often a tacit endorsement of injustice.\n“We engage in anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, and anti-sexism campaigns not because they are popular, but because they are right, and they are important to our members,” she says.\nJoanne Rider of York media says university administration has not been contacted by the YFS or any other student groups regarding this campaign.\nSAIA will be holding a protest March 27 in Vari Hall at 1 p.m. to call on university

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign at York, causing an uproar from those who disagree with its aims.\nThis decision was made during a meeting called by the YFS’ executive members held at the Underground on March 21, where a motion was put forth to endorse the BDS campaign, resulting in a vote of 18-2 in favour of its endorsement.\nApproximately 200 undergraduate students attended the meeting.\nSafiyah Husein, vp equity of the YFS, says the BDS movement is a form of “international solidarity with the Palestinian call for justice, equality, and an end to the occupation” that “puts pressure on institutions to divest from companies currently funding weaponry for the Israeli military.”\nOver 5,000 students signed a petition asking the YFS to discuss the BDS issue, says Husein.\nJessica Cherkasov, member of Hillel at York, alleges no one from Hillel at York or Hasbara @ York was officially informed of the meeting, the motion, or of the meeting’s agenda. They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.\nWhile both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.\n“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.\nVanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.\n“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”\nThe BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.\nAs of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.\nThe campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.\nMembers of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012. They celebrated the YFS’s endorsement after the meeting at around 1:45 p.m. with a march around campus, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “victory.”\nThe Graduate Students Association at York endorsed the BDS campaign on November 16, 2012, as have other student organizations including the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association and the University of Toronto Graduate Student Union.\nHillel at York and Hasbara @ York condemned YFS’s endorsement of the BDS campaign on behalf of York’s undergraduate students and issued a statement through the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.\nIn the statement, Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara @ York, says Hasbara is “extremely disappointed” that the YFS passed this resolution. He alleges the YFS is “blacklisting and boycotting Israelis.” Lax also alleges the YFS’ resolution is “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”\nCherkasov says as a union representing the interests of 55,000 undergraduates, the YFS should not take a political stance on an issue that does not affect all students on campus.\n“I understand that we all have our personal opinions, but the fact that [the YFS] took a stance on a very touchy issue for Israeli and Palestinian students, I think that was inappropriate,” says Cherkasov. “Now, they have marginalized a group of students and created a hostile environment because they adopted the BDS movement.”\nLax echoed Cherkasov’s opinion, saying the YFS should not take a political stance that could divide the campus.\nHe says 4,000 students have signed a petition against the GSA’s endorsement of BDS, created in November 2012 by Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York.\n“It showed a substantial amount of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.\nHusein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.\nShe says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she would be happy to meet with them to discuss it.\n“Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important,” says Husein.\nHusein says to remain silent on issues of basic equality is often a tacit endorsement of injustice.\n“We engage in anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, and anti-sexism campaigns not because they are popular, but because they are right, and they are important to our members,” she says.\nJoanne Rider of York media says university administration has not been contacted by the YFS or any other student groups regarding this campaign.\nSAIA will be holding a protest March 27 in Vari Hall at 1 p.m. to call on university administration to address their demands.\nMelissa Sundardas, News Editor\n ']"

In the same interivew, Markicevic said that as a result of York firing him, his reputation has been damaged, he’s having a hard time finding a new job, and that this situation has cost his family about $800,000 in legal costs to date.\nMarkecevic said to the Toronto Star that he is depicted by York as being the mastermind behind the entire fraud invoice scheme, with the university filling the civil action suit in early 2012 before the police criminal charges.\n“I’m not able discuss specifics relating to an individual’s case when it comes to an agreement made with the university, but we are making an effort through the civil action suit to recover the funds that were defrauded by Markicevic,” says Rider.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nPresident Shoukri has placed in Canadian Immigrant Magazines Top 25 contest.\xa0\nYork’s President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri is in the running for Canadian Immigrant magazine’s Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards.\nThe awards acknowledge citizens for their accomplishments in their adoptive country.\nSanjay Agnihotri, director of operations and strategy at Metroland Specialty Markets, who leads the Top 25 awards program, says Shoukri’s nomination was a result of his inspiring academic and professional accomplishments, as well as his participation in many organizations.\nShoukri currently sits on the boards of directors for the Ontario Centres of Excellence, Cancer Care Ontario, and the Canadian Merit Scholarship Foundation.\n“I am extremely honoured to be nominated for this prestigious award along with such respected and accomplished individuals who have contributed so much to Canada,” says Shoukri.\nThe nomination process is open to all Canadians who wish to nominate an inspirational immigrant with permanent residency or citizenship in Canada.\nNominators are asked to provide reasons as to why the nominee is inspiring to them, including any accomplishments they have made and any challenges they have overcome, explains Agnihotri.\nNominations, as well as votes, were made on Canadian Immigrant’s website.

Each new editor brings a different set of priorities and personality to their job;\xa0it’s simultaneously a way to improve the learning experience and stay in touch with the ever evolving needs of the community we serve.\n“Cynicism is far too easy, and we are all of us doing the best we can.”\nAnd believe me, we’re here to serve.\nTo those unacquainted with Excalibur, I’ll give you this sentence to expend your phallic jokes re: our name.

Our job is simply to be journalists, journalists that look out for the interests of York’s students, faculty, and community.\nTo those familiar with Excalibur and are cynical about the paper, student journalism, or the impact of the press-at-large: at the end of the day, we’re still here to look out for you, regardless of how you view us. Cynicism is far too easy, and we are all of us doing the best we can.\nTo those of us who pick up and read Excalibur regularly, we can guarantee the paper will only get better. We’ve picked up from what was already an amazing team of editors, and we have titanic shoes to fill.\nOur team is diverse. Some of us have worked here in other positions, others are entirely new, and a few of us started as volunteers and staff writers. Our doors are open to anyone and everyone who wants to be a part of the team, and this has only ever been a good thing.\nThe paper has content online and in print; we change with the times, and expect a Herculean degree of web content this year. The physical paper will stay strong, too, no matter how many death bells toll for print journalism.\nHey, we outlived Newsweek. Isn’t that neat-o?\nAt this point, it’s not unsafe to call Excalibur an institution at York, and while there have been ups and down in the paper’s history, we have a standard of excellence to meet — a standard that’s set not by us, but by you, the reader.\nAnd I can speak for the entire team when I say we plan to go above and beyond the call of duty for the next year.

Having put on a variety of in-company shows over the last two years, LBA has found success in fringe festivals and short runs across southern Ontario. Luke answered a few questions for incoming theatre students.\nExcalibur: What’d you like and dislike about first year theatre?\nLuke Reece: My favourite thing about first year theatre was the variety of skills I learned. I was hanging lights, making skirts, and building a giant water tower for Hippolytos. You get to learn about every aspect of theatre, inside and out. There is also a really friendly community that is wonderful to be a part of.\nI don’t think there was anything I really disliked but something that was challenging for me was making the time for crew shifts. I was (and still am) commuting from Mississauga and I wouldn’t be home until 11:30 pm or later on days I had crew shifts and then up early the next morning to get to Stagecraft.\nE: What do you wish you had done more of in first year, especially re: your program and your aspirations?\xa0\nL: I’m fairly happy with everything I did in first year. I was there for Orientation Week, acted in Playground, played intramural sports and all that fun stuff.\xa0I guess what I wish I did more was go see more of the upper-year devised shows. Shows, shows and more shows! See the un-mounted ones too.\nE: What do you wish you hadn’t done?\xa0\nL: I wish I hadn’t procrastinated as much as I did! I wish I hadn’t not slept as much. Yes, that’s a double negative. That’s what happens when you don’t sleep enough. ..make sure you stay healthy! Take care of your body and your body will take care of you.\nE: How did first year shape you as both a creative person and help build up Little Black Afro ?\xa0\nL: First year shaped my creative being in the most positive way ever. I was exposed to new techniques and did things I never thought I would even try. I also met a ton of other creative people who I learned from. You learn a lot from working with your fellow theatre students.\nAs for Little Black Afro, after my first year of theatre, I had learned so much and I wanted to put it into practice. My friend Ryan Ovas came to me with the idea and we just went to it. It’s that easy. I reworked a piece I wrote back in high school, and it was noticeably better. It was clear proof that I had improved as a theatre artist through my first year at York. And then, in future shows our cast and crew were all Yorkies.\nE: What advice would you give to incoming theatre students regarding the program?\xa0\nL: Try everything! Approach everything with an open mind, and prepare to surprise yourself with everything you will learn. There are things you didn’t think you’d like that you’ll like a lot and vice versa. It’s a lot of work, but you get out what you put in, so work hard. Also, don’t be afraid to have fun. It’s a big York theatre family, and now you’re a part of it. Welcome!\nAbdul Malik\nArts Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nDon Jon, Joseph Gordon- Levitt’s directorial debut, is a strong, bold take on how our generation forms relationships and how unrealistic our expectations of those relationships can be.\nDon Jon cares about very little besides porn and the flashes of open-mouthed women and bouncing breasts during the opening credits of the film make this clear.\nWe follow Jon, played by Gordon-Levitt himself, a chauvinistic, Jersey Shore-esque “bro,” who likes to work out, go to the club, go to church, and masturbate excessively. During a typical night out at the club, he meets who he believes is the woman of his dreams, Barbara, played by Scarlett Johannson.\nAs their relationship progresses, it becomes clear that Jon and Barbara aren’t on the same page in terms of expectations, which we see during a scene in which Barbara tells Jon how she desperately wants him to meet her parents.\nand take classes at night school as he dry-humps her outside of her apartment. He wants sex as good as the pornography he is addicted to, and she wants a happy ending like the ones shown in the films she obsessively watches.\nEverything in Jon’s life is an objectified version of what it’s supposed to be, and Gordon- Levitt shows us this is a bold way. When his portrayals verge on the stereotypical, we’re reminded that he doesn’t take himself too seriously. His girlfriend is almost too hot, but also incredibly vapid and demanding. His family looks like an Italian-American blue-collar family taken straight out of one of too many reality TV shows. His church is where he confesses his numerous sins and instantly redeems himself by reciting 10 Hail Marys and 10 Lord’s Prayers. It is only when he gets to know Ester, played by Julianne Moore, a quirky middle-aged woman in his night class, that he begins to reflect on his empty affair with pornography and how it affects his relationships\xa0with women.\nGordon-Levitt is able to walk the line between satire and stereotype, while creating a tight narrative that wraps up in a satisfying conclusion.\nThe social commentary is relevant and honest, but doesn’t overwhelm the script. Levitt knew exactly how deep to go with this film, and he hit his mark perfectly. If he remains this tempered and disciplined, he could be a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Considering all the attention Don Jon has been getting, we will all certainly be watching.\nMarileina Pearson\nPhoto Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAmidst international cries\xa0for their release, York film\xa0professor John Greyson\xa0and London, Ontario\xa0doctor Tarek Loubani are still\xa0being held in an Egyptian prison.\nThe actual date of the arrest is\xa0unconfirmed, but most sources\xa0have reported it to be between\xa0August 16 and 18.

He added that the\xa015-day detention order is not jail\xa0time, but rather a “detention order\xa0pending investigation.”\nThe detainment of Loubani and\xa0Greyson comes at a turbulent time\xa0for Egypt as they face the deadliest\xa0period of civil unrest they have\xa0seen in 60 years.\xa0It was only recently that Egyptian\xa0President Mohammed Morsi\xa0was ousted as from o ce, and\xa0since then, conflict has erupted\xa0between the Muslim Brotherhood,\xa0the military, and other political\xa0factions within the country.\nThis recent violence has killed\xa0over 1,000 people, which makes\xa0the detainment of the two Canadian\xa0even more concerning for\xa0family and friends.\nAccording Canadian officials in\xa0Egypt, it appears that the pair were\xa0at the wrong place at the wrong\xa0time, and were apprehended\xa0during the arrests of anti-government\xa0protesters, reported CTV.\xa0Shalakany Law Office has been\xa0hired to represent Greyson and\xa0Loubani and is currently working\xa0to free the pair, who are being\xa0held pending an investigation by\xa0prosecutors.\nGreyson, who has been part\xa0of York’s film department since\xa02005, is both an awarding winning\xa0filmmaker and professor of\xa0video theory, film production, and\xa0editing.\xa0President and Vice-Chancellor\xa0Mamdouh Shoukri says the university\xa0as a whole is extremely concerned\xa0about the safety and well being\xa0of Greyson and Loubani.\n“We are in contact with Canadian\xa0government officials about\xa0the detainment of the two men,\xa0and we offer our support for theirsafe return,” says Shoukri.\n“Our\xa0thoughts are also with their family\xa0and friends at this time.”\nDeepak Obhrai, parliamentary\xa0secretary to John Baird, Minister\xa0of Foreign Affairs, told CBC on\xa0August 19 that the federal government\xa0is trying to call on the Egyptian\xa0ambassador for the release of\xa0Greyson and Loubani.\nMeanwhile, demands for the\xa0quick release of the two Canadians\xa0has been growing in Canada.\xa0Other universities, including\xa0Western and Queen’s, have\xa0released statements of support,\xa0along with organizations like the\xa0Canadian Civil Liberties Association,\xa0Canadian Doctors for Medicare,\xa0and the Toronto International\xa0Film Festival.\nA petition has also been set up on change.org, calling on the\xa0Canadian government to put pressure\xa0on Egyptian authorities for\xa0a quick release and has gathered\xa0over 86,000 signatures as of publication.\nNews\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nRepresentatives from\xa0Students Against Israeli\xa0Apartheid recently sat\xa0down with York administration\xa0to discuss the SAIA rally\xa0that occurred earlier this year,\xa0which resulted in their club status\xa0being revoked until January 2014.\nThe meeting with administration,\xa0which took place August 7 in\xa0the President’s Office, followed a\nYork University Board of Governors\xa0meeting on June 24, during\xa0which members of the Board\xa0walked out after SAIA members\xa0attempted to engage them in a\xa0discussion.\nAt the June 24 meeting, SAIA\xa0delivered a communication to the\xa0chair of the Board, which was read\xa0aloud by a student Board member.\xa0The board was then advised by\xa0the speaker that the document,\xa0which contained demands from\xa0SAIA, be drawn to the president’s\xa0attention.\nOnce the first page of the statement\xa0was read, individuals from\xa0SAIA attempted to engage the\xa0board in a conversation, expressing\xa0concerns about York’s alleged\xa0investments in weapons manufacturing\xa0companies and the sanctions\xa0imposed on their club.\n“SAIA members had violated\xa0meeting protocol and the chair’s\xa0repeated requests to follow protocol\xa0were not met.

According to SAIA, the adjudicator said, “I didn’t find that there was a breach. I think that what the student was complaining about was fair, but I didn’t think that it met that threshold of disruptive activity. I didn’t find a formal breach.”\nYork officials, however, state: “It is false that the adjudicator found there to be no academic disruption. In fact, academic activities were disrupted which is in violation of University policy. “\nThe university also notes that members of SAIA were warned verbally and in writing that they were in violation of a contract signed by the club, stating that it would abide by all university policies.\nThe same day SAIA’s club status was officially revoked on May 3, SAIA activist and York alumnus Hammam Farah was also banned from York property due to “repeated disruption of academic activities.”\n“SAIA claims adjudicator ruled no breach.”\nAl Sarraj commented on this past summer’s meetings: “What York is currently portraying is that they treat alumni like outsiders who come on private property.”\nEarlier this month, a total of 125 York faculty members signed a statement addressed to Shoukri, as well as to Janet Morrison, vice-provost of students, and Gary Brewer, vice-president of finance and administration, expressing their concerns about civil liberties on campus. The statement cited an earlier statement made by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association who also came out in support of SAIA.\nThe statement called on York administration to restore SAIA’s full rights as a student club, to withdraw the trespass notice against Farah, and to amend the Student Code of Conduct and the Temporary Use of Student Space Policy to “recognize the legitimate right of peaceful assembly on campus by members of the […] community.”\nSAIA has also been gathering support for their reinstatement as a student club through an online petition which has collected 1,363 signatures thus far.\nHamid Adem\nNews Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nCan you believe that Ontario doesn’t have CEGEP yet?\nFor those who don’t know, allow me to be condescending for a moment about something I was unaware of until last year: CEGEP (Collège d’enseignement général et professionnel) is Quebec’s enforced college system.\nBasically, students from the province enter university with two years of post-secondary experience that we don’t get in Ontario. I feel like the kid who just found out all his friends get money when they lose a tooth.\n“CEGEP lets you figure out your future cheaply.”\nI’m well aware that mass overhauls of education, healthcare, and everything else are tricky business. I’m also quite familiar with the questions many people have about Quebec’s education system on the whole. It does work, however. The benefits are twofold.\nFor one, every year thousands of university students pay Ontario millions of dollars in tuition just to figure out what they maybe want to do at some point if they don’t want to not do it. A lot of these people end up dropping out in a year, or three, after their fortunes have been drained discovering they don’t want to be a psycho-para-engineer.\nCEGEP lets you figure out your future cheaply. The programs are usually two years long and are affordable – two reasons it really doesn’t matter if you screwed up choosing your major. In fact, many CEGEP students will focus in one stream, and discover their future university major in some mandatory other class on the side.\nWe enter university at 17 or 18 in Ontario. In Quebec, high school ends a year earlier, but the extra year of schooling that CEGEP provides means they start university around 19. Those couple years at the end of our teenagehood are pretty formative. It doesn’t matter what you do with that time – by the laws of science, you’re going to grow up.\nPersonally, I think that giving yourself a year or two to mature before entering university can help relieve the stresses of adapting to a new environment, and reduce social anxieties that many first-years have.\nFor this reason, I’ve always encouraged taking a year off between high school and university, but a CEGEP equivalent would be even better, offering something productive for us to do with that time and a means to adjust more smoothly into higher education.\nOntario already offers the choice to pursue college, but it’s more of an opposing option to university than a companion. With a CEGEP-like program in place, many people will find a passion that they otherwise wouldn’t have known they thirsted.\nSo do I think that this little piece is actually going to cause the Ontario government to reform their entire education system, build dozens of new institutions, and hire thousands of new professors? I’m 60 per cent sure it won’t. But maybe this will help cultivate some sort of action.\nIf Ontario won’t initiate an equivalent program with the scope of Quebec’s, they can at least encourage other post-secondary endeavors that help bridge an oft-ignored leap in our young lives. Let’s make that big journey off to university really worth it when the time comes. We don’t all have the luxury to be uncertain.\nDustin Dyer\nContributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe Excalibur opinions section welcomes typed, double-spaced letters (no longer than 300 words).

There was a heavy security presence and there were no major incidences that would be cause for sanctions. York’s administration has proved very prejudiced against anyone who dares speak out against injustice. Isuspect that this decision must have been pre-meditated; there must also have been influence from the university’s shareholders and affiliates to resort to this decision.\nThe March 27 rally is not a sufficient reason and has crossed the line into censorship. Furthermore threatening YUBSA, OPIRG, and other student groups is a desperate move. Iwould think that York University would be a great space to exercise our civil liberties, York being progressive and all, but now it no longer feels like the safer, inclusive space they promised us when we enrolled. Ifully agree with SAIAthat the decision to revoke their status is an attack on academic freedom.\nMargaret Macharia\nBA Economics Hon.\xa04th year\nRe: Safety forums\xa0\nIam writing this in reply to a recent opinion article entitled “York administration plays it safe” in Volume 47, Issue 22 of the Excalibur. Iwas slightly disappointed when Iread this article that emphasized the “lack of interest” of the writer for safety initiatives that the university undertakes. Ican only hope that not too many students at the university have the same opinion and indifference towards this topic, but Ifear that Imight be wrong.\nIdo not know if the intentions of the forums held over the past year were “part of a larger public relations strategy of the university,” but Ibelieve that they were not. Nonetheless, the forums held were an amazing opportunity for everyone in the community to come together and voice their concerns on a very important topic. If you want your voice to be heard, you should not take it elsewhere. WE, the students, ARE York University, and only we can make it better. While the administration might have the financial power or the fancy job titles, students can be leaders and agents of social change, if we so choose to be, by investing our passions accordingly. Imagine that there were no inspiring and passionate individuals in the world: what would happen if we were all to decide that we no longer cared?\nIoana Gheorghiu\nBA Nursing,\xa01st year\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2013/08/29/university-meets-with-saia-in-attempt-to-resolve-issues/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nRepresentatives from\xa0Students Against Israeli\xa0Apartheid recently sat\xa0down with York administration\xa0to discuss the SAIA rally\xa0that occurred earlier this year,\xa0which resulted in their club status\xa0being revoked until January 2014.\nThe meeting with administration,\xa0which took place August 7 in\xa0the President’s Office, followed a\nYork University Board of Governors\xa0meeting on June 24, during\xa0which members of the Board\xa0walked out after SAIA members\xa0attempted to engage them in a\xa0discussion.\nAt the June 24 meeting, SAIA\xa0delivered a communication to the\xa0chair of the Board, which was read\xa0aloud by a student Board member.\xa0The board was then advised by\xa0the speaker that the document,\xa0which contained demands from\xa0SAIA, be drawn to the president’s\xa0attention.\nOnce the first page of the statement\xa0was read, individuals from\xa0SAIA attempted to engage the\xa0board in a conversation, expressing\xa0concerns about York’s alleged\xa0investments in weapons manufacturing\xa0companies and the sanctions\xa0imposed on their club.\n“SAIA members had violated\xa0meeting protocol and the chair’s\xa0repeated requests to follow protocol\xa0were not met.

Perhaps it’s because in our angst-ridden early adulthood, a crooner’s release of “Silver Bells” simply doesn’t touch our icy soul. But whatever the reason, it seems that many people at York don’t like holiday music.\nIf you find the blizzard of Christmas tunes around this time emotionally numbing, infuriatingly catchy, culturally assimilating, too religious, or conversely, too commercial, you’re not alone. It’s part of the lethal holiday mix that drives employees and customers everywhere into a state of rage.\nBut there may be hope yet for the herds of Christmas-weary students. Not all Christmas music is so bad. Over the last decade or two, the music industry has slowly trudged out some gems by bands a little more worthy of radio play than Susan Boyle.\nHere are 15 downloads to put on your next seasonal mixtape:\n1. “Did I Make You Cry on Christmas Day? (Well, You Deserved it)” by Sufjan Stevens\xa0\nOf the 50 or so Sufjan Stevens Christmas songs on record, this is the best. The instrumentation and Stevens’ shaky, harmonized voice have all the drabness and depression of an office X-mas party, but the overall arrangement is beautifully moving and folksy.\n2. “Christmas Lights” by Coldplay\xa0\nThis single, released in 2010, begins low-key, led solely by a sparkling, effervescent piano, but eventually achieves the kind of grandiose, heavily orchestrated Coldplay heard in “Viva La Vida.” It’s also a rare Christmas tune about heartbreak and relationship problems.\n3. “The First Song” by Band of Horses\xa0\nThe best Christmas songs are those that aren’t actually written for the season — the lyricist just had the holidays on their mind. The vocals in “The First Song” are cried with BoH’s typical uber-reverb, but one of the few clear lines is “Christmas time’s coming.”\n4. “I Wish it Was Christmas Today” by Julian Casablancas\xa0\nCasablancas, the frontman of The Strokes, does a jingly cover of the song made popular by Saturday Night Live’s Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz, Tracy Morgan, and Chris Kattan. Aside from the expected Casablancas throatiness and danceable beat, the rendition is actually pretty faithful.\n5. “It’s Christmas So We’ll Stop” by Frightened Rabbit\xa0\nThe Scottish indie band’s attempt at a Christmas track is as touching as it is minimalist. Mostly backed only by the carefully composed plucks of an acoustic guitar, the song builds to a swell of choir humming and percussion, and feels like an audio sweater being placed over your shoulders after a sad skating trip.\n6. “Are You Coming Over For Christmas?” by Belle and Sebastian\xa0\nThe Glasgow band’s playful Christmas gem kicks off with a jazzy tone, evoking famous holiday tunes from the 40s, while having the likability of modern indie pop’s most darling act. From there, the duo’s soft and lispy vocals accompany an alternation of big brass and tranquil bass strums.\n7. “Candy Cane Children” by The White Stripes\xa0\nMaybe the most gritty and unpolished Christmas song of all time, “Candy Cane Children” is actually a somewhat hard find, especially its studio version. Nonetheless, it’s worth the search for Stripes fans, with Jack at his most unhinged, tattering his vocal chords, and Meg slamming those drums like she literally wants to break a record.\n8. “All I Want for Christmas” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs\xa0\nIn a way, this is as Christmas-spirited as you can get: Karen O actually sounds pleasant and a little seductive, and there are some unexpected holiday tropes thrown in: jingle bells behind the sheen of guitar strings, a snowfall tempo, etc. But a sloshed-sounding O dedicates the song to “the people\xa0they love” right off the bat, so you can be rest assured this wasn’t some festive cash-in.\n9. “I Do Not Care for the Winter Sun” by Beach House\xa0\nSome people do not care for Beach House’s too-distant, ice queen sound, but it lends itself well to a winter-themed song. The tune shivers with Christmas loneliness, and is warmed only by the sound of its own sunburst electric guitar. It ends with Charlie Brown-worthy Yuletide lyrics (“it’s all that matters this time of year”) but they’re chilled with a melancholy piano outro.\n10. “Xmas Time is Here Again” by My Morning Jacket\xa0\nIf Radiohead and Fleet Foxes had a disappointingly conventional baby, it would be My Morning Jacket. If nothing else, that baby would’ve been born to perform a hipster Christmas anthem or two. That’s exactly what these bearded boys with bad style did. “Xmas Time is Here Again” is gentle and harmless, a little poignant, and very suggestive of the winter woodsmen in the recording booth.\n11. “The Christmas Song” by The Raveonettes\xa0\nThe most popular of the songs on this list (you’ll definitely hear this in an HMV or Sears around this time), The Raveonettes’ holiday jam is still commendable for its great musicality and for the Danish duo’s reliably haunting, consistent harmony. The lyrics are traditional Christmas schlock, but nothing can take away from moving chord changes and faint guitar wailing.\n12. “Got Something for You” by Best Coast and Wavves\xa0\nAt first, the collaboration between real-life lovers Best Coast and Wavves doesn’t sound so different from a Target Radio choice (because that’s exactly what it was written for). But over two minutes, these Cali surf rock hipsters pull out their own brand of rad, sneaking some garage-rock crunch into a market-friendly exterior.\n13. “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” by Death Cab for Cutie\xa0\nThis one’s kind of a cheat, as you’ll be sick to death of U2’s version by late November, but Death Cab manages to escape the Christmas music trap, turning this “classic” into a fairly traditional yet well-composed indie rock song, with the bonus/detractor of Ben Gibbard’s beautiful voice.\n14. “Christmas at the Zoo” by The Flaming Lips\xa0\nAn upbeat, sort of Christmas-y song, performed by pop rock’s weirdest band. It starts off seasonal enough, with disheveled frontman Wayne Coyne lamenting about the lack of snow on Christmas Eve, but pretty quickly he’s just shouting about monkeys and birds being loose. What else did you expect?\n15. “Christmas in Harlem” by Kanye West\xa0\nNo such list would be complete without Kanye’s sleazy and nostalgic six-and-a-half minute, ghetto-blasting gift to the world. Bringing with him an army of urban music all-stars, West manages to hit a sweet spot in spite of himself, and produce a crude, vulgar, ass-shaking Christmas carol that’s also unexpectedly worthy of a fireside hot chocolate.\nWith 15 fine Christmas songs at your disposal, you may make it through the holiday toil yet. Get these on a mixtape and block out Kelly Clarkson. You can still have a hipster — I mean, happy – holiday season.\nDustin Dyer\nFeatures Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nGet your Toronto events on!\n\xa0\nHave any plans for the coming winter break?

This year, like any year, changed the world and added its unique stamp on history — politically, socially, and culturally. Here are some of the moments and movements that shaped the last 365 days (give or take a month).\nIn entertainment:\nJust this week, 40-year-old • Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died, tragically and ironically, in a car crash. Cory Monteith, the 31-year-old star of TV’s Glee, died of a drug overdose in July. Other notable deaths in the entertainment industry this year included singer-songwriter and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, espionage-fiction writer Tom Clancy, Sopranos star James Gandolfini, and famous film critic Roger Ebert.\nAs of publication, • Iron Man 3 was the year’s highest grossing film, while Justin Timberlake’s The 20/20 Experience and Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2 were notably successful albums. Grand Theft Auto V was the top video game, and had the biggest debut of any entertainment release in history.\nGravity• and 12 Years a Slave are currently the frontrunners for Best Picture at next year’s Oscars. The former was a giant leap for mankind in terms of technical innovation; the latter is one of the most brutal accounts of history to come from Hollywood — this decade’s Schindler’s List.\xa0\nBreaking Bad • had record ratings for a cable series in its final episodes, and furthermore, cemented its legacy as what some are calling the best television show of all time.\nMiley Cyrus and Amanda • Bynes: two famous female tweens grew into raunchy, notorious adults… seemingly in months. Cyrus has found success and new fandom thanks to her racy persona, but Bynes has been deemed mentally unstable due to her self-destructive, concerning online presence.\nEvents:\nThe Chelyabinsk Meteor collided with Earth, causing major destruction and injuries in Russia. It was the largest object to enter the planet’s atmosphere in over 100 years.\nThe Boston Bombing: two \xa0explosives detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 264. It was one of the most shocking acts of terrorism in the U.S. since 9/11.\nPope Benedict XVI resigned: the first pope to do so in 600 years.

Messages of gun violence, theft, and other crimes run rampant through its pages, with the finger of disapproval constantly pointed towards members of her own community, Jane and Finch.\nJohnson skims the pages with a familiar feeling of dismay. The picture of Jane and Finch’s youth population is painted clearly in the paper’s narrative: troublesome, delinquent, and even criminal.\nJohnson, 27, was born in Jamaica. She is a former resident of the Jane and Finch area. The community has always held a special place in her heart, but it is aggrieved by the constant stereotyping of its inhabitants.\nPerpetuated by popular media, the “danger” myth of Jane and Finch is widespread—even amongst York students and faculty, a population situated mere minutes away. Johnson recognizes that a communication barrier between York and the Jane and Finch community has resulted in a damaging reputation for the neighbourhood.\n“I think the relationship between York and the Jane and Finch community needs a lot of work. It’s an institution versus [the Jane and Finch community’s] youth, and youth in the media are either seen as unable to represent themselves or as rebellious,” says Johnson.\xa0\nJohnson has taken a stand against the stigmatization of her heart and home by founding Boss Magazine. While others dwell on mainstream media stories of gun violence and poverty, Johnson works ardently to inspire a better informed public.\nThe youth-led Boss aims to dispel the danger myth of the neighbourhood by showcasing positive activities of the Jane and Finch community and its vibrant youth population. The publication covers a range of lifestyle and fashion topics to appeal to a diverse audience.\n\n“There was nothing for us to voice our own views of what we like, what’s really happening in the community, and the creative vision that youth have,” says Johnson on the pre-Boss Magazine era.\nJohnson has attempted to engage the York population by reaching out to students, specifically those interested in fashion and business, and encouraging them to get involved with the magazine.\n“[York] shouldn’t be a separate entity from the area,” she says. “It is part of the Jane and Finch community, it should have a mandate to engage.”\nJohnson continues, “There are a lot of students that are [at York] for writing, and I wanted to give them a platform to [promote] their own talents.”\nCurrently, Johnson is still looking for more York students to work with Boss. She wants the magazine to be a vehicle for talent and to bring in youth to be a part of a project they can be proud of.\nJohnson is extremely proud of her accomplishments with the magazine thus far. For her, the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Boss Magazine from the Jane and Finch community is its own reward.\n“People from the community opened the magazine and saw themselves,” she says.\xa0\nJohnson feels strongly that reconnecting York and the Jane and Finch community will be mutually beneficial because their proximity allows them to share resources.\nLorna Schwartzentruber, manager of York University’s Community Engagement Centre, is deeply focused on repairing the relationship between the\xa0two communities as well.\n“Most understandings of the Jane and Finch community don’t reflect its reality. Stereotypes have been processed year after year, and students don’t often take the time to experience the community, which perpetuates a power imbalance,” says Schwartzentruber. “We need to challenge some of those stereotypes by getting a more holistic view of the community.”\nThe Community Engagement Centre is making efforts to strengthen university’s ties to the community by making York a better neighbour.\n“York has a social responsibility as a large organization to be a good neighbour, and contribute in positive ways to the community it is a part of,” says Schwartzentruber.\xa0\nTheir “Student Orientation to Working in Jane and Finch,” for example, will pilot this September in an effort to unpack some of the issues faced by this community for students so they may better understand systemic oppression in marginalized communities and be able to engage with the community without fear or judgment.\nSchwartzentruber strongly feels that this is just the beginning of uniting York with Jane and Finch. “Through community engagement, we can increase the learning potential for students, while simultaneously strengthening the community,” she says.\nNatalie Coulter, a communications studies professor at York, is another strong advocate for community engagement. Through her classes, she has given her students the opportunity to participate in various community engagement projects with different organizations in the Jane and Finch region.\n“I hope [York students] have a new understanding of [the] richness of the community that goes beyond school,” says Coulter. “I hope when students leave [York], they are proud that they both went to York University and that York University is in the Jane and Finch community.”\n“The separation is not just physical—it’s also in terms of knowing and understanding the community,” she says. “I realize that there are incredibly rich resources in this community that represent a huge array of opportunities for students.”\nProjects like Johnson’s and Coulter’s provide a channel of communication between the two communities that students can get involved in.\nJohnson is amazed that Coulter’s students have become involved with the magazine, and this exemplifies how Boss is one step closer to reaching this common goal.\nAlthough Johnson is excited about the current progress and attention to these initiatives, she realizes there is much more work to be done, and that the process will be an arduous one.\nAs a York student and a Jane and Finch native, the burden of the stigma against her community is her own, and it pains her to see her school and her home at odds when the media so often targets them both. But she is hopeful that more people will join her fight for change. When that happens, the students of York and the people that make up Jane and Finch may stand together in a celebration of diversity, talent, and a sense of unity.\nBy Demitiria Neofostistos and Amara Hannah\nWith files from Samantha Chelsea and Samantha Herson\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThere’s been a dialogue about whether switching to an online voting system would be a better way forward for York Federation of Students elections.\nTo me, this is sort of like a debate on whether or not you should find a place to live by looking at pictures online and sending your first and last deposit by email transfer or by doing your research and then going in person to ensure you are getting what you’re paying for. Sure, the former is convenient and might save some time, but the risks are far too great for my liking.\nWe have seen far too many examples of elections going horribly wrong when online voting is employed, and these many instances of corruption give me doubts about the true integrity of the online elections.\nThe Western Gazette reported that in 2012, their university students’ council elections had been hacked by a former student, “who took advantage of a weakness in the site,” and that all 10,000 votes were invalidated, requiring a re-vote to be held two weeks later.\nSimilarly, in 2013, “poorly-timed human error lead to voters being presented with the wrong choices.”\nAt the University of British Columbia, in an online vote held in 2010, The Ubyssey reported that people were able to log in, clone the voting page, and submit fake ballots. This resulted in 731 ballots being submitted from a single IP address, alerting the elections committee that something was wrong.\nUnsurprisingly, the votes were thrown out, but whoever received the extra 731 votes could have won if the flaw wasn’t discovered. And of course, students were a little angry at the system that allowed this to happen.\nRecently, Queen’s University students saw their fall referendum postponed by a day because a miscommunication between the software behind their online voting system and their email server resulted in 6,000 email ballot logins not being sent out.\nI think you see the trend here. The list goes on.\nLet’s also acknowledge that in Canada, our federal, municipal and provincial elections operate\xa0on paper ballots.\nThe paper ballot voting system does not work at the touch of a button, but at least we know it’s a system that allows the integrity of the elections to stay intact.\nAt the end of the day, I like knowing I can have my space to vote without someone looming over my computer, that the candidates can’t hack in and vote for themselves 1,000 times over, and that people won’t be prevented from accessing the system due to glitches.\nYou can keep your “convenient” shortcut—I would much rather spend the time on ensuring quality.\nJenny Sellathurai\nContributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nI was banned from York University almost a year ago for exercising my freedom of expression by organizing and participating in a peaceful protest for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions and against York’s investments in weapons manufacturers.\nThe administration singled me out as an instigator, and they now may be attempting to paint me as an outsider to the York community.\nDespite the dubious claim that I was banned for disrupting classes during the protest (York’s own local adjudicator found no disruption), I initially received a letter from VP Students Janet Morrison stating: “The University does not give permission for members of the public—including alumni—to enter our campus lands for protests or demonstrations, or to engage in forms of speech or action that are, in any way, racist or that advocate racism, violence, or hatred.”\nAside from the fact that alumni participate in on-campus protests regularly, Morrison’s statement raises the question of whether I was banned for disruption, for my political beliefs, or because I’m Palestinian. The fact that York Security threatened another Palestinian alumnus with arrest and trespass makes the question more pressing.\nMoreover, former director of Security Services, Rob Kilfoyle told Office of Student Conflict Resolution Director Debbie Hansen by email that although my status as an alumnus complicates things, he “would love to” trespass me.\nIn another instance of disregard for the role of alumni, when SAIA met with the administration, VP Academic Rhonda Lenton refused to include me because “the offer was made to meet with current members of the York community.”\nI feel compelled to state my history at York, for the record.\nI was a student of psychology and political science from 2001 to 2007. The attacks of September 11 occurred after I arrived to Canada and following my frosh week.\nMy world was changed.\nI became radicalized as bombs fell over Afghanistan and Iraq, and as the second Palestinian uprising was crushed under blood-soaked tank treads and the rubble of thousands of demolished Palestinian homes.\nThat’s when I joined the anti-war movement and, through the mentoring of a group of Iraqi students, honed the skills of activism.\nI was co-founder of Amnesty International at York, a member of Now End War and Sanctions on Iraq, an executive member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, and a member of the Grass-Roots Anti-Imperialist Network.\nI took part in the barricading of the entrances to campus on March 10, 2003, and helped to organize lectures, film screenings, and protests.\nI worked for the Student Christian Movement at York and for the York University Telemail Program. I was elected to the York Federation of Students as the Stong College director, submitted articles for Excalibur and the YU Free Press, sang with the York University Choir, and performed with Vanier College Productions.\nI experienced the corporatization of campus, repressive changes to university policies, and the numerous sanctions imposed on outspoken students and faculty as a result of those changes.\nI went to pub nights when Founder’s Cock&Bull and Calumet’s On the Edge were more popular than The Underground. I lived at Stong Residence and Assiniboine. I walked through the graffiti-laden, weed-scented underground tunnels before they were closed, pulled all-nighters alone at the Student Centre and watched the sun rise from rooftops.\nAfter I lost my home in Palestine, the York community became another home to me. York and I even share the same birthday. So rest assured, I am here to stay, and attempts at erasing my history at York University have already failed.\nHammam Farah\ncontributor\n ', 'BDS is a campaign that marginalizes Jewish and pro-Israeli students. Whether or not you agree with their values, they have legitimate opinions from a different perspective. They are paying students trying to get an education. You’ve already paid your dues and you are preventing them from getting an education. Move on.\nAnd fight your cause somewhere else.\nYou’ve got to get rid of this “us vs. them” mentality.

[/su_heading]MyMail, Moodle, the York homepage, and Flex accounts were all affected by the outage, which started at 7:20 p.m. on March 19.\nChristopher Russel, director of ICT infrastructure and information security officer at York, says the outage was caused by a breaker being tripped during inclimate weather on the evening of March 19.\nThis caused a power outage on the Keele campus, and University Information Technology supply units failed. Some elements of York’s core network then lost power.\n“With some exceptions, nearly all services were affected since they rely on the network,” says Russel.\n“In some cases the service itself was still functioning, but it wouldn’t have been possible to connect to it. Parts of the network, including internet access for Keele campus student residences, were not directly impacted and continued to function.”\nPardis Aliakbarkhani, a third-year professional writing and anthropology student, says, “I had an assignment due that night through Moodle, and I was locked out of everything York-related. It was really frustrating.”\nBetween 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 20, nearly all services affected by the outage were restored. Some services however, were not fully restored until midday on March 20.\nRussel says a network error would not allow for correct diagnosis of network problems right away, and technical teams referred to a process of elimination to figure out what the problems were.\n“In all, over 800 servers and systems were checked on and brought back into service,” says Russel.\nRussel says scenarios like this have been successfully tested in the past.\nUIT is currently working with the network vendor to ensure this problem is fully understood to reduce chances of this happening again.\nAshley Glovasky\nDeputy Copy Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe election voting period for CUPE 3903, the union that represents York’s contract faculty, teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and research assistants, has been extended to the end of this week as neither candidate for chair received more than 50 per cent of the votes.\nThe third candidate was dropped from the ballot since he did not have enough votes, leaving only Faiz Ahmed and Christina Rousseau running for chair.

Police allege the employees issued fake invoices to the university.\nToronto Police announced the arrests on March 20. This is an ongoing investigation, and police expect more arrests to be made and further charges to be laid.\nVittoria Caparello is being charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, Yossi Zaidfeld is charged with one count of fraud over $5,000, and Melissa Caparello faces a charge of possession of property obtained by crime of under $5,000.\nMalissa Caparello is still employed as an administrative assistant in the dean’s office at the faculty of environmental studies and has been employed by the university since January 2005.\nIn regards to the future of her employment status, Joanne Rider of York media says the university is currently doing a review of the matter, and once a decision has been made, appropriate action will be taken.\n“As soon as the university was informed that there was a suspicion of fraud, we did two things: we informed the police and we engaged an external firm to conduct a forensic audit,” says Rider.\n“The university has already recovered the money estimated to be lost plus additional costs since the university initially found out about the alleged fraud in October of 2012,” she says.\nYork was notified of the fraud when a whistleblower came forward with the information around the same time the university implemented new policies and procedures to detect fraud, says Rider.\xa0\nThese policies were developed following a 2012 case in which two former York executives were accused of taking part in a massive phony invoice scheme and of defrauding the university of $1.2 million.\nThe Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation of Funds Policy developed as a result helped strengthen the university’s controls against fraud. The changes included an updated whistleblower policy, a conflict of interest policy, and the implementation of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment initiative.\n“So it was at that time an individual came forward and indicated that they suspected suspicious activity,” says Rider.\nAs part of this policy, the identity of the whistleblower remains confidential.\nHamid Adem\nNews Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nProminent York faculty and community members spoke in the Student Centre on March 25 to publicize alleged violations of student rights and civil liberties by York’s administration.\nProfessors David McNally, John Greyson, and Penni Stewart, as well as CUPE 3903 Chairperson Faiz Ahmed and alumnus Hamman Farah all spoke at the event.\nFarah, who was banned from campus in the spring of 2013 following a rally held by Students Against Israeli Apartheid, says administrators cannot be allowed to continue to intimidate and harass students in unrestrained manner.\xa0\nFarah also points to York’s revocation of SAIA’s club status on March 27, 2013, as an example of this harassment and intimidation from York’s administration.\nDespite being banned from campus, Farah still spoke at the event.\nJoanne Rider of York media responded to Excalibur’s request for comment via email, stating that freedom of expressions is one of York’s guiding principles.\n“Members of the York community have the right to express their views and to test and challenge ideas, provided they do so within the law, and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner that does not disrupt academic activity,” Rider continues.\xa0\nShe also adds that York’s responsibility is to protect the academic environment, while ensuring all community members abide by agreed upon standards of conduct, which allow students to pursue their studies “free from unwelcome disruptions.”\n“York has and will continue to ensure these policies are communicated, understood, and adhered to in a consistent manner,” says Rider.\nThe event was not prevented by York administration, as it was approved by the Student Centre board and included participation from the York Federation of Students.\nFarah is pushing for York to amend their Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Senate Policy on Disruptive and/or Harassing Behaviour in Academic Situations, and the Temporary Use of University Space policy to reflect Canadian values of freedom of expression.\n“Free speech and free assembly are important to students,” he says. “This is where we learn the most about these basic democratic values, and where the most opportunities arise to exercise them.”\nDavid McNally, a political science professor, spoke out in support of SAIA and Farah.

The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.\nExcalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.\nWhen they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.\nWhether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.\nOne reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.\nWhile I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.\nBut it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.\nSome believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.\nHave students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?\nThere are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.\nI’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.\nThere are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.\nWhen it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.\nBut more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.\nIf you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.\nThis year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause. I just wish I’d had more to talk about.\nTamara Khandaker\nEditor-in-Chief\n ', 'As a Founders grad, Student Council, & Excalibur active participant from the early 70’s, I’ve recently been disappointed with your online feedback procedures and the lack of commitment to fix such a simple technological problem.

She was found naked and face down in her room the next day after Meng managed to get word out to her friends and landlord that she could be in danger.\xa0\nOn April 1, the court heard that DNA found on Liu’s abdomen, groin, fingernails, and chest matched Dickson’s DNA profile.\nForensic biologist Melissa Kell also testified that Liu could also not be excluded as a source of the DNA found on the bloodstained shirt collected from Dickson’s residence.\nForensic pathologist Dr. Christopher Milroy said Liu’s death may have been caused by mechanical asphyxiation, which is blockage of airways through neck or chest compression, as indicated by bruising on her neck and bleeding in her eyes.\nHer roommate, Zahid Abdullah, who also testified on April 1, may have helped identify the shirt with the matching DNA sample.\xa0\nHe told the jury he saw an unknown Caucasian male in the house the night of Liu’s death, wearing a shirt that matched the description of the one investigators eventually retrieved and tested.\nAbdullah, however, did not directly identify Dickson.\nDickson’s lawyer, Robert Nuttall, is seeking a manslaughter ruling, arguing the cause of death needs to be definitive before one can determine intent beyond reasonable doubt.\nNutall also argued that Dickson’s mental capacity was reduced, based on his claim that he was medicated and intoxicated, but no evidence to prove this combination affected him has been presented as of publication.\nLyra Madriaga\nContributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe York University Student Centre’s board of directors has decided to increase security surveillance and lighting in the building.\nCameras will be installed facing the exits of the building, and lighting in the walkway and exterior of the building will be increased.\nJessica Thyriar, York Federation of Students president and spokesperson for the board of directors, says after discussions with stakeholders and groups in the Student Centre, a compromise was made to increase surveillance for safety reasons, but also ensure student privacy.\n“We needed to find a balance between ensuring that folks who use the space for various reasons, such as support services, felt comfortable [and that their information remained confidential] and ensuring other students did feel safe when using the building,” says Thyriar.\nImran Mohamed, third-year kinesiology and psychology major, says the change is a positive one.\n“It’s not exactly monitoring student activities inside the Student Centre. We still have our sense of privacy, [but] we know who is coming in and who is leaving,” says Mohamed.\nMohamed adds that while he supports the decision to add cameras facing the exits, he would not feel comfortable with cameras being installed in the food court or by the couches upstairs.\n“If there is a sense of people watching you, you just do not feel right. It doesn’t add to the festivities or the atmosphere [that the Student Centre is trying to promote],” says Mohamed.\nThyriar says the board of directors is constantly reviewing ways to improve the Student Centre and ensure students feel safe.\n“I think it’s important for the community to come together in various ways to share various things that we can do in regards to safety, and if we continue having these discussions and [making] efforts to actually put these things forward, it’s more of a community,” says Thyriar.\nCurrently, York has over 660 CCTV cameras overlooking parking lots, buildings, and classrooms, but there are none in the Student Centre.\nVictoria Alarcon\nAssistant News Editor\nWith files from Michael Burton\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/editorial/2014/04/02/york-students-silenced-or-unmoved/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nWhen I started my term as editor-in-chief last May, I was pretty naive.\nThe vision I pitched in my job interview was one of Excalibur as a driving force for change on campus.\nThis has proven to be difficult though. The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.\nExcalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.\nWhen they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.\nWhether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.\nOne reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.\nWhile I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.\nBut it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.\nSome believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.\nHave students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?\nThere are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.\nI’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.\nThere are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.\nWhen it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.\nBut more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.\nIf you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.\nThis year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause. I just wish I’d had more to talk about.\nTamara Khandaker\nEditor-in-Chief\n ']"

Composed of Chris Donnelly on piano, Ernesto Cervini on drums and percussion, and Dan Fortin on upright bass, the group shared equal ambition and exuberance in performance, bringing their beautiful and exciting sound to the uplifting contrast of overcast skies and the York subway construction behind them.\nHailing from Toronto, Myriad3 formed accidentally as a self-proclaimed “twist-of-fate” which had brought the trio together in 2010. Each member brought forth awe-inspiring talent, performed with the utmost intricacy, providing the modestly crowded room of York students a one-of-a-kind show.\nMyriad3 was nominated for Jazz Album of the Year: Group at the 2015 Juno Awards for their sophomore release, The Where. Their debut album, Tell, was released in 2012. If that wasn’t ambitious enough, Myriad3’s pianist, Donnelly, released a collection of renditions of the group’s music in the style of 8-bit chiptunes in Tell((Chip)), bringing the worlds of classical jazz and the nostalgia of Nintendo Entertainment System together, colliding in a beautiful harmony.\nAlthough jazz is often associated with being soothing and soft, intensity was not devoid in their performance. The ambiance and emotion of the trio’s sound hopped from moments of vigorous intensity, often guttural, bassy transitioning, to intoxicating soothing smoothness.\nThe performers also treated the audience with an original rendition of Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson’s arrangement of a Duke Ellington piece, which showed exuberance in everything that is in the spirit of the Jazz ethos.\nThe trio even dabbled in some modes of performance art, where the audience broke out into unbridled applause, when Donnelly lead a synchronized rest and queued his fellow bandmates to break the silence by sniffling; a flawlessly executed move that led to the audience’s amazement.\nThis could arguably be recognized as the highlight of the performance.\nThe modestly crowded room enjoyed the jazz outfit’s timing, both speeding up and slowing down tempos and resting pauses, and showing the different streams of consciousness of playing amalgamated into a single, unified form.\nThe instrumental renditions were not without sentimentality either. One of the group’s songs “Little Lentil” was titled after Cervini’s then unborn child, who was the size of a little lentil. A twinkle sounding beautiful lullaby-esque jazz ballad was reminiscent of the charm of a child’s lullaby, mixed with the thickness of layered artistry found in jazz.\nAlthough the performance was instrumental, Myriad3 managed to conspire laughter as Fortin’s hosting showcased his sense of humour. Pressing on issues of the current state of the Canadian dollar, and the terrifying rising price of cauliflower, brought more personality to the silent moments between renditions, arguably just as entertaining as the music.\nThe show’s greatest moments however were surely seen from the beginning of the performance until the end. It was seen in each member of the trio’s moods while playing. The looks of joy, unobstructed focus, and dedication on each of their faces showed the genuine love each member had for the performing arts and music alike.\nZack Fenech,\xa0Staff Writer\nFeatured image courtesy of Myrid3\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2016/01/31/ontario-ndp-leader-andrea-horwath-talks-anti-racism-initiatives-at-keele-campus/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nStudents are reporting mixed reactions after Ontario New Democratic Party leader, Andrea Horwath toured York’s Keele campus.\nBacklash ensued on social media after a photo was posted to the Students Against Israeli Apartheid Facebook page featuring Horwath meeting with York Federation of Students executives and a “SAIA member.”\nRena Silver, political liaison with Hasbara at York, says it was distressing seeing Horwath meeting with students associated with movements such as Israeli Apartheid Week, which Silver describes as dangerous behaviour.\n“Without being privy to the exact details or context of this meeting, Hasbara at York can say that it is of the firm understanding that hateful movements such as Israeli Apartheid Week which serve no purpose but to demonize and slander Israel slow potential peace processes.” \nWillem Hart, president of Campus Conservatives York University, wants an Ontario free of discrimination.\n“But it gives me pause to think of what this secretariat would look like practically, given that Horwath is promoting this policy to students whose goal is to marginalize and alienate Jewish and Israeli students with their advocacy for the BDS movement,” says Hart.\n“Horwath and the NDP should take a less ambiguous stance on this issue.

This included nine regular season games overall and three crucial victories, without which the Lions gave up their spot in the OUA playoffs.\nThe player, who was not named, had participated in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport at another institution during the preseason and hence was not supposed to take part in the Lions’ games this season.\nPrior to the debacle, the Lions had spent the final weeks of the regular season fighting their way through tough games. They lost to the Windsor Lancers by a score of 86-85 and to the Western Mustangs by 81-80. The Lions then edged the Algoma Thunderbirds by 68-67 and finally secured themselves a playoff spot by defeating the UofT Varsity Blues in a huge overtime victory by a score of 97-93.\nThe Lions lost to the dominant Ryerson Rams by a score of 81-72 in their final game of the regular season, perhaps taking it easier knowing they had already achieved their long-sought goal of making the playoffs.

We lost a handful of games by three or fewer points that could have gone either way.”\n“We did everything well at some point or another,” he adds, “but (we) just couldn’t bring it all together consistently.”\nReader believes that the team needs to especially work on defense, which he says can be done by careful observation of the opponent’s strategy and game planning. “Our offence does need work,” he adds, “but we have enough weapons to score when chances come around.”\nLooking forward to next season, Reader says that it will take more than just better defense and a summer of intensive workouts to get the team to where it needs to be.\n“The goal for next season is to get a new coach that will help [our program],” he says. “It’s obviously time for a change after six long seasons of backing out in the first round of the playoffs, and you’ve all seen how this season ended.”\n\nFollow us on instagram,  @excalphotos \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nFarah Isahack, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\nThe subject of illiteracy among women has not been talked about enough and it is time to change that. Adults who are illiterate or have low literacy have been shamed as beings of idiocy or laziness in today’s society, unless they seek to improve themselves or merge into the mainstream education system. In Canadian society alone it is noted that four out of 10 adults’ literacy skills are too low to be fully competent for most jobs in the economy.\nIlliteracy rates among racialized women have a critical effect in Canadian society. To be an immigrant to Canada, one must be capable of learning a language outside of their mother tongue, if not English or French, and be able to adapt to the new economic structure in place here.\nWhat many seem to overlook about immigrants in Western society is that a majority are coming from situations of poverty, political upheaval, or social structures that have not allowed them to seek further education.\nLiteracy is a fundamental right for all, but in regions where agendas of domestication are pushed onto women, literacy and higher-education do not become a priority.\nBefore jumping to theories, it is important to note the life of a lot of immigrant women and how they have adapted into Canadian society. It has become necessary that women provide the domesticated services they have been trained to do, under the sacrifice of an education. Unpaid domestic labour that goes on in the home is often considered invaluable.\nA lot of people in Western society and in our current generation are used to having the ability to read and write. Many cannot imagine what it feels like to look at something and not be able to understand it. You may say, well then go out and learn, but once these women come of age they take the knowledge and notion they learned in their home country and migrate to Canada, and start a new life.\nThey come here for work and to start a family. You will find a lot of immigrant women and men working in factory settings because more often than not, the job does not require a lot of comprehension for reading and writing, but rather is more labour focused.\nOnce these women marry and start a family, the structure in the household changes to focus not just on themselves but on their children. These women tend to put themselves second to their children, and education is prioritized for their child. Over time, their notion of improvement gets lost, because they become roped into a routine of work and home life, and the idea for a second chance at literacy is put on the back burner.\nBut the stigma of women not having that ability is still in place. Women who do not have the skills that modern education provides lose the ability and skill set that they could have had to manage their own income and expenditure. Children of literate mothers are known to be more likely to complete their education.\nDoes this mean we need to start forcing people to take educational tests and literacy examinations before entering the country? No. That is only fueling the taboo around the whole topic. What needs to be done is accepting the fact that they are people who’ve had to sacrifice more than they’ve had to gain, especially these women.\n This is still an empowerment movement for women. Even though some women may lack mainstream education in Canadian society, they still provide for themselves and their families in the best way that they can. They are not lesser beings because they didn’t get the chance at modern education. You wouldn’t make fun of an individual in a wheelchair, therefore there should be no hatred or fuel for ignorance against women for their disposition.\nInstead, please praise them and encourage more women to better themselves and take a second chance at learning. What many miss when they cross paths with a person who is illiterate is the fact that in a society built upon languages and literature, despite them not being able to fully comprehend what is being written, they still made a life and have overcome that barrier. Women who have this trait are no less than women who have the educational means to succeed in life through positions greater than their own.\nA factory job does not under any circumstances demean you as lesser than others, because what many forget is that we are all striving towards supporting ourselves and others. These women face this stigma harsher than anyone else, and they still stand strong and make it through a lifestyle that does not accept their lesser implication. So stop shaming them, start praising them, and help them when you can. Take an interest in adult illiteracy because many people have family and friends who are going through this and everyone deserve a second chance.\n\nFollow us on instagram,  @excalphotos \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJustyna Korczynski, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Meghana Kulkarni\nCaught your professor jamming with earbuds in at York Lanes?

According to SAIA, Khalek was invited to give a lecture on how Israel uses Palestine as a laboratory for weapons and methods of domination and control, which are then exported to other parts of the world.\nBGSC’s bulletin calls for a boycott of Khalek’s lecture, stating it is their policy whenever a speaker with a history of committing emotional, social, and or physical violence against groups of black people. However, the event proceeded as scheduled.\nThe BGSC was not available for further comment.\n“Rania Khalek is a well-known supporter of Black Lives Matter and the call for reparations for past and present injustices inflicted on black people in the United States,” says Merate Atare, member of SAIA. “Those who levelled the allegation that Khalek is anti-black, with no evidence, lack a progressive worldview based on mutual solidarity.”\nAtare explains SAIA reached out to the individual, but couldn’t come to an agreement.\n“We in the Palestine solidarity movement at York will not throw our friends and supporters under the bus, and we stand firmly behind them.”\nKhalek has come under fire in the past for allegedly overstating the similarity between the movements for Palestinian and black rights, particular on social media.\nIn the aftermath of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri in late 2014, for example, Khalek made a connection between the repression of Palestinian protests in Israel and of black protests in the United States.\nShe faced backlash on Twitter, where she was referred to as “an anti-black, ahistoric troll” and was threatened with violent retaliation.\n ']"

While the raw and honest elements of Bierk’s work might mistake him for a street photographer, his work strongly differs from this practice. He is currently featured in the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival, an annual month-long festival held throughout the GTA in May. Bierk has two shows on display, Top Left and 10 Blankets, the latter of which has been praised as a must-see of the festival. Excalibur had the opportunity to attend the opening night of Top Left on May 13 and interview the man behind the powerful images.\nFrom making photographs to displaying them, transparency and respect remain principles in Bierk’s work. He has developed a collaborative practice where the subjects of his photographs are recognized as collaborators, with profit splitting being one way to demonstrate this. This perspective comes from Bierk’s understanding that without the labour that his collaborators put into daily life, none of the photographs would be possible. He also offers accessible public viewing of his work by displaying them on streets, perhaps a response to the widening of class gaps and digital divides.\nConsent has been another cornerstone of Bierk’s recent photography. Bierk explains how he used to take photographs of homeless people, who he refers to as “precariously housed,” sleeping on hot air grates on the corner of Queen Street East and Victoria Street.\n“I used to do it without consent,” describes Bierk. “Those images, without consent, mark a big transformation in my way of making photographs because I was operating without a lot of thoughtfulness. I had entitlement where I wanted to capture the honesty. I [felt I] had the right to photograph you and use your body to tell my story.” \nBierk’s journey has not come without hardship. Tragedy has influenced much of his work.\n“I experienced three deaths at a pretty young age. My parents and the person I fell in love with died,” says Bierk with both strength and sadness.\nBierk’s parents were both artists, so as a child, he was exposed to their art from a young age. His father was a painter and even taught him how to take photographs.\n“I was seeking connection to my father and my mother through trying to become an artist and make photographs,” he says.\nFor the majority of his life, Bierk battled with a drug addiction, though he has been sober for four years. \n“I was really into photography and then I got really into drugs. So I checked out of the world for a long time,” says Bierk.\nPhotography has been a mechanism to cope with his addiction. “I think seeking quick interactions with strangers was a way for me to connect with my addiction and connect with the kind of excitement I felt when I was doing drugs – being in places I shouldn’t be in, seeing these secret places we don’t see unless we’re involved.”\nBeauty might not be the word dominant culture would use to describe his work but Bierk begs to differ. \n“At the core, it’s about honouring a kind of beauty that I see, though it is not a dominant notion of what is beautiful,” explains Bierk. Bierk believes narrow perceptions of beauty are why his portraits are mischaracterized as street photography.\n“You show portraits of people and automatically have it lumped into street photography,” he says.\nBierk’s work is refreshing and his story is one that adds dimension to conversations of street, candid and beauty photography, pushing conversation of what it means to be homeless.

With tuition costs constantly rising, more and more students are forced to try and balance work and school to ensure they can pay their fees. This balancing act often forces them to give up certain aspects of their life, and one of the most common things sacrificed is sleep.\nThe National Sleep Foundation published a study in February 2015 that stated people between the ages of 18 and 25 should be getting between seven and nine hours of sleep each night, while people between the ages of 14 and 17 should be getting eight to 10.\nPeople who don’t get more than six hours of sleep on a nightly basis have been found to be clumsier and less focused.\nClete Kushida, director of Stanford University Center for Human Sleep Research, found that people who aren’t getting enough sleep often have trouble focusing, impaired depth perception and slowed reflexes.\nNot getting enough sleep on a nightly basis can also lead to other more serious health concerns, including weight gain. When your body doesn’t get enough sleep it starts craving high-calorie foods to make sure that you have the energy you’ll need if you’re going to be awake longer. Another side effect is a lower immune system, leading to difficulty in fighting off illnesses. According to a 2009 study, people who get less than six hours of sleep each night are three times more likely to develop a cold. They also have a harder time recovering from illnesses such as the flu.\nProbably the most frightening side-effect of lack of sleep is the increased risk of heart disease and stroke.\nAccording to Atlanta cardiologist David E. Montgomery, people who don’t get enough sleep put more pressure on their heart, which leads to a higher risk of heart-related illness.\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in North America, with one in four deaths linked to it. A recent study found that people over the age of 45 who got six hours of sleep or less on a consistent basis doubled their chances of stroke and heart attack, and are more likely to experience heart failure.\nSo the next time you’re up late and Netflix asks if you’re still watching, hit no and go to sleep.\n ', 'I highly recommend meditation at least twice a day for at least 20 minutes each session. It is hard at first, but after a few months of effort it gets easier.\nIt does a lot to help get a better night sleep and just helps you have a clearer peaceful mind throughout the day. There are many resources online to help, I recommend focusing on your breath but the Mantra method works for other people, find what works for you. And remember, you can meditate walking to class, riding your bike, just quieting your mind and not thinking all the time about things you do not need to think about.

The image shows Gray (far\xa0right) standing with other members of the student organization Silence is Violence.\n\xa0\nThe Mandi Gray sexual assault trial resumed May 3, with the accused Mustafa Ururyar appearing on stand. Ururyar confirmed he and Gray were casually dating each other for two weeks.\nDuring cross-examination, more personal details came to light about the nature of Ururyar and Gray’s relationships. It came to light that on the night of the alleged assault, Gray and Ururyar were at a bar with colleagues when Ururyar heard from someone that Gray was planning a threesome with him and a mutual friend, to which he was indifferent, yet expressed his disappointment to Gray when the third person did not join them at his apartment for drinks.\nUruryar maintained that it was consensual sex, as he had received a text from her earlier that evening to “come drink and then we can have hot sex.”\nWhile walking from the bar to his apartment, Gray expressed interest in having sex, to which Ururyar responded saying he was not physically feeling up to it and did not promise her one hundred per cent. He said he would try to perform.\nGray claims Ururyar criticized her at his apartment, calling her “needy” and an “embarrassment.” Ururyar denied this in his testimony, though he did clarify by saying he did not appreciate her behaviour that night.\nUruryar apparently broke up with her while they were having sex as Gray leaned in to kiss him.\nThe accused reasoned he decided to break up because they were incompatible due to Gray’s behaviour at the bar when she allegedly groped him without his consent, and because he was in an open, long-distance relationship with his girlfriend who was moving to Toronto in April.\n“I said we could still be friends but she would often get upset if I mentioned my girlfriend and I intended to continue my relationship with my girlfriend,” says Ururyar.\nUpon hearing about the break up, Gray cried and Ururyar claims he consoled her and then they had consensual sex. During intercouse, Ururyar failed to have an erection and suggested that they watch pornography to get in the mood.\n“I just put on porn because I needed extra help. It didn’t work so I suggested we just watch a movie or The Daily Show. Mandi got angry with my inability to perform and left abruptly without saying a word.”\nLater he received a text from her stating “last night was fucked up.”\n“I did not want to assume anything so I simply replied ‘OK’ because I did not want to dominate the conversation.I wanted to provide her space to tell me what was going on. I wanted to give her the space and opportunity to continue what she was thinking,” says Ururyar.\nUruryar’s girlfriend, Alison Moore, says he’s the best boyfriend ever, having met him seven years ago.\nMoore said she was shocked when Ururyar informed her that Gray had pressed sexual assault charges against him.\n“While we were in different cities, we agreed to see other people, but maintain our relationship,” says Moore.\n“We agreed not to talk about our other relationships with each other.”\nClosing arguments in the trial are scheduled for May 24.\n ', 'Jelas bukan, lah.

The win marked the fourth time the Lions have won the Sam Davidson Memorial Trophy since 2008.\nDespite the recent success, the team has been working harder this offseason according to head coach Carmine Isacco. \n“Our approach has been somewhat different. I feel like we’re working harder because we’re going to lose a few key players, and we’re not sure about a couple other ones. So it’s going to be a rebuilding process,” says Isacco.\nThe Lions will are saying goodbye to midfielder Matt Stinson, goalkeeper Colm Vance, striker Michael Cox and forward Jarek Whiteman. Ben Futorianski is expected to be gone, as is Joey Cicchillo, who injured his ACL during winter training.\nIsacco is excited to see who steps up and fills the void. \n“We’ve got some players coming in. It’s going to be up to them how they make an impact. They’re going to be good players, but we keep a big roster, and our players who haven’t stepped up and gotten a lot of time in the past are going to have to step up and give us some more minutes.\n“Jonathan Lao has always been a stalwart for us; Matthew Arnone who went from a striker to a center back position and was fantastic for us and should have a big impact. We’ll be looking to Malcolm Loukides for a lot more leadership, as well as a couple red-shirts from last year such as Adam LoFranco to step in and do well.\n“We’re hoping Cristian Cavallini, who didn’t play last year because he wanted to focus on school, will come back, because he’s quite a talent and he can score goals. We’re going to look to the guys we have to be more responsible.”\nWhen asked about the chance of a three-peat, Isacco says, “We’re not even concentrating on that. We’re concentrating on what we need to do to get better. We’re just trying to be physically, mentally and of course academically prepared for the season. It’s a new game, it’s a new season and it’s 0-0 across the board.”\nThe Lions open their regular season in the last week of August, with the official date still to be determined.\n ', '05/12/2010 – 5:41pmEl Pantuflainas… Nunca mejor dicho… La gente estÃ¡ descontenta y la prensa por hacer propaganda estilo segunda guerra mundial simplemente colabora para que los madridistas de pro, los que realmente AMAMOS la instituciÃ³n querrÃ\xadamos que Florentino y sus secuaces se piren de una jodida vez.Yo creo en el ideal… Que es el Real Madrid, el club seÃ±or, el intachable, el gran deportista.

She is currently working on a series of paintings where she manipulates acrylic paint to create unique abstract pieces. \nSuriano has been influenced by the cubist art style in the past, and more recently, has been interested in the postmodernist movement. She describes her art style as a mixture of realism and abstraction, through an elevated yet childish process of painting. \n“Anything can be art but not everyone can be an artist,” says Suriano. “Art nurtures the mind and the soul. It allows you to express yourself visually when you cannot verbally. It is an outlet that encourages creative thinking and abstract ideas. Art brings things to life on a daily basis so as an art teacher, it is my mission to instill a love for art in all of my students.” \nSuriano attributes her high school years as a key developing stage for her as an artist. She decided to pursue art and teaching thanks to her high school art teacher, in hopes of inspiring future generations of artists. “As for teaching,” says Suriano, “I knew I loved sharing my artwork and my art knowledge with others so it was just fitting that I become a teacher.”\nEven though she enjoys teaching, Suriano holds that she is a painter before a teacher. She plans to continue creating artwork on a weekly basis in order for her to properly teach students. She dreams of opening her own art studio and private art school one day in order to focus solely on developing students’ artistic creations. \n“I want to inspire my students to embrace their many talents and understand how amazing art truly is.”\nSuriano’s art has varied over the years, depending on her courses and the themes she was exposed to.

Stephens, a 20-year-old Seneca@York student who grew up in Toronto, is a true musical force to be reckoned with.\n“My dad would say it was when I was 2, I sang the entirety of ‘I Can Believe I Can Fly,’ and at that point he knew I was going to be a musician.” \nStephens is not only a talented vocal artist and DJ, but also a well-rounded musician. She plays a wide array of instruments including the piano, drums, guitar and steel pan, some of which were self-taught. \nFor Stephens, music is a release and a way to connect with her listeners, showing them that she understands their struggles, especially concerning heartbreak. \n“Life events and experiences play a major part in my music,” notes Stephens. “I’ve always treated my song-writing as an emotional release – a therapeutic way for me to analyze my own thoughts and also connect to my listeners.” \nStephens recognizes Brian McKnight and Aaliyah as important influences in her vocal work, and her father for her passion for DJing. “I developed a passion for music from before I could remember,” says Stephens. \nLike every artist, Stephens has gone through her own journey of struggles and feels that finding her sense of self as an artist and remaining true to herself has made her music better than it has ever been. \n“Be true to yourself,” Stephens advises aspiring artists. “There will always be people who want you to sound a certain way or do certain things in the industry, and it is important to take the time to understand yourself. There is always something to learn, even when you feel you are at your best.” \nYou can listen to Stephens on Soundcloud at soundcloud.com/classybutdaring and follow her on Facebook at Natasha Stephens.

Perhaps you’re a fantasy sports enthusiast, and have had to adjust your lineup because one of your starters was knocked out with a concussion. Or maybe you just really like Will Smith and saw the 2015 film.\nBut what is a concussion?\nConcussions, often referred to by athletes as the c-word, are traumatic brain injuries usually caused by hits to the head.\nOther injuries are fairly easy to detect—if you break a bone, for example, there is usually a visible indication of the injury, as well as an incredible amount of pain. But concussions are an invisible injury, and are harder to detect.\nFortunately, advancements in technology and increased research have allowed us to learn more about the nature of concussions.\nA recent study by Purdue University found that concussions are possibly caused by multiple hits to the head over time, as opposed to the previous notion that they were caused by a single impact. Another common misconception about concussions is that they go away after a certain amount of time, without any lingering side effects. In reality, many people who experience concussions also experience post-concussion syndrome, where symptoms last for more than six weeks.\nBut what are the symptoms, and how do you know if you have a concussion? According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms include headaches, loss of consciousness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, fatigue and slurred speech.\nIn severe concussions, a person’s pupils may appear different sizes, with one dilated more than the other.\nSome symptoms may take longer to show up, such as memory loss and an inability to concentrate, irritability and personality shifts, sensitivity to light, erratic sleeping patterns and even psychological disorders such as depression, according to Mayo Clinic.\nMore alarming are the findings by the researchers at York’s Centre for Vision Research, who found that athletes who suffer concussions may also have neurological deficits that are typically not detected in standard clinical assessments.\nThe study compared the cognitive-motor integration between 51 athletes who had never been diagnosed with a concussion, and 51 athletes who had a history of concussions but were no longer showing symptoms.\nThe goal of the study was to determine whether athletes with a history of concussions displayed any impairment when asked to “think and move at the same time.” Participants were asked to perform two separate tasks that tested their cognitive-motor integration.\nAccording to the results, athletes who had never suffered a concussion performed the tasks roughly 50 milliseconds faster than athletes who had.\nWhile that doesn’t sound like a large difference, it could be the difference between getting hit or not, according to Professor Lauren E. Sergio.\nThese tests could also provide a more accurate assessment for determining when a player is safely able to return to the field or rink. If a player returns to their sport too soon after experiencing a concussion and suffers another, known as second impact syndrome, the results could be devastating and even fatal.\nSide effects of second impact syndrome include swelling in the brain, possible herniation, loss of consciousness, acute metabolic changes and cerebral blood flow alterations, according to brainandspinalcord.org.\nHopefully as we learn more about the brain and how it functions, we can find ways to ensure player safety and better diagnose concussions—or prevent them from happening at all.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\nLet’s face it: staying focused in class is hard—especially in the age of technology, where laptops and cellphones are everywhere you look. Since 2000, when the mobile revolution began, the average attention span dropped from 12 to eight seconds. It is hard to focus when you’re distracted by chatter in the back of the class and a never-ending stream of late students. This difficulty increases with lecture lengths.\nAlthough the average attention span has dropped quite a bit, fourth-year psychology student Shakil Mirza says it heavily depends on the lecture. “I have sat through three-hour psychology lectures once a week, and one-hour biology lectures three times a week. I’ve been alert and more attentive in the latter, because I’d be more interested [and] there is no time to doze off. Even with a middle break in a three-hour lecture, not everyone comes back to class,” says Mirza. One of the perks of hour-long lectures is that there’s no time to stop—so you’d better write notes and stay focused as if your life depended on it.\nBut what about the dreaded three-hour lectures? How do students possibly stay focused? Are they simply wasting their time? The answer is, surprisingly, that there are some benefits to long lectures. For one, commuting times can be reduced, saving time and money. Rather than travelling to campus several times a week, stacking up longer classes could cut down on days travelling to school, thus saving those pricey tokens. You know that a broke student is willing to do anything to save those valuable dollars.\n“All of my courses are three-hour classes, and sometimes they are back-to-back. I actually prefer three-hours lectures over [hour-long] lectures as it cuts down on commute time. But I do often struggle with paying attention. I try to sit close enough to the [professor] that I can engage in discussion, but far enough so that I can slip out easily if I need a break, which is often,” says fourth-year global health policy, management and systems student Anmol Yagnik.\nThree-hour lectures allow for more opportunities to spend time with the professor and fellow students to develop a strong connection with them. “I love long lectures as I feel the professors cover more of the material in detail. They are more prone to tell their personal stories regarding the text or theories presented, which I enjoy. It makes it easier to comprehend and more interesting,” says third-year psychology student Waverly Pegelo.\nThat being said, if you are planning to take or currently taking three-hour-long lectures, try to find a different course offering that can break them down into one-hour lectures. If you cram your schedule with class after class of three-hour lectures, be mindful of the hazards and honest with yourself: are you actually learning and retaining the material, or are you just wasting your time and money? It does depend on preference and on the specific person.\nIf it is nearly impossible to split your class schedule, here are some tips. Turn off all devices, such as your cellphone and laptop, if possible. This prevents the possibility of opening time-wasting applications. Sitting in the front of the class will keep you focused and be an incentive to not use your devices. Ask yourself if you really need to bring a laptop to take notes. Recent research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton University and the University of California found that writing notes by hand requires a different type of cognitive processing than when typing notes. Since writing by hand is a slower method, it also allows for more time to digest information. Try finding a professor with favourable ratings.

Maybe your friend tattooed his ex-girlfriend’s name on his arm, or maybe your grandpa has a tattoo hidden away from his rock n’ roll days. Maybe you have a tattoo yourself. If so, you might have found yourself exploring this unique art form in a museum exhibit. \nThis year the Royal Ontario Museum, or ROM, hosted an exhibit dedicated to showcasing the diverse body art form of tattooing. Tattoos: Ritual. Identity. Obsession. Art, opened its doors on April 2, 2016 and closed on September 5, 2016. Visitors were invited to an exhibition that not only displayed the uniqueness and variety of tattoos, but also the traditional, historical and cultural context associated with this intrinsic art form. \xa0\nThe exhibit enabled onlookers to have a multifaceted learning experience. Spanning over the course of 5,000 years, the exhibit provided a history of both ancient and modern tattoos, while also paying tribute and highlighting some of the world’s most famous and talented tattoo artists, such as Sailor Jerry, and their respected pieces. This was done using various visual aids, artifacts, posters and silicone figures that were used to reproduce tattoo pieces. \nTools that were used to draw tattoos were scattered all over the museum. One of the more complex and inventive tools featured was a handmade tattoo gun crafted by prison inmates. Using the limited supplies available, the prisoners were able to use ball point pens, wire and spool to create electric and manual machines. \nThe exhibit also provided a historic and cultural context for tattoos, exploring how tattoos are regarded in America, Asia and Europe. In a historical context, the museum displayed photographs of the chests of Auschwitz prisoners in Nazi camps and the identification tattoos the Nazis’ inked onto the inmates’ skin. Juxtaposed with these pictures were the bodies of the grandchildren of some of these survivors, who tattooed the identification numbers onto their skin as a way to remember and honour their family and family history. \nOn a cultural level, the museum explored what tattoos meant to different cultures, such as the Japanese. This was explored through a documentary video that interviewed famous and rewound Japanese tattoo artist Horiyoshi III, who specializes in full body tattoos. Horiyoshi III said that tattoos are important to the Japanese culture he caters to because they view tattoos as a symbolic and personal expression. When a person goes out to the workplace, they are seen as that person; a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher. However, once they are in their naked form, their tattoos became their own personal, symbolic expression of their true inner identity. In a Japanese cultural context, tattoos are essential in cultivating modes of personal identity and expression. \nEvery empty space, every wall and every corner of the tattoo exhibit was scattered with unique information on tattoos and the rich history that accompanies it. Whether you have your own obsession with tattoos, want to learn more about this ancient form of body art, or have a burning passion for history, the exhibit satisfied all these interests. What was most amazing about the exhibit was the way it took tattoos and gave them an identity not many would expect. In modern society, tattoos are met with mixed reactions, but a spectator who went to the exhibit would have left with a newly found perspective that hopefully allowed them to see that tattoos are more than just ink on skin; they are a tool for cultures to cultivate identities that penetrate external surfaces.\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAs an international student, I come from a country where student activism and politics are banned across university campuses and journalism has become a guise for promoting a corporate agenda.\nComing to York, colloquially referred to as a “social justice university,” I found a sense of freedom in expression and joined many social justice groups on campus in various leadership capacities.\nI also ended up becoming the assistant news editor at Excalibur, York’s largest student newspaper.

Thanks for sharing!\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nYork is known as a commuter school, and many students are no strangers to the red and white buses that circulate York, which are frequently delayed, overcrowded and overpriced.\nStudents and faculty are travelling miles upon miles to get to campus, making the daily use of transit a necessity. Despite many students’ growing financial burdens, the TTC continues to increase fares. In 2016, the TTC’s decision to raise fares occurred in the beginning of January. While Metropass prices remained the same, the transit board approved a 25 cent increase to the adult cash fare, a 10 cent increase to the cost of a token, a 50 cent increase to family/day passes and a $1.50 increase to both adult weekly passes and downtown express stickers.\n“Like many people, I believe that [the TTC] is very expensive and underdeveloped. Toronto is a big city area-wise, and comparing it to other urban centres such as New York City, London or Istanbul, the subway system needs so much improvement as well as lower fare prices,” says Mert Beloglu, third-year accounting student.\nToronto now has the most expensive monthly pass in Canada, priced at $141.50. The Toronto Star reported that Torontonians will have to ride the TTC more than 50 times per month to make the Metropass worth its price. With the increase in cash fare and the price of tokens, the TTC will still have to address a $30 million deficit through an increase in the subsidy it gets from the city.\nWhile children are allowed to ride for free, there is no discount provided to low-income riders as in many other Canadian cities; Calgary offers a 95 per cent discount to its monthly pass for residents living in extreme poverty. Despite this, the TTC is again considering increasing fares to make up for lost costs, as it claims that it receives the smallest subsidy in North America.\n“I am an international student and for me paying about $3.25 for a ride seems stupid. If I have to go to downtown then it makes sense, but sometimes going from one stop to the other [and paying that much] seems outrageous,” says Latika Verma, second-year communications student.\nThe TTC is beginning to phase out older fare media such as tokens and tickets and move forward with the PRESTO fare card system. Many TTC buses are now accepting PRESTO as a form of payment, however it is still encouraged to bring cash in case of a glitch. The old fare media will be accepted until mid-2017.\nTTC users are not happy when it comes to the lack of reliably and inconsistency in their transit conditions. With the winter months approaching, commuters are dreading the delays and tentative bus schedules. Enduring the elements of a Canadian winter only makes matters worse. Waiting for a bus can change from a 10 minute expenditure to 25 minutes; busses seemingly go in and out of service with no warning, and the winding lines in the York Commons are surely a foreshadow of your inevitable sardine-like packing into a bus.\nCommuters are left in the dust, wondering if the transit system serves them or the owners.\nIn 2015, the TTC broke its record of highest all-time total number of riders with 538 million. Kadeem Griffiths, TTC communications advisor, says that they are taking action to increase capacity, such as the automatic train control system coming in 2019.\n“The [Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension Project], which is scheduled to open in late 2017, will have a subway station on the York University Campus and will help with any increased demand for transit for students traveling to and from the campus,” he adds.\nWith six fare hikes in six years, the unpredictability and unreliability in TTC prices and times are leaving many people looking for alternative methods of transportation. TTCriders, a grassroots transit advocacy organization, is encouraging Toronto residents to stand up against the prices and conditions of the TTC. On October 26, they are hosting an event at City Hall to protest the cost of fares for individuals in need of social assistance, including low-income families, seniors and students.\nWith files from Arfi Hagiyusuf\n ', 'You’re the grtsteae! JMHO\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nThe men’s and women’s hockey teams were in action this week, as the men played on Thursday and Saturday, while the women played on Saturday and Sunday.\nIn Thursday’s game, the men were facing off against the Guelph Gryphons in Guelph. With just under six minutes to play in the first period, the Lions drew first blood with Derek Sheppard’s third goal of the season, assisted by Greg Milner and Trevor Petersen.\nLess than three minutes later, York added a goal courtesy of Petersen and assisted by Daniel Nikandrov and Nick Zottl.\nGuelph opened the scoring six minutes into the second period to cut the Lions’ lead to one, but York added an empty net goal with under a minute to play, putting the game out of Guelph’s reach.\nYork goalie Mack Shields was sensational, saving 33 of the 34 shots he faced in the win.\nOn Saturday, Ryerson opened the scoring with just 10 seconds left in the first period, giving them a one-goal lead they would take into the break.\nHowever, York didn’t have to wait long to respond, as Petersen scored his fourth goal of the season two minutes into the second to tie things up at one.\nAt the end of regulation, the score was still tied, which meant overtime was needed. However, neither team was able to break the stalemate in the first overtime, meaning we were heading to double overtime.\nJust four minutes into the extra extra frame, Sheppard was able to sneak a shot past the Rams goalie to give the Lions the 2-1 win.\nShields was spectacular once again, saving 26 of 27 shots, including five saves in overtime.\nWith the win, the Lions are now 4-2 on the season and have won their last four games.\nEarlier on Saturday, the women played the Brock Badgers at home, but neither team was able to find the back of the net in the first period.\nThe Badgers opened the scoring in the second period with a flurry of three unanswered goals coming nine, 12 and 18 minutes into the frame, respectively.\nWith seven minutes left in the game, the Lionesses finally answered Brock’s three goals with one courtesy of Erin Locke, who found the back of the net for the second time this season to end the Badger’s shutout. Unfortunately, that was York’s only goal of the game, and Brock went on to win by a final score of 3-1.\nThe women played again on Sunday, looking to even out their record against Ryerson.\nThe Rams’ Ailish Forfar opened the scoring with just over five minutes left in the first period, but less than two minutes later, the Lionesses evened the score with a goal from Leah Hibbert, assisted by\xa0Kelsey McHolm and Avery Reeves.\nBoth men’s and women’s teams won nail-biting games against Gryphons and Rams.\nYork opened the scoring midway through the second courtesy of Dana Somerville, assisted by McHolm and Taylor Davison.\nDespite being outshot by York in the third, it was Ryerson who found the back of the net just after the midway point, evening the score and forcing overtime.\nNeither team was able to break the tie, sending the game to double overtime. York was outshot 3-0 in the second overtime, but managed to preserve the tie and force a shootout.\nYork’s first shooter was Rianna Langford, who beat the goalie and gave York a 1-0 lead. Ryerson’s first shooter missed, but York’s second shooter, Tegan Duncan, also missed.\nRyerson’s second shooter missed again, but a goal from Somerville beat the Rams goalie and gave the Lionesses a 3-2 win.\nThe men’s next game is Friday at home against Brock starting at 7 p.m., while the women play again Saturday at home against Laurentian at 2 p.m.\n ', 'Cheers pal. I do aprcpeiate the writing.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nCasually arranged seats, a lit stage and glittery garments magically transformed Buddies in Bad Times Theatre’s cabaret space for Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again. The musical comedy, written by, directed by and starring Rachelle Elie, with musical accompaniment by Luke Jackson, teased and thrilled audiences from October 18 to 23.\nThe show started with Elie in a vibrant dress, descending a staircase as she took centre stage. Her gleeful and welcoming demeanor as she made her way through showgoers set the tone for the whole night. Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again was going to be fun, upbeat and relaxed.\nNo stranger to comedy, Elie filled the room with her sexual jigs and honest storytelling. As Elie glided across the stage and changed her costumes, she shared her love woes and awkward sexual encounters. Her stories of falling in love with a poet and then with her husband, aka “the voice,” resonated with the audience.\nThe lighting added an important formal element to the performance, following Elie’s every move, adding drama to her stories and illuminating key parts in the show. Even if Elie’s sharp humour and jokes did not connect with all present, the theatrics of the setup—costume, lighting, sound and staging—were aesthetically pleasing.\nElie shares everything in Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again, from her parents falling in and out of love, discovering her own sexuality in adolescence, to getting married, having kids and traveling. This vulnerability, along with guest interactions throughout the show, stressed the importance of love being rooted in communication. The casual and intimate setup could have backfired if audience members didn’t connect with the production, but Elie overcame this with her performance. She maintained eye contact with the audience throughout the night, creating a welcoming environment where people could feel comfortable to laugh, sing along or disagree.\nSh!t I’m in Love with You Again centers around Elie’s energetic performance, but what makes the show special is its message. The comedy show doesn’t shy from diverging from the fairytale story about a man and woman meeting and falling in love. Elie’s one-woman performance shows that, more than anything, love is not about getting your happily ever after.\nElie’s storytelling lets us know that it’s okay to hate your partner at times or to change your mind. It’s okay to leave a relationship that you’re not happy in, as is the case with her mother and father, or try to make things work with your partner as Elie does with her husband. Both are equally acceptable responses to falling out of love.\nIt’s easy to fall prey to notions of what a relationship, love or partner should look like. Remember that there is no ideal relationship to hold yours up to.\nThe only measure of your happiness or love is yourself.\nWhen your resolve weakens in February, Elie and Jackson will be putting on a Valentine’s Day Rag Bag Cabaret on February 14. The night promises to dish out music, burlesque, clowns and magic.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nCramped office spaces in the Student Centre and apparent lack of communication see clubs demanding greater transparency in the way space is allocated each year.

The attacks allegedly included YouTube and Facebook comments, as well as direct messages to their Twitter page.\nMany of the messages were racist and explicit in nature.\nYUBSA released a statement in response to the comments, saying that their efforts to offer reduced-cost training were met with resistance and anti-black racism.\n“Do not confuse our duty to give back to our community with the notion that we are imposing limitations or restrictions to others,” reads the statement.\nSome were quick to point out that other groups on campus, including York First Aid, provide similar medical training courses.\nAccording to YUBSA, the poster’s wording was generalized to include all black students, even those who are not officially YUBSA members.\nOne post on the York University Class of 2019 Facebook page has garnered more than 100 comments, with students discussing the validity of having a “black students only” event.\nThe controversy even escalated to some students being publicly attacked as white supremacists, but many posts were later taken down.\nIn a public statement, YUBSA proclaimed that as black students, they were faced with resistance for wanting to provide support for black community members, when allegedly other service groups and cultural organizations do this as well.\nYUBSA was not concerned with responding to the social media uproar.\n“Our concern was our intent,” says YUBSA.\n“The university must make a genuine commitment to challenge racial injustice and social inequalities on this campus,” they add.\nFounded in 1996, YUBSA was the fusion of African Student’s Association, the Caribbean Student’s Association and the Black Caucus Association.\n“As a Pan-African organization, YUBSA’s mission is to provide services that will foster the self-empowerment of students of African descent academically, financially and socially on the York University Campus; as a politically motivated association, YUBSA embodies a mandate to fight racial discrimination and systemic racism on the York campus as well as the wider York community,” reads the YUBSA description on the YFS website.\n ', 'I really wish there were more arlcetis like this on the web.\nMaybe there is a reason why these people impose this kind of announcement, other groups are doing this to them as well. formal first-aid training are imposed in order for a person to be considered “suitable” to carry out that role.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nWhat a year.\nCorrection: what a shitty year.\n2016-2017 at York saw continuing declining enrollment with tuition still rising by up to 3 per cent; the food sucked so much that we topped the list of worst Ontario post-secondary institutes for food safety; a petition was created for a disappointing sandwich; food service workers went on strike and a new incoming president received letters of no-support even before she was announced to take over the position.\nBut I guess the year didn’t suck that much. The food services workers that went on strike settled with Aramark, including an agreement that within a year, no worker will be making less than $15 an hour; the Bachelor of Administrative\nStudies program has been officially renamed as the Bachelor of Commerce thanks to a student petition; Bethune is introducing a course to help equip student leaders to address sexual violence and the men’s Lions hockey team won their first Queen’s Cup in 13 years.\nAnd that’s just what Excalibur reported on.\nThere are countless issues, concerns and voices that we didn’t cover—and it’s a damn shame.\nYork is a widely diverse and immensely passionate community and I recognize the opportunity— and responsibility—that is bestowed upon student journalists.

I have learned more about myself and grew as a person and a journalist in more ways that I could have anticipated from a measly student club. I have also seen the true passion within activists, the hurt souls of marginalized groups and even the ugly sides of people’s characters.\nBut most of all, I have learned that you can’t please them all. The truth, this imaginary ideal that journalists strive for, is not always pleasant. As a journalist, if you are pleasing everyone, then you are probably not doing your job right.\nHowever, if you’re ignoring certain voices, or simply not including them in your paper, then you are also failing at your job.\nJournalism is hard, particularly at a school that does not have a dedicated journalism school to teach us these valuable skills of interviewing, transcribing, oxford commas and managing hateful emails.\nAll I can wish for is that in spite of all of this, there are some of you who read Excalibur, appreciate the efforts of the editorial team and maybe become inspired to contribute.\nIt is immensely difficult to\xa0reflect the student body without the student voice.

Nearly 49 per cent of students had felt depressed to the point that it was difficult to function regularly and nearly 12 per cent seriously considered suicide.\nEarlier this month, Jack.org held their annual summit in Toronto, which saw 200 post-secondary students attend and discuss what mental health means on their campuses. The organization developed in 2010 as a movement when Jack\nWindeler, a first-year student at Queen’s University, committed suicide due to mental illness. Their vision is “No More Silence” about mental health.\nThe summit discussed the importance of access to mental health services on campuses and how there is often a lack of communication, resources and programs available for individuals in need. Many campus services are overwhelmed with students and are not properly equipped to deal with a large capacity or long-term treatment options.\n“It’s evident that universities are overwhelmed. There’s a huge increase in students wanting and needing to access mental health services,” said Fred Wagner of the Canadian Mental Health Association.\nJack.org is about creating dialogue and networking; by ensuring that young people are better able to care for themselves, they are further encouraged to support their peers.\n“When it comes to the more serious, long-term mental health conditions, the community and the university really have to come together to support that student,” said Wagner.\nThe aim is to empower students to get involved with their campus resources health advisory committees to ensure that help is available to all students who need it and that students know how to access these resources, as well as establishing dialogue around universities’ academic policies and how they affect mental health.\nStudents can play a significant role in how universities approach and handle mental health. Mental health problems exist beyond Bell Let’s Talk Day, and these illnesses aren’t present exclusively during exam periods.\nMaintaining one’s mental health is a continuous process, which is why Jack.org has created contact-based education and peer-to-peer outreach programs that are designed to teach students that we all have mental health, we all need to care for it and, most importantly, we need to talk about it.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2017/03/31/divestment-officially-recommended/'],"['\xa0\nYork’s Advisory Committee on Responsible Investment has voted to recommend divestment from fossil fuels and arms manufacturers.\nThe decision comes after the committee, or YUACRI, examined two major proposals submitted by YU Divest and Fossil Free York.\nYU Divest, a coalition of York students and alumni, has called for York to make a lasting commitment to divesting from five large arms manufacturers for their alleged complicity in human rights abuses due to war.\nFossil Free York called for York to divest from companies whose involvement in the extraction, processing and transport of fossil fuels means that they directly contribute to climate change.\nThey also state that investment in fossil fuels risks becoming “stranded” as the market for them becomes less viable.\nChenthoori Malankov, president of York Federation of Students, stated that the York community understands the link between human rights and climate justice.\n“We are excited about the possibility that York could be a global leader in promoting these values and in helping build sustainable, ethical economies of the future,” she said.\nRichard Wellen, president of York University Faculty Association, has hailed YUACRI’s decision as a historic moment for York.\n“The university is now poised to align its investment practices with its institutional values of sustainability, social justice, equity and good governance,” he said.\n“The Board of Governors should implement these recommendations as soon as possible.”\nPreviously, YU Divest was lobbying the Board of Governors against any future investment in companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Textron and Amphenol.

Prof. MacDonald’s research on the environmental value provided by various animal species living in our midst is informative and impressive, and is in keeping with the legacy of the naturalist Charles Darwin that there is merit in the comparative study of other species.\xa0\nThe article makes it clear that the animals she has studied (e.g., raccoons, opossums) actually benefit us;\xa0 “recycling mountains of consumer-generated waste in cities around the world.” As your article points out, Prof. MacDonald also confronts various myths about urban wildlife, as these animals are generally viewed as dangerous and dirty, responsible for disease.\xa0 By “eliminating enormous amounts of consumer waste,” she says, these animals actually make our cities healthier.\xa0\xa0\nFor those of us who live in an urban environment, our contact with urban wildlife may be coloured by misinformation that generates negative views (e.g., see the late Rob Ford’s views on the opossum).\xa0 Growing up in a city with its shopping plazas and malls may not give much of an opportunity to take note of the natural world and the creatures with whom we co-exist, except as seeing them as intruders and pests.\xa0\xa0\nThrough her work on animal behaviour, Prof. MacDonald not only provides insight into the habits of urban animals, which is in itself interesting,\xa0 her research, by reaching a wider audience through a docuseries such as CBC’s, The Nature of Things,\xa0 also contributes to fostering more tolerant and benign attitudes towards these creatures and remind us that we, too, are biological animals sharing our ecological niches with other species.\xa0 Let’s not forget, we are the waste makers and these animals, by being the ‘clean-up crew’, are doing their best to adapt to the environments that we continually destroy and create. Their creative ability to adapt to the challenges they confront in our urban spaces is even more remarkable for in the process of making our living spaces healthier,\xa0 these animals do not contribute to further environmental contamination or deterioration.\xa0\nIn a consumer-driven culture such as ours, with our bloated overblown sense of narcissistic omnipotence, these animals can teach us a lesson in humility, a lesson in eco-consciousness, by reminding us that we are custodians, and not rulers, of an ecosystem we all share and should protect.\n— Frank J.

Nanjeeba Chowdhury-Mohammad had been waiting to meet with family and partake in cultural ceremonies and gatherings. Although Sylhet’s economy has been thriving in recent years due to its production of gas and tea for all of Bangladesh, its residents continued to persevere through difficult living conditions. Many of the people living in Sylhet are elderly and are stricken with illnesses that make life debilitating.\xa0\nNanjeeba says everything feels different than what it is in Canada — a lot more “hustle and rush.”\xa0\nGrime and dirt-stained cars and lorries dangerously weaved through traffic. Run-down buildings and services in the village is a byproduct of the crippling economy. Merchants and business owners nearby try to keep their head above water to sustain their family. The demise of a notorious, poverty-stricken community being illuminated by the cultural preservation that still exists.\nNanjeeba’s experience, for the most part, is consistent with mine when I had travelled to Harar, Ethiopia in 2007. The city of Harar is walled with notable features of the region being its homes that are built from stone and wildlife (specifically hyenas). During my first visit, I recall seeing merchants scattering the streets on the hard rock surface selling their fresh produce and clothing in desperation to survive.\xa0\nThough I have only travelled back home once, I remember trying to immerse myself with how life was lived there. Doing so forces you to wonder about all of the first-world luxuries you take for granted: a nice bed to sleep on, a lack of nuisance-causing mosquitoes, a free healthcare system, a transit system that gets you places without compromising your safety, and a lack of air raid sirens. When we go back to our homeland, we say our hellos, stay a while for leisure, and just leave without so much as lending a helping hand once we leave.\xa0\xa0\nHumanitarian agencies identify many nations, like both Ethiopia and Bangladesh, as underdeveloped or developing. Most of all, these countries are in need of relief from famine, war, water contamination, disease, and deplorable living conditions.\nYou have seen the campaigning and programming time and time again: starved and traumatized children shedding tears in front of a camera. So although we as immigrants have the privilege of living in Canada now, we cannot forget our roots.\xa0\nBe it donating to non-profit organizations, volunteering with programs or volunteering abroad, donating clothes back home during leisure visits, donating insecticide-treated bed nets, sponsoring a child, or directly contributing to education reform, the smallest of sacrifices will make all the difference.\nIn hopes of reshaping and restructuring people’s lives in these nations, merely a small amount of time out of our days is required. After all, it is a delegation and duty that we do our part in contributing to our motherlands, as to show we are not abandoning them.\n ', 'I like this piece. Maybe say that World Vision is an agency – orient people with it?\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nMatt Render | Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Jordan Chu,\xa0Photo/Video Editor\nI hear a lot of apologizing today. A lot of people are made to feel ashamed of themselves and their identities. A lot of people who are being silenced based not on what they say, but who they are. I’ve seen people who accept the role assigned to them as some sort of enemy based on what they look like or what they believe in. People who apologize for their own existence. I’m not one of those people. I do not apologize for being white. I do not apologize for having red hair, either. And I surely won’t apologize for being Jewish. I’d like to emphasize that last point. I will neither apologize for being Jewish, nor will I remain silent while the cloud of anti-Semitism looms darker by the day.\nInstead of listing off the daily news events in the Jewish world, from the ongoing anti-Semitic attacks that have gone rampant in France, England, and throughout North America, I will single out two Canadian events. They speak to a larger issue that is at hand. These are not isolated incidents. They are indicative of the current political climate in Canada, and surely in other parts of the world as well. These are not the exception, but rather, the new normal.\nInstead of generating intellectual discourse, university campuses have become a breeding ground for hatred and thought control. At McGill University, it has been outlawed by the school newspaper to publish any pro-Zionist content whatsoever. This has been passed and enforced under the guise that any pro-Zionist speech is “hate speech.”\nForget the fact that I’m writing this as a Jew. This is a university we’re talking about here. A university that has effectively silenced an entire group of people. I don’t care who you are or what you stand for, that is anti-democratic. How that could ever pass is beyond my imagination, but I will venture to explain it this way: hating Israel (and Jews by default) is not just trendy, it is now politically correct.\nIf you are confused as to why Jews were included in that equation, you shouldn’t be. It’s simple math, really. If people hate Israel, believing it to be an evil, apartheid state, without the right to exist, and Israel is the homeland for Jewish people, is it a big intellectual leap to say those same people who hate Israel probably hate the Jews? That, coupled with the statistically most violent last couple of years in the history North American Jewry and the rise of anti-Zionist activist groups may help to elucidate the point a little clearer. If Israel is the enemy, then so are the Jews.\nLet’s be clear: the point isn’t to say anyone can’t disagree with Israel (or Judaism for that matter). Go right ahead and disagree. But, don’t forcefully break up a lecture being given by a veteran of the Israeli army while hurling anti-Semitic slogans and death threats under the guise of “social justice.” Here, I am referring to the incident on York’s campus where a pro-Israel group had their event shut down by a protest from Students Against Israeli Apartheid which quickly resulted in violence, anti-Semitic slogans, and death threats.\nIf this is what’s going on in our universities today, and if students are being bullied, belittled and denied their own voice, then the future is looking pretty bleak. Censorship and physical violence have no place in any democratic institution.\nThis has nothing to do with me being Jewish. This has nothing to do with me being pro-Israel. This is about hatred. No group deserves to be bullied into silence. No group deserves violence against them.\nI don’t care what group you belong to or what you think you stand for. I stand for what’s right. I stand for the truth. If that makes me the enemy, then so be it. I will not apologize for that.\n ', 'This is such a bad take, are you forgetting that it’s a settler colonial state and people have literally been displaced and had their homes destroyed and bulldozed in droves? I’m not sure what anti semitic slogans were actually said when the only alleged one was debunked and heard by no one there, but to answer your point the PREMIER of ontario and PRIME MINISTER of canada publically shamed the grassroots student protest because of one alleged comment that wasn’t actually said. So you have to ask yourself at some point, who has the real institutionalized power here, and who is actually being shamed for their opinions when any human rights activist in this country is smeared as being anti-semitic (google Canary Mission if you don’t believe me) and deplatformed/fired. What did actually happen was an FBI-recognized terrorist group, the JDL full of grown men, came and urinated on a Palestinian flag (Captured on video, see the yfs link) and assaulted student protestors. And sorry, yes it is strange to have members of a foreign military on our campus speaking because they are being paid heavily to do so by herut, a right wing, fascist political party. There is nothing wrong with criticizing israel’s policies when they have blatantly committed many human rights violations and many students have personal histories of their families being affected by these facts.\ni agree with bh. this is a very strange take on the situation. i absolutely understand the hurt & hatred one must feel when they’re standing up for something that others don’t believe in, but you have to recognize that this was not an antisemitic event. the rally was against having former soldiers who have killed innocent families in our place of education. as a palestinian supporter, i had a grown woman flip me off from behind a police officer & gesture as though she was spitting at me. all i had done was make eye contact w her. the “antisemitic chants” were debunked as a rumour a JDL member had started. as a rally attendee, i promise you there were no antisemitic chants. find me a video where that was chanted & i’ll side w you in a heartbeat.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nVictoria Meyer | Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of\xa0Pixabay\nCurrently, the minimum wage in Ontario is $14 an hour, which falls short of ensuring full-time work pays enough to make a living. It was scheduled to rise to $15 an hour this year, but the current provincial government has decided, instead, to freeze the minimum wage at $14.\xa0\xa0\n\xa0 I believe that $14 an hour is too low as compared to the current living wage, but $15 would have been a large increase and a good start to catch up with inflation,” says Sheila Block of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives “$14 is still good progress, but since it was rolled back it affected minimum wage workers negatively.”\nThe minimum wage is regarded as the legislative floor for hourly wages, and it should cover everyday costs for all workers. However, there are a number of exclusions not taken into consideration.\nSince the minimum wage is so low in Ontario, young adults struggle to pay for their daily expenses including schooling, transportation, housing and groceries. Regardless of where they are in their life, a minimum wage job does not cover the living expenses of Ontario.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, 52 per cent of Canada’s working population aged 15-24 earn the mandated minimum wage — 77.8 per cent of those minimum wage workers live in Ontario.\xa0\nMany students can relate to the struggles of having to keep up with living expenses.\xa0\nUniversity of Guelph-Humber student Lucas Neto, 21, says he worked a minimum wage job from age 16 to 18.\xa0\n“For me, at this age, I had a lot saved up and purchased my first car and paid off my first year of university. Of course, I had help from scholarships and my parents paying my car insurance. Without this financial assistance my perspective would be completely different,” says Neto.\nNow, Neto earns $20.81 an hour and was able to work full-time over the last few summers, which helped pay for his university tuition. Still, he struggles to stay on top of other expenses.\n“Although I have been fortunate to work at a higher wage job, this doesn’t leave me with too much room to spend more money,” Neto explains. “I can only imagine how difficult it is to work the minimum wage while having to pay for tuition, books, food, residence, a car, insurance, etc.”\nUniversity of Guelph-Humber student Brooklynn Lake, 21, has been working a minimum wage job for over six years. Lake explains: “Although my job has provided me with some funds for schooling, I still have to make sure that I have done the extra work to receive scholarships to cover my school payments. As well, it has made it difficult for me to ensure that I have enough funds for transportation as well, with bus fares increasing and not being able to afford a car for school and work”.\nLake believes that the minimum wage is not comparable to a living wage. “It has been difficult to live off of the wage I have been receiving for these six years”.\nYoung adults feel pressured to further their education in hopes of getting a well-paid job, but this also comes with the uncertainty of getting the occupation for which they studied so hard. Many are stuck working minimum wage jobs while paying off their student loans.\nYork alumnus Alex Few, 23, says that student debt can often weigh heavy on young adults’ shoulders. “Most of us have the hope that post-secondary will bring a well-paying job, but in reality, that’s not always the case,” says Few.\xa0\n“I have friends who work in retail and other underpaid positions to help pay for school or other necessities, and I have first-hand seen the stress that results from large expenses and low salaries”\nFew believes that the minimum wage needs to reflect growing expenses so that the wellbeing of people her age don’t have to be at stake.\nAccording to a 2013 report by Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a large majority of millennials who work in minimum wage jobs are characterized by four main things: low pay, few or no benefits, part-time or casual work, and greater risk of injury. Many minimum wage workers also have no choice but to rely on low-income jobs to support themselves.\nSome people worry that raising the minimum wage to a more adequate living wage could lead to job losses and would affect employees positively or negatively. However, this is not the case, according to Block.\n\xa0 Extensive academic research has been progressive on this issue and claims that the minimum wage increase does not increase unemployment but, instead, it increases wages for families as well as increases the pay rates of workers earning slightly over the minimum wage,” Block says.\xa0\n“So, overall, it is a positive impact.”\nThe bar is set too low in Ontario and it is time for the Ontario government to increase the minimum wage to benefit all low-income workers.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nAmeer Shash | Staff Writer\nFeatured image courtesy of Pixabay\nAs midterms approach, tensions and emotions run high. Families are pressing their children to reach their maximum potential to secure their dream job that “pays well,” build a name for themselves, and uphold family dignity. For hours on end, students will immerse themselves in textbooks and hurriedly submit documents online.\xa0\xa0\nIn many families, though, speaking about mental health is practically non-existent and having a mental illness is shameful in some cultures. January is half-way point of the school year, and students just hope to be able to plow through the remainder of the year with decent grades. Being caught up with studies and sometimes a part-time job can mean forgetting about self-care — physically and mentally. Fortunately, many corporations and businesses are taking a stand by letting social media be a voice to many who sit in silence to the stigma surrounding mental health.\nJanuary is renowned for Bell Let’s Talk Day: an initiative created by Bell Canada to advocate and educate others about mental health awareness and self-care. Their initiative, which began in January 2011, encourages Canadians to use hashtag symbols in conjunction with ‘BellLetsTalk’ and ‘MentalHealthAwareness’ on social media with their posts.\xa0\nAlternatively, if you are a Bell Canada customer, every text or call made on their network contributes to the cause. The power of medical innovation is, quite literally, at the tip of your fingers. The annual initiative also aims to destigmatize mental health and open up a conversation about the struggles of living with mental illness.\xa0 This is also the time where on-campus support services are the most critical.\nWhile technology can aid so much in advocating for a great cause, if you are a student who believes studying comes before self-care, you may want to reassess your disposition. When your brain is fogged and in the clouds, how can you expect to achieve success in school?\xa0\nUnfortunately, many students deal with adversities during their learning. The loss of a family member, emotional abuse from a loved one, a traumatic event — and especially when it happens for the first time, one can be at a standstill. It takes a lot of time for someone grieving to rationalize what has happened. Time can heal, but time can also manifest itself into a spreading “infection” on the brain. This is why it is important to seek help when and where possible, and without delay.\xa0\nIf you’re someone who is feeling down, put your head up and look around. Our school’s community has an array of support groups, services, and clubs where one can open up without feeling judged or ashamed. Mental health initiatives are imperative for us all, and we must continue to talk about this not only in January, but every day of the year.\xa0\nSince #BellLetsTalk’s inception, $100 million dollars has been raised for the cause. Canadians remain hopeful that technological advancements in both medicine and social media enhance the lives of those living with mental health challenges.\n ', 'When I was 19, I met my girlfriend who was 18 at the time.

It’s a time when student groups and the university alike go all-out to talk about mental health and wellness.\nThere are so many resources and services available to help with feelings of stress, anxiety, depression, and the like at York that it can be overwhelming figuring out what the best option is for you. At least the options are there, unlike at some other universities that have little to no support available for student mental health needs.\nIt’s great that we’re finally moving into a place where we can discuss all of our feelings — not just the shiny, happy ones. And, it’s great that Bell Let’s Talk Day has played a major role in this movement.\nHowever, in these conversations about mental health, what’s often excluded is mental illness.\nYes, when negative mental health exists long enough it can turn into an illness, so it is important to focus on strategies to improve and reflect upon one’s mental health. However, stopping at mental health doesn’t help those who are already at the point of illness, both diagnosed and undiagnosed. It also doesn’t help that we only speak about mental health meaningfully at this time of year, and that for a few weeks its social media filters and tags are the new fad before mental health and wellness fades into the background.\nEmphasizing positive mental health practices — such as exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep — isn’t enough for those who struggle on a regular basis, not just in January. It can make those who are mentally ill feel like they did something wrong, that somehow their illness is entirely their fault, and that can be dangerous to someone who is already struggling with mental illness(es).\nSo, in the same way that we’re moving forward and breaking down the stigma around discussing mental health, we’re often neglecting thoughtful conversation and education about mental illness. We’re neglecting an already vulnerable group who doesn’t feel like they belong, and further ostracizing them.\xa0\nWhat Bell Let’s Talk festivities need isn’t more talk about mental health, it needs more talk about the illnesses that can result from prolonged poor mental health. It’s talking about what anxiety can look like, or depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, or any other number of mental illnesses. And, it’s talking about how harmful it can be when someone who doesn’t have one of those illnesses uses them as adjectives to describe their quirks.\nThe Bell Let’s Talk initiative raises a lot of money every year that goes toward making mental health support services more accessible, and the conversation it sparks at this time of year is important. However, it’s a conversation that needs to be continued and be made more inclusive. Mental health and mental illness are equally important every other day of the year.\xa0\nIf we can’t have comfortable conversations about mental illness, we’ll struggle to understand why those who practice good mental health habits can also be the same people who have a mental illness.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nEmily Goodwin | Editor-in-Chief\nFeatured image courtesy of Jeremy Zheng/York Lions\nThe Lions were looking to snap their 11-game losing streak this past weekend, and did just that when they travelled to St. Catharines to take on the Brock Badgers on Thursday. However, when they returned onto home ice the following night to take on the Guelph Gryphons, they could not repeat their success.\nThe Lions had defeated the Badgers by one point at the beginning of the season, but the Badgers had in turn won their last contest by the same margin.\nIn Thursday’s match, the Lions beat the Badgers 5-4 in overtime. Tyler Higgins got the Lions onto the scoreboard first, netting a goal at 13:37. Twenty seconds later, Xavier Pouliot added a second goal for the Lions. Brendan Browne assisted on both of these goals.\nThe Lions added two more goals in the second period, the first of these coming from Justin Bean. Brandon Yeamans followed up with another goal less than a minute later, bringing the score to 4-0 for the Lions.\nIn the last half of the same period, the Badgers took control of the puck and scored three consecutive goals. Tyler Rollo scored twice and\xa0 Jordan Sambrook added another to close out the period one point behind the Lions at 4-3.\nThe Badgers tied the score in the third period when Ayden MacDonald scored on a power play.\xa0 Neither team was able to score after that, and the game went into overtime.\xa0\nEarly in the period, the Lions were able to once again find the back of the Badgers’ net and regained the lead at 5-4. This goal came off the stick of Nic Coric, with Yeamans and Mark Wilson assisting.\xa0\nThe Lions’ defence stayed strong for the rest of the game, and the Lions took home their first win since November.\nFriday’s match against the Gryphons was a tough contest. The Gryphons had defeated the Lions in both of their prior matches this season, and were looking for a third. The Gryphons achieved just that, edging out the Lions in overtime for a final score of 4-3.\nThe Gryphons scored early in the period, with Mikkel Aagaard and Justin Lemcke teaming up to get past Lions goaltender Cole Ceci. After battling it out for another 18 minutes, the Lions found their way to the Gryphons’ net. Peter De Coppi scored first for the Lions, and was assisted by Coric and Browne. The first period ended tied 1-1.\nThe Gryphons took the lead in the second period. Ryan Valentini and Ted Nichol scored once each to put the Gryphons up 3-1 over the Lions.\nShortly after Nichol’s goal, Morgan Messenger of the Lions found his way to the net. Alex Mowbray and Scott Feser assisted on this goal.\nThe Lions scored again in the third period while keeping the Gryphons at bay. Bean scored his second goal of the weekend, with Feser and Messenger assisting. This left the game tied at 3-3, and the game went into overtime once again.\nThis overtime did not go as well for the Lions as it did the night before. Connor Bramwell of the Gryphons scored 40 seconds into play, and the Lions were unable to regain the lead. The game ended 4-3 in favour of the Gryphons.\nThe Lions are now at 6-16 for the season, up to 14 points but still last in the OUA West rankings.\nThey will be back in action tomorrow on Wednesday, January 29 at 7:00 p.m. to take on the Badgers once again, this time at Canlan Ice Sports.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nEmily Goodwin | Editor-in-Chief\nFeatured Image: Lauren Golding goes in for lay up in Friday morning’s match against the Nippissing Lakers. | Courtesy of Jojo Yanjiao Qian/York Lions\nThe Lions’ basketball teams were back in action at home this past weekend. They took on the Nippissing Lakers on Friday and the Laurentian Voyageurs on Saturday. The women’s team picked up two more wins, extending their winning streak to five in a row. The men’s team had a tougher time and lost both matches.\nFriday’s school-day match against the Lakers saw the women’s team start strong and maintain their lead throughout the game. By the end of the first half, the Lions were already up 39-28.\xa0\nThe Lakers desperately tried to close the gap, but they were no match for the Lions. The game ended 84-70 for the Lions.\nLauren Golding once again lead the Lions in points, scoring 28. Katrina Collins-Samuels lead in rebounds with 19.\nWhen the men took to the court, their skills were not enough to keep up with the Lakers. After the first quarter ended in a 19-all tie, the Lions increasingly fell behind each quarter. At halftime they were down 43-35.\nThe Lions struggled for the remainder of the game, which ended 82-67 for the Lakers.\nSaturday night’s matches against the Voyageurs saw the women’s team replicate their first half success from the previous night. They were up 31-22 over their opponent at half time, and picked up the pace in the third and fourth quarters.\nThe Voyageurs struggled to keep up with the Lions in the last half of play, and continued to fall further behind. A massive 26-point fourth quarter from the Lions sealed their fifth straight win, with a final score of 75-48.\xa0\nGolding and Megan McLeod shared top point accolades, scoring 18 each. McLeod also lead in rebounds with 10.\nWhere the women’s team replicated their success, the men’s team had an equally hard time in Saturday’s match. After trailing in the first, the Lions came back to score an equal number of points to the Voyageurs in the second period. This burst of energy did not extend into the last half of the game though, and the Lions lost their third straight game 84-76.\nPrince Kamunga and Tyler Prince led in points during Friday’s game, earning 13 each. Kamunga took the lead for the Lions in Saturday’s game with 26 points.\nThe women’s team now sits in third in the OUA Central division, with 20 points and 10-6 for the season. The men remain in last with just four points, and two wins to 14 losses.\nThe Lions will be on the road for their next four games where they will take on Brock, McMaster, Windsor, and Western.\nThey will return to the Tait McKenzie Centre for their final games of the regular season, the first being Wednesday, February 12 against the UOIT Ridgebacks. The second and final game will be on Friday, February 14 against the Queen’s Gaels. Tip-off for both games is at 6:00 p.m. for the women and 8:00 p.m. for the men.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/op-ed/2020/01/29/sorry-not-sorry/'],"['I like this piece. Maybe say that World Vision is an agency – orient people with it?\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nMatt Render | Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Jordan Chu,\xa0Photo/Video Editor\nI hear a lot of apologizing today. A lot of people are made to feel ashamed of themselves and their identities. A lot of people who are being silenced based not on what they say, but who they are. I’ve seen people who accept the role assigned to them as some sort of enemy based on what they look like or what they believe in. People who apologize for their own existence. I’m not one of those people. I do not apologize for being white. I do not apologize for having red hair, either. And I surely won’t apologize for being Jewish. I’d like to emphasize that last point. I will neither apologize for being Jewish, nor will I remain silent while the cloud of anti-Semitism looms darker by the day.\nInstead of listing off the daily news events in the Jewish world, from the ongoing anti-Semitic attacks that have gone rampant in France, England, and throughout North America, I will single out two Canadian events. They speak to a larger issue that is at hand. These are not isolated incidents. They are indicative of the current political climate in Canada, and surely in other parts of the world as well. These are not the exception, but rather, the new normal.\nInstead of generating intellectual discourse, university campuses have become a breeding ground for hatred and thought control. At McGill University, it has been outlawed by the school newspaper to publish any pro-Zionist content whatsoever. This has been passed and enforced under the guise that any pro-Zionist speech is “hate speech.”\nForget the fact that I’m writing this as a Jew. This is a university we’re talking about here. A university that has effectively silenced an entire group of people. I don’t care who you are or what you stand for, that is anti-democratic. How that could ever pass is beyond my imagination, but I will venture to explain it this way: hating Israel (and Jews by default) is not just trendy, it is now politically correct.\nIf you are confused as to why Jews were included in that equation, you shouldn’t be. It’s simple math, really. If people hate Israel, believing it to be an evil, apartheid state, without the right to exist, and Israel is the homeland for Jewish people, is it a big intellectual leap to say those same people who hate Israel probably hate the Jews? That, coupled with the statistically most violent last couple of years in the history North American Jewry and the rise of anti-Zionist activist groups may help to elucidate the point a little clearer. If Israel is the enemy, then so are the Jews.\nLet’s be clear: the point isn’t to say anyone can’t disagree with Israel (or Judaism for that matter). Go right ahead and disagree. But, don’t forcefully break up a lecture being given by a veteran of the Israeli army while hurling anti-Semitic slogans and death threats under the guise of “social justice.” Here, I am referring to the incident on York’s campus where a pro-Israel group had their event shut down by a protest from Students Against Israeli Apartheid which quickly resulted in violence, anti-Semitic slogans, and death threats.\nIf this is what’s going on in our universities today, and if students are being bullied, belittled and denied their own voice, then the future is looking pretty bleak. Censorship and physical violence have no place in any democratic institution.\nThis has nothing to do with me being Jewish. This has nothing to do with me being pro-Israel. This is about hatred. No group deserves to be bullied into silence. No group deserves violence against them.\nI don’t care what group you belong to or what you think you stand for. I stand for what’s right. I stand for the truth. If that makes me the enemy, then so be it. I will not apologize for that.\n ']"

This post, which boasted hundreds of likes and included three different confessions, is not only deeply antisemitic and offensive, but it could not be further away from the truth.\nThe first confession stated that the York Federation of Students (YFS) was right to not let Israeli students participate in CultureFest because Israel has no culture and “is a country built on the genocide of Palestinian families”. This statement is both factually incorrect and deeply offensive. Israel is a legitimate, democratic country that was founded in 1948 on the back of a rich 3000-year-long connection to the land of Israel, dating back to biblical times. This connection is not only religious and cultural, but also historical.\nClaims that Israel “has no culture” are simply false. Israel’s culture is deeply rooted in the Jewish religion and its diverse population has contributed to its dynamic, creative, and diverse culture with contributions in areas such as art, literature, music and cuisine.\nThe claim that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people is an ugly distortion of reality. Genocide is defined as the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation. The reality is millions of Arab citizens live peacefully and freely in Israel, with equal rights and opportunities under the law. Arab citizens hold positions of power in government, business, and academia and they are represented in the Israeli parliament and judicial system. Israeli hospitals treat Palestinian patients alongside Israeli patients, Israeli universities admit Palestinian students alongside Israeli students, and all citizens enjoy full opportunity to participate in Israel’s vibrant economy.\xa0\nThe conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is complex and reducing it to a simplistic narrative of genocide is not only inaccurate but also dangerous. It is important to recognize that Israel is not committing and has never committed genocide. Both sides have suffered in this conflict. This February alone, 13 Jews, as young as six years-old were murdered by Palestinian terrorists solely for the fact that they are Jewish. Most people on both sides desire a peaceful resolution that recognizes the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians, and to end the non-stop suffering from terrorism that Israeli people have endured — Jewish and non-Jewish, alike.\nComparing Israel to Nazi Germany, as the second confession post does, is not only absurd, but also deeply offensive to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Such comparisons trivialize the atrocities committed by the Nazis and demonstrate a profound ignorance of history.\nThe third confession is the face of today’s antisemitism. It is a cheap coverup of the same old, vile forms of antisemitism Jews have suffered from for thousands of years. While you could technically be pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel without physically hurting Jews, the notion that taking an anti-Israel position is not only detrimental to Jewish people, but is also utterly foolish from all viewpoints. It is important to note that there is a line between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. Denying the legitimacy of millions of Jews living in their ancestral homeland and denying their right to self-determination is antisemitic. This is not a matter of political opinion, but a basic human right that is afforded to all people, even to those without a rich history and ties to a land like the Jewish nation.\nWhat is particularly concerning about these confessions is not just that they are offensive and frightening to Jewish students, but also that they contribute to the spread of antisemitism in our society. Antisemitism is a type of hatred that not only harms Jewish people but one that perpetuates fundamental flaws in society and negatively affects everyone.\nWe have seen time and time again throughout history the horrific consequences of allowing antisemitism to take hold.\xa0\nIt is crucial that we, the York student community, come together to fight against antisemitism in all its forms. This means standing up against hate speech and discrimination, and fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect for all students, regardless of their background or beliefs. For future events held by the YFS, we must demand from the federation to be truly inclusive and allow for the fair representation of all students, including those of Israeli descent.
