Other athletic facilities would be moved closer to the center of campus, and parking spaces may be shrunk and pushed to the edges.\nChristopher Wong, director of master planning with the YUDC, said the plans will be revised based on consultation with stakeholders over the summer, but that the changes realistically reflect the direction the campus will assume over the next few years.\nAt the open house, students engaged with consultants over the changes; some reactions were quite positive.\n“The people who put this together seemed to have a pretty good idea of the university and its needs,” said third-year law major Flynn Paquin, citing the general switch from parking lots and roads to multi-use pedestrian space. “They’ve a pretty good idea of what actually happens on the campus.”\nBut Paquin was also worried the plans focused too much on “greening” a campus that, for most students studying in the fall and winter, will still mainly feature brown, barren trees.\nWong said while courtyards may not be usable in wintertime, they “provide a visual amenity to the building occupants, bringing daylight into complexes like Schulich and the Seneca@York building.”\nThe open house was the YUDC’s first information session on the project – they’ve another set for this coming fall – but some students noted it wasn’t well advertised, and spanned only a few hours. “I didn’t know about this at all—it just popped up,” said a second-year liberal arts student. “I think they strategically place it during exam time when not everyone’s on campus.”\nWong explained the presentation panels will be available for download from the YUDC website in the next few weeks.\nLooking at photos on several panels, it was apparent the Planning Partnership and Greenberg Consultants Inc., who worked together on the project with the YUDC, drew inspiration from parks and walkways at McGill University in Montreal; in Brooklyn, New York; and in Shanghai, China.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/04/13/york-unveils-master-plan/'],0.5792999863624573,0.008058689534664154,0.021896526217460632

Excalibur will continue to update any breaks in the story.\nToronto police have identified the woman who was found dead April 15 in a basement apartment in the Village at York University.\nQian Necole Liu, a 23-year-old student who came to Canada in January and was studying at the York University English Language Institute (YUELI) on a student visa, was found dead at her off-campus Village residence at 27 Aldwinckle Heights.\nLiu’s boyfriend, who is overseas in China, told police he was engaged in an online conversation with Liu when she answered her door around 1:00 a.m. A physical struggle ensued between Liu and the man at the door – who initially asked to use her cellular phone – while her boyfriend looked on, until the unknown man turned off the computer.\nPolice outside of 27 Aldwinckle Heights (Jacqueline Perlin)\nThe computer, an IBM ThinkPad T400, is still missing. The police have labeled the man a person of interest, and describe him as a tall white male with a muscular build and medium length brown hair between 20 and 30 years old.\nHer boyfriend alerted friends of the incident via internet; they contacted police. Liu was found dead by the time authorities arrived, approximately 10 hours later.\nExcalibur approached YUELI and the Chinese consulate in Toronto. YUELI declined comment, while the Chinese consulate only mentioned there would be a related media release April 19.\nPolice and forensics were seen on site moving in and out of the residence, though they declined comment.\nAccording to Tony Vella, a Toronto police officer working on the case, ensuring student safety is one of the major issues at hand.\n“The [roommates] have been spoken to. Obviously it was a very traumatic experience […] their safety is our first concern,” he said. “We are trying to determine if it was an isolated incident or if it was random.”\nVella said Toronto Police are currently speaking with York security and the public relations department to make sure the school population is safe.\nFourth-year kinesiology student Marco Manca says that for students living in the village, the incident has struck very close to home.\n“A lot of us have lived in this Village area for so long,” he said. “[My] friend that lives here has been deeply affected because he’s met the victim.”\nManca’s friend – who was living at the same residence as Liu, though he was not at home at the time of the murder – has since moved back to his family residence.\n“He has to move his stuff back to his [family residence],” said Manca. “He’s waiting on word when he can do that, because right now he’s not allowed.”\nAlexandra Shiman, a fourth-year student who lives in the Village, feels unsafe in the wake of the incident.\n“I’ve always felt uncomfortable living in this area, but my fears have increased since hearing about the murder,” she said.\nAnyone with information about the incident or the person of interest is asked to call police at 416-808-7399 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-8477.\nWith files from Kate Hudson, Yuni Kim, Jacqueline Perlin and Michael Sholars']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/04/18/york-village-death-qian-liu/'],0.19984778761863708,0.455351322889328,0.0961734801530838

Once done, he says, the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC) will decide on the best one before a design plan is reviewed and approved by the Student Centre.\nThe height of the statue, Parsons adds, will depend on cost. Bronze, the preferred material, costs more than alternatives like aluminum. Though there are cheaper and quicker alternatives, he feels they will not be a creative, long-lasting solution.\nCheuk Kwan of the TADC is hoping a bronze statue will be approved.\n“The Goddess of Democracy is the most symbolic icon of the Tiananmen Massacre,” he says. “Thus, it must be both prominent and identical to the original, both conditions laid down by the TADC to emphasize the statue’s historical significance.

Eke.\nNo one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.\nWhat parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.\nRoom 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.\nFrom the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.\nThe campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.\nHer pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off. \xa0Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.\nShe heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”\n“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”\n“No, she never goes anywhere.”\n“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”\n“Did you notice in English lecture…?”\nEke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.\n“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.\nShe blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.\nDuring her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.\n“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.\n“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”\nAt six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.\nHis arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.\nEke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.\nJoining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.\nBut this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.\n“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.\nWith her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.\n“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.\nHer hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.\nKnock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.\nThe door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.\n“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”\n“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.\n“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.\n“Do I know you, girl?” he said.\nShe grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/arts/2012/02/29/the-professor/'],0.18174442648887634,0.44506245851516724,0.20401597023010254

He served as Dean of Graduate Studies before becoming the Dean of the Faculty of Environmental Studies.\nA staunch advocate of sustainability, Dr. Bell’s drive for environmental education was recognized with a number of awards throughout his lifetime—notably, the 2014 Canadian Network for Environmental Education and Communication Award and The Green Toronto Award for Leadership in Sustainability.\nMarilyne Lambert-Drache, the associate vice-president international at York and former colleague of Dr. Bell’s, emphasized his passion for education in an interview with the Toronto Star.\n“I saw him giving lectures two times to undergraduate students and he was an incredible communicator,” she said. \n“He radiated that passion and students were absolutely mesmerized by this tall man with a big smile and just listening to every one of his words.

No, just Kombucha. | Courtesy of Pexels\nImagine an alternative to your everyday coffee, pop, tea, or energy drink—a refreshing, sweet drink that may offer multiple health benefits—kombucha. Kombucha is a drink made from sweet black tea, fermented with yeast and a bacteria culture.\nKombucha only recently become a mainstream beverage and can be found in health-food, grocery, and some convenience stores across Canada. One Regina café even offers kombucha on tap as an alternative for those who are health-conscious.\nThe origin of kombucha is unknown, but it has been around for thousands of years, praised as an “immortal health elixir.” Throughout the 20th century, scientists in Russia and Germany investigated this mysterious drink after noticing that entire regions of their respective countries appeared to be immune to rising rates of cancer. The reason? Kombucha.\nThe drink is especially prominent in the East, including in China, Russia, and Serbia, where it is known for its health benefits. Some of these include an increase in energy, a strengthening of the immune system, improved digestion, weight loss, reduction in high blood pressure, decreased chance of heart disease, and the lowering of one’s chances of developing various cancers.\nThe drink is rich in antioxidants, B-vitamins, and glucaric acids, and is also credited for reducing or eliminating the symptoms of fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety.\nThere is, however, one element produced during the fermentation process that further sets kombucha apart from your everyday energy drink—alcohol.\nKombucha contains a small, yet measurable percentage of alcohol. A single bottle can contain an alcohol level of 0.5 to 2.5 per cent. While it may be easily sold and accessed, some demand that kombucha be registered and regulated as an alcoholic beverage, only to be sold in facilities licensed to handle alcohol. Due to this controversy—and as a measure of caution—a number of chain food stores, moreso those in the United States, will require patrons to show proof of age before allowing them to purchase it.\nThere is, however, a mixed reaction from those who have tasted it. Nathan Abdool, a fourth-year Kinesiology student, notes its alternative taste, and Negar Almas, a third-year Political Science student, raves about its texture. Both suggest more people should try kombucha and form their own opinions of the drink.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/health/2017/10/31/kombucha-magic-in-a-bottle/'],0.531480073928833,0.08155611157417297,0.08200306445360184

They are fresh,” says Sabine Mondestin, OWTFF president and founder. \n“What I love is to be able to give them that platform to be able to experience the festival feel, to be able to know what it is like to showcase their film and to have that experience. We have granted free access to all university and college students.”\nUpon entry, festival-goers could not help but notice the red carpet laid out before them with an OWTFF backdrop ringed by a wave of fluttering flashes as photographers and videographers captured the night’s invited talent. Downstairs in the basement, a professional makeup studio was assembled to have everyone feeling celebrious.\n“I attend so many other events in Los Angeles,” Mondestin explains. “What I really like there is that feeling of ‘Oh my God, I’m a star!’ so I really want to give students that same treatment. [The filmmaker’s] film is there, and they get the star treatment: the paparazzi-style pictures—this is something that people like.”\nMondestin says she uses this unique framework to also recognize new photographers. “[Student photographers] don’t all have careers, but they are talented. They send us their portfolios and say: ‘I really want to take pictures in front of the red carpet.’”\nOver the course of three days, the festival featured 17 films and provided a space for directors, producers, actors, models, film reviewers, and multimedia professionals to all network and share their processes. Screened movies were selected from submissions to FilmFreeway and the official OWTFF website.\n“We’ve been travelling around and, you know, Canada is a bit behind on this compared to Los Angeles,” says OWTFF Director Steve Lareau. \n“Over there they really know how to market their movies, but here—not so good. We are inspired quite a bit by Los Angeles in this business model.”\nThe 2017 film selection featured short student films, documentaries, animated shorts, music videos and experimental films from Toronto, New York, Japan, and Turkey. Films included The Kidnapping of a Fish, Poison in the Water, The Oasis Affair, \xa0Nights of Contrition, Princess Eun Hwa, The Box, Voice of Grace, Frapuccino, Approaching, Finding Hope, and Echo Park Blues.\n“There have been lots of movies we’ve seen over the years that have been excellent, but we think that even more people should see them—to bring some light to those talents,” adds Lareau. “Every year, as soon as we’re done with a festival, we start to find new talent for next year, and we really try to find those little diamonds.”\nThe festival further featured a conference, moderated by Alina Christensen, on financing and filming in—and co-producing with—China alongside James Nan Guan, a Chinese producer who has worked on films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drago, among others. \nChristensen, a York Theatre alumna, says she was particularly impressed with Nan’s eagerness to share his knowledge. “It was clear to me that despite all the experience he has, he was still very humble and passionate about cinema, wanting to connect with likeminded artists here in Canada.”\nNan forecasted that the Chinese film industry will soon surpass Hollywood’s.\n“The Chinese population is much greater [than America’s],” Nan noted on stage, speaking with her. “Toronto’s is three million; Beijing’s, 23 million. If even 10 per cent of China sees a movie, that’s already more than all of Toronto.”\n“He answered every question with confidence and in plenty of detail, and he even threw in some humour too,” Christensen adds. “His charisma kept the audience attentive and focused.”\nOWTFF further invited critics and reviewers to offer feedback to the featured talent.\n“Film festivals offer a great opportunity for young filmmakers to network and meet industry professionals,” says Maziyar Khatam, a Toronto filmmaker who had his own movies screened. “It’s a good chance to have your film screened in front of an audience and to receive feedback on your work. \n“The technical aspects of [OWTFF’s] films—the cinematography, editing and music—were astounding. My favourite film from the festival was Bakemono, a 48-minute Japanese experimental film.”\nThis is the festival’s third year running. “We try to add one day every year,” Lareau mentions. “The first year we did one; the next year, two; and this year, we did three.”\n“It’s easy to remain in your university bubble, especially at a school like York which is located away from the downtown core and where everything you need is on campus,” Christensen notes. “It’s a really good idea to get out there and begin creating a network outside of your own school, which allows you to meet industry professionals as well as other students.”\nAfter all, this is what Mondestin aimed to create.\n“The main thing we want to accomplish is to showcase talented filmmakers who have the talent, but don’t have the name,” she says. “It’s hard to get into festivals if you don’t have a name. \n“And I’m all about glamour.”\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/arts/2017/11/29/toronto-film-talent-receives-hollywood-treatment/'],0.9372940063476562,0.19737964868545532,0.2009795755147934

The artificial moon could save the city of Chengdu $174 million when providing light for only 50 square kilometers. They plan to send three more after the first; if and when the following three are operational, they’ll be able to cover 3,600 to 6,400 square kilometers.\nAccording to Chunfeng, extensive testing for the satellites began years ago, so hopefully, when the mini-moons are ready to be launched, there won’t be any problems. \nRussia conducted launch tests in the 90s on a similar device, dubbed ‘The Znamya 2’, which was taken into orbit aboard the cargo spacecraft Progress. It was equipped with a 25-meter mirror capable of producing a bright spot on the Earth, 4.8 kilometers in diameter. The overall project was a failure, as the subsequent test of the Znamya 2.5, the Znamya 2’s predecessor, resulted in an entangling conundrum between one of the antennae of Progress, and the mirror itself. The mirror was irreparably destroyed, costing the Russians a pretty penny, and ending their audacious attempt indefinitely.\nBut in today’s day and age of species extinctions, deforestation, and global warming, it’s not the satellite that people are worried about; it’s the wildlife. Many animals are reliant upon the rather predictable nature of the moon. Be it for hunting, mating, or navigation, the moon is a powerful tool used by numerous nocturnal animals. With the addition of a second ‘moon’, there is a concern that these creatures of the night may be affected negatively by the increase in light exposure.\nAlex Mills, an associate professor at York who has taught undergraduate courses in evolution, population ecology, conservation biology and animal migration, explains that “many organisms are light-sensitive.” Having completed his Master of Science on the influence of moonlight on nocturnal birds and bats, Mills further elaborates that “some species avoid night, some prefer night providing there’s some light (as in twilight or moonlight), and others prefer night without moonlight.”\nThe birds and bats that Mills studied are defined as “lunaphilic”, which means they are moon-active, as well as twilight-active, “but some bats are lunaphobic, meaning they do most of their feeding in the dark, without moonlight.”\nWhen asked how he thinks night-active birds may be affected by the artificial moon, Mills says: “There is evidence in North America that breeding birds that are inactive by day, and inactive during dark night, but active during twilight and moonlight, are influenced by artificial anthropogenic light, such as is found in urban and suburban areas. It does affect their circadian rhythms, although I’m not sure anyone has shown it is costly for them.”\n In regards to his own subject species, he describes that they “adjust [their] reproductive schedule to the lunar cycle (laying eggs at the time of the full moon). I suspect this kind of facility would interfere with that kind of cycle, because the light periodicity associated with the lunar cycle would disappear.”\nMills further notes that light pollution produced by cities is “a huge problem for migratory birds,” as countless birds have died colliding with commercial office buildings, houses, and apartment buildings, which are often kept lit at night. The best course of action to prevent this from happening is to remember to turn off all lights that are not in use, or use curtains, even when it’s dark outside. To learn more about how to help protect these birds, Mills recommends a citizen science group called FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program), based in Toronto.\nThough the idea of an anthropogenically placed moon sounds totally out of this world, it may not be as far out as it seems—or rather, as far out as it should be. In an interview between Discover Magazine and Ryan Russell, an associate professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas, Russell said: “Their claim for one LEO (Low Earth Orbit) sat at [500 kilometers] must be a typo or misinformed spokesperson. The article I read implied you could hover a satellite over a particular city, which of course is not possible.”\nAccording to Discover Magazine, geostationary orbital satellites, or satellites that maintain a fixed position over Earth, are only capable of doing so at approximately 35,500 kilometers. If Chunfeng and his team were to set their mini-moon at that height, the mirror would need to be much, much larger for anyone to even remotely see the light. And at a distance of 500 kilometers, the satellite would require thrusters, as well as a significant amount of refueling, to remain stationary, which simply wouldn’t be economically feasible. \nSo are they lying? We’ll just have to wait and see. One thing can be known for certain though: most people will be getting a good night’s rest under one moon, just as nature intended.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2018/12/14/thats-no-moon/'],0.07844827324151993,0.19473667442798615,0.017791153863072395

Some of these residents are students who are there on exchange programs from Canadian universities.\nAs a result, York and other Canadian universities have requested that the exchange students come back to Canada out of concern for their safety.\nAfter Hong Kong was returned to China after being a British colony in 1997, Hong Kong still maintained a certain level of independence as a separate entity from China.\nSince June, protests have escalated as Hong Kong has put forward a bill which threatens to have criminals from Hong Kong extradited to China for punishment.\nThe protests have gradually become worse. They have been characterized by Chinese officials as riots and have led to many protestors being killed, injured, and detained.\n“I think it is reasonable for them to call back the students,” says Kevin Gu, first-year language student. “The protestors have attacked the universities,” he adds, emphasizing that the severity of the protests were putting Canadian students’ lives in danger.\nOne student, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of a reaction from the Chinese government, had a different outlook.\n\xa0Canadians are safe in China. Canada has always been viewed positively by the Chinese, ever since Mao. This is all being blown out of proportion. China doesn’t see Canada the same way as other Western countries,” says the student.\n“If the protests continue to grow more violent, based on history, it could lead to a civil war, and Canadian students could be caught in the crossfire,” says third-year history student Eric Solomon.\n“I don’t know how bad it actually is, but studying abroad is stressful enough, having this going on would take a toll on one’s mental health,” adds Solomon. “Even if Canadian students aren’t being targeted, they’re getting affected one way or another. Everybody is hurting. No one wins.”\nFirst-year interdisciplinary studies student Katherine Mu challenged whether the overall concern from Canadian universities was for the best of all involved.\n“Are we valuing some lives more than others? Why don’t we focus on creating a safer environment for everybody rather than just calling these students back? For any university or country to only call back their people from a situation like that shows they are valuing some lives more than others,” says Mu.\nDespite being across the world, many students at York are engaging in discussion and protesting around the current situation in Hong Kong. For now, all students can do is hope for the safety and well-being of those affected by the conflict.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2019/11/28/from-york-to-hong-kong/'],0.04335322231054306,0.5339545011520386,0.02411917969584465
247,York,2020-10-29,journal_data/txt/York/2020_10_29.txt,"[""LSD, less commonly known as lysergic acid diethylamide, has gained a reputation throughout the years as somewhat of a “hippie drug,” allowing its users to “expand their consciousness” and experience the world through a lens they would otherwise never be able to.\nAs time has gone on, and the stigma around it has lessened, we have been able to learn more about LSD and psychedelics in general.\xa0\n“LSD makes you feel really in touch with the world; I’d consider it a spiritual journey. But it can definitely also make you think too much, and just be in your own head,” says Allen Rotger, a fourth-year economics student.\xa0\nModern day pundits such as Joe Rogan have emphasized that psychedelics make him “more compassionate, more aware, more vulnerable.” And Steve Jobs, the late founder of Apple, was even quoted as saying that taking LSD was one of the most profound experiences of his life.\xa0\nAnd now, science has something to say about the drug as well. A study published this past August set out to discover the effects of taking very small doses of LSD (a phenomena now known as microdosing) in relation to productivity, depression, and other mental health issues. These aspects were investigated after long standing anecdotal reports.\xa0\nThe study gave 27 volunteers a placebo, as well as actual LSD, on separate days while monitoring their brain-derived neuropathic factor (BDNF) blood plasma levels every two hours.\xa0\nThe study found that at a dose of five micrograms of LSD, BDNF increased and peaked after four hours, while 20 micrograms also saw an increase with a peak time of six hours.\xa0\nWhat exactly is BDNF, you may ask? Tya Vine, second-year medical student at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine with a BSc in neuroscience, sheds some light on the subject.\n\xa0 “The research was conducted on healthy volunteers, so I think much more research, including potential clinical trials on patients with mental illnesses, would be needed before concluding that microdosing LSD could be considered a form of treatment for mental illnesses.”\n“BDNF is a growth factor that is important for brain development and maintenance. BDNF production and release is activity dependent, which means that properly functioning neurons produce more BDNF, which in turn maintains the healthy neuron and its synapses. It is important for both supporting the survival and health of existing neurons, as well as encouraging growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses,” says Vine.\xa0\nBDNF also plays key roles in learning, memory functioning,\xa0 and neuroplasticity — the capacity of our brain to rewire itself. This is fundamental to depression and neurodegenerative disorders like dementia, all of which are tied to a decrease in BDNF levels.\xa0\nSo, with all this research done and anecdotal stories recounted, does LSD really give its users any support when it comes to the busy workday or the distress of mental health issues? The answer is: maybe.\xa0\nIn the aforementioned study, a 10 microgram dose of LSD had no effect on BDNF levels, even though a five and 20 microgram dose did. This shows that our understanding of the way this substance behaves is still far from plain sailing.\xa0\nIn reviewing the study, Vine shared some potential changes that could be taken into account for future research.\xa0\n“The research mentioned in the article was conducted on healthy volunteers, so I think much more research, including potential clinical trials on patients with mental illnesses, would be needed before concluding that microdosing LSD could be considered a form of treatment for mental illnesses,” says Vine.\xa0\nThe study itself indicates that though results were promising, “new studies performed under modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge.”\nPositives and negatives aside, it is still important to keep in mind that the unauthorized consumption of LSD and most other psychedelics is still illegal in Canada.\xa0\nThe content in this article is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment; nor is it intended to promote, recommend, or endorse the use of this substance, or any other substances, in any way.\xa0\n \nShivam is a driven undergraduate Political Science student with a penchant for health, wellness, and communicating it to people.

For the first time ever, York will be offering remote global internships in Winter 2021. Several international universities have also made remote study options available for York students.\n“These are offered through our direct partner organizations, and they may or may not include a program fee — most of them do not,” said International Internships Assistant Natasha Pursun, at a Global Internships Q&A session. “The selection process is handled by both York International and the organization.”\nThese remote internships are three months long, and interested students can apply directly to York International. Short-term remote internships are also available and will be offered year-round through external providers.\xa0\nCurrent remote opportunities include fields like accounting, marketing, non-governmental organization (NGO) management, and conservation, in countries such as China, England, France, Japan, Portugal, and Peru.\nWhile these internships no longer provide students with a physical international work experience, they still retain the financial benefits. Students are eligible for a funding of up to $3,000 for these opportunities.\nDepending on the travel situation, there may still be some international opportunities available in summer 2021. However, they will not be hosted through direct partners like the remote opportunities.\n“These are organizations we’ve partnered with through faculty connections here at York,” said Pursun. “We reached out to faculty members here at the university and we asked them for any connections they had in the field, either working with other organizations or working with other universities.”\n\xa0 \xa0 “Obviously it was upsetting, having the trip cut off and flying home, but at the same time the situation was getting really scary in Europe, and Canada had it better under control in that sense.”\nIn terms of educational opportunities, many international universities have pivoted to virtual learning as well. While summer 2021 opportunities have yet to be posted, fall/winter virtual opportunities currently listed include the European studies program at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, and the Winter Abroad program at South Korea’s Yonsei University.\nFourth-year Schulich iBBA student Meena Shanmuganathan can speak to the benefits of her own exchange term this year: “I loved my exchange experience, it was a fantastic time. I really got to discover independence in a new country, in basically learning the language and everything I had to do there. I did get to travel alongside the South of France, I went to Aix-en-Provence on exchange.”\nHowever, Shanmuganathan’s experience was cut off early due to the onset of COVID-19. The time of her return marked the beginning of York’s overall transition to virtual international opportunities.\n“Obviously it was upsetting, having the trip cut off and flying home, but at the same time the situation was getting really scary in Europe, and Canada had it better under control in that sense,” she says.\xa0\n“It was definitely my first time travelling that long on a plane alone, and I travelled without my suitcases because I’d left them all in France. I flew straight home from London, kind of like an emergency flight.”\nWhile Shanmuganathan enjoyed her own in-person exchange, she still believes it’s worth it for those virtually studying abroad.\n“Of course I think exchange isn’t all just about the school you go to, it’s about learning to live in that environment with the locals as well. But the good thing is, I actually really like the virtual study tour opportunity, where I believe you get to meet other businesses or you get to meet people from different parts of the world, so it’s really eye-opening in that sense.”\n“Some of these schools are highly prestigious,” she adds. “To be able to say you studied from them, even virtually, is always going to be an asset for you on your resume.”\n \nSakeina Syed is a former Excalibur news editor, and remains a dedicated Excalibur reader. \n                \n\n York University Community Newspaper \n""]",['https://www.excal.on.ca/health/2020/10/29/microdosing-lsd-and-its-potential-effects-on-the-brain/'],0.36155736446380615,0.13317899405956268,0.23837003111839294
