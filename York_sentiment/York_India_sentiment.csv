12,York,2011-02-16,journal_data/txt/York/2011_02_16.txt,"['I happen to agree with him. You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. And why should you blame the officer? It’s your society which turns women into chattel by making a half naked woman sell a pepsi or sprite bottle. That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. Also, girls today dress like sluts so the whole lot of them take offense when someone tells it how it is. Kudos to you Officer.\nOf course the men are responsible who perpetrate this, but seriously, when they chose their victim I’m sure that they searched for someone who was eyecandy to them. They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.\nYou’re just as bad as him. You’re basically insinuating that ‘hindu or sikh or muslim’ women don’t experience sexual assault. You’re saying that men only want eye candy. You’re the one reducing women to their appearance anyway. What about mentally challenged women who are assaulted? Young girls?  You’re blaming women for men’s crimes. You are furthering ideas that men have uncontrollable urges and act on impulse rather than the fact that they have internatilized misogyny and feel the need to exert control over women due to their own insecurities about masculinity.\nI happen to know a lot of decent men who don’t believe that the way a woman is dressed gives you permission to do what you please with her. I also know of a lot of men who think they have that permission, regardless of the situation or your dress.\nEducate yourself. Stop being so ignorant. Your victim-blaming rhetoric is not needed here.\nVery well said.\nIt’s not that the victim is being blamed. You can’t change those around you so you should do everything you can to keep yourself save. I agree that people who are covered up also get raped but you try to optimize your security as much as you can… One way is to dress less provocative and make sure you are always around someone you trust when you are at a party and prevent being in unsafe areas. I think the officer used inappropriate words to say what i think he was trying to say or he could just be a really sick person who believes that it’s ok for men to do it if women dress the way they want to.\nI agree, if you leave your car keys in plain sight in your car it is more likely to be stolen. This logic can be transferred to the topic at hand  The officer simply made a suggestion without sugar-coating it and he got his point across.\ni dont think its about “blaming victims”. it’s about common sense. i think that’s what the officer’s intent was with his comment, though obviously it skirted sensitive territory.\nObviously, as a society we want to ensure all citizens are safe and that we all adhere to the social compact. but that’s not how the world works in reality. While it’d be wonderful to leave precious possessions laying about in plain view unattended, the expectation that we should be able to do this without having them stolen is delusional. That’s why we lock our doors.\nWomen should also realize that the officer’s intent here was to protect them, not to blame them. Like many fathers, brothers, boyfriends and husbands, men worry a great deal about the safety of the women and girls in their lives. And we know that in a society as hyper-sexualized as ours, that avoiding unwanted attentions often times means applying a conservative approach to how we present ourselves.\nSadly the rhetoric and anger surrounding this discussion does a disservice to the police and to the law abiding citizens. I think it’s a shame generally that we can’t seem to appreciate the nuances of coping with the dangers in life.\nOh, the old comparison to the common sense of locking our door because things get stolen. There are so many things wrong with this analogy.\nFirst, while leaving your doors unlocked makes it easier for someone to rob your house, dressing sexily does nothing to make it easier for someone to rape you. A woman in a long skirt is just as easy to force sex on than a woman in a short skirt, as is a woman in baggy jeans vs hot pants, as is a woman in a t-shirt vs a low-cut top. The clothes I wear do not make myself more or less able to defend against an assault, nor do they prevent me from taking other, more realistic safety precautions such as not being alone while out at night.\nSecond, all this rhetoric goes on the baseless assumption that the more attractively a woman dresses, the more likely it is a rapist will target her. This is simply not true. Rape is about power and is most often done when it is convenient, as most victims are raped by people they know or who already have some sort of power over them.\nThird, everyone seems to be forgetting that sometimes women dress provocatively because the DO want to attract attention – of the consentual kind. Blaming the woman for wanting to look attractive is like blaming a store owner for having such nice and expensive things in his store, after the store is subject to an armed robbery. Clearly the owner should cover up and hide all the nice things so no one wants to steal them.\nI completely agree. The part about clothes reminded me of the Italian judge who ruled in favor of the (alleged) rapist on the basis that women wearing jeans are physically impossible to rape.\nPeople seem to like telling women not to dress in sexy clothes, not to get drunk. Wish they’d turn that righteousness to telling men not to rape people.\nAre you suggesting that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women never get raped? Sadly they do. And many of them face ridiculous cultural laws in which the rape must have been witnessed by several MEN who are willing to testify on their behalf or they can’t even report it! Also, a shocking number of seniors are raped every year. So the statement that women dressed “respectably” or women that are not considered “attractive” do not fall victim to sex crimes is seriously seriously flawed.\nA while a woman who dresses up to go to a club may very well be there to pick up (just like the guys are) she still has the absolute right to decide who picks her up.\nI’ve never heard or read of Sikhs or Hindus having a law where male witnesses must have witnessed the rape to testify on behalf of the victim.\nFYI I am a Sikh and have lived for years at a time in Canada, India and the UK.\nActually in most western countries convicting a man of rape is difficult-this is reflected in the conviction rate for rape cases (Google it). So to suggest Sikh, Hindu and Muslim rape laws are so woefully inadequate compared to Canadian ones is unfair.\nAnd a women has the right, but how would she enforce it? This is an issue of ideals versus reality and the reality is men are physically stronger than women.\nRegardless of if you take self defense classes-9 times out of ten an average grown man could rape a women if he was so inclined.\nIts always smarter to avoid attracting unwanted attention anyway.\nI’m not saying women don’t have the right to dress how they wish or to dress attractively because after all most men enjoy seeing a beautiful women. But women should exercise common sense too!\nI think women need to realize that although the sexes are equal, that does not mean we are the same.\nYou’re basically saying that you do agree that women shouldn’t dress provocatively.\nCome on no one respects a women who picks random guys up at clubs or anywhere else.\nI don’t understand why some women don’t respect themselves more. Is it because your trying to emulate some men? Or is that just an excuse-I hear it sometimes ‘men sleep around and they are considered studs so why are women called sluts when they do the same?’ Well thats just a highly reductive and generalized statement that just comes as extremely stupid and not what most sensible people would expect from a university educated women!\nBecause believe me we are not all promiscuous.\nThis reflects a bigger problem with our generation we don’t value ourselves enough. Society is way too hyper sexualized (as someone else commented).\nAnyway students should spend more time studying and less time messing around at clubs and dressing sexy. Where are your priorities?\nFYI-\nPlease don’t make baseless ignorant generalizations. I am a self-identifying slut, and plenty of people respect me completely. Because many people are not sex-negative fuckwads.\nI like to have sex with people I like. It’s enjoyable, fun, good exercise, and generally makes my life more awesome. I am safe, use multiple birth control methods, and get tested regularly. How, exactly am I not respecting myself? I am doing what I choose when I choose with people I choose. I empower myself in my own sexuality rather than letting any societal construct dictate my actions.\nHowever, the most important thing here is that I CONSENT. No matter what the context, no matter what I’m wearing, who I’m with, where I am, I expect everyone to establish consent before having sex with me. I might be dressed sexily because I’m looking for sex, or not, but the way I dress NEVER implies that just anyone can have sex with me without consent. Nor does the way I dress render anyone incapable of making decisions for themselves about whether to rape me.\nYou are right about one thing and that is our society is hyper-sexualized, but only in that it glorifies sex WITHOUT putting the equal necessary effort into promoting consent work and sex-positivity. We make sex tantalizing without making it empowering. But we need to empower ourselves in our sexuality, not by slut-shaming, but by encouraging everyone to make intelligent, informed, consentual decisions about sex.\nAlso, in all my sluttitude, I got all A’s and B’s all four years at university. Explain to me what those exactly have to do with each other?\nHow dare you suggest that a woman leading a sexual life on her terms doesn’t respect herself.\n“a women”\nwhat\n“a university educated women”\nwhat\n“is way too hyper sexualized”\nredundant phrasing\nQuit school; Marry soon; Let party girls party. You give yourself too much credit and respect, and others too little.\nThank you for replying and yes very well said!  It’s sad that there is still such ignorance like that out there…\n…and oh it is Brittaney i agree with if that was unclear.\nSexual assault has nothing to do withthe way the victim is dressed but the sickness of the rapists mind! 80 year old women and little girls get assaulted too! dont make excuses for these sick bastards!\nThe problem is that this is being made into a women’s rights issue when it is broader than that.  For example, I should be able to walk through Regent Park at 3 AM carrying a clear briefcase filled with cash, but I wouldn’t because it would greatly increase the odds of attracting trouble.  This is an exaggerated example, but the point is valid.  Women should be able to dress as they please and go where they please, when they please, but there are people with no respect for the law or other people.  The common sense solution is to avoid drawing their attention.  It doesn’t make it right, but too many people are in here arguing that women should be able to dress as they please and not be sex objects, when no one actually disagrees with that.\nThe cop chose a poor word, and everyone has keyed in on that word, but his point is valid.  You should be able to dress as you please, but in an area where there is a history of sexual predation, you have to adapt and take precautions.  The vast majority of men who respect the law and the rights of women are not your issue here.\nYou are one of the biggest idiot douchebags I have ever read but I guess thats the downfall of the internet, you have to read the opinions of people who think they actually know something about a highly complex topic- that of gender, misogyny and politics. Get educated before you open your mouth. You seem to know nothing about which you are speaking of and you look like a fool. I HATE people like you.\nYou discredit your own argument as lacking intelligence by engaging in ad hominim attack. Your comment adds absolutely nothing to the conversation.\nI agree with and am delighted at your rage and indignation — but I have to interject at “downfall of the internet.” Such a phrase suggests that the internet was ever “up” to begin with; i.e. that it was ever used as an outlet for anything more than toxic opinions amplified by anonymity, moronic acronym-and-emoticon-based “conversation,” and porn. Sorry for interrupting, thanks for listening.\nWow. Way to go buddy. Misogyny and racism at it’s best/worst, right there. Do you really think that rapists care what a woman is wearing? Women who are dressed conservatively get raped, too. The only thing a woman can do to avoid being raped is to not get raped. Seriously, next time, educate yourself before you decide to put your two cents in.\nI was raped while wearing an ankle-length dress with a high neck and long sleeves.  I had NOTHING showing.  The only person responsible for rape is the RAPIST.  PERIOD.  Rape is not about sexual attraction, it’s about power and hatred of women.  Educate yourself before you open your mouth.\nBullying and murder are about power and control, rape is about satiating one’s lust for sex. Power and control over the victim just happens to be the method used to satiate said lust. Have you ever heard of a rapist raping someone he couldn’t overpower? That NEVER happens.\nYou don’t have to dress provocatively to be raped, but rape is one of only three ways to satiate sexual lust. The remaining two methods are consensual sex, and masturbation. If you can think of a fourth method, please, let me know so that I will know too.\nJoe, please tell me you’re being sarcastic.\nHow is it that you profess to know so much about the underlying causes of rape? Should I assume that you’ve being researching rape statistics and studying the psychology of rapists for the last 20 years?\nOr have you raped before? Did you commit such a horrible crime just so you could get off? Because to be honest, I don’t know a single man or woman who would rape someone, who would put another human being through the terrible hell of sexual assault and rape, just so they could get laid.\nAnd to anyone on this post who DARES to suggest that women are raped because of what they’re wearing, how they’re acting, if they’re flirting or not, or if they’re “asking for it,” then how do you explain that 1 in every 3 women in the US army is raped?\nFor more information: http://www.stopmilitaryrape.org/\nhttp://newsjunkiepost.com/2010/01/26/13rd-of-women-in-us-military-raped/\nMy apologies. I tried to find Canadian statistics, but to no avail. Instead, I have an anecdote. A friend of mine just came back from doing a tour in Afghanistan (she’s Canadian Forces). One day, her commanding officers had a meeting with all the females in camp. They gave the women a little whistle, and told the women that if they were ever attacked by a man, to blow the whistle for help. A f&%ing whistle? Really? Canadian Forces can’t do better and maybe find ways to deter potential perpetrators?\nBut you don’t need a Phd to figure the reasoning behind a statement such as ‘dressing a little less provocative’.\nYou are a women and as such you will never understand how men think irrespective of how much education you have-its experience versus sitting in an ivory tower. Some men are nice as pie, where as some may appear nice on the outside and yet be very evil minded on the inside (e.g. Ted Bundy).\nIn war a lot of the rules in civilian peace time society are thrown out-this happens regardless of the Geneva Convention and is a sad reality.\nI think we seriously need to bring women down to earth-you are not the same as men (yes, you are of course equal I’m not disputing that!). Men can be brutal towards one another-how the hell do you think you will stand up to that? (Unless you are some sort of Martial Arts expert).\nThe fact that someone would call this “Fair Game” is sickening.\nA woman has the right to dress however she chooses. Whether she chooses to show skin, or cover herself should not affect the fact that any sexual assault is fully the responsibility of the perpetrator.\nIt seems to be a typical defense response to call a woman a whore or to imply that she was “asking for it”.\nThis post says that “of course the men are responsible”, yet it is said that by choosing unrevealing clothing then a woman is less likely to be assaulted, putting responsibility in the hands of the victim.\nI guess I’d better start wearing a parka at all times so that no men will see my body and be driven into a sexual frenzy… don’t want to get myself attacked or anything…\nIt’s a shame that people still hold these misogynist ideas in Canada in 2011, you’d think we’d be past this.\nWhat a disgusting and misogynistic human being you are. It is people like you and comments like the one you’ve made that have created and sustained a patriarchal rape culture. As a Muslim woman who is a survivor of rape, I can tell you that having your body covered has NOTHING to do with why sexual violence occurs. Sexual violence is about POWER AND CONTROL, not the clothes you wear, and not about being “eye candy”. The comments that you and the police officer have ignorantly made do nothing except re-victimize and re-traumatize victims of sexual violence, and do NOTHING to put blame or punishment upon the individuals who perpetrate such monstrous crimes. Please get yourself a REAL EDUCATION while you are at York, and never make such hateful, disgusting, shameful comments about women who have survived sexual violence again. I am disgusted to go to school with a human being as deplorable as you. May you NEVER have to feel like a survivor of sexual violence and be blamed for the lifelong trauma and horror you experience.\nAnecdote is not an appropriate means to determine if fully covered women experience less sexual assault than sluts.\nIt does prove one instance of its occurrence on a fully covered woman, however, which is more than some are willing to admit is a possible situation. In addition, you have proffered no valid research demonstrating the contrary, instead hoping that your simplistic refutation of an assertion will lead others to believe that its opposite is true.\nFair Game, you are completely right. In the history of the world, a hindu/sikh/muslim woman has NEVER EVER been raped. Women, if you don’t want to get raped, stop being “eyecandy” to men. You should always think of possible rapists while getting dressed and going outside. In fact, why do women even bother going outside? Sure, you could dress conservatively to ward off rapist, but you might accidentally smile seductively or brush your hand against your breast- things that will lure the rapist and force him to rape you.\nI’m actually confused why a woman is Assistant Dean of the JD program. Are they even allowed to vote??\nMarry me…\nA women has a right to wear whatever she wants without fearing sexual assault. Are you actually suggesting that before leaving her house a women is supposed to consider if she looks like an “eye candy” to some sociopath or a pervert with no self restraint? You should be deeply ashamed of yourself, especially for putting the word “freedoms” together with the garbage you wrote.\nSo by your reasoning their are no rape victims in muslim countries that force women to cover themselves from head to toe.  What planet are you from, because you surely aren’t  from this one.\nWhat?! What’s like saying that children who have suffered from sexual assault deserve it.  Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts, and telling girls not to as a step of sexual assault is bound to make victims uncomfortable.  Victim =/= enabler in most cases like this.\nIf your mom was sexually assaulted, do you think you would say “well, were you dressed like a slut, mom?” Or do you think it’d maybe be best just to assign the blame where it belongs (hint: not with the victim) and be supportive.\n“Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts”\nyou suck just as much as the person you are replying to .\nIt is abominable that someone would ever have this opinion, as it is exactly this type of ignorance and misogyny that breeds the sense of entitlement which feeds behaviors such as sexual assault.  Rape is a war crime; not because a whole village, city, or country is filled with women who are ‘asking for it’ by dressing provocatively, but rather, because rape is about POWER.  Even more disgusting is the fact that you seem to think that women who dress in a way that covers their bodies don’t get raped. Rape is one of the many things a man can use to wield his physical power over a woman (and a man or a child, by the way), so in case you missed the last fifty years, women are people now too. Idiot.\nits not just females that can be raped.  I was raped as far as the topic im sorry i have to agree with something 9 times out of 10 it is the women that dress provocative that males rape.  It does make me sick to my stumach that this happens though.  i do have a heart.  I know 3 females that have been raped and one mail that was raped and thats me.\nAnd you didn’t deserve it, even though you’re an asshole. Were you dressed like a slut? That doesn’t make it your fault.\nAmen sister or brother!  Thank you “Winter”!\nI just want to add that thinking the way “Fair Game” does is still universal amongst many societies.  I was teaching English in Japan in 2001.  We threw a party for one of my roommates. That night a foreigner attending the party slipped me the date rape drug.  Even though, I’m pretty sure that I wasn’t actually rapped per se he did have his way with me.  I remember bits and pieces.  He by the way was a fellow English teacher and not a Japanese citizen.  I did end up reporting the crime at the hospital and little did I know, police then become automatically involved.  The reason I bring this up is that amongst all the stuff I was going through at the time, the police while investigated made me find the clothes that I was wearing at the party that night.  At the time, and for a moment the act of photographing my clothes made me feel like I had asked for it.  Now of course I know better.  Making women feel like it is their fault due to their dress really does re-victimize the victim.\nActually, the statistics show that a woman’s appearance and pattern of dress have absolutely NOTHING to do with her risk of being sexually assaulted by a male.  Muslim women DO get sexually assaulted. Older women DO get sexually assaulted.  Little girls DO get sexually assaulted.  Moreover, the majority of male-perpetrated sexual assaults against women take place in the HOME.  I can wear baggy sweat pants on the street AND in the home, and statistically, it will do absolutely nothing to ‘protect’ me.  Perpetrators are responsible for choosing violence.  Believing otherwise is sexist ignorance.\nSo Fair Game:\nLet me get this straight… what you’re saying is that:\na. Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women (which by the way, all of whom apparently dress “traditionally”) do not get raped because they are covered up.\nb. Only hot girls get raped. No one else gets sexually assaulted.\nI would normally suggest that someone as ignorant as you pick up a book or a newspaper, but I’m not sure that even that could save you. I would site some statistics about the sadly high number of women that get raped in all different countries of all different religions and demographics, or even explain to you that a woman has the right to dress how she wants without being sexually assaulted, no matter how provocative it is, or even question what a slippery slope your argument is– next you’ll be saying that if a woman has a drink or two, she’s also “asking” to be raped. But it’s not worth my breath. If you truly believe a woman who shows some skin is apparently “fair game” for sexual assault, as you put so repulsively in your pathetic attempt to be clever, you are ignorant beyond repair. Making excuses for those who would sexually assault innocent women, no matter how they are dressed, is lower than low.\nAs if infants, the elderly, and women in proper hijab aren’t raped every day.\nNice work, Mr. Troll.\nYou’re a pig. Sexual assault should never be the storm cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim, especially a woman, looks like.\nThat’s not true. You can be wearing jeans and t-shirt with nothing revealing and you could still be a victim. If the community start thinking that victims are usually “sluts” as you put… the victim (who is already going through hell for what has happened to her) will start thinking that she is disgusting and blame herself for what happened.\nThere are people out there that think the victim was probably dressed “slutty” and got what they deserve. It’s those kind of thinking that make victims try to hide what happened because THEY will be viewed as “disgusting” by the community and NOT the perpetrator.\nPlease understand that it is NOT the victim’s fault. No matter how they are dressed. Why should the victim get condemned by the society for being a victim? Is it their fault? They dressed to impress not to imply that they want to be sexually harassed.\nTruly an idiotic comment. There is absolutely no excuse for rape and what a woman is wearing is nobody elses business. Muslim and Sikh women are raped regardless of dress. It’s not a question of clothing but of mens attitudes, such as the one you voiced. Is there a set of conditions that makes it justifiable to violate a persons physical autonomy? The comment has a very wide range of implications and all of them are negative towards women and victims of crime. There is always an excuse by the perpetrators to try to justify their actions.\nI think If you were to dress less like a ‘slut’  you might actually decrease your chances at getting raped. How hard is that for you feminazis to understand?\nSee my response to Fair Game.  It applies to you as well.\n@Feminism stinks, Sometimes, people have a hard time understanding things that don’t make sense. Let me educate you:\nUtah State University Sexual Assault and Anti Violence Information:\nMyth: Rape victims provoke the attach by wearing provocative clothing.\nA Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only\n4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior on the part\nof the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple\nas a glance).\nMost convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.\nVictims range in age from days old to those in their nineties,\nhardly provocative dressers.\nUtah State University\nhttp://www.usu.edu/saavi/pdf/myths_facts.pdf\nI fail to see how not wanting to blame victims for the actions of the perpetrator of a crime, when statistics don’t suggest that “not dressing like a slut” helps, makes one a “feminazi.”\nI’m pretty sure my niece could never force someone to assault her, so I guess I must be a feminazi.\nI read in the news about elderly women who got repeatedly sexually assaulted by the same perpetrator who would break into the home in the middle of the night.\nYea, shame on those sexy grannies who are seducing men into committing rape!\n@Feminismstinks: please do the world a favor and REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS PLANET IN THE FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY!  may I recommend walking off a bridge?\nFirstly, women are raped regardless of what they’re wearing.  Secondly, stop placing blame onto women.  No one WANTS to get raped.  Wearing a certain outfit is not an invitation to rape me.  Fuck off.\ni agree that it would help however is not a solution and proper security would go a lot farther then longer hem lines.\nare you ill ? who doesn’t know that rape has nothing to do with sex, it’s about power and humiliation. are you saying that women who don’t dress like “sluts” never get raped ? or women that people may not deem “attractive” ? did you know that 45% of rape victims were assaulted by their partners, compaired to only 8% who were assaulted by strangers ? this makes it hard for me to think that women are raped because of the way they dress.\nyou said yourself that images of half naked women are used to sell products and this is half the problem. society objectifies women into nothing more than sex objects WHEREEVER YOU LOOK. and opinions like this do not make it any better.\no_0\nAnd what exactly does “getting treated like a slut” mean to you? Getting raped? Sorry to point out the obvious, but even sluts aren’t out to get raped, they are out to have consensual sex. A man is not some kind of wild animal species that can’t control its urges when it sees a short skirt. Also, rape is usually not about “eye candy” but about asserting power over the victim. And victims are often not “slutty”-looking girls, they can be anyone from your daughter to your grandmother. Your comment is ridiculously asinine and ignorant. Hope nobody you care about ever gets attacked.\nYou do know that women in traditional clothing get raped all the time, right? The more “traditional” a society, the higher its incident of rape (including marital rape), and IN ADDITION to the higher incidents of rape these women are actively discouraged from seeking justice. You have a serious problem. How about teaching men NOT to RAPE. Dick.\nIn the immortal words of Antoine Dodson, “You are so dumb.  You are really dumb.  For real.”\nOther commenters have eloquently covered all the reasons why you are so dumb.  That is all.\nOh I love that song!!!\nand it certainly applies to all rapists and rapist supporters!\nOh, of course you are right.\nAnd, if you are robbed, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought stuff that someone might want.  If you are carjacked, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought a car.   If any other crime happens to you, it must be your fault for having something the criminal might want.\nThis all makes perfect sense.\nWell Fair Game is completely right. I mean Hindu, Sikh or Muslim women are never raped. Western women only started showing more skin around the 1920’s and that’s right about the time that women started being raped. Coincidence? I think not. Thinking back to when I was raped at 17, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved sweater. Must of been asking for it right? If only I’d had a burka on to clearly indicate that I wasn’t interested in being held down and raped.  I never told anyone about it because I felt like it was somehow my fault. I felt ashamed. I shouldn’t of let myself be in that situation. The comments made by Fair Game and the officer are the reason so many women never come forward when sexually assaulted.  That officer should be fired. Fair Game, if you have any females close to you, try talking to them, chances are one of them has been sexually assaulted.  Ask your mother, your sister or friend if they were asking for it when it happened to them. Or then again, maybe you don’t have many females in your life that you’re close to. Wouldn’t that be a shock.\nYou’re an idiot. Men walk around showing skin all the time, no shirts, for example. What is a “slut”? Aren’t men the definition of the word? Also, you may want to look up rape victims–they are the elderly, they are the two year olds, they are the nine-year-old male, they are in prison. Get an education.\nYou do realize that Middle Eastern women who wear veils, abayas and burqas are also victims of rape? In fact, victims of rape in Middle Eastern countries are subject to public lashings and honor killings because they “shamed” their family by being the victim of a crime.\nRape isn’t about sex, it’s about controlling and humiliating another person. Men can be raped too, so can children and elderly women. What would you attribute that to? Slutty looking 5 year olds? Please.\nI feel sorry for anyone you know personally that is a survivor, because clearly you have no idea about the true psychological motivations of rape.\n@Fair Game, Rapists will rape people regardless of what they are wearing. No one asks or deserves to be raped. The only people responsible for rape are rapists and rape apologists like you.\nconsidering the fact that the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows (relative, friend, date etc.) I’m certain that when “they” chose their victim, it likely was not at random and probably had nothing to do with how she was dressed.\nin fact, dressing in a manner that exudes (and requires) confidence would probably deter a man from assaulting them.\nnothing a woman says, wears or does warrants being sexually assaulted.  it is a act of power and control that is perpetrated by someone who has neither.  it is a demeaning and shattering experience that no one asks for. and if you think for one moment, Fair Game, that Sikh, Muslim or Hindu women do not experience this kind of torture, you need to put down your excalibur and pick up a G and M.\nwow. check your privilege, asshole.\nhttp://sap.mit.edu/content/pdf/male_privilege.pdf\nthe definition of “slut” is so loose that it can apply to a woman who has had multiple sex partners, and to a 14 year old girl in a short skirt.\nwhat the crappy thing is, women are judged on EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR PERSONALITIES. a woman is not a slut for enjoying sex or wearing revealing clothing that is not always worn to attract others, but to make the woman feel good.\nrape and sexual assault are ALWAYS initiated by the presence of a rapist. the woman (and sometimes men are raped too! think about that!) is NEVER asking for unwanted sexual advances.\nyou sir, can fuck off.\nEven though I didn’t have sex (of any kind) until I was 19, I was labeled a slut in middle school just for having large breasts, which were always covered by baggy t-shirts.\nI totally agree with you on this one, girls who want to dress in a certain “sluttish”  way, they have to pay for the consequences. 5/5!\n“The way a woman dresses or acts does not cause or prevent sexual assault; an attacker rapes someone because they want to exert power and control over him or her. The attacker is solely responsible for the crime. However, this responsibility is lost in translation through the police, the courts and the media.”\nfrom: Don’t Rape (http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/3497)\nCurl up and die please. You’ll do everyone a favour.\nSince when is the onus on women to make men behave like gentlemen? If you can’t keep your pants zipped, YOU have the problem, not the victims!!\nRape is more often than not, an act of dominance.  Sociopathic individuals will commit rape to assert dominance and inflict harm on an individual because that aspect is sexually arousing to them; they do not usually rape someone based on how that person is dressed.  On the contrary, rapists generally look for someone who has low self-esteem (no confident, sexy outfit?) and may not put up much of a fight.\nYeah only the issue is the disgusting and unacceptable crime of the perpetrator, not their sexual preference. Implying that a woman is somehow deserving of sexual assault because of what she wears implies that the crime AGAINST LAW of sexually assaulting someone can be justified. Any grown man that is rational and worth a trial can presumably control his sexual inclinations around a girl in revealing clothing.\nFair Game is a troll.\nTo call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.  Clearly, what you said is a reflection of what and how much you know about our society.  First of all, sexual violence has NOTHING to do with sex.  It is about POWER, HATRED AND VIOLENCE against another human being.  Second of all, to say “wouldn’t choose a Hindu, Sikh or a Muslim because they are covered in traditional clothing” is an absolute horrible thing to say.  Fair Game, go educate yourself about violence and please keep your comments about our society problems to yourself.  Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.\nTo call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.

Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.\nIt’s sad to know that there are people out there that concludes that women who dresses provocatively are “asking” for this type of crime to happen to them.  One does not have to dress like a “slut” in order to be raped.  The responsibility lies in the fact that our society needs to educate people of all cultures about violence.  It is disappointing that a police officer, someone whom you think that will serve and protect you and your city would lower himself to a comment like that.\nStupid troglodyte!\nSome years ago I was raped by a man I considered to be one of my closest friends, in my own home, while clad in a decidedly unsexy sweatsuit and bunny slippers. The only thing making me attractive to the bastard was my gender, my trust and my availability.\nhey so if I think you’re dressed like a douchebag I should get to beat you up, right? After all, it’s YOUR fault for asking for it! You’ve got the face and clothing of a douche just begging to get beat up!\nfirst of all, you’re disgusting. Secondly if you dress in a way that I decide is “slutty” I suppose you’d be okay with it if I violently destroyed you too. I dress how I want to because it makes me happy, I shouldnt have to hide myself because people like you can’t control yourself. I hope you never have to experience the horrors of rape but if you do maybe you’d finally shut the hell up\nHey, little boys get raped by priests. INFANTS get raped by sick men.  Hell, animals get raped by sickos. I guess they ALL asked for it.\nHow dare that cute baby wear nothing but a diaper?  I guess it’s rape time!\nDON’T APOLOGIZE FOR RAPISTS! the only one at fault is the rapist!!!\nYou’re a troll.  Wise up, people.\nyour comment made me so angry!\nso i guess that its your fault if i (fill in the blanks) you!\nyou have some serious problems…\nYou’re absolutely right. Because no woman wearing a burqa has ever been sexually assaulted.\nFair Game: I know I shouldn’t feed the trolls here (read: you) but I’m going to anyway because I have nothing better to do.\nA) What does it mean to “dress like a slut?”  Is it the showing of skin that makes you think she must have too much sex (which is what I assume you mean by “slut,” a woman who has more sex than you deem appropriate)?  Or is it the too-much-sex issue itself?\nB) Calling a woman a slut is silly, because what constitutes a slut varies depending on the perspective of the person doing the slut-shaming, but worse than silly, it’s a means of silencing the legitimate concerns of women.  Women are called sluts for what they wear (even if they’re virgins,) they’re called sluts if they have monogamous sex with one partner (if they’re the wrong person,) they’re called sluts if they have the audacity to have had multiple partners BY CHOICE.  None of these things make it ok for that person to be raped.  Women aren’t “asking” to be raped if they dress in revealing clothing.\nC)Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women, along with women of every ethnicity and religion around the world are raped daily, regardless of what they wear.  One reason this is allowed to continue is because of the prevailing views that rape is the fault of the victim and not of the rapist.  When a woman gets raped, every sexual experience she’s ever had, her clothing, whether or not she chose to imbibe that evening, and whether or not she chose to go somewhere alone, are all dragged up and used against her.  None of these things have any bearing on her rape- whoever she chose to have sex with in the past has no bearing on this rapist.  As a matter of fact, whether she’s had consensual sex with the rapist in the past has no bearing- anybody has a right at any time, regardless of sexual history, to not give consent to engage in sexual activity, and the only one to blame for the ensuing rape is the rapist.\nYou’re right. about the last part. it’s the perpetrator who is at fault, not the woman. it’s not the woman’s fault the perpetrator is a raging sociopath.\nwhat an incredible double standard. society love women that dress like “sluts.” we see it everywhere, from movies to commercials to ads, all to appeal to the male gaze. but it’s immediately jumped to as an excuse for rape.\nnot to mention, a very small percentage of rape is the “stranger in the bushes on the wrong side of town at night.” Most rapes happen in the victim’s or rapist’s home and they almost always know eachother.\nyou’re an idiot.\nAttitudes like this do nothing to dispel the problem. Women (and men and transgender folk) of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, levels of intelligence, and physicalities experience rape. Research has largely indicted that rapists are not necessarily attacking others due to an insatiable sex drive, but because it’s a way to exert control. Instead of victim-blaming, perhaps we should focus our energies into educating people to not become rapists. I, for one, feel that the officer’s suggestion only perpetuates the attitude that it’s up to the potential victims to avoid getting raped, rather than that it’s a person’s responsibility not to rape.\nIn no way is a woman responsible to dressing to deter rape. This is nothing but victim blaming and as  a social worker who worked with victims of sexual assualt I can assure you that the women who are assaulted are of all shapes/sizes and appearances. It has little to do with sex and more to do with power and control of another person.\nWomen get raped often in more nylon countries where the burkas or niquabs are mandatory so your assumption is inherently wrong.\nWhile I agree with your views about the current objectification of women in our society, I completely disagree that the way in which she dresses means that she is a justified target of sexual assault. I’m sorry, but no.\nA woman has the absolute, undeniable right to walk down the streets of Toronto completely naked without having someone assault them. A woman has the right to walk around dressed head-to-toe in full snow gear without being sexually assaulted.\nPoint is, no matter what a woman is wearing, now matter how much or how little she is wearing, she has a right to not be sexually assaulted.\nPerhaps she invites people to treat her with a certain attitude (ie. treat her like a slut) if she dresses in such a fashion, but in NO WAY is that an excuse for her to be violated. No way, no how.\nI was raped when I was asleep in my bed, where I SHOULD have had every reason to feel safe. Obviously you don’t know shit about this subject, women in every manner of clothing and every situation get raped. It doesn’t matter what you where you where you are, the rapist is the one who did wrong.\nActually there’s nothing to prove that. Most rapists know their victim. What she chooses to wear on any given night has nothing to do with the attack. In fact, some rapists will even target women who dress more conservatively. Women in burkas are raped all the time. As are women in long skirts, fatigues, jumpsuits, ballroom dresses, shorts, pajamas ratty bathrobes and curlers. Furthermore, the term “slutty” can mean different things. To some people it means nothing but boots and to others it means visible wrists. Telling a group of women that they can avoid rape by not dressing slutty even aside from the fact that it’s a huge insult doesn’t add anything constructive. There is nothing a woman can wear that wouldn’t be considered provocative by someone. Responsibility needs to be shouldered by those responsible. A victim of rape is not a slut. They are a victim.\nFair Game, I know rape is scary and not something you want to face, but it’s cowardly to blame the victim. And if a guy really can’t get any without raping or can’t control his impulses, then he probably is not mentally equipped to be having sex in the first place. That’s his problem. It’s not the victim’s fault and I think it’s a little weird that you would side with such a loser.\nSorry, Fair Game, sexual assault is not a crime of passion, but one of violence. Read the research; all types of women, including fully covered women and women in their 80’s are assaulted on a regular basis. Stop trying to blame the victim.\nI agree.  These canadian women are dressing too much vulgar.  In india, women are more traditional and we do not have such things.  but here i seeing many women dressing like sluts (not that i am wanting to complain).  at school, indian girls are dressed conservative and theyr not experience rape but other girls who dressing vulgar and showing body are teasing people.  police man said a good point in my opinion.\nCan you explain why old women in nursing homes have been raped by male nurses?\nOr why children are raped?\nI seriously doubt elderly women or children “dress like sluts”. And saying Hindu,Sikh and Muslim women wouldn’t be raped? Please explain why thousands Hindu and Muslim women who actually *report* being raped to authorities never receive any justice?\nI guess those ladies traditional clothing was just too….ah, traditional? And that is why they were raped?\nI guess I’m just too much of an ignorant woman to understand any of this.\nI am deeply disturbed by this line of thinking. By your point of view, I (a human being, as well as a woman) should be blamed for the choices and actions of others whom I have absolutely no control over, because of how much fabric is covering my body! Does this not seem outrageous to say the least? If you were to leave your house carrying a wallet and there is some indication that that wallet is presently on your body, does that give someone the right to steal it? If someone were to tell you that it’s not the pickpocket’s fault, because you enticed him by taking the wallet out of your pocket to pay for whatever it is you buy, would that be acceptable by your standards?\nThis makes me sick to my stomach. Men are not treated in this fashion, so what in this world that you seem to live in gives you the right to judge women like this?\nFYI: sexual assault is a crime of power, control and violence, not because the assailent is so turned on they have to sexually assault someone and people who observe religious conduct by covering themselves also are victims of sexual assault you are an ignorant person who has no idea what you’re talking about.\nI am always amazed how victim blaming can be so one sided… Would you ever blame a victim of a hold-up? What about of a car-jacking? A break and enter? Of course not, it is patently absurd; however, if police officers have the ignorance to blame rape survivors then they should also hold these other groups partially responsible in motivating their own attacks:\nPerhaps the man who is robbed for his rollex should be held accountable. He dared to ‘show-off the goods’ (ie: his material wealth) and so he should expect to be robbed… right?\nWhat about the old lady driving the $100 00.00+ luxury vehicle? She deserves to be car-jacked. How could she drive around in a car like that and expect not to be car-jacked?\nWhat about the nice couple who worked hard and bought their dream home? Should they be held accountable when they are victims of a home invasion or burglary?\nIf we take the same logic offered by this Toronto officer than it follows that he would recommend that all these other groups should avoid wearning expensive jewellery,driving nice cars, and owning nice homes in order to be less likely to be victims of robbery, car-jacking, and burglary. OF COURSE THIS IS ABSURD!!!! THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE IGNORANCE AND MISOGYNY INHERENT IN BLAMING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. USE YOUR BRAINS PEOPLE…\nYou are completely wrong, most rape victims are introverted, slightly desperate looking, who are alone, rapists dont go for confident people, they are scavengers that look for easy prey like cowards… only really charismatic sexual predetors/cereal killers go for pretty/slutty confident girls but they have a certain something they are looking for….\nthose cereal killers will Trix you, Corn Pop you in the kneecap, rob you of your Life, and all the witnesses will be able to say is “I didn’t get a good look at his face, he just shot the guy and Bran.”\nI apologize to everyone who is nauseated by puns.\nI was going to say “I hope you never have daughters” but I’m almost more scared of what you’d teach your sons!\nRape is not a compliment, you fucking asshole.\nFair Game, show me the statistic that proves Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women “in their traditional clothing” are raped less than other women.\nYou show a lack of understanding of sexual assault and society in general. You express racist and sexist idealogies. The majority of rapists do not even remember what their victim was wearing. Your comments are uneducated and offensive to both men and women. You imply that men cannot control their minds and bodies, you demean women young and old. Women should not have to fear violence and degredation. Think of your mother, sister or daughter – if she walked down the street naked and was raped could you tell her to her face that she ‘deserved’ sexual violence? The only people who can stop rape are rapists.  Nothing a human being wears, says or does justifies sexual assault.\nYou’re an idiot. By your logic if some pervert that’s into feet sees someone wearing open toed shoes he has the right to rape her? I don’t care if a woman is walking down the street naked, that doesn’t give anyone the right to sexually assault her. Just because *you* (or whoever) deems a woman a slut doesn’t make her so.\nHow DARE you, FairGame!\nI was drugged, and gang-raped by 6 men I trusted. I WASN’T drinking alcohol, I WASN’T at a club/party, and I WASN’T “dressed like a slut”.\nI was on a field trip, in front of a motel in the middle of the wilderness, at a bonfire. I was dressed in sweats and a sweatshirt. How does that scream: “Rape me! I’m slutty!” I’m not even that good looking, and I’m certainly not afraid to admit that! I’m not one of your Top Models, nor do I dress sexy.\nI was raped because I’m an independent woman and I don’t conform or allow myself to be peer-pressured or manipulated into doing things. They saw me as a challenge, but knew my character enough to know that I would fight them, tooth and nail, if they tried anything. Which is why they drugged me. Made it easier for them to violate me.\nYou’re a misogynistic pig! I bet you hate women–which must mean you like men. If you like men that much, leave us women the hell alone and go back to that rock you’re living under. Sure, you’ll have to look for a little while, because it’s back in the Dark Ages.\nWhile I agree that many women dress too provocatively, that has NOTHING to do with rape.  I was definitely NOT “eye candy” when I was raped; I am overweight and dress to hide it!  Some people are just sick, whether it is a man or a woman attempting the rape.\nHey fair game it is a womens god given right to dress how ever the fuck she pleases.  What kind of man are you that you don’t like to see women in provacative clothing?\nNot everything the police or the government feed you is right.  Go on thinking that you fucking drone.  OBEY, SLEEP, CONSUME, REPEAT.  Follow those orders and you’l be a model citizen\nDear Fair Game,\nWhat does it mean exactly to be ‘dressed like a slut’? Even if you were somehow able to come up with a clear cut definition, what gives you the right to determine it for the rest of society? Moreover, does getting ‘treated like a slut’ entail sexual assault – are you advocating that those who dress ‘like sluts’ ought to be sexually assaulted? This is absolutely unacceptable, and quite a dangerous comment; what’s next, telling women they shouldn’t wear high-heels because they will get sexually assaulted?\nFurthermore, as Canadians, we all share this society – no matter what religion, gender, and race you are from. Surely, in the 21st century, we have all come to realize the importance of the freedoms and civil liberties we enjoy; to shoot them down, and argue – in your case – for something that is completely a matter of personal taste is not only appalling, but quite barbaric. I certainly agree that our society has problems, and you are correct in pointing out how the media portrays women in advertisements, and how sex appeal is used to sell goods in the market – but that is an entirely separate issue, for which sexual assault victims should NOT be blamed – It simply has nothing to do with them.\nWhat could you possibly mean by ‘the evil terrorists’? Surely you are not implying that those who perpetrate sexual assault are terrorists; as wrong, and as guilty, as both activities are, they are simply not related. Please take care to understand the different terms, the motivations lying behind such activities, and the purposes for which they are conducted.\nIn addition, when an officer of the law – whose job it is to protect citizens, prevent crimes, and arrest criminals – is taking part in a safety information session, he is not representing his own person,  personal values, nor his personal moral outlook on society; he is representing the Toronto Police Department. As such, his flagrantly misogynistic, sexist, and simply revolting opinions should be kept to himself, until such time that he is no longer representing a public security organization, whose aim is to protect individuals, not punish the victim of crimes.\nLastly, if you took care to read, and study about such phenomena, you would understand that they dynamic that underlies sexual assault is not at all similar to what you have described. Please take care to become more informed, because your utter arrogance and ignorance can only assume the role of a burden for a fine society such as our own.\nrape is wrong. even if she dressed like a ‘slut’, a ‘slut’ is  NOT asking for rape, she is asking for consensual sex (and to be paid for it).\nIt seems as if sluts don’t believe in personal responsibility. These poor cops have to deal with sluts who refuse to grow up: http://goo.gl/ODyno\nLet’s address a few of your comments. Let’s pay attention to all victims not just the one’s you may secretly covet. Are you saying elderley woman are eye candy? Little boys are eye candy? In fact there is absolutely no correlation between rape/ molestation and what the victim is wearing! I have stats to back this up. Do you honestly belive Hindu, sikh & muslim women are not sexually abused?!! It’s just not reported because those women would be blamed & punished for it. In many middle eastern countries its legal for a man to rape his wife! Are you excusing a violent act & abuse of power? Is that not like saying his car deserved to be stolen because he drives a BMW? That house deserves to be broken into & robbed because they have a nice tv? Rape/molestation are NEVER the victims fault!! It doesn’t matter what they wear/drink, which family member/uncle/teacher the trust or where they walk/work! The criminal is crossing a line & violating someone else because they are selfish, immature, have no control, have no honor, have a corrupt religion etc. Perhaps what you’re saying is that if you’re to choose a victim you would go for eye candy? You threatened, frightened & are not able to handle sexy women as your equal so that would make perfect sense. (It’s often about control & power issues not about sex.) I may not agree with the use of women in advertising in N.America but I’m glad I am free to dress & express myself as I wish. My final thought: Sex should be enjoyable, sacred, spiritual, sensual, fun and CONSENTUAL for both partners. I hope for your partners sake that you at least come to accept that. Women have just as much right as men to find pleasure in their sexuality without fear or rape.\nrape is a war tactic, all who take part in it are therefore barbarians. people were raping before there was such a thing as “dressing like a slut”-and hindu, sikh, and muslim women get raped every day. is you support rape-and you do, according to what you’ve written (no bs one-line disclaimer at the end can hide that, just as no burqa can hide a woman from a rapist) than you are a moron, and anyone who is not blatantly against rape is FOR the metaphorical rape of his own people (rape historically was inflicted upon women with full knowledge that to destroy an entire group, one must destroy the women which are the core).\nRape is not about being turned on, nor is it about pepsi. It is about inflicting power upon another human being. It has nothing to do with outfits that turn people on-if it did, than cops would be raped all the time.\n“Fair Game”, I am a Hindu and grew up in Mumbai. I wore ‘decent’ Indian clothes – salwar kameezes, fully covered my arms, legs & the rest of my body – except my face. I was molested in public transport on a daily basis. Men would feel me up and stare & say lewd things.\nI am not the only one who faced this on a daily basis. Every girl I know who grew up in India and stepped out of her home was harassed.\nWill your next suggestion be to stay at home & avoid going out, if you’re a woman?\nYou’re an ignorant misogynist and a clueless privileged man who has never had to face the humiliation of being touched or treated inappropriately.\nHow about this phrase: “Men can avoid sexually assaulting women by not sexually assaulting women.”\n@Fair Game, “You can avoid acting like a misogynistic neanderthal by not acting like a misogynistic neanderthal”.\nLOL @ women getting sexually assaulted due to the way they dress. Nothing but ignorance and hate.\nYou’re right – women ask to be raped. WHAT AN IDIOT. It’s people like you who make it hard for victims to ever ask for help .\nSo why is it that men who walk around public parks bare chested, only shorts on aren’t asking to be “raped”?!\nWe are all human, In our country, in this day and age we still have a major double standard!!\nYeah, because women who dress in their traditional clothing never suffer violence from men, except for honour killings, and forced marriages to old men, and being executed in ‘traditional’ societies for being raped (because all they were was their cherry, so when you have garbage you might as well throw it away, right?) while their rapist(s) gets the lash. Of course no one commits incest where ‘traditional’ values rule. No one’s gay either. We’d know if anyone did or was because those societies are so frank and clear eyed about such things. Those societies are not founded on a retrograde and backward superstitious idiocy.\nand this is without getting into all the prepubescent girls who get raped, the old ladies who get assaulted, often in their own homes…\nno, its all about the sluts you miserable stupid arse.\nThere have been thousands of Muslim and Hindu women worldwide who have been raped.. covered or not. The amount of ignorance infused in your comment is the reason people give up on society. Do you really believe that only women showing skin get assaulted?\nIt’s people like you who have taught this officer and other impressionable public figures that it’s okay to generalize people like this. A whole lot of you seem to take offence when someone tells it how it is though, so I expect you to be pretty upset with me at the moment.\nTROLLLLLLLL!\nGet back under yer bridge where you belong!\nWell put… I also want to add that the officer isn’t implying that they deserve to be victims… Or that the perp shouldn’t be punished… He is simply stating that in order to avoid putting yourself in a situation of risk… Tone it down a little…. !  Much as a zookeeper might advise that you don’t strap a steak to your body and enter the lion cage!   Use your heads ladies….!\nSeveral women who were fully clothed have been brutally raped you fuck wit.\nRape is about control not women dressing in “slutty” outifts.\nWhat is your problem? women should be able to dress however they want?  They do not dress like sluts for men to rape them.\nAnd exactly, everyone dresses this way now, does that mean everyone deserves to be raped or assaulted?\nWhen making such ignorant comments think of your mother, sisters, nieces, grandmothers, etc.\nYou sir are a dumbass.  🙂\nAre you serious? I have dressed in very modest clothing all of my life. I thought not dressing provocatively and not going out at dark hours would leave me safe. Was I safe? NO!  I still ended up being sexually assaulted.\nI also completely agree with the cop. Matter of common sense, really.\nYou’re an idiot. My best friend was raped in her Marine Corps Mess uniform; she was covered in head to toe with her damned rank on her shoulder.\nYou owe every man on the planet an apology for being so insulting. Men are completely capable of controlling their sexuality. No real man needs to rape a woman because he thought her skirt was sexy. Sure women dress to attract mates ,as do men, it is not an invitation to take something that without consent. I’m sure you know that .\nHere again we see institutional feminism confronting society in an obnoxious, spoiled brat kind of way. I can hear the truckload of  DONTATE NOW buttons hitting the webistes  — This is such a ridiculous joke — I can’t wait for Harper to cut all funding to this nonsensical educational directive that is womens studies et. al. – a more divisive topic has never been adopted by our school systems and I’m terrified for any young man who has to live under the police state that these feminist architects have implemented. Stop giving court to these nutbags who wake up every morning determined to be offended…\nBut it is that the victim is being blamed. Men who say that are just trying to pass the blame onto the victim- ‘Oh you wore a miniskirt well it’s your own dang fault then’. It’s pathetic. Most girls who are raped don’t dress like sluts. Rape is entirely the fault of the rapist. I mean, do people want girls to walk around all day dressed like nuns and never go out at night? We shouldn’t need to do that. Men should be able to control themselves. Men aren’t accused of ‘dressing like sluts’ when they wear short shorts and walk around with no shirt.\nwomen of all shapes, sizes, colors, ages, and dress get sexually assaulted. men should learn to control their anger and learn to treat people with respect. the real problem is men who believe they have the right to take what ever they want from women when ever they want.\nyour comment is so incredibly misogynistic, unfounded and dangerous. it is so far from depicting the realities of sexual violence and works only to perpetuate the myth that some how survivors of sexual violence (female or male) are responsible for their perpetrator’s actions.\nsexual assault is defined by a lack of consent. period. no consent = sexual assault. no where in that legal definition is there any sort of wiggle room around dress, skirt length, traditional clothing, attitude or relative “sluttiness.”\nand i’m going to go ahead and call bullshit on your claim that women who wear traditional clothing are not targets of sexual violence. talk to the women who walk into my office daily to share their stories of intimate partner violence. or the men who experience violence in their own lives.\nalso – it is unfair for you to make broad sweeping generalizations about “girls today” and the “whole lot of them taking offence.”\nsorry if this comes off as curt, but you seem to be someone who appreciates people “telling it like it is.”\nFair Game, I happen to disagree with you. “You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? That’s beyond ridiculous.\nAnd what’s up with men choosing their “victim” based on how they dress? Do you really believe “hindu or sikh or muslim who was covered in their traditional clothing” don’t get sexually assaulted? It is evident from your illogical statements that you need some intense training on this topic.\n“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? ”\ngreat comment. It really doesn’t mean anything, just a thoughtless comment from somebody who doesn’t even think about what the implications of his words are. I know of women who were sexually harassed who were very conservatively dressed. As well, for some Muslim fanatics if a women shows even her face that is a justification to do whatever they want, because as in the previous comment “dress like a slut you will get treated like one”.\nYou are a disgusting excuse for a human being, and a poorly educated, socially ignorant one at that.\nAnyone who knows the first thing about sexual assault is aware that it is a crime of power and has nothing to do with “eyecandy”.  In fact, most victims of sexual assault know the perpetrator intimately – whether it be a family member, friend or other acquaintance.  Are you going to tell me that children, the elderly and otherly abled women are assaulted because they are dressed like “sluts”?  Did you actually just argue that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women aren’t victims of sexual assault?\nLet me educate you a little bit about what a “fair game” entails.  A “fair game” is one in which a person feels safe walking around regardless of their gender, creed, religion, ability, sexual orientation or the way in which they choose to adorn their body.  A “fair game” is one in which a victim of a heinous crime feels comfortable approaching a police officer – who, after all, is paid to protect citizens’ safety – without feeling judged or reproached.\nKudos to you for being one of the most ignorant and simple-minded people I’ve ever encountered.\nHey Fair Game,\nI was raped . . . by my boyfriend. Your move.\nI’m so sorry. Thank you for being brave enough to use your story to stick up for other women against insensitive jerks.\nMy ex attempted to rape me while retrieving belongings he had left at my house (fortunately, my dog is super protective and started biting him).\nI was also sexually assaulted while wearing a long-sleeved, knee-length dress with a cami that hid my cleavage, my hair in a bun, heavy black stockings and ballet flats. Hardly slutty, didn’t stop five guys from surrounding me and groping/grabbing and trying to violate me until my friends caught them and kicked them out of the restaurant we were in.\nYour dog is a better person than Fair Game will ever be.\nI’m very sorry about the things that bad people have chosen to do and try to do to you. The last thing anyone (even worse a law enforcement officer!) should do is pretend you somehow made it happen, whether you were wearing a miniskirt or a burqa.\nWomen are raped in middle eastern countries where they cover up, too.  Did you think of that?\nRapists attack people who are vulnerable.  That can mean children and elderly people, too.  Women with disabilities are more likely to be raped than those who are able-bodied for that reason.  It’s not about provocative clothing.  Rapists act out of a desire to hurt and humiliate their victims, and to have power over them.  Isn’t this a whole lot more worthy of criticism than women’s clothing?\n“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” definitely implies that the victims are responsible for crimes against them, and is a disgusting statement that I can’t believe anyone would utter these days.  Clothing is not consent for sex, as everyone knows, and “no” is not a hard word to understand.  Arguing that rapists can’t understand it is a huge load of crap.  After all, “no” is one of the first words we learn as children…so there’s no excuse for rapists regardless of what the victim was wearing.\nIt’s sad that people like “Fair Game” feel the need to criticize the victims rather than the violent criminals who abuse them…\nThere are so many things wrong with this statement but here are the things that really bother me:\n1) The onus is NOT on the woman to not get raped, it is on the rapist to NOT RAPE. NO ONE ever deserves to be raped, and it is NEVER a woman’s fault that she was raped. NEVER. Even if she was dressing in a way that you don’t personally approve of.\n2) Rape is not about sexual attraction, it is about POWER. Just because a woman is more covered does not mean that a man who is going to rape, will not rape her. It sounds AWFUL, and it IS AWFUL, but rape is not about “eyecandy”. It is all about power and trying to attain power by forcing someone into doing something they don’t want to.\nWell when the rapists start listening then hurray for you, till then I suggest you take it upon yourself to help prevent rape. If you are raped it is no way your fault but again can’t help to reduce the chances.\nThis is the same way I take measures on not getting murdered. Yes the onus SHOULD be on the murderer to stop killing people I do however in the meantime not pick up hitchhikers.\nI’d also like to point out that I also do not agree with Fair Game but I do agree with the officer in the article UNTIL I find evidence that is not a quote from the woman who took offense to the statement that the officer was implying that the women are to blame for the rape.\nIf the officer was simply saying not dressing like a slut can reduce the risk of rape (from opportunistic rape) then by all means he should be able to say that. Yes there will still be rapes on covered up women and “ugly” women but until the rapists decide to stop raping you’ll have to take the responsibility to help not get raped. Which again DOES NOT MEAN you take responsibility for getting raped if you do. RAPE IS WRONG REGARDLESS OF WHO HOW OR WHY IT IS DONE!\nIf you are trying to make a helpful or constructive point you’d be doing everyone a favor by not. Traditional Muslim women suffer rape. Nuns suffer rape. Grandmothers and little girls suffer rape. Dressing like a “slut” has nothing to do with it.\nOf course no one wants to get raped and tries to avoid it!!  No one wants to have their house robbed either! Just imagine your house is robbed & things that are special to you are destroyed. \xa0Imagine the police show up assess how ‘nice’ your garden looks. Now imagine they make you feel guilty (or even worse blame you) for attracting the thieves. They tell you it’s your fault. (seriously you’d be pissed!) No one would accept that! Are you picking up what I’m saying? Let’s realistically assume what attracts one thief to one house may not be the same as what attracts another thief to another house. Would an arbitrary authority telling us how to decorate our house so they all looked a certain way be effective? We can take all the precautions we can afford (deadbolts, bars on the windows & alarm systems) but if a thief still robs you would you not agree it’s not your fault? \xa0\xa0\nWe have the right to decorate & enjoy your home anyway we want! You may not agree with your neighbors idea of what looks ‘nice’ but you must agree you both deserve the same right to be protected? The thief should receive the same penalty regardless of how we each decorate our homes? The thief is at fault!\n\xa0\n\xa0You’d also get pretty pissed off if a judge sentenced the criminal to 1month jail time because she thought your garden looked shitty but sentenced your neighbors thief to 2 yrs because theirs was nicer looking in the judges eyes!! Thats not how our system works! It shouldn’t work like that in rape cases either!! \xa0\xa0\nHow do sluts dress?  Do I deserve to get raped because I’m wearing a skirt? How about if I tell you it goes past my knee, do I still deserve it now? If I’m wearing a long sleeved sweater, is that okay? Or does it have to be a certain degree of baggy before it passes your “shouldn’t get raped” standards?\nSaying things like “dress like a slut you will get treated like one” is EXACTLY the kind of statement that contributes to the rape culture that makes men think rape is okay, and it’s wildly misogynistic – what, exactly, should MEN avoid wearing so they don’t get raped?  Oh, there’s nothing? Men can wear whatever they want?  But women have to dress with a degree of modesty defined by the individual minds of every man on the planet, or hey, it’s her fault.\nAnd by the way, douchebag, women in hindu, sikh, and muslim cultures get raped ALL THE TIME.  There’s a well-documented history of family members MURDERING women from those cultures who are raped, despite their “traditional clothing.” So, as it turns out, forcing women to cover up not only FAILS to protect them from rapists, but also dehumanizes them even further, by implying that after being raped, they’re not even worthy of life.\nThe way to stop rape is for RAPISTS TO STOP RAPING, not for women to swaddle themselves away from male gaze.\nWell put sister. Agree on all fronts, glad someone is able to articulate exactly what is so offensive about this comment without relying on name-calling.\nI don’t agree.  I’ll have less hotties to look at >=(\nYour comment reeks of ignorance.  Women who dress provocatively are not the only women who get sexually assaulted.  And there is no law against dressing in a way you think will attract the opposite sex.  The idea that the way you dress is what gets you raped is beyond ridiculous.  You and the police officer in question need a bit of education\nExcept that the thing about rapists is that *they rape people*\nThey rape women who are fat and they rape women that are thin.\nThey rape women who are tall and they rape women that are short.\nThey rape women of colour and caucasian women.\nThey rape women wearing snow pants and a parka on a winter day, or they rape a woman wearing a short skirt.\nThey use rape as a tool of war in war-torn countries.\nThey rape children, and they rape men.\nThey are family members, coworkers, police officers, doctors, bosses, students, teachers, friends.\nSo instead of trying to punish some women for being sexually active, or blaming them for the terrible thing that happened to them.  You can encourage people to respect consent and bodily autonomy and *not* rape people.\nExcuse me “Fair Game” you have no idea what you are talking about. How about you get educated and then talk. It doesn’t matter what women wear. Assault happens because people like you choose to focus on the victim rather than the perpetrator. “I’m sure” doesn’t carry much weight. Women should be able to wear what they want either way. That is not a reason. Assault is about power, it doesn’t matter whether she’s “eyecandy”. I suggest you take a course from Women’s Studies before you continue with your sexism.\nI imagine you must dress like an ignorant misogynist because you certainly sound like one! Perhaps instead of choosing a “slut” to rape, the men responsible could just not rape anyone! What a crazy idea.\nFair Game, you sound like a real class act.  Are you seriously under the impression that the only women who get raped are “eye candy”? I can’t think of a more ignorant comment you could have made.\nClearly you are a man who hates seeing women in control of themselves, and would prefer if we were all veiled to keep men from getting excited.  I pity the women in your life. I’m sure you’d be really sympathetic if any of them were ever raped, but, hey, it would be their own fault if the rapist found them attractive, right?\nActually, no. It has been well established, time and time again, that rape has nothing to do with how someone is or isn’t dressed. That is a myth used to excuse rapists and blame victims, like what’s happening here. And even if there WAS a correlation, it would STILL be disgusting to blame victims for being raped, because it STILL wouldn’t be their fault.\nThe Toronto police officer’s comment is truly disturbing because he blames the victim for unwanted, forced sexual violence. Blaming the victim means that you hold the person who was attacked responsible for that violence that they suffered. It implies that the victim coulda, shoulda, woulda avoided the attack and therefore was partially responsible for what would inevitably happen.  Sadly, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Rape is regularly and consistently used every day by men all over the world as a way of asserting power and dominance over women.  It is a system of control moreso than a sexual act, and therefore it really doesn’t matter what the woman is wearing.\nIt’s really sad that the police officer who made this comment is in a position of any kind of authroity. With flagrantly sexist and mysogenistic attitudes like that, women in Toronto are certainly less safe. He should be fired or resign from his duties.\nYou ARE aware that rape is rampant Hindi, Sikh and Muslim women, yes?\nI cannot believe the last post. It is people like you that are the problem with society today! I am a male, and regardless of my gender I think that the victims of sexual harrasment should NEVER be to blame.\nDo you think the way a woman dresses, really changes the perspective of a predator. How small minded are you? Have you not been reading about the recent events in egypt, where even women in traditional muslim clothing are being sexual harrassed?\nJust an FYI, you and your opinion disgust  me.\nHey, Fair Game.\nNews flash. Sexual assault is a crime of violence, not sex. It’s a power issue, not one of sexual attraction. When I was raped, I was wearing a winter coat, an oversized sweater and baggy jeans – what’s so slutty about that?\nI’m sorry but what you wear has NOTHING to do with it, a lot of sexual assaults happen to women who are in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nOr to women that have been watched for weeks or even months, and ‘Fair Game’ I bet you any money they don’t always look like sluts.\n& just so you know, Muslims and Sikh women who do wear traditional clothing are just as much at risk if they’re in the wrong place, walking in dark areas and alone.\nYou and this officer disgust me.\nThe safety tips should have been general:\nAvoid being alone late at night.\nStay in well lit areas.\nActually, there’s zero correlation between rape and how someone is dressed, even if you discount the fact that most assaults are committed by relatives and partners. Outside of the societal myths that support rape culture, there’s nothing linking costume, conventional attractiveness, health, fitness, weight, or any other physical trait with rape, completed or attempted.\nNone.\nI also admit to being curious whether you actually believe that cultures which shame women into covering their bodies more fully are magical rape-free zones, which is what you seem to be suggesting.\nYou can’t have it both ways – either you’re blaming the attacker, or you’re suggesting there’s something the woman could have done to avoid being assaulted. There’s no middle ground there, at all. To say that women should expect to be assaulted and should modify their lives accordingly is to support the belief that women should be contained, covered, and chaperoned. It also infantilises men, suggesting there’s no chance that they could learn not to rape.\nRather than wasting time victim-blaming – and that’s what you’re doing, even with your mealy-mouthed proviso to the contrary – spend your time asking yourself exactly how we’re going to pound it into assailants’ heads that rape is bad, it is not excusable, it is not acceptable, and it is not ever anyone’s fault but theirs.\nSuperbly put, Judith. I could not agree with you more.\nAre you fucking kidding me?!?! Cause everyone who gets sexually assaulted MUST be wearing something slutty\nFucking ignorant idiots 😐\nYou know nothing about the anatomy of rape, do you?\nThe elderly and babies are targeted, along with people anywhere on & off the gender spectrum, of all shapes, sizes, colours, creeds, wardrobes.  It’s not about them looking pretty, hot, sexy, nor slutty.  It’s about power.\nThe main purpose of rape is power for the rapist, not sexual gratification.\nFalse false faaaalse. Are we fucking done with the sexism and rape apologism? Women do not get raped because of what they wear, but because a disgusting human being RAPED them. 80% of victims know their rapist, so quit it with the ”stranger in a dark alley raping a young woman with a short skirt” trope.\nMuslim women are raped all the time. Ugly women are raped. Fat women are raped. Actually, 1 out of 6 women will be raped in her lifetime. You are an ignorant misogynist.\nperhaps we should tell men who are victims of crime that it’s their fault too. maybe they should be advised that if they travel or go out at night, they’re just asking to be mugged or robbed. because they are after all just making themselves eye candy to the thieves.\nYou’re honestly calling women who are dressed like sluts “Fair Game” for being attacked? That gives someone fair reason to sexually assault a woman? Using your flawed theory, that gives me the right to attack you because you’re going around flaunting an opinion I don’t like. Same concept, there is no real logic behind it.\nYou sir, have your morals backwards. I also don’t understand why you are referring to it as ‘your’ Society like you are not a part of it too. You are a part of the so-called problem of half-naked women selling pepsi and coke and people purchasing it.\nUse your head, innocent people have no right to be attacked.\nShort version of Mr. ‘Fair Game”s comment: “women who don’t adhere to my religion should be raped.”\nI’d say you just need to get laid, but, really, men like you need to be castrated. You’re encouraging violent criminals – if you’re not one yourself – and you’re giving the rest of us a bad name.\nWork on your self-loathing, kid. Here’s a hint on where to start; women aren’t to blame for it. Stop punishing them because you’re afraid of their bodies and your own.\nI hope you do some growing up before you really damage someone.\nWell said George!!  Great assessment of fair game’s personality! I’d say you got it exactly right!  Hopefully he gets some help with his issues around sexuality and insecurity.\nTo the person who commented that if a woman dresses slutty, she is therefore to blame for any unwanted sexual advances/assaults should probably get their head examined. Completely backward and illogical thinking when it comes to womens’ issues like sexual assault is asinine and it’s that out of touch thought process that scare women off from reporting these crimes.\nAnd the motivation to sexually assault a woman has been rarely reported as a result of what the victim is wearing compared to a crime of convenience (victim was easy to access and isolate), a result of the perpetrator’s upbringing (bad childhood/was assaulted as a child) ,societal pressures, etc.. A lot of these men also have social/behavioral issues, as well.\nLastly, women are assaulted everyday, whether they’re wearing a parka in the dead of winter, or short -shorts in the middle of summer. Neither are acceptable and neither is your comment. It’s actually quite disgusting and ignorant. It almost feels as if you think they DESERVE to be raped because of what they’re wearing. Personally, I think YOU deserve a smack upside the head for even writing any of that.\nMuch as I hate to admit it, the first comment does have a point. We live in a time when if you go to our ‘universities’ (our esteemed institutions of learning), all that the people are doing in the hallways, benches, under trees, in every place one looks is doing everything but having the actual act of sex. In such a pornified society as this where its all about flaunting what you got on a beach or at a university…people may not realize the attitudes that are fostered towards them when they act as ‘sluts’.\nAnd yes its true that rape is not the exclusive domain of western foreigners, it still is a sizeable occurance as compared to other countries in the eastern part of the world (saudi arabia)-not saying that it doesn’t happen- but that its much much much less on a ratio basis even taking into account people who won’t report it because the same thing happens here in canada and the USA.\n@Thinking about #1, too bad rape is not about sex then, and actually about power. Rapists rape people who are vulnerable, which has nothing to do with anyone’s perceived “sluttiness.”\nYea, the difference between what’s going on at the universities and what’s covered here is that one happens between two consenting adults and the other one is a CRIME.\nSo if you get married, have kids, so everyone knows decisively that you’re most definitely NOT a virgin, does that mean we can now declare a rape open season? OBVIOUSLY *NOT*.\nIt is immoral and illegal to force something upon another person, ESPECIALLY something as violent and degrading as rape!!!!!\npersonally, I feel people who wear a certain brand of clothing are all idiots but that doesn’t mean I now have a license to assault anyone wearing that brand of clothing!\nYou are full of it, “Fair Game” — and frankly seem to be getting a little too much enjoyment out of the idea that people “deserve” to be raped. Rape is a crime of power, to suggest it’s primarily sexual attraction that motivates it goes everything we know about the subject. You’re also full of it re: “traditional clothing” as we know damn well the rape culture that exists in some of the societies with very traditional dress. Seriously, look in the mirror, you are expressing some very backward and honestly borderline evil attitudes. This Officer was WAY out of line.\nIf you knew a single thing about sexual assault and rape you’d know it’s about power and dominance, not about ‘eye candy’.\nYou are completely correct.\nMuslim women are obviously never the victims of sexual violence.\nSound logic.\nA woman should not have to cover herself from head to foot to feel safe.\nI blame the officer for being so crass, but it’s not like this is an isolated issue. This society fosters a rape culture, where it’s on the potential victim to hope they’re not picked out by some rapist tonight. It’s a society which makes women afraid to go to the police because they’re “asking for it” by dressing or acting a certain way.\nFair Game,\nyou’re a disgusting misogynist. Educate yourself.\nMost women aren’t sexually assaulted because of how they dress. They’re usually assaulted by men that they know personally.\n‘You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. ‘\nSo you’re justifying rape now, you pathetic scumbag?\n‘That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. ‘\nThat doesn’t even make any sense. Are you justifying Muslim terrorism because women wear tank tops and dresses that don’t cover their knees? How stupid are you?\n‘They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.’\nSo women need to be fully covered up to avoid being raped? What kind of sexist double standard is that? As a man I find you’re comment an insult to me personally. You’re treating men as if they’re animals who can’t control themselves. What a ignoramus you are.\nAnd here’s a newsflash: Women don’t need to justify their worth to you by dressing the way you prefer them to dress. If you’re so small-minded that you’d judge a woman negatively not by her character and actions but by how much skin she shows, than you’re the one who needs to change.\nHey Fair Game…\nMy soulsister was sexually assaulted by a man at her synagogue when he drove her home. She wears long sleeved shirts, jeans, and never wears makeup. She’s one of the least “slutty” girls I know. Also, most cases of rape/sexual assault are done by men that are close to them such as boyfriends, husbands, relatives…\nAnd of course, we haven’t touched upon same sex or female-on-male sexual assault.\nThat cop is a pig.  Sexual assault should never be a frightening cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim “looks” like.\nHe’s also an idiot. Everyone knows that pigs who rape women or who expose themselves or whatever else, have serious mental problems that go way beyond their “weapon of choice.” Just because they can’t keep it in their pants, doesn’t mean it has ANYTHING to do with actual sex.  Anger, rage, hatred, revenge and jealousy are the main reasons men rape.\nToronto Police are NOT educating their members!  (Pardon the pun).\nThe policeman does not have to issue the apology. He has not done anything wrong. It is just a suggestion people. Dont make such a big deal over this! If you do not dress like sluts, then ignore the suggestion. Why bother to get so offended?\nDressing slutty at night is like wearing a redsuit when a stupid bull is around. Smart people will avoid dressing in red. Do not give rapers an incentive by not dressing slutty, trust me, it will help you alot. (Althought it has been proven that colour red does not anger a bull)\nAfter all the policeman just voiced his thoughts – freedom of speech – and if you do not like it, then ignore it.\nLastly always look around when you are alone 🙂\nIt’s not just a suggestion, and women covering up won’t suddenly make rape go away or stop assaults.  Not only is it an ignorant comment that the police officer made but the fact that he is a cop makes it worse because he is supposed to one of the “good guys” who will help the victims. As well, the definition of “slutty” can be almost anything. Maybe the pants were not baggy enough, shirt not baggy enough, should of wore a jacket, should of wore a veil….how far do you want to go? There is never a justification.\nP.S. freedom of speech also involves the right to voice dissent against ignorance.\n@Fair suggestion, It is absolutely wrong to spread misinformation like that because it leads to the perpetuation of a culture in which women are held responsible for a crime committed against them. It is absolutely NOT TRUE that promiscuous dress “attracts” rapists. Please educate yourself:\nA Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only 4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior (“sluttiness”) on the part of the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple as a glance). Additionally most convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.\nThe policeman should issue an apology, though the explanation should be prepared by the police service and be to the effect of, “We did not properly educate this officer on the subjects he discussed.”\nThe logic you use is astounding. First you suggest there’s a relationship between rape and time of day, and then in one breath assert that one should not wear red around a bull while in the next seem to suggest awareness of the fact bulls are colour blind…\nLastly, awareness isn’t the best way to protect yourself. The average rapist is known to the victim, and spends time grooming said victim. If there’s not a previous relationship, the perpetrator takes steps to circumvent his victim’s awareness and preparedness. There is, frankly, no way to completely avoid being a victim. Rather it is better to make oneself a harder target.\nNo, what the policeman is doing is blaming the victim and in so doing he is creating an atmosphere in which rape is seen as being more acceptable because it really “not the rapist’s fault”. Unless this kind of crap is stamped on every time we hear it we will continue to have a society where women can’t even answer their own front door without the fear of rape.\nNo one asks to be raped, unless it’s a fantasy of yours. Period.\nFreedom of speech isn’t quite the same thing when you’re in a position of formal public trust and wearing the uniform of a sworn service. Stop making stuff up.\nPeople are making a big deal of this because you fundamentally DO NOT GET IT and are advancing a very dangerous line of reasoning. You are ENABLING the problem. You and your attitudes are PART of the problem. Listen and learn, stop being so pig-headed. This stuff counts.\nPeople could cover every inch of skin, lock themself in a house, master self-defense, carry a knife, carry a gun, wear a locked metal “chastity belt”, and still get raped. We can take measures to protect ourselves, and still get assaulted. Sometimes sexual assault happens long after a person has been made a victim.\nSometimes the people who commit the crime are the ones we turn to for protection, the ones we think will never hurt us. Sometimes it can happen where we feel the safest. Sometimes it happens when we least expect it.\nSubjectivity aside, what the police officer said is worse than unhelpful. If a person were to believe him, were to believe that by dressing conservatively s/he could avoid or discourage rape, they might believe they were safe.\nThat police officer is terrible. This whole “dressing like a slut” business actually has nothing to do with a woman’s preference of clothing. “Dressing like a slut” is an EXCUSE used by perpetrators to justify hurting another person.\nTo say that a woman who dresses how she wants to dress deserves to be raped is like saying that you deserve to be hit by a car if you’re around a road. It doesn’t matter if you’re at a crosswalk or have the pedestrian right-of-way or even on the sidewalk – you’re near the road, so I’m going to run you over with my car. Sure, I could CHOOSE not to and keep going on my merry way, but because you’re close to a street, it means you’re “asking for it,” right? I mean, if you didn’t want to become a victim of vehicular homicide, surely you would NEVER go near a road.\nEveryone needs to chill out and take a look at this UN crime survey before we keep bashing the guy who made the first comment and the police officer in question:\nhttp://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_percap-crime-rapes-per-capita\nIt is shown that the majority of the top 20 nations with the highest prevalence of rape in the world are those with the greatest female civil liberties, which includes the freedom to dress as they please. (South Africa, Australia, Canada, USA, France, UK, etc.) The others are mostly impoverished nations with weaker law enforcement established. (Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Dominica, Venezuela, etc.)\nIt is shown that many of the the bottom 20 countries surveyed are predominantly governed under Islamic Law or with a legal code modeled after Islamic Law, with far fewer female civil liberties. (Azerbaijan, Yemen, Indonesia, Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc.) Rape is actually found to be the least prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where many foreign observers find women to have the fewest civil liberties.\nThis information was found in about 2 minutes, which suggests that the people most in need of education are those blindly criticizing our friend who made the first post. His point is valid and so is that of the police officer, statistics show. However, the officer probably should have exercised more tact in his choice of words, which by the looks of them suggest that they have been taken somewhat out of context, in my non-expert opinion.\nPlease, before anyone tells me that I am placing the blame on victims, read the following: Rape is against the law and I do not condone it. The tragic fact is this: people are going to rape people no matter what. There is nothing anyone can do to eliminate it without revoking our civil liberties to extreme degrees.\nThe biggest problem with numbers and estimates on rape has to do with a severe under-reporting of these incidents, due in large part to cultural issues such as this one. If a woman feels embarrassed or worries that she won’t be taken seriously when reporting a rape (e.g. being told she looks slutty and was probably asking for it), why would she bother making it worse on herself? Embarrass the victim, protect the rapist. Not to mention how many women in other nations will get stoned to death for being an “adulteress” or having sex outside of marriage when someone (yes, even a family member) rapes them. There’s a lot of incentive to keep your mouth shut when someone violates you.\nThere are a lot of nuances here, and it’s hard to trust the numbers. Not that they should have anything to do with this–rape is rape, regardless of religion, dress, geographic location, sex/gender, age, or any other demographic someone should happen to pull out in defence of ignorance.\nThat site clearly says:\n“DEFINITION: Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”\nThe actual prevalence of rape IS NOT reflected in this chart, the website itself says so. This is a collection of reported rapes, not real prevalence.\nIn many Middle Eastern countries women who are rape victims can be publicly punished with lashings, killed by the family members or shunned by their community. Therefore, reporting is low. Try reading all the information before trying to use these statistics to your advantage.\nI just want to point out that statistics like that are based upon REPORTED crime, or government estimates. In some countries being raped can lead to you being condemned to death, I’d say that’s a reason to keep it quiet. In countries with more equal rights for women, women are more likely to report crimes against them. In countries where rape is understood as a crime of power, and victim blaming is slightly less of a problem, more people will come forward. Even in the US, where I’m from, most assaults go unreported.\nLook at the caveat on the survey you just posted: “Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”\nIn countries governed by Islamic law, rapes are vastly under reported precisely because the victim is often blamed for somehow soliciting the assault. In many cases, when the victim is a woman, the victim is then charged with adultery. A man’s word counts more than a woman’s so the rapist can simply claim the woman seduced him to avoid a rape charge. Naturally, this reduces the number of recorded rapes because 1) it’s not recorded as a rape if it’s recorded as adultery and 2) who the hell risks reporting rape in a country where they’re more likely to punish the victims? This is precisely the reason why all of us are mad at rape apologists like Fair Game and the policeman in the article. They enable rapists by blaming the victim for the crime.\nAlso @Edgar Graham, shame on you for pretending to state the facts while at the same time confounding correlation and causation.* They are not the same. If you don’t condone rape, please don’t inadvertently contribute to rape culture by supporting rape apologists and not reading your own sources correctly.\n*An example: While red hair and freckles often occur together (correlation), it does not necessarily follow that red hair CAUSES freckles (it doesn’t).\n@mynameisbutters\nExcellent comment but unfortunately too many people are so uneducated in science and basic statistics that they can’t separate correlation from causation.\nThere is research showing correlation between teenagers who have breakfast with family and sexual activity at a later age.  An idiot would claim breakfast cereals have the magical ability to make kids more “moral” but in reality, it’s because typically, children who have breakfast with their family come from more close-knit families with more attentive parents.\nThese statistics don’t show anything about whether “dressing slutty” makes you more likely to be raped.  I’d go so far as to say that countries where women’s freedoms are greatly restricted don’t create an environment where it’s easy for women to report rape in the first place.  Rape is very prevalent in many African countries, for example, but do you think that society there provides recourse for victims, or even acknowledges that a crime has taken place in most cases?\nYou’ll notice the DRC isn’t recorded, where rape is used as a weapon of war. Also, many of those countries at the bottom of the list don’t consider marital rape a crime.\nAs the majority of responses to your post have pointed out, this is a report on sexual assault that is reported or otherwise recorded. The relationship between reports of sexual assault and the civil liberties women have in that country cannot be over-emphasized; it is far easier to report a sexual assault in a country which will take your report seriously. The report in question does not define “rape” or take into account the differences in definition by region. I prefer the term sexual assault, as it encompasses many different aspects of the term than just forced intercourse.\nIn many of the countries you reference as being in the bottom 20, reporting a sexual assault is a fast track to ostracism on the nice end of things. Can you imagine how difficult it must be for a woman to disclose sexual violence to the men who think her ankles are to be hidden? I know from travelling to some of these countries that women are blamed for many types of sexual assault, including being groped or frotteurised on public transit; these women should not be in public surrounded by men is the logic used. It does stand to reason that in a country where women are “allowed” to say no, they will report a man who doesn’t respect their use of the word or their attempts to protect their civil liberties and personal safety.\nI don’t think you are necessarily placing blame on the victim, however, I do think it’s a good idea for you to look into the subject a little more thoroughly.\nA few things the officer in question, as well as most of the comments, seem to disregard include male on male sexual assault, or even what dressing “like a slut” entails. The word is, after all, a misogynist insult in itself. If a young boy is assaulted, is it possible he also dressed like a slut? Or perhaps it’s more to the point that in justification of his actions a rapist will say he was overcome by feelings of lust based on his victim’s attire rather than say the truth: he is a violent offender who will take whatever excuse he can create to be violent toward his preferred victim.\nNaturally countries where the legal penalty for having been raped is stoning have fewer rapes, not less reporting.\nSo if you have sharia law in these societies, then you have a situation wherein a woman’s testimony in a court of law is worth only half a mans. So if two men hold a woman down while a third rapes her, and then she goes to the police, her testimony counts for nothing against that of her three rPISTS, NO?\nSo how many fucking rapes do you think are likely to get reported in these shitholes?\nOkay, here’s a serious question.\nIs it okay or not okay for advertisers of products and makers of pop music video clips to use semi-naked models in slutty clothes and make-up?\nThere have undoubtedly been hundreds (if not thousands) of graduate theses on this very subject–I think the resounding answer to your question is, “The jury’s still out.” Or, at the very least, it will remain a contentious issue for a very long time (if not forever).\nWhat is the bigger consideration to me is the definition of the word “slut” and its implied meaning. It’s a tired observation, but it’s still true–guys who sleep around are seen as manly and deserving of respect for their sexual prowess, whereas girls who have the confidence to enjoy their own sexuality while behaving the same way are completely disrespected and dismissed as tramps. Where’s the equality in that? Even when men get called sluts and whores in popular culture, the connotation is a positive or non-serious one.\nRather than do an overhaul on advertising practices, I’d like to see a complete rewrite of cultural understanding and acceptance when it comes to female sexuality. You can’t shame sluts if the concept of being a slut doesn’t exist.\nLast I checked, dressing provocatively is part of their job description so I don’t really see your point!  Part of their job description is also to be more attractive than the vast lot of us (except me because I’m gorgeous LOL LOL)\nCome to think of it, you’ve posted more than one random non-issues that no one but you think is a thought provoker here.\nIf I were you I wouldn’t go around calling myself “clear thinking” because it’s an embarrassment.\nLet us remember, people, that rapists are sick people; they enjoy violent and brutally having sex. How a woman dresses play very little in a rapist committing the act or not. Seriously, do you think that because you are wearing long jeans and a sweater you risk no chance of getting rape?? I have big news for you!\nPretending that the way women dress is a direct consequence of what men will do to do is actually both offensive for men and women: it seems to suggest that women who are covering more their body will not be victim of rape and it also suggests that men cannot control their actions (1) and that they enjoy brutally and violently forcing a women into having sex (2); i’m not sure how many men would enjoy this characterization of themselves.\n@fairsuggestion\nWomen get raped every day by people that they know wearing almost anything.  The last thing a victim needs to hear is that they gave the rapist an incentive to rape them.  You have obviously never been raped, or else you wouldn’t utter something so ignorant and one sided.\nWhen you tweet this; make sure to cc @torontopolice\nWho here suspects that Fair Game is indeed the police officer, further running his mouth??\nFirst to comment…? Sounds fishy.\nI’m not making accusations, just wondering.\nThe biggest problem with this situation is that the officer will likely not have to suffer the consequences of his actions (the parallels to victim-blaming are astounding). My guess is a brief suspension with pay at worst, though a light slap on the hand in the form of a forced public apology is the most likely outcome.\nWhile people recognize these kinds of comments as wrong, society doesn’t care about women enough (yet) to follow through on making examples of people who are in positions of authority, but who clearly shouldn’t be. By not taking this issue as seriously as it should, the police department is merely acknowledging public frustration with the officer in question rather than taking responsibility for the situation. True, you can’t control everything coming out of an employee’s mouth, but public servants have a responsibility to ensure that the people walking the streets are educated and sensitive to such damaging events.\nAs far as I’m concerned, the police representative’s PR spinning is just as bad as the cop’s comment. What are you investigating? He said it. People heard it. Time for justice. It’s almost as if they’re saying, “If women didn’t get raped so much, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with providing tips on how to stay safe. And then this issue would have never happened.”\nAre you kidding me?\nTo all of you on here who are blaming the victim for dressing too ‘slutty’ or ‘sexy’.  Has it occurred to all of you that this argument cheapens men as much as women by asserting that guys have absolutely no control over their instinct and that instinct will always trump our higher thought processes?  By the same logic, those who wear expensive clothes were just asking to get robbed because nobody can control themselves, right?\nDressing provocatively may not be an invitation to rape but it IS an invitation to be treated as an object. Please note that I haven’t specified a gender.\nIt makes me sad that one moronic police officer can say something like this and makes the whole force look like misogynistic assholes. As a victim of sexual assault who DID go to the police, they aren’t all like this and I would actually say most of them aren’t.\nI would like to know why this particular officer was chosen to speak on this issue when he has no understanding of it and is therefore clearly not qualified to do so. It isn’t as if there are no police officers in the city who have two brain cells to rub together, so what gives?\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nNicole Hanson\nContributor\nBlack enclaves – urban settlements with an inherent sense of both cultural and ethnic pride – are known for being separate from the societal social and economic mainstream. Little emphasis, however, has been set on their origins: a series of beginnings mainly built on race.\nEglinton West is also known as “Little Jamaica”. John Tavares\nBoth historically and presently, black enclaves have been a contested urban space. When we look at North American black enclaves – settlements such as Africville, Jane and Finch and Eglinton West – we are visibly engaging in spatial histories which may be unnoticed.\nThe births of these “ethnic enclaves” are imbued with strong, racial undertones that connect racial identities.\nLooking back, black enclaves, such as Nova Scotia’s Africville, Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Ontario’s Wilberforce Colony, have been nationally understood as an embodiment of black pride and community. Yet their formation was involuntary, because slavery and racism enforced lines of demarcation, drawing out an urban space for blacks to live and hindering them from settling in desirable spaces.\nThe forced nature of these black enclaves embodied oppression, because whites owned most of the land, exerted power and domination, and dictated where blacks would fit within the urban landscape – but these communities were nevertheless successful in building black solidarity.\nRetrospectively, these spaces have fostered a sense of spatial emancipation and liberation from their white counterparts.\nNow black enclaves are becoming voluntary spaces; the dynamics within them are liberating, empowering and uplifting, and build a sense of residential solidarity through community building.\nJane and Finch, just south of York University, is a black enclave with a bad reputation. (John Tavares)\nEglinton West and Jane and Finch stand as examples of community-building urban space in Toronto, Ontario. Eglinton West is called “Little Jamaica,” and is characterized by retail Jamaican shops, authentic Jamaican cuisine, barbershops and salons.\nThe black identities that make up this space have allied together to strengthen themselves as an economic, communal whole; however, the arrangement of these urban settlements, especially that of Jane and Finch, have become associated with stereotypes, clearly polarizing the city’s social, economic, political and cultural makeup.\nThat’s why Jane and Finch area has been labelled the home of the impoverished, disadvantaged or, more clearly, the urban poor, over-generalizing every identity within that space because they reside within that enclave. The politics of representation co-exist with the urban politics of the space when it comes to black enclaves, thus perpetuating not only an urban identity crisis, but re-instilling structures of hyper-segregation, racial discrimination and urban apartheid.\nBlack enclaves, whether thought of as voluntary or involuntary, are still oppressive, because as more blacks concentrate in these enclaves, they further remove themselves from the mainstream. What this mechanism does is reinforce a lack of economic opportunity, which continues to pave the way for both residential, community and entrepreneurial poverty.\nThe people in a neighbourhood reinvest their income back into their community. In situations of blatant poverty, neighbourhoods do not have that reinvestment coming back to them, stopping them from building the fundamental institutions that cater to community building. For the most part, the little sense of economic development these neighbourhoods once had quickly ceased; poverty creates crime, leaving the economic value of these businesses threatened.\n(Illustrated by (Cola)nothy Humphrey.)\nBusinesses thus move out of these areas. High insurance means businesses are forced to increase the price of their products, but the high crime rates do not allow for longevity and economic profitability, thus reinforcing discrimination and segregation, leaving the black enclave socially and economically stigmatized to development and growth.\nEven though black enclaves are also seen as voluntary spaces, they continue to be the epitome of racial segregation and economic divide. They are notoriously characterized as unattractive spaces with a high rate of poverty. They are affiliated with joblessness, insurmountable teenage pregnancies, out-of-wedlock births (emphasizing discontinuity between black male and female relationships) and female-led families people assumed are welfare-dependent –\xa0 and all of this against the backdrop of high crime rates.\nWhether black enclaves are understood as involuntary or voluntary, these places have been sensationalized within the city. Black enclaves have become ghettoized, to the point where it’s almost taboo for blacks to live out in the suburbs. The ghettoization of these black enclaves perpetuates a sense of stagnation, affecting the identity of urban youth, both within the enclaves and outside of them.\nIntangible structures such as racism, racial segregation and discrimination lead to urban segregation, and create a politic of identity that intentionally captures and emphasizes difference and limits social and economic integration for those identities within black enclaves.\nThis robs people in these spaces of the ability to create identities for themselves; instead, they become neglected, subordinate and dependent on dominant groups. If we can utilize this historic transfer – black enclaves premised on a racialized connectedness – then we can create a holistic approach to community building, not only visibly to the mainstream, but also internally, within ourselves, the foundation for a nationalistic sense of independence.\nThere needs to be a holistic approach to reclaiming the identity of our communities and to embody that nationalistic spirit of residential solidarity, community building and economic independency.\nWhen we understand black enclaves were formed via a racialized connectedness, we can examine that shared history – a history of communities formed both involuntarily and voluntarily, premised not only in racism, discrimination and segregation but focused on community formation and restructuring.\nThis understanding will allow us to take better steps to form a nationalistic approach in rebuilding black solidarity within and outside black enclaves.\nNicole Hanson is the president of Apostolic Pentecostals of York University (APYU)\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2011/02/16/from-africville-to-eglinton-west/'],0.2099073976278305,0.7603537440299988,0.401114821434021

This is all mine,” says Grillone as she flips through her recently published book, My Pen, My Voice. Grillone is a 22-year-old writer who graduated fromYork University’s English program in 2010. Faced with the “real world,”  Grillone wanted to follow her dream and publish a book. She had been  keeping a diary since before she was twelve and knew that she had a story that should be told. Upon  graduation, she decided there was no better time to pursue her dream of  being a writer than now, while she was still young.\nShe sent out manuscripts, but received no replies. Most publishers  rarely look at unsolicited manuscripts and Grillone did not have a  literary agent. After a few months, though, she found some hope when a publisher vacationing in India promised to look  at her work after she returned to Toronto. Grillone waited eagerly, but her hopes were crushed when she found out the publisher fell  ill on her trip and passed away. Grillone lost not only a friend, but also her only connection to the publishing industry.\nVanessa Grillone. (Courtesy of Vanessa Grillone\nGrillone was convinced publishing the book was simply not meant to be. Her parents were determined to see their daughter succeed and suggested self-publishing. She researched her options and decided to go with a self-publishing package from iUniverse, a company linked to Chapters.\nThe self-publishing package suggested writers hire a copy editor and line editor–but Grillone didn’t. Instead, she used the skills she learned in school to edit her own work. It worked out great, she said.\xa0 The finished book is her real diary, filled with\xa0 her “raw emotions.” While some editors suggested she tweak it in some parts — changing\xa0 some prose to poetry, for example — Grillone kept it the way it was because she didn’t want to alter the reality of the diary.\nThe result is a book that’s all hers — from the words on the page to the choice of cover. It illustrates her improvements in her writing abilities and her growth as a person.\nGrillone wants people who are thinking about self-publishing to “make sure they are ready.”\nHer book recounts her life from when she first began writing it at age 12, before she’d ever considered publishing it, even revealing\xa0 the minutaie of her relationships and notes on a hidden tattoo most people didn’t know she had. It feels odd for her to hear strangers talking about the details of her history.\nGrillone's self-published book. (Courtesy of Vanessa Grillone)\nThere were some reprecussions to revealing that much about herself, though–for example, her family’s reactions.\nThere is one reason Grillone is glad she revealed her diary to the world: her 16-year-old cousin. When Grillone looks at her, she sees herself–a shy teenage girl struggling with growing up. Grillone is not a conversationalist, and feels the best way  for her to communicate to teenagers is through writing. “That’s  her — and my — thing. She likes to write.”\nGrillone hopes that this book can help her and other teenage girls relate to someone just like them. She feels that today’s society is making it increasingly difficult for young girls to be confident and independent. “I want to encourage  teens to not only be comfortable in their own skin but to find their  voice, whether it be through writing, or music, or actually speaking. Nothing will change unless you raise your voice.”\nVanessa Grillone will be having a book singing on April 16, 2011 12pm-2pm at Chapters Woodbridge 3900 Hwy 7 West, Unit 1 Woodbridge.\n ""]",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/04/04/my-pen-my-voice/'],0.6109672784805298,0.3976401686668396,0.1993408054113388

John Janas, Ron Maloku, Alex Curci, and Mike Mclnroy present a shared ability to use the media of illustration, animation, and drawing to create powerful, interesting, and ultimately effective works. The exhibition, currently running at the Samuel J. Zacks Gallery, presents works with an expressive, attention-grabbing style.\nCo-director of the gallery, Stas Guzar, explains that what interested him in hosting this exhibition was to bring recognition to up-and-coming artists.\n“I feel as though drawing and illustration don’t get the attention they deserve, and can get lost amongst the other mediums,” Guzar explains. To him, each artist’s work is special in its own way.\nComic-book-style pieces are among the works Guzar focused on for the show. He was drawn to the works of Curci because of his ability to use this style and present, as Guzar describes it, “a duality in the image of technology and raw organics.” Located along the western wall, his ink and watercolour work presents many abstract concepts and depicts futuristic technologies.\nThe works of Janas, located along the southern wall, consist of pop-cultural icons in watercolour and comic book visual narratives. The calm colour scheme in contrast with the vibrancy of the bold black lines appeal to the viewer.\nMclnroy’s work further adds to the show’s atmosphere with his cartoon style and effective use of bold black ink. He presents interesting and humorous subjects in his works, including a modern-day take on the Three Little Pigs.\nPresented along the northern wall are captivating images produced with India ink in an expressionistic style. The works of Maloku are powerful because of the unsettling feeling they create within the viewer.\n“I particularly like the raw emotion these images create,” comments Guzar. “I find them effective in creating this raw emotion as a result of the loose stylistic essence Maloku used to produce them.” These works are powerful and appealing as a result of the grotesque images which captivate and intrigue the viewer.\nGuzar describes the exhibition as “more conceptual than visual.” The works as a whole are effective because they are relatable on a universal level. This show allowed for a spotlight to be put on works that are bold and intriguing.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/arts/2012/01/30/drawing-within-fat-lines/'],0.7213159799575806,0.26711273193359375,0.09362386912107468

Eke.\nNo one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.\nWhat parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.\nRoom 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.\nFrom the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.\nThe campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.\nHer pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off. \xa0Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.\nShe heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”\n“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”\n“No, she never goes anywhere.”\n“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”\n“Did you notice in English lecture…?”\nEke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.\n“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.\nShe blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.\nDuring her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.\n“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.\n“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”\nAt six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.\nHis arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.\nEke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.\nJoining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.\nBut this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.\n“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.\nWith her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.\n“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.\nHer hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.\nKnock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.\nThe door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.\n“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”\n“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.\n“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.\n“Do I know you, girl?” he said.\nShe grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/arts/2012/02/29/the-professor/'],0.539358913898468,0.8058913946151733,0.6090517640113831

As a child, Saleem discovers he has the special power to bring together all the Indian children born in that same hour and that they each have their own gift.\nShiva is a fierce fighter, and\xa0Saleem’s closest friend Parvati is\xa0a witch. The children’s stories\xa0are inevitably “handcuffed to history,” playing out against the uncertain backdrop of cultural divisions and civil war.\nThe problem is that by the time we get to this story, we’re exhausted. The tale is buried under an hour of recounting how Saleem’s adopted grandparents and parents meet. Rushdie, who wrote the screenplay himself, makes the fatal mistake of trying to cram the entire 446-page novel into the movie, making it a tedious, unrewarding experience.\nAlong the way, we’re introduced to an extensive list of characters that are completely forgotten by the end of the film, and this is perhaps where Midnight’s Children’s biggest flaw lies.\nBy the end, so much precious time has been wasted on introductions to new characters, that we haven’t grown to care for or empathize with the main characters at all. All the moments that are supposed to move us don’t because a connection with the hero just isn’t there.\nAn all-around bad casting job doesn’t help the situation as most of the cast, and especially the Canadian-born Anita Majumdar who plays Saleem’s beautiful but selfish Aunt Emerald, deliver cringe-worthy, awkward performances, struggling to bring Rushdie’s quirky humour to life on the screen.\nThe cost of Rushdie’s highly literal, page-by-page on-screen translation is sacrificing a deeper exploration of the best and most affecting stories within Midnight’s Children. What motivated the nurse’s actions? What has filled Shiva with so much rage? There are so many unanswered questions.\nThe story of the “midnight’s children” is a perplexing one if you haven’t read the source material. The purpose of their meetings, orchestrated by Saleem, is confusing, and the divisions and tensions that exist within the group are never justified. But how could they be when so much time is thrown away on the story of Saleem’s parents who are long gone, and serve no purpose now?\nI’d imagine the conflict is tied to the chaos that is India’s political situation at the time, but Rushdie decides to skip over history in favour of unimportant subplots.\nMehta hasn’t completely lost her touch, though; having described the book as “Salman’s love letter to India,” her adaptation of it is a love letter of its own kind.\nWith bright colours, dream-like visuals, and a fantastic score, she captures the magic and beauty of India’s streets.\nThis isn’t an unfilmable story. But Rushdie is incapable of being ruthless when he needs to be, keeping scenes that ought not to be there, and leaving out the ones that should. Perhaps it’s his deep understanding of the book that is actually Midnight’s Children’s downfall, keeping him from seeing that some things don’t work in movies.\nTamara Khandaker, Copy Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nSigning of the memorandum of understanding marks\xa0milestone in Canada-India relations\xa0\nOn November 6, a\xa0memorandum of understanding was signed between York and the Defence Research and Development Organization in India, which will facilitate collaborative research in the area of defence technology.\nVK Saraswat of the DRDO and Robert Hache, York’s vp research and innovation, signed the MOU in the presence of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\n“It should make it easier for\xa0our colleagues to access research funding available in India for international partnerships,” writes Janusz A.

However, it will be up to individual researchers whether they want to collaborate.\nYork will also not offer individual, stand-alone funding for research projects, Kozinski says.\nSeveral collaborative projects are possible in areas like chemical-biological defense, advanced materials, and nanotechnology.\nThe DRDO, India’s military research and development agency, also funds much of the research done in top Indian universities.\n“It’s important to clarify that India does not have an equivalent to the Canadian Tri-Council granting agencies,” writes Kozinski, referring to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, which fund most of the research in Canadian universities.\nCurrently, York is not collaborating with DRDO on any projects, but a number of initiatives were discussed at two workshops in 2011, on which the MOU is based.\nKozinski mentions the Early Warning and Advance Response Network [e-WARN] project, designed to detect, identify, and neutralize chemical and biological agents released in public buildings. The e-WARN system would save lives in events like the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995.\nIn March 2011, the e-WARN response time was seven seconds.

It was going to ask, considering it’s the year 2013, is feminism still even necessary?\nBut I noticed a pattern when the first drafts of the articles started coming in.\nI realized they were all about questioning what a woman was, and what a woman was supposed to be. The stories examined the expectations society sets for women, and the expectations we set for ourselves—the ones that tell us we should be thin but curvy, ladylike but sexy, career-oriented but dedicated mothers, smart but not too smart; certainly not smarter than men.\nThe stories in this supplement challenge these assumptions. Some of them feature women testing the boundaries of what is considered appropriate “feminine” behaviour, and others are about women pushing back at these boundaries when they get in their way.\nSo that is where the theme, “De/constructing Feminism,” comes from. It means both taking apart what a woman is supposed to be, while simultaneously constructing new, diverse images and ideas about women.\nI’ve thought a lot about what I want to achieve with this supplement. And the truth is, I don’t want to make some grand statement on feminism or offer a sweeping solution to any of the questions mentioned above.\nWhat I want is for people, women and men, to ask questions. I want to inspire a dialogue that questions what it means to be a woman in today’s society, and if one singular meaning is even possible.\nAnd I want people to question the boundaries and rules set for us—that govern the way we should dress, the way we should speak, the way we should act, what things we should like, and even in what fields we should work, and for how long.\nBecause that’s the thing about boundaries. Once you know where they are, they become easier to cross. So, happy crossing.\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nVanessa Del Carpio, Women’s Supplement Coordinator\nIn the supplement, look for:\nToys without boys\nIn defense of fashionistas\nEverything means yes: consent in the media\nPublic action continues for gang rape victim in India\nSpelling out the sex trade\nA lesson on inequality\nGirly-girl power\nYou are what you write\nThis is what a filmmaker looks like\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe sexual assault of Jyoti Singh sparks protests in demand of women’s rights\n\nNews of the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman, Jyoti Singh, on the streets of Delhi, India’s capital, outraged the world this past December. More importantly, it has caused Indian society to question its treatment of women.\n“I feel disgusted calling myself a man and not being able to help that girl who fell prey to those animals,” says Chirag Thakkar, a political science student at Delhi University.\n“However, I see immense hope in the protest-scape of India. Twelve thousand charged and angry youngsters outside the president’s house crying for justice is not an ordinary event. It definitely brought the complacent and power-mongering statesmen to come out of their slumber and respond.”\nThakkar is referring to the mass protests that started in New Delhi as news about the rape case reached the public through news and social media. Thousands protested at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the location of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president of India. The protests soon spread to other parts of India as well as abroad.\nThis massive public outcry led to the creation of a special commission and a fast-track court being commissioned. Currently, five men stand trial for the rape and murder of Singh.\nSignificant change, however, requires a consideration of India’s history and culture.\nIn the year 1947, with the end of colonialism and the formation of a nation-state, a new chapter started in the story of an ancient civilization. Today, 65 years after independence, 21st-century India is caught up in the debate between tradition and modernity.\nGender inequality is deeply entrenched in Indian society, but this runs counter to Hindu values. According to Hindu traditions, goddesses are worshipped because they bring wealth, wisdom, and strength.\nHowever, today the very practitioners of Hinduism look down upon girls as financial burdens for families, who must marry off any female children and pay their dowries.\nMitra Joshi, news reporter for CNBC TV-18 in Mumbai, reflects on these contradictions.\n“On one hand, we worship Durga [a Hindu goddess] and her numerous forms in the temple, but when it comes to women in the house or the womb, she is treated as an unwanted commodity. All our society needs is a son. Why?” asks Joshi.\n“Unless, and until, women themselves stand up against these atrocities, nothing will change,” says Joshi. “But women are told to keep quiet and endure the violence, or else they will be stigmatized by the society.”\nToday, the Indian judicial system is adapting to seek justice not only for Singh but also for every Indian woman who has been a victim of gender-based violence. But there are no quick fixes to end the injustice.\n“All along, we have been denying the noise this issue deserves. The anger had to pour out on the streets, at protest sites, in cyberspace, and in the media,” says Thakkar.\n“I believe that some seeds of change have been sown and that they shall germinate. The tree shall bloom, not by living in denial, but by being constantly at war with patriarchy.”\nChandni Shah, Contributor\n ']","['https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2013/03/11/finding-your-feminism/', 'https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2013/03/11/public-action-continues-for-gang-rape-victim-in-india/']",0.774285614490509,0.3847901523113251,0.03596061887219548

September 24 marks the premier of this year’s I Am series, featuring solo autobiographical dance performances that shed some light on four students’ journeys.\xa0The solo performances mark a transition for second year master’s students, who after a year of choreographic study are able to present their works on a public stage.\xa0This particular performance, held at the McLean Performance Studio, is titled Available Light. Carol Anderson, creative director of the I Am series, says the show was named due to the performances being presented in whatever available lighting they have. “It seems an apt metaphor for the way in which artists work with the resources that they have at hand, and in mind and heart, at the moment of creative expression,” said Anderson. Available Light spotlights students of diverse backgrounds, including Nikolaos Markakis, Allison McCaughey, Suma Nair, and Michelle Silagy. Having survived their first year in their master’s program together, the quartet of dancers regularly collaborate and together comprise a diverse show. Markakis, who is dancing to live music, drew inspiration from folklorish and contemporary dance for his performance titled Ithaka. The title comes from a Greek poem that transcribes the 10-year-long journey from Troy to the island of Ithaka. “I am using Ithaka as a metaphor for my journey from my past to my present and hopes of my future,” added Markakis. McCaughey, a former chorus dancer, named her solo Third from the Left, a play on her position in a chorus line. A more commercial performance, the solo is meant to represent how the business of entertainment is an all-consuming aspect of dance, particularly McCaughey’s experience. Nair incorporates traditional Bharatanatyam Indian dance into her contemporary piece Belong.Influenced by personal narratives and cultural memories, this dance performance is a re-imagining of traditional dance to a contemporary audience. Silagy’s solo, titled …at the end of a stem, is a piece inspired by nature and a garden, environments which often influenced her MFA research. “It becomes a portal through which to pursue a fine attunement of my relationship to air, exhalation, respiration, impulse, nuance, gravity, and the natural world,” said Silagy. The I Am solos are one of three research components that the students go through, which culminate to a self-produced thesis concert in collaboration with York’s theatre production program. The public performances are open to all, and allow for students to embody their critical research into physical practices in front of an audience.\nVictoria Goldberg, Arts Editor.\n\xa0\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2015/09/25/shed-some-light-on-these-unique-dance-solos/'],0.434560090303421,0.015160501934587955,0.055551014840602875

The award-winning play was sparked by the events of December 16, 2012 in South Delhi, India. A group of six men brutally raped a woman and assaulted her male companion when the two boarded a bus on their way home from the movies. Jyoti Singh, whose name was prohibited from being released by the press at the time of the rape, became known as “Nirbhaya,” the Hindi word for fearless one. Singh later died of the severe injuries sustained from the rape and beatings. Media outlets all over the world covered the assault, inspiring thousands of people across India to break the taboo of silence and discuss the reality of sexual assault, violence, and abuse in India.\nNirbhaya uses the rape of Nirbhaya as the framework for the play, focusing on the experienced sexual violence of five women. As these women take turns sharing their lived stories, Nirbhaya is always present in her white gown, singing and haunting the actors and audience. The five other characters speak of marital abuse, molestation, and violence with the rawness of lived knowledge so that no one in the audience is left untouched or comfortable.\nNirbhaya’s richness and power as a play resides specifically in its unplay-like nature. Yes, Nirbhaya has many formal qualities of a play, a theatre setting, stage, lighting, props, and costumes, yet it rejects the notion of actors performing. These women have performed silence and submissiveness their whole lives, unable to speak of the violence done to and around them. However, when on stage, these women speak without apology or restraint for what they have gone through. As theatre-goers sit in rows, compelled by these horrific and moving stories, they empathize simultaneously with the real experiences.\nNirbhaya documents the specific horrors of violence that many Indian women have gone, and continue to go, through, yet also speaks to the condition of all victims and survivors. These people who have suffered violence, injustice, or indecency have been wounded, but that wound is what lets the light in. The bandage of silence is insufficient and the bondage to social taboos is suffocating. The women have chosen not to be scared by the darkness around them. They are not scabbed in silence, choosing to shine the spotlight on social injustices, allowing for change to occur.\nNirbhaya welcomes other people affected by violence to not mark themselves by the actions of others. Though it may hurt, survivors must peel back their scabs and deal with what lies beneath. Wounds come in all shapes, sizes, colours, and degrees of pain. They’re not discriminatory in that sense. No one can choose how they are wounded, but everyone can choose to allow wounds to fester in hatred, silence, and darkness, or heal in knowledge, sharing, and lightness.\n\xa0\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2015/11/27/the-wound-is-the-place-where-the-light-get-in/'],0.7919153571128845,0.18914291262626648,0.03742021694779396

In the finals, he improved on his timing and finished at 1:01.04, but that was not enough to beat P.S. Madhu and Sethu Manickavel, both representing India, who won the gold and silver medals respectively. Tariq also competed in the 50-metre freestyle, the 200-metre freestyle, and the 4×100-metre freestyle relay. In the first of these, Tariq set a national record for Pakistan with a time of 2:01.84. He set another record for Pakistan by swimming his leg of the relay in 54.30 seconds.\n“I’m really happy and proud of all my achievements at the SAG 2016,” says Tariq. “To scoop up a medal among some really fast competitors makes me extremely satisfied with all the hard work I had put in prior to the Games.”\nTariq shares the credit with his training at York, where the finance student has been swimming for three years. “Training at York is the sole reason for all my achievements,” he says. “Coming back from the trials just a month before the actual Games, I did not really think I had more room to improve in such a limited amount of time, but it did end up helping me a lot.”\nThe South Asian Games, which are held every other year, feature athletes from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka competing in a variety of sports. The 12th South Asiam Games were held in Guwahati and Shillong, India.\n“This was my second opportunity to represent Pakistan,” says Tariq. “It’s always a proud moment to hear your name with the name of your country. However, there was a greater responsibility for me to do well as we were competing against our neighbour countries and had a reputation at stake.”\nThere is often more than just a reputation at stake in any relations between South Asian nations. Tensions between Pakistan and India in particular have been rising in recent months, but Tariq believes that events such as the Games are a way to dissipate those tensions to some extent.\n“Such events improve relations,” he says. “Going into the Games, I thought the Indian public would be hostile toward us Pakistanis, but I was stumped by their welcoming nature. Such events are really important to erase misconceptions about other countries.”\nTariq believes that the Lions competitive club for swimming should be turned into a full-scale varsity program, but he encourages members of the York community to try swimming. The pool is “a great place to make some good friends,” he says.\n“Swimming definitely makes me focus more on school and of course, physically, it’s the best sport to play in my opinion as it engages all of your muscles, keeping you fit and active.”\nTariq quickly returned from South Asia, bronze medal in hand, to represent his university in the Ontario University Athletics championships in London. There, he made it to the final round of the men’s backstroke, in which he came in at 13th place, and in the 50-metre he broke his own York record to set a new record of 26.63 seconds.\nIn the future, he hopes to compete in the upcoming 2016 FINA World Swimming Championships in Windsor, and in the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nTariq has made Pakistani students at York proud. “We are extremely happy to see our member Haseeb Tariq accomplish such a milestone and set a record for others,” says Muhammad Nisar, president of York’s Pakistani Students Association. “We encourage him to work harder and accomplish all the goals that he wishes to succeed while representing himself as a proud Pakistani.”\nFollow us on instagram,  @excalphotos \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nRobbie Ahmed, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Visual Aids\nAt my first month at the Alliance for South Asian Aids Prevention, it was hard to orient myself and process what was happening around me. I saw a South Asian man next to me eat Indian food with his hands, a man that looked a lot like the ones my family would invite over for dinners, except for the fact he was queer, just like me. \n\nThat image stirred an emotional reaction in the bottom of my stomach. I had two images before my eyes that I could not reconcile: queerness and my own culture.\n\nLast time I remembered being at a South Asian gathering, I was carefully dodging aunts in the hallway who bombarded me with numerous questions regarding marriage, short hair, and lack of saris in my wardrobe.\n\nThis time though at ASAAP those aunts instead asked me about my preferred pronoun and talked freely about queer issues. Never would a young South Asian queer transboy imagine such a place existed.\n\nThese days, I run a queer program at ASAAP called Lassi, yes, just like the South Asian drink, except that it is a support space for young queer South Asian men who like men from ages 16-29.\n\nDuring biweekly Lassi sessions, young queer South Asian men gather together to socialize over games, music, and food. These men can be desi and queer at the same time.\n\nThere is, however, some controversy on why spaces like Lassi, exclusive to only queer-identified South Asian men, still exist.\n\nWhen so many open queer support groups are sprouting up in the vast city of Toronto, why have one only for queer South Asian men?\n\nWhen a South Asian individual comes out as queer, they find themselves not in conflict not only with their family, but also with their culture and identity.\n\nEvery tradition and every cultural practice they were taught are all challenged by a simple announcement of one’s queerness.\n\nIt is hard to reconcile those aspects of oneself when one is taught to believe that queerness does not exist outside of the Western culture.\n\nASAAP was created when a South Asian couple passed away from AIDS-related illnesses and were not able to get resources and treatment due to linguistic barriers and stigma within South Asian communities regarding HIV/AIDS.\n\nSimilarly, these South Asian youth feel deep isolation and shame regarding their sexuality and identity.\n\nWith culturally specific groups, these men can freely share their love for South Asian culture, songs, dances, literature, and food once again, as well as find resources and support with a reduced cultural or language barrier.\n\nYouth can also seek confidential one-on-one peer support where they can freely ask questions regarding sexuality, sexual health testing, or just personal concerns. They will be respected for their identity and not be turned away due to their sexuality or gender identity, which is a great concern for many South Asian queer youth.\n\nLassi also strives to provide free TTC tokens to groups in regions such as Scarborough to help attendees come to the space, regardless where they live in Toronto.\n\nThere is definitely a need for cultural-based programs such as Lassi to reduce this isolation and stigma, to help young racialized youth embrace their cultural traditions, find pride, and have a familiar support space to the one they thought that they have lost and one that looks and feels a lot like their home.\nLike us on Facebook,  @excalweb \n ']","['https://www.excal.on.ca/health/2016/02/26/lions-swimmer-tariq-wins-medal-breaks-records-at-south-asian-games/', 'https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2016/02/26/a-profile-of-lassi-a-group-for-culture-and-queerness/']",0.7966115474700928,0.20393194258213043,0.26377308927476406

For the past few years, Yashinsky, director, and Rodgers, producer, have worked to bring the Storytelling Festival to the city, which truly lives up to its name. The festival, which will be hosted at various locations across the city from April 1 to 10, gives storytellers centre stage to share their tales.\nStorytelling styles vary from place to place, giving the festival a unique element as it brings the globe to one stage with diverse storytellers.\n“In African and West Indian cultures, storytelling can be very animated and participatory. In First Nations traditions, the storyteller can be quiet and intimate. The one thing every storytelling style shares is that the teller has to make the listener want to know what happens next,” says Yashinsky.\nThis year’s festival will be bringing a lot more to the table than previous years. Alongside Harbourfront Centre and TD, the festival will be offering two days of family storytelling. There will also be collaborations with Aga Khan Museum and Ismaili Centre Toronto.\nOne thing that this festival does is bring the art of storytelling to life in a way that everyone can enjoy.\nThere is an opportunity for everyone to get involved. Before the festival kicks off, the Storytellers’ Camp from April 6 to 8 will host workshops, performances, and story talks for participants. Festival goers can get face-to-face with some of the storytellers and learn about their art in an intimate setting.\n“I am especially excited for the life-changing afternoons with Ron Evans and the Telling Life Stories workshop with the brilliant and multi-award winning author and performer Ivan Coyote,” says Rodgers.\n“I was also thrilled to watch attendees who had never told stories before discover their love of this art form. I’ve seen several of them onstage since and it’s been wonderful to see them captivate an audience.”\nThis year, stories will be closer to home. Storytellers Coyote and TUUP (Godfrey Duncan), will be coming to Seneca College on April 6 at 12:00 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., as part of a co-production with Seneca College’s School of of Arts and Science.\nCoyote shares life stories, has won awards for their writing and performances, and has travelled across the globe on tour. Coyote’s most recent work was a collaboration with musician Rae Spoon titled Gender Failure.\nTUUP (The Unorthodox, Unprecedented Preacher) brings stories from his Guyanese and African roots and has performed all over Europe, North America, and Africa.

This panel centers its solutions on this.”\nThe Bonn panel brought together several researchers and regional government representatives from Canada, the U.S., India, and Germany, where they all discussed the role of multi-stakeholder dialogues under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Action.\nKenneth Shockley, an associate professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, shares his own approach to his portion of the panel. “I am interested in the different ways that we understand ‘working together,’ and I wanted to impress upon the audience the importance [doing so] in a way that fosters trust among all parties,” he states.\n“This collaborative approach gives a productive way of listening to other parties, working in a manner that is focused on the problem at hand, and not any individual parties’ preconceived— and therefore biased—notion of how we might solve that problem.”\nSander Chan, adjunct assistant professor at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development at Utrecht University and researcher with the German Development Institute, focused on similar themes.\n“I was invited to speak on a conference I organized called ‘Interconnections,’ which discussed how the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement are connected,” he says.\n“Discussions focused on the role of state, non-state, and subnational actors, who could help deliver on both agendas.”\nAlthough the sustainable development and climate change processes are politically separate, they contribute to the same reality.\n“There is much interest in connecting climate action to sustainable developmental goals,” said Boran.\nThe panel participants were pleased with the headway of the Bonn panel, but all agree that more action and research is still necessary.\n“Idil and I, and our colleagues involved in this work, plan to move onward with a collective, broad, and interdisciplinary research that will take us into uncomfortable places, as the solutions to climate change require difficult decisions to be made,” says Bazely.\nShockley insists further research should be pursued to look for points of synergy between the different non-state actors (states and provinces, financial actors, and NGOs) to make sense of the new international policy landscape.\nChan, meanwhile, offers a starker truth.\n“We have only 45 years before our carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius warming will be used up,” he comments. “Before [we] have a research project funded, conducted, and that can present final results, it’s probable that we [will have] already passed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.”\n“Building interfaces between decision makers and researchers is, in my view, more urgent, to bring\xa0knowledge and solutions into the decision-making space,” he adds.\nStarting her sabbatical research in July, Boran will spend three months at the German Development Institute, then two more as a researcher in residence at the Centre for Excellence at Goethe University in Frankfurt/ Main to continue work on her study manuscript.\nShe aims to develop a political theory of climate action on a global public sphere.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2017/05/26/york-philosophy-prof-climate-change-un-event/'],0.8400291800498962,0.6059026122093201,0.4767642617225647

We’ve hidden this shame under countless straightening until our hair starts to break off; we spend hundreds of dollars investing in long 18-inch Brazilian hair because we want to meet society’s demands. This is ruining young black girls’ psyche, because our “kinky curls” are considered “not pretty.”\nI spoke with entrepreneur Jacintha Wallen-Charles, and I asked her if little girls are taught to be ashamed of their curls. “Not only society, but the black community itself. It’s small things that we don’t recognize, like ‘you should sleek back your edges,’ or ‘what are you going to do with that hair?’,” she says.\n“Having baby hairs in its natural form is frowned upon by other black girls, because it is seen as ‘not doing your hair.’ Moreover, people of other races often look at our hair and ask: ‘What are you going to do with it?’ as if its natural state isn’t adequate enough to wear in public.”\nI remember when I got my first weave—it was an Onyx, 18-inch, straight, 1B. When I strutted down the aisle, about to graduate, with my weave sewn into my head, I felt beautiful. I no longer felt uncertainty. It gave me an identity. They called me a weava-diva! I could get any colour, style, and length.\nWeaves allow black women to feel beautiful; it allows us to hide from what we were given with. Ask a black woman if she’d rather wear her natural kinky curls or a Tokyo Stylez, custom made, 20-inch, Indian Remy hair, and see what she says.\nThe thing is, we have become so comfortable in the shell that we’ve grown up in, that it gets harder to break out of it.\nI spoke with a fellow employee, Jaya Hance, a black woman who often wears her hair straight. I’ve never seen her hair in it’s natural, kinky state, so I asked her why. “When I was growing up, I was moved from a mixed-culture school to a pure white school, and they didn’t understand my different hair. Because of this they made me feel different, and always pointed it out. This little boy even told me my hair looked like poop,” she says.\nEven if we come from different ethnicities, there should be a boundary where parents should teach their children right from wrong—and they don’t. Due to the bullying, Hance felt ashamed to wear her hair in natural braids, or out in an afro.\nWe have been criticized by the media, by society and even by our peers. But now the media, society and our peers want to take credit for African beauty and culture. Let me educate everyone. When Miley Cyrus started wearing what many called “Space Buns,” it got a lot of hype.\nThese Space Buns, however, are actually called Bantu knots, a hairstyle said to originate from Zulu tribes in southern Africa. When the Kardashians started donning what everyone called “Boxer Braids,” it became a hot new trend. Boxer braids are called Cornrows, and have been found in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara, dating as far back as 3,000 B.C., particularly in the Horn of Africa and West Africa.\nThese hairstyles are not new fashion trends that Miley Cyrus and the Kardashians came up with out of the blue. It shows the twisted way that, on a black girl, it’s seen as ugly—but on a famous white person’s head, it’s seen as trendy and new.\nHow are they going to look down on black beauty, then try to take credit for it? The problem is giving recognition to black women who’ve had these styles forever. Don’t rob us of that recognition. Don’t rob our culture from us.\nBlack women have started to become comfortable without the wigs, sewn-in weaves, and the constant straightening, because we’ve realized that we are beautiful; that we should not care about society’s opinions.\nWallen-Charles stated Viola Davis and Lupita Niyong’o, who are both Oscar-winning black actresses, show their natural hairstyles on the red carpet with confidence. We are seeing the beauty of the curls. We shouldn’t feel different nor ashamed, and instead, feel liberated and proud.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/supplements/black-history-month/2018/02/17/my-kinky-kurls/'],0.21405433118343353,0.8338568210601807,0.15680135786533356

Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a medley of holidays or none at all, December is often regarded as the “ideal” time of the year. It is a month typically free from university classes and full of non-stop gift-giving and quality time with family and friends.\nHowever, for some, this period is far from being “the most wonderful time of the year” – but why is that? Why is this time of year, synonymous in society with glee and relaxation, often not experienced by many in such a joyous way?\nSome may categorize themselves as having the “holiday blues” during the holiday season.\nAccording to Gordan Flett, Personality & Health professor, the holiday blues is “the idea that a substantial proportion of people feel sad and depressed during the holidays. It also suggests someone who is quite lonely and isolated from others.”\nWoo Kim, International Student & Scholar Services associate director at York, says the holiday blues may be experienced for various reasons for some international students in particular.\nKim describes that an international student may be in a mundane mood because “they may not be going home over the December holidays and won’t get to see their family and friends. This may lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, at least temporarily.”\nAparna Mehta, third-year English student at York, explains how she was impacted during the past holiday season when she was unable to visit her family in Delhi, India.\n“The holiday season tends to be a time for family. As I was unable to travel back home and be with my family last year, I did feel a little unhappy and homesick.”\nKim also explains how “for other students, this may be their first, or one of their first, winter. If they’re from a country where the weather stays fairly mild or hot in winter and stays sunny, the early darkness and grey winter days may cause them to feel less energized and ‘blue.’”\nSarah Irwin-Gardner, York’s Graduate Student Wellness Services manager, lists some factors that generally may impact students’ well-being during the holiday season. One factor Irwin-Gardner mentions is “feeling pressure to produce or experience a ‘perfect’ holiday.” Cassandra Carcasole, third-year English student, describes how she feels this expectation Irwin-Gardner describes.\n\xa0The holidays do cause some stress for me because there are so many things on my mind. I also feel like I need to buy everyone the perfect gift, so there’s always some pressure there,” Carcasole says.\nBrian Villa, third-year Business Administration student, also has experienced this type of pressure. “My stress derives more from what to do on Christmas so that everyone will be happy.”\nIrwin-Gardner discusses how the holiday season may affect a student because they tend to “manage multiple demands on one’s time.” Such demands may include balancing time for holiday shopping and social gatherings with time for final exam and assignment preparation, on top of working a part-time job.\n“Other than being a student, I work two part-time retail jobs. Right now, it’s definitely a lot. I don’t have any days off,” Carcasole says.\n“I am able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments, but it is not easy and definitely not the ideal situation.” Villa adds.\nCharles Matthew Mishiyev, second-year history student, explains how becoming accustomed to a hectic routine is his key to balancing a hectic season.\n“I am somewhat able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments because I have worked in retail during the holiday season for two years and have adapted to it,” Mishiyev says.\nAdelaide Dolha, third-year Devised Theatre student, recalls her experience working in retail during the holiday season.\n“Last year when I worked in retail, I had more hours due to more people being needed and these were 5 a.m. shifts. I even had one on Christmas Eve which made me tired for the rest of the day.”\nAnother factor Irwin-Gardner adds to the list of potential reasons for stress during the holidays is an “increase in academic pressure and the effects of working intensely leading up to the holidays.”\n“I am able to balance my schedule as I usually start preparing for the holidays only once exams are done,” Dolha adds.\nIrwin-Gardner also lists “feelings of isolation or feelings of loneliness” as a contributing factor for one’s holiday blues. Silsila Bahrami, fourth-year communication studies student, shares her feelings of discontentment with this time of year.\n“I do not typically enjoy the holiday season. I am not a fan of the cold weather and I usually feel left out of the festivities, as my family does not celebrate the holiday season. I try to keep myself busy during this time period, but it is difficult when most people are away and/or celebrating while I am at home.”\nOther factors listed by Irwin-Gardner include: “Distance from loved ones; increased financial demands/pressures; change in routine; missing loved ones who are far away or no longer alive; seasonal effects on mood (SAD), and difficult or distressing family dynamics.”\nIf you feel as if you may have experienced, or are currently experiencing, the holiday blues, there are other students at York, and in the country, who share your discontentment. But, how many students do the holiday blues impact?\nUnfortunately, there has not been any research conducted that has established a relationship between the holiday season and an increase in stress and unhappiness among students, according to Flett. Nonetheless, there are still students who may feel a sense of unhappiness at one point during the holiday season due to the aforementioned potential factors.\n\xa0I look at the holidays as a time for relaxation and enjoyment for some people, but potentially hellish for others. It is a difficult time for any student who is preoccupied mentally and emotionally with not having done well in the fall term or who is returning to a less than optimal interpersonal situation or who is just feeling isolated and lonely,” Flett explains.\nFlett also further supports the factors listed by Irwin-Gardner as to what could contribute to the holiday blues.\n“It is more stressful for those who are focused on happier times in the past and why aren’t they so happy now. Or, for someone who is overly focused on comparing their holiday experience to the idealized accounts of life over the holidays provided by other people. Also, some people really buy into the notion of the perfect holiday season and they can exhaust themselves and others by trying to live up to an idealized image of how it should be or could be. Others are disquieted because they are so work-obsessed, they don’t know how to respond during times when the focus should be on rest and replenishing oneself.”\nLouise Hartley, York’s Psychology Clinic director, comments on how marketing is also a contributing factor for those experiencing the holiday blues. Marketing has surrounded us with a narrative of how the holidays “should be,” despite it being unattainable for some.\n“The holiday season can be difficult for anyone because there are these expectations built in through the excessive advertising – that this is a ‘happy’ time of year.”\nSo, how can one cope with the holiday blues?\nMayo Clinic shared 10 tips to coping with stress and depression during the holidays. The Mayo Clinic staff recommended that if you are experiencing the holiday blues for any of the aforementioned reasons, you should try to do the following: “acknowledge your feelings; reach out; be realistic; set aside differences; stick to a budget; plan ahead; learn to say no; do not abandon healthy habits; take a breather, and seek professional help if you need it.”\nIf you often feel lonely during the holiday season or you feel yourself feeling in such a way in the next few weeks, registered psychologist, Dr. Ganz Ferrance explained to CTV News that “if you are isolated from your family, find other ways to connect with people. Make time for friends or volunteering to help combat loneliness.”\nKim provides information on how York students will be able to connect with other students staying in the city to avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness this holiday season.\n“International students who aren’t going home and staying in Toronto may want to connect with other international students staying over the break or with domestic students who live locally. This year, York International will be running a few events and outings in the city for any international students staying in Toronto so they can connect with other students staying over the break.”\nThe Mayo Clinic staff put it best: “Don’t let the holidays become something you dread. Instead, take steps to prevent the stress and depression that can descend during the holidays. Learn to recognize your holiday triggers, such as financial pressures or personal demands, so you can combat them before they lead to a meltdown. With a little planning and some positive thinking, you can find peace and joy during the holidays.”\nIt is very important to reach out for support if you have concerns about your mental health or wellness during the holiday season or at any point during the year.

(Courtesy of Mahdis Habibinia)\nAs a Halloweenie, you can imagine my disappointment in finding out that the most exhilarating time of the year was rendered obsolete by the COVID-19 — which, for me at least, is the scariest Halloween yet. However, one of my all-time favourite traditions every year was a different kind of scare: haunted houses! Casa Loma’s Legends of Horror, Screemers, terrifying escape rooms — name it and I was there. Granted, if you ask my friends they will tell you I shriek my lungs into pneumothorax every time, but I live for the experience! This year, however, I’m indulging in a virtual, at-home experience including online escape room games (yes, they are a thing, and yes, there are creepy ones best played with the lights off), and horror movies in the dark with friends (or while carving pumpkins)! As long as I get my Halloween fright this year, the holiday may not be completely dead (pun not intended) after all.\xa0\nSPOOKY, BUT LOWKEYVictoria Silman, Managing Editor\nShark costumes, parties, and travelling were 2019’s Halloween theme. (Courtesy of Mahdis Habibinia and Victoria Silman)\nEvery year around this time, I am usually in the works of planning a Halloween bash. My roommate and I would probably be returning from Value Village or the Dollar Store, where we would pick up all the things we need to decorate. We’d be changing the lightbulbs to black, green, and red, and we’d be decorating the apartment to the nines. We’d be sending out invites to all our friends, and researching the best bar to go to around 11 p.m. to save our neighbours from all the noise. And, we’d be preparing the best jello shots you’ve ever had. Last year, we celebrated on the weekend prior to Halloween, and we made our way down to Clinton’s at Bloor and Christie. On Halloween, I was in Mexico with my mom, dressed in a shark costume and handing out candy to children (as they sang Baby Shark to me, which made me regret everything). The next day, I also had the honour to celebrate Día de Muertos with the local Mexican community. But, this year we will create new memories, even if they are toned down. We might play some horror video games, or, perhaps watch some scary movies, carve some pumpkins, and bake some of those delicious Halloween Pillsbury cookies. Halloween is one of my favourite holidays, and even if it may look different this year, we can still make it special.\nLONG LIVE SPOOKY SEASONJonathan Q. Hoidn, Copy Editor\nJust a couple of boneheads. (Courtesy of Jonathan Q.

What DO you do on Halloween? That’s what this article is about, discussing what we do on Halloween? You’re telling me that people treat Halloween as a one-day thing and NOT a month-long spectacle like it deserves? Did the event’s in the movie Trick or Treat ever actually happen? Is The Nightmare Before Christmas not based on a true story? Do people watch scary movies ONLY on October 31st and not year-round? Is Spooky Season even a real thing? Am I going crazy or is my whole life just a lie!?\nJokes aside, I watch Halloween with my family every year.\n— R.I.P. Spooky Season 2020.

I’m not sure where the apostrophe went, but it was one of the things that fascinated my eight-year-old self about the holiday. It just seemed so mysterious and magical…what purpose did an apostrophe in the middle of two of the same letters serve? No one knew. Where is the apostrophe now? No one knows. Spooky.\xa0\nAt any rate, everything about Halloween — clearly including grammatical minutiae — has always enchanted me, as someone who doesn’t personally partake in the festivities. With my cultural background, trick-or-treating wasn’t really something my family chose to participate in. The idea of taking candy from strangers is something that scared my Indian grandparents far more than any costumes we could ever come up with! So for me, Halloween is like the Met Gala — I have the most fun judging everyone’s costumes and envisioning elaborate ones of my own. (And enjoying the discounted candy the week after).\nFROZEN HALLOWEENSarah Garofalo, Assistant News Editor\nTaken last year on campus right before Halloween, because nothing says ‘spooky’ like a miniature pumpkin photoshoot. (Courtesy of Sarah Garofalo)\nLiving in Northwestern Ontario, Halloween has always been a testament to how long you can bear to walk in the sludge outside, and go trick-or-treating in snow before calling it quits due to frostbite and numbed fingers. Despite all that, my frozen Halloweens are some of my favourite childhood memories, even when I had to wear snow pants and a parka over all of my cute costumes. Over the past three years, with living in Toronto, I’ve gotten the chance to experience a warmer, more social Halloween at York. You can walk outside in your insufficient costume without being camouflaged with snow, and you can wear heels outside without worrying for the safety of your toes. Because of COVID-19, I am back in my snowy town, surrounded by an incredibly disappointed family. Halloween was always my family’s favourite holiday; we’d dress up our house like it was a Blumhouse set. We’re all disappointed that we can’t live it up spooky this year, but we’re admittedly happy that I am home to be able to experience a good ol’ fashion below freezing Halloween.\xa0\nA HOMEBODY HALLOWEENShivam Sachdeva, Health Editor\nA little throwback to about 15 years ago when my sister and I were about to venture off trick-or-treating. Big credit to my parents for being able to stop us from fighting for two seconds and pose for a picture. (Courtesy of Shivam Sachdeva)\nHalloween has been a pretty eventful time of year for me since as early as I can remember. Whether it was the innocent days of dressing up in a costume I’d planned months in advance or being taken trick-or-treating by my parents, or even all the fleeting memories captured inside bars and house parties years later, the 31st of October has always been far from dull. This year however, as we all know, the usual celebrations won’t be possible. But rather than sulk about what cannot be, I am trying my best to accept the situation simply for what it is: a pause on life. The more social activities of Halloween have gone on for years before this pandemic and there’s no reason to think they won’t continue once we’re out of this mess. This year, I’ve put up some Halloween decorations around the house to keep the spirit up as much as possible, but the holiday will likely be a lot more laid back and family-oriented than it has been before. Scary movies, board games, and lots of candy will likely be on the agenda. And though it isn’t what I would have expected going into this year, I am looking forward to all of it.\xa0\xa0\nHALLOWEEN CANCELLED…TWICE!Sergiy Slipchenko, Sports Editor\nHalloween was not something we celebrated or even heard of in Ukraine. When my family moved to Toronto, in October of all months, I had quite the puzzling experience. I was suddenly immersed into the spooky atmosphere already well underway at school. I was already frightened of school as I didn’t know English and everything seemed foreign to me — the fact the walls were plastered with paper cutout witches, skeletons, and gravestones was not helping. Eventually I understood what the holiday was about so I was able to relax and enjoy the traditions — pounds of free candy were certainly persuasive. Although I enjoyed the holiday, it never caught on as a yearly tradition. Many years went by and I have yet to properly go trick-or-treating, until this year — or so I thought.\xa0\nMy three-year-old daughter was excited to go in her Elsa dress (after some negotiation I got picked as Kristoff instead of Olaf). We planned to go out and reap free candy, and quite honestly I was excited to go out for the first time as well. Unfortunately, the news of COVID-19 resurging crushed those dreams and I was dreading how to explain to a three-year-old that it may not be safe to go this year. However, just a week before Halloween, fate did its thing and disappointment was avoided…kind of. After watching a “scary” Halloween episode of her favourite cartoon, she has condemned “Lalloween” (as she calls it) and decided we will be skipping it in favour of Christmas. So while you celebrate at home with pumpkins, scary movies, and candy, you now understand why my living room has a christmas tree, christmas music, and a strict ban on all Halloween paraphernalia. Hopefully next year the allure of candy will outweigh any fear and I will finally get to go trick-or-treating.\nMY SPOOKY SEASON BIRTHDAYCéleste A. LaCroix, Arts Editor\nSome brief decorations in my house since our celebrations haven’t happened yet. (Courtesy of Céleste A. LaCroix)\nWhile Halloween has been cancelled around the world, it seems like my roommates didn’t get the memo. I’m not sure if it’s their Halloween spirit or if they’re just trying to make my Halloween birthday feel special, but the second our Friends-giving dinner was over, they turned our whole house into a miniature Halloween Haunt. Believe me when I say it, theatre kids do not take decorating lightly. Halloween happens to be only a day away from my birthday, so naturally, I’ve hosted the Halloween parties every year since I stopped trick-or-treating. The only difference this year will be the size. Instead of inviting over half my program and filling my house with strangers, I’ll be celebrating both my birthday and Halloween with my roommates and girlfriend. We’ve been planning activities like pumpkin carving and costume contests because apparently the global pandemic is no match for Spooky Season. I have no doubt that this year will be different, but certainly not less special, as my friends made sure of that.\xa0\nFROM WALLOW’S EVE TO ALL HALLOWS’ EVEBhabna Banerjee, Creative Director\nOur Film & TV themed Halloween party, 2019. (Courtesy of Bhabna Banerjee)\nFairly new to the country, the excitement of this day didn’t quite strike me for the longest time. Perhaps, it was because the holiday coincided with my father’s birthday, or that it coincided with the largest festival in my culture — each Halloween spent here meant that I was missing the two most important days of my year, thousands of miles away from my family and friends. And no surprise there, but pretty much every year, I chose to wallow. It’s clear that in my short time here I haven’t created any traditions, but after three years of avoiding this day, last Halloween I finally gave it a try to spend the day with my friends rather than alone on my couch (even though this might have been the spookier option). I commuted an hour to attend a good ol’ Village Halloween party that a group of film kids religiously hosted, and not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was also transported to the most extraordinarily decorated house (apparently film kids too, do not take set decoration lightly). To stay on-brand, we spent the night dressed as and talking about film characters, and I left quite happy after having a chance to channel my inner Cher Horowitz. Granted, this year I’ll be back to my old ways of spending the holiday cooped up on my couch alone, spooked out by absolutely everything going on outside. I now have fond memories of this holiday to hold on to, from a time that was spent here, with a new (and pretty amazing) family.\n \nInterested in becoming a contributor?

264,York,2021-01-29,journal_data/txt/York/2021_01_29.txt,"['The same monotonous routine of moving from your bed to your desk every day is a daunting thought that, this time last year, no one would have guessed to be the reality of the majority of our community only two months later. But alas, here we are — more exhausted than ever (mostly because of the mentally draining life of stagnicity), and stressed about the economy, our health, and our well-being.\nTalking about mental health is now, more than ever, critical for our population. For students like Wasifa Noshin, a third-year theatre production and design student, mental health has been a prevalent concept throughout her life — something that I’m sure many students find relatable.\xa0\n“My perspective on mental health has changed quite a lot over the past few months and years,” Noshin says. “When I was younger, I would always put my mental health on the back burner even though I was simultaneously struggling with multiple mental health struggles of my own and I chose not to prioritize it.”\xa0\nWith Noshin’s perspective on mental health shifting throughout her life, it begs the question of whether mental health is more prominent now, or whether it’s just talked about more.\xa0\nAssistant Professor Jeffrey Wardell, who specializes in substance-use behaviour, says that some mental disorders, such as depression, may be on the rise.\n“There’s some debate as to what might account for apparent increases in the prevalence of mental disorders — it may be that the mental health issues are becoming more prevalent, but it may also be that more people feel comfortable talking about their mental health and are more likely to seek out a diagnosis and treatment because of increased awareness of these issues,” Wardell says.\nIn addition to this, Wardell notes that mental health disorders may be more easily recognizable than they used to be — even the definition of mental disorders has changed over time. “Overall, it’s complicated,” Wardell says, “but at the end of the day I do think there’s a greater recognition of the prevalence of mental health issues and more public discussions of these issues, which is an important change.”\n“I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”\nIn regards to reducing stigma, Professor Marina Morrow of the faculty of health says that, in a positive sense, perhaps the reason for higher diagnoses is the “decreasing stigma around mental health for some forms of mental health problems,” most prominently with depression and anxiety. In addition to this, Morrow notes that the more normalized the language, the higher the possibility that people are “always influenced by our social and economic context,” where “people are more likely to use the language of mental health as a way of expressing any kind of distress.”\nEchoing these sentiments, Professor Megan J. Davies of the department of social science, who is also involved in Madness Canada, adds, “I see a whole new focus on and interest in mental health and addictions. Though for sure there is a widespread distress now during the pandemic, I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”\nFor Noshin, mental health troubles stem from her busy life — something she says she has developed through societal values. “Part of the issue I think stems from the culture that I’m a part of: the hustle and grind culture — this culture promotes ambitions, yet with a huge flaw. The flaw is that our ambitions, accomplishments, and success comes at the cost of our health and mental health.\n“We live in a world where being a part of this culture has resulted in me compulsively checking my emails, social media, and phone notifications at 12 a.m. instead of getting proper sleep — the stress of living up to my bar of accomplishments and having to increase it every time by coming up with new and more innovative ideas,” she adds. “Meanwhile my mind was struggling beyond repair and I just started losing it in my downtime, and lashing out at the wrong people for no reason.”\nIn a statement from Active Minds at York University (AM@Y), a student-run organization dedicated to providing students a safe space to talk about mental health, they say that society definitely seems to be more comfortable talking about mental health.\n“Mediums like the media are normalizing mental health issues and talking about it, so that makes people more willing to talk about it as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that at the same time there is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect,” they state.\xa0\nRegarding the last year, one parched of serotonin, AM@Y adds, “Because of COVID-19, people are feeling more isolated, and this is affecting their mental health. So we would not say it is one or the other; both of these go hand in hand. There is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect and we are more willing to talk about them due to the stigma being reduced.”\nAlongside this, according to a media release published by the Canadian Mental Health Association in June 2020, “the pandemic has caused intense stress and disruption for all people in Canada, and is causing pronounced mental health concerns, including suicidal thoughts and feelings, in various subgroups of the population.”\xa0\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association adds that in 2019, 2.5 per cent of Canadians said they had thoughts or feelings of suicide, while in May 2020, that number rose to six per cent.\nAlongside concerns of suicidal thoughts, substance abuse may be on the rise. “There is some research showing that alcohol and other substance use increased among certain individuals early in the pandemic, but again this is mixed,” Wardell says.\nWardell’s research from the early stages of the pandemic suggest that sound people decreased their alcohol consumption, “probably because they were staying home instead of going to bars and parties,” but also others increased consumption to deal with the stress of the pandemic.\nThe CBC recently reported that Canadians overall have increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, something that Canada’s chief of public health, Dr. Theresa Tam, noted in a statement released on December 31, 2020.\xa0\nWardell adds that research has indicated the increase in alcohol consumption has resulted from “depression and social disconnection, as well as being a parent with young children at home, were associated with drinking to cope during the pandemic.”\nHe adds: “There are definitely some risk factors that may make certain individuals more susceptible to experience drug or alcohol problems during COVID-19.\nIn addition to the pandemic’s increased strain on Canadians, a poll conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found that the mental health of women has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\xa0\nMorrow notes that even the women in her life are experiencing increased hardships as a result of the pandemic. “I even see it amongst a pretty privileged group at the university with my colleagues. Many of them have to be in these meetings all day long and they’ve got small children they’re trying to look after. Their partners may not be working outside of the home or may not be available to support them. They might be single single moms,” she says.\nMorrow adds: “Statistically we’re seeing a lot. I think in regards to Canada, women are giving up their jobs more readily than men and more likely to take on the family responsibilities — and not just at home, but the elder care piece, I think is huge in this as well. The fact that we’ve got a heightened anxiety around our older population, it’s no doubt that women have taken on the care and the concerns on this piece.”\n“Women are giving up their jobs more readily than men and more likely to take on the family responsibilities.”\nBut, Morrow states, other marginalized communities have also borne the brunt of the stress the pandemic has put on the population.\xa0\n“I think if you start to look at race and class into that conversation more, there’s so many people who just don’t have the option to work from home,” she says. “Many of those are women who are working in the health care sector or working as migrant workers in the fields and in agriculture, or in factories. Most sectors are also being terribly impacted, but I think it’s important to look at all those different factors to best understand the impact of the pandemic.”\nDavies adds that our elderly population has also faced increased hardships, pointing out the issues of for-profit long-term care homes (LTC) in Ontario. LTC homes have been a huge topic of conversation in the media over the past year, with detrimental issues coming to light amid COVID-19.\xa0\n“Think about how elderly people with dementia are doubly disadvantaged, and consider what they might do to treat these elders like human beings,“ Davies says.\nOn the other side of the world, Vipul Singh, an international student remotely studying documentary and non-fiction media production at Seneca@York from his home in India, says that COVID-19 has had profound impacts on his community.\xa0\nWith less regulation and more exploitation, Singh says that life has continued as normal due to fear of people losing their livelihood.\xa0\n“Most of the people were very, very stressed out and in fear of what they might lose, such as their jobs — my father included,” he says. “There is this one mindset that goes around and it’s that we have to die anyway, but it’s better to die with COVID-19 than from having an empty stomach. Some of the people I know went to work even during the lockdown.”\xa0\nSingh adds that these people would say: “If I have to die, I left because of hunger. If I do not go to work, I lose my job. And if I don’t have my job, I won’t be able to feed my family.”\nWith this, Singh says that his community has returned back to normal. “It does not seem as if there is a pandemic going on. There are crowds on the street, nobody actually cares about a\xa0 pandemic anymore in the area that I live, in the state that I live, because everywhere I’m going I see a lot of crowds”.\nBut with life returning back to normal in his community, Singh still attends classes via Zoom, despite the frustrating complication of having an unstable internet connection due to his remote town.\nSingh says with his remote location, his internet isn’t necessarily strong enough to get the full experience of a successful Zoom lecture. “If somebody asks if I had to choose between offering classes in person or online classes, I would absolutely go for in-person classes because it has more benefits,” he says.\nWith a lack of social interaction taking hold throughout the world, Children’s Mental Health Ontario has reported that there are increased issues with youth mental health and the pandemic response.\xa0\nWhen asked about increased issues of mental health in students on campus, the AM@Y states they cannot be certain about the effects on the rest of the community, but note their own experiences have proved to be difficult.\nThe members of AM@Y have also noted uncertainties have increased their stress and anxiety levels. “We speak purely from our experiences. A lot of us feel an uncertainty due to COVID-19. There is a suspense that makes people anxious. COVID-19 is like a traumatic experience and the uncertainty of it is more likely to make us feel anxious and depressed,” they say.\n“A lot of us feel an uncertainty due to COVID-19. There is a suspense that makes people anxious. COVID-19 is like a traumatic experience and the uncertainty of it is more likely to make us feel anxious and depressed.”\n“There will definitely be a long-term impact to the mental health of individuals once COVID-19 is over. And like we said, people feel more of a disconnect that makes them feel isolated which affects their mental health,” AM@Y adds.\nFor some students, such as Noshin and Singh, studying from home hasn’t necessarily been more taxing, but it does come with its challenges.\n“It has slowed me down a lot, but that’s a good thing, I think,” Noshin says. “It has really allowed me to step back from the hustle and grind lifestyle. I can really go at my own pace now and it really allowed me to spend time by myself in a productive way.”\nSingh adds that, despite issues arising with online learning, staying home still hasn’t proved to be too taxing.\n“In the past two or three months I have become a very relaxed person,” Singh says. “I’m the kind of person who hates to be at home everyday — so I’m used to traveling a lot, whether it is going to my friend’s house or any other place. Being at home I became lazy, to be honest.”\nWith the difficulties of living in a virtual world, AM@Y says working remotely has made it difficult to gauge the impact COVID-19 has had on the York community.\n“There have always been mental health issues, and because of COVID-19, there have been more factors that add on to pre-existing mental health issues,” they say. “However, we cannot speak with certainty that students have been facing more mental health issues as we have not been able to reach students that easily because of the online system.”\nDavies says that moving forward there is still room for improvement, in language, such as the stigmatization of the word ‘crazy,’ but also treating those with mental health disorders better.\xa0\n“I think overall the greater openness to talking about mental health is really helpful. The stigma is less, but the discrimination against people with mental health differences is no less at all,” Davies says. “They are still largely excluded from the labour market, have difficulty finding housing, and don’t even get me started on how we treat our elders with dementia.”\nAM@Y adds that, going forward, they ask the community to be more open in the conversation about mental health. “People should know they are not alone in the issues they are struggling with. Another thing to point out is that if you are speaking to someone it is important to be empathetic towards others’ experiences and not to be judgemental or insensitive. It is important to be open and accepting,” they say.\n“Also, it is important to understand that just even letting people know you’re there for them is such a big gesture. Everyone’s experiences are valid and real. Some mental health issues can present very differently in different people,” they add.\nNoshin concurs, adding that everyone is facing their own battles, “and they may not be vocal about it.”\nWith everything moved online, Noshin says she dedicates some personal time to help relieve her stress.\xa0\n“Some of my outlets include journaling, reading, and catching up with friends,” Noshin says. “I really just try to do things that put a smile on my face and ease my mind.”\nSingh adds that to relieve stress he catches up with old friends, and tries to stay as busy as possible. “I play games, and I started reading a book. I research a lot of books, and then I start reading them.”\nWhile students may have some outlets for relieving stress, there are still resources available for those who need them.\xa0\nWardell encourages more open discussions about mental health and addiction, as it “is important to raise awareness and decrease stigma around these issues.\xa0\nHe adds, “I would want readers to know that if they are struggling with their own mental health or substance use that they are not alone. For students who need someone to talk to, I would recommend the Good2Talk helpline, which provides confidential support services for students dealing with mental health concerns. They can be reached 24/7 at 1-866-925-5454.”\nStephanie Chung, policy, program evaluation, and data analyst for Student Counselling, Health & Well-being, says their services, while online, are still available for the community.\xa0\n“Student Counselling, Health & Well-being continues to provide service online since the shift to remote service provision in March of 2020,” Chung says “Our reception staff are available on a live phone line, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to support students with general inquiries and setting up meetings with counsellors. Students can access workshops, support groups, and individual counselling sessions through a confidential and secure audio/video platform.”\n \nVictoria is a Documentary and Non-fiction Media Production student at Seneca@York, as well as a Technical Writer at Knockri.

It is, however, not always the best approach for all patients. Dr. Sergey Krylov, a chemistry professor and researcher at York, is conducting groundbreaking research into chemoresistance, which would help predict whether or not cancer patients will resist chemotherapy and tailor their treatment plans to match.\nSome patients may have a pre-existing resistance to chemotherapy, or their tumour may develop a resistance to it over time. Ways to predict this chemoresistance have been sought after by researchers for decades, but there simply haven’t been many reliable methods for most types of cancer. Krylov’s research may be part of the answer.\nResearch into predictors for ovarian cancer is where Krylov begins. “The reason for choosing ovarian cancer is that we anticipate great potential benefits for patients. Currently, near 3,000 women are annually diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Canada,” he says.\xa0\nAccording to Krylov, most of these women are treated with a chemotherapy drug called platinum-taxane, which also has severe side effects. As of now, 25 per cent of the women treated with chemotherapy experience chemoresistance.\n“Ovarian cancer is a very deadly disease, and chemoresistance is an important contributor to the low survival rate of patients in the advanced stages. Developing methods to detect chemoresistance will help doctors choose the appropriate treatments for patients,” adds York biology professor Chun Peng, who is working in collaboration with Krylov.\nTheir research has determined the best strategy to measure the population of drug-resistant cells. Determining the amount of cells in the body that are drug-degrading and drug-extruding will provide a better understanding of how to treat someone with ovarian cancer.\xa0\nCurrently, the research is undergoing a feasibility study to determine the likelihood of completing the research successfully.\xa0\nKrylov’s future plans are to apply his research to a clinical setting. “We will apply this technology for identification and validation of a predictor of ovarian cancer chemoresistance to primary platinum/taxane chemotherapy, which is the first-line treatment for all patients with advanced ovarian cancer.”\nKrylov and his team have been carrying out this research for 10 years, and his team has made major advancements. Working with the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, they have the opportunity to study and apply their research to tissues from various ovarian cancer patients, which will play a role in further developing predictors.\xa0\nWhile the predictors for ovarian cancer patients are major discoveries, they are not applicable to other types of cancers. However, they hope to change this soon.\n“We are developing a new technology for development of chemoresistance predictors. It will be applicable to all cancers, in which chemoresistance is driven by drug extrusion from cells and drug degradation,” says Krylov.\nKrylov and his team’s research could be revolutionary, but he warns that the process will be a group effort. In an interview with Brainstorm, Krylov urged other researchers to join in: “I hope I can convince a good group of researchers to join us; I hope to create a little wave, and that the wave would grow, and more and more people would join this effort.”\xa0\nTo read the research article, visit the website here.\n \nInterested in becoming a contributor?

This peaceful, stone-like creature usually lives between 10 to 20 years and can grow up to 19 centimetres, making it the largest toad in the U.S. The psychoactive excretion found in the toad is so strong that dogs who have attacked one have suffered paralysis and even death.\xa0\nThe property found in the secretions that results in the desired effects is known as 5-MeO-DMT — a potent hallucinogenic compound that produces intense effects such as euphoria and powerful auditory and visual hallucinations. Some studies have even suggested long term use of the compound can help treat anxiety and depression.\xa0\n“I think it’s really interesting that a lot of psychedelics are now being brought into the mental health field. Anxiety and depression are very common issues for people of all different backgrounds, and I would love to see more expansion into issues such as PTSD,” says fourth-year health studies student Ameek Singh.\xa0\nThe psychedelically-inclined have also been orally ingesting toad secretions for quite some time now, with the term toad licking being coined to describe a dangerous phenomenon.\nToad licking dates back to 1983 when a man named Ken Nelson, who supposedly was the first person ever to consume the compound in this format, did so and circulated a pamphlet detailing his experiences and the effects the drug had. This soon sparked interest in others to try it as well, and it slowly gained popularity.\xa0\nSome claim the slime found in the toad was used in various Mesoamerican ceremonies and rituals, yet direct and reliable evidence for this has not found its way to scientists, who generally agree that Nelson was the first human to consume it.\xa0\nThe toad’s habitat has been greatly threatened in recent decades by those seeking a psychedelic experience, resulting in the species disappearing almost completely from California. The seeking of an otherworldly experience by our fellow human beings is resulting in toads being overmilked, jeopardizing their survival.\nGlen Kelly, a third-year electrical engineering student who has dabbled in a psychedelic experience, does not see why it would be hard for people to put the toads’ lives first before they think about indulging.\xa0\n“There are so many other psychedelics out there for those insisting on the experience — I really don’t see why anyone would get hung up on specifically wanting 5-MeO-DMT from a toad, especially if they’re being endangered.”\nHope is not lost, however, for those still vying for the effects of 5-MeO-DMT. As it turns out, the compound can be manufactured in a laboratory as a synthetic alternative. A fairly recent study in the ACS Omega Journal shows us that the new method for synthesizing the substance is 99.86 per cent pure.\xa0\nSo, if you happen to one day find yourself stumbling on the Sonoran Desert toad for whatever reason, take a moment to admire it, maybe even get a picture — but for the sake of the species and even yourself, please don’t lick it.\xa0\n \nShivam is a driven undergraduate Political Science student with a penchant for health, wellness, and communicating it to people.

When Shivam is not writing, you can likely find him working out, playing tennis, hanging out with friends or wasting endless hours going down YouTube rabbit holes. \n                \nLicking the toad is not how it’s consumed. That’s not how it’s described by Nelson in his pamphlet and it’s not how it’s used widespread today or ever. In fact that method of injesting the secretion is extremely dangerous, as it contains cardiotoxic steroids. These are burned off when it’s smoked, which is the manner in which it’s used. Guess you should stay in college a little longer. Or maybe learn how to research. Regardless of your intentions of this article, which may be well and good, your blatent disregard of the truth could very well result in someone’s death. Congratulations.\nThe mistakes in this article can literally kill someone if they take it seriously..

Please be a journalist not a repeater.\nIt’s not orally active moron.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nIn September 2020, the Parliament of India passed three bills that aimed to reform the country’s agricultural sector. These laws were protested by farmers’ unions mainly due to the lack of provisions for a minimum support price — a policy that guarantees farmers a minimum price for their produce, unaffected by market demand. Since then, massive protests consisting of thousands of people have been organized by agricultural workers, demanding that these bills be repealed.\nThese protests have so far claimed the lives of many people and resulted in frequent internet shutdowns and hundreds of arrests by the government. The Indian government’s response has raised concerns regarding the erosion of democratic institutions in India and the curtailing of press freedoms.\nThe Indian community, including the Indian diaspora in Canada and elsewhere, have had varied reactions to the protests, indicative of the increasing polarization of Indian politics since the ascension of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in 2014.\nS.H., an Indian international student who requested to remain anonymous, says the protests have further amplified political divides and have even cost them a few friendships.\n“Thanks to the brainwashing done by the ‘Godi media’, meaning lapdog media, a lot of my Indian friends believe that protesting is an anti-national activity, and speaking against a party is speaking against India and its people.”\xa0\nS.H. adds they are often on the receiving end of hate and slurs when they speak out against these policies.\nS.H. further explains they were surprised that Sikhs in particular were being targeted by the government, “Despite seeing last year’s anti-CAA NRC protests, which were protesting Islamophobic laws, being met with violence and brutality. I was surprised that even the Sikh minority would be a target of vilification,” they say.\xa0\nAs the majority of the protests have occurred in the states of Punjab and Haryana, home to majority of the country’s Sikh population, Sikh farmers participating in the protests have been branded separatists by government officials, threatening to undermine support for the farmers.\xa0\nSikh-Canadians, who make up a sizable minority of the Indian community in Canada, are worried that this rhetoric may lead to anti-Sikh violence.\xa0\n“I know a Sikh who regularly goes to protests and helps feed the old farmers. She’s has been speaking out about how people online have been calling for genocide against her people and calling her slurs,” S.H. says.\n“I remember how horrifying it was seeing my university peers using ethnic slurs during NRC-CAA protests, it is not pleasant at all,” they continue. “This just shows how the ruling party’s niche likeable group gets smaller and smaller depending on the situation, and any opposition is hated with ferocity.”\n“There’s a big fear that this protest or this agitation could end up like 1984,” B.C. resident Sukhdeep Singh told Global News, referencing the massacre of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\nSimilar protests have sprung up in Canada in solidarity with the Indian farmers. Sikh-Canadians across the country with ties to Sikh farmers in India have called on the Canadian government to take further action and support the protesters.\xa0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has affirmed the farmers’ right to protest. “Canada will always stand up for the right of peaceful protest anywhere around the world, and we’re pleased to see moves toward de-escalation and dialogue,” Trudeau said according to CBC News, which may complicate an already tense relationship with Prime Minister Modi.\n \nDiego is a communications student at York University’s Glendon campus.

That’s a huge loss.”\nSingh agrees, stating, “International students go through so much stress and risk by paying increased college fees, putting money towards a Guaranteed Investment Certificate, and paying for the 14-day mandatory quarantine.”\nAccording to a joint statement provided by Ford and MPP Ross Romano, minister of colleges and universities, the Ontario government hasn’t made a formal request to ban international students. “We look forward to the federal government providing solutions to reduce the importation of cases and introduction of variants into Canada,” the statement said.\nJohri says while the situation in India is dire, the measures put in place to protect Canada from incoming variants have been extensive. “We are tested three times before we are allowed out of quarantine,” she says.\nHowever, Johri agrees the situation is hard to gauge, with some reports of the B.1.617 variants going undetected in tests. “It’s really a diabolical situation for countries and their leaders,” she says.\nFord and Romano’s statement adds that they are mainly concerned the current travel restrictions are not enough. “Ninety per cent of all cases in Ontario are caused by a variant of concern,” they said.\xa0\n“The variants of COVID-19 driving our third wave are a direct result of weak measures at our borders, which is why we have been calling on the federal government to take a number of additional steps to address this situation.”\xa0\nThe Ontario government has also asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ban all non-essential travel, implement mandatory PCR testing for interprovincial travel, and close the loophole at the land border with a three-day quarantine.\xa0\n \nVictoria is a Documentary and Non-fiction Media Production student at Seneca@York, as well as a Technical Writer at Knockri.

The Ministry of Health reported over the weekend that this big decline in case numbers has resulted in a provincial positivity rate of 1.4 per cent.\xa0\nThis relief in cases can be most appreciated within our hospitals, as COVID-19 hospitalizations saw a drop from 378 on Friday to 336 patients being cared for as of Saturday. Of these patients, 335 are in ICUs and 221 are currently requiring a ventilator to assist in breathing.\xa0\n“Where I work, critically unstable hematology patients requiring ICU admissions for care were having to be triaged in order for them to receive care, sometimes outside of a formal ICU setting due to all the COVID-19 cases we had to take care of,” says Anju Vyas, a pharmacist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.\n“I’ve never witnessed such an acute demand on an already strained nursing, physician and other allied health care staff resource pool.”\xa0\nThe downtrend of case numbers has allowed us to enjoy some freedoms again, as Stage 1 of reopenings began on June 11. This first stage — afforded to us as 60 per cent of adults received one dose — means we can once again gather outdoors with up to 10 people, visit patios, dine with up to four people per table, and shop at non-essential and essential businesses within 15 and 25 per cent capacity respectively. Additional details on what is currently permitted can be found on Ontario’s COVID-19 website.\xa0\nStage 2, set to begin once 70 per cent of adults have received one dose and 20 per cent of Ontario is fully vaccinated, will expand outdoor gatherings to 25 people and indoor ones to five people while patio tables will see an increase to six people.\xa0\nNon-essential retail capacity will also move up to 25 per cent. Amusement parks, town fairs, water parks, sports leagues, and cinemas will be permitted to open during this stage as well. The government states that each stage will be active for at least 21 days before moving onto the next.\xa0\nAs of Monday, 20 per cent of Ontarians have been fully vaccinated — the mark needed to move to the second stage. The province has also announced that it will be moving up second dose appointments for a number of groups shortly, and by June 28 all adults will have the opportunity to get their second dose.\xa0\nWhat remains concerning, however, is the highly transmissible variants currently circulating around the world. Ontario health officials have identified approximately 400 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 variants, the majority of which appear to be the Alpha variant first discovered in the United Kingdom.\xa0\n“With more and more people starting to get vaccinated, I feel safer than I have in a long time. I am, however, concerned with whether or not the vaccines will be able to protect us against the Delta variant,” says third-year health science student Marc Delado.\xa0\nThe Delta variant, first found in India, also remains at large. Last week, Canada saw a 66 per cent increase in COVID-19 cases attributed to the Delta variant, with case counts totaling just over 2,000 as of Friday, June 18. The Delta hotspot list also has some new additions and now includes Toronto, Peel Region, York Region, Waterloo, Porcupine, Halton Region, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Durham, Hamilton and Simcoe Muskoka.\xa0\n“Recent numbers suggest that two doses of the vaccine are still fairly effective against combatting this variant, however, there is still a clear decline in the effectiveness in comparison to combatting the Alpha variant,” says Swar Shah, a first-year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.\xa0\n“For example, the Pfizer vaccine has been stated in a recent study to be 92 per cent effective against the Alpha variant, but 79 per cent against the Delta. However, it is undeniable that the progression of vaccination in Canada is comforting, and I would not believe that any additional measures would need to be taken at this time,” says Shah.\xa0\nWhile accelerated appointment availability has been offered to these locations, it has unfortunately not been followed up with an increased share of vaccine supply.\xa0\nThe Waterloo Region has been hit particularly hard with the Delta variant, with Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang stating that residents should assume it is the “dominant strain circulating in the region.”\xa0\nProxy data for the region has led health officials to believe that 65 per cent of cases between June 6 and 12 were the Delta variant.\xa0\n“I believe that our hope in controlling the Delta variant lies in not backing off on our current vaccination efforts, including appropriate allocation to existing and upcoming hotspots,” says Vyas.\xa0\nOntario and Canada as a whole continue to make solid progress in combatting the pandemic, however, factors like the variants serve as a reminder that it is still far from over. The safest course of action remains following health guidelines such as regularly washing our hands, wearing masks, and maintaining social distance while also staying within the current regulations of Stage 1.\n \nShivam is a driven undergraduate Political Science student with a penchant for health, wellness, and communicating it to people.

After all, with water making up around 60 per cent of our body, it would seem only logical.\xa0\nBut for a select few, water may carry more of a risk than benefit. Aquagenic pruritus is a skin condition “characterized by the development of severe itching on contact with water without observable skin lesions,” according to the Indian Journal of Dermatology.\nAquagenic Pruritus is officially classified as a rare disease. The exact percentage of people with it is difficult to narrow down as it varies greatly between populations, but the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center states that the disease ranges “between 1.4 per cent to 24 per cent across different populations at any given point in time.”\n“Rare diseases often don’t get the funding they require in order to research them further because resources are allocated towards conditions that affect a larger number of people,” says third-year health sciences student Akanksha Patel.\n“While this is a good thing, it unfortunately means that those with conditions that are far less common often don’t get the answers they’re looking for,” says Patel.\nThe onset of this allergy typically begins immediately after skin contact with water of any temperature and can last for an hour or more. It can be so difficult for some to manage that it creates a psychological aversion to bathing.\nThe condition results in intense itching and irritation in parts of the body that come into contact with water. Most commonly affected are the legs, arms, chest, back, and abdomen. The head, neck, face, and hips rarely exhibit symptoms.\nThis condition may sometimes be a symptom of polycythemia vera — a form of blood cancer that results in the excessive creation of red blood cells by the bone marrow.\xa0\nLinks have also been found to other conditions such as hepatitis C infections, T-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome among other serious diseases.\xa0\n“Aquagenic pruritus definitely appears to be highly represented among those with polycythemia vera. Studies have shown that as many as approximately 40 to 50 per cent of those with the blood cancer also show symptoms of this skin condition,” says Swar Shah, a first-year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.\xa0\nAs for why such a condition would develop in the first place, though there are some hereditary links, an official cause remains unknown.\xa0\nResearchers have, however, suggested possible causes that could lead to more knowledge of the ‘why’ behind this disease in the future.\xa0\nProposed causes include increased mast cell degranulation, which means granules of excessive histamine and other compounds are being released into the body by mast cells (a key cell in the functioning of the immune system).\nAnother suggestion is the release of acetylcholine, a compound in the body that “sends signals from nerves to muscles and between nerves in the brain.”\xa0\nThe disease may also potentially be tied to increased skin fibrinolytic activity, during which the breakdown of clots in the skin are accelerated.\xa0\nThere is no specific test to determine if one may suffer from the condition, and diagnosis is typically based on ruling out other possible conditions.\xa0\nGenerally speaking, however, if an individual encounters severe itching or burning consistently when in the contact of water, has no visible skin manifestations, reacts within 10 minutes to two hours of exposure and lacks any other skin condition, aquagenic pruritus may be considered.\xa0\nAs for treatments, there is no singular approach to alleviating one’s symptoms. There have been several treatments used all with varying degrees of success including using skin softeners that repel water, antihistamines and the use of tight-fitting Lycra clothing.\xa0\nA full list of possible treatments can be found here.\xa0\n \nShivam is a driven undergraduate Political Science student with a penchant for health, wellness, and communicating it to people.

352,York,2022-02-19,journal_data/txt/York/2022_02_19.txt,"['To Begin — It’s a ‘We’ Thing\n“Racism is relational.”\xa0\nThis is the astoundingly pervasive phrase that Jennisha Wilson, Senior Manager of Anti-Racism Response at University of Waterloo, repeatedly uses during our conversation about progress made in the fight against racism over the previous year.\xa0\nBefore delving deeper into the discussion of the progress made by York in its fight against racism, as well as the abundant wisdom that Wilson has to offer in my conversation with her, I would like to issue a reminder of sorts, as to why our battle against racism is so important: Racism is not to be taken lightly, for it has taken lives.\nAs we honour this Black History Month, we must remember that Dr. Martin Luther King did not sacrifice himself to save Black Americans from America’s sins — he was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for himself and his people.\xa0\nThe same applies to George Floyd: He did not sacrifice himself to offer the world a revelation as to the insidious nature of America’s policing — he was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for himself and his family. He had just taken on a new job and was in the process of turning his life around to better provide for his daughter, whom he so greatly loved.\nThe same applies to Breonna Taylor: She did not give her life for our enlightenment — she was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for herself and her patients. She was a nurse who had recently taken on longer hours and shifts to aid in the fight against COVID-19 and was killed while in her own home trying to catch rest for her next shift.\nI put it to you that Black History Month should not be the designated time only for a celebration of Black people — Black excellence is something to be celebrated all year round. Neither is it appropriate that in this month we only glamorize our efforts to make a change. Instead, we should consider it a time for honest reflection and transparency, to see that our university incorporates the very same systems that perpetuate the oppression of Black individuals all around the world, and this is something that it is actively working to address.\xa0\nBut when addressing these issues, what should be counted as true progress?\nTrue Progress — A Definition\nIt is crucial that Black, Indigenous, and racialized individuals be at the forefront of the conversation around racism, seeing as oppression is their story, and no one can speak to what progress is better than those who are most affected by it.\xa0\nWilson identifies as a Black woman, stating that she was born and raised by two parents who are immigrants to Canada from Jamaica, continuing to say, “My dad is Black, and my mom is Indian, and I think it’s really important to contextualize where I’m coming from as a settler — a racialized settler to Turtle Island — to understand what progress would look like in this particular context.”\xa0\nIn reflecting on the progress made by our own university in terms of enforcing racial inclusivity, it is imperative that we define what true progress is within this context.\nWhen asked about what she considered to be true progress, Wilson states that “racial inclusivity and progress would essentially be summed up when individuals can be their true authentic selves in spaces, feel heard, have really good health and outcomes for their communities, and when conversations around racial justice are not situated around the basic needs that people need to survive in life.\xa0\n“If we’re having conversations around basic human rights — which are things that we need to survive — we can’t even get to the place of having conversations around how we thrive, how we build, how we transform spaces in a way that allow our communities to really flourish,” Wilson continues.\nYork’s Efforts — A Rundown\nIn keeping with the collective strive that has been made by general society to correct its ways in dealing with race, York has made a concerted effort in the past year to improve circumstances for students, teachers, and staff alike.\xa0\nAs detailed in a joint statement made by President Lenton and Vice President of Equity, People and Culture, Sheila Cote-Meek, York’s plans to achieve a racially inclusive environment include, but are not limited to “hiring a minimum of 12 new Black faculty members by 2023, creating a new physical space to facilitate meetings among Black faculty, staff and students, increasing funding for scholarships, bursaries and other forms of financial aid in support of Black students, and establishing a new, culturally safe tool for complaints about racial discrimination and harassment, available in English and French.”\nThese plans were made in March 2021 during what was considered a wildly successful virtual town hall. In keeping with what Vice-Provost of Students Lucy Fromowitz outlined in a summer 2020 statement wherein she implored the York community to “listen closely before we act.” This town hall was held after consultations with over 200 Black community members.\xa0\nIn the same statement, it is outlined the goals that York has already achieved in this plan, including the following: “Twelve new Black faculty members have been welcomed to the university, with one additional Black faculty member confirmed for 2022,\xa0$150,000 has been committed to support Black scholars in 2021-22, and consultation has begun on the formation of a funding program for Black scholars, with the goal to launch by early 2022.”\xa0\nThe statement added that as part of a $2.25-million commitment over the next three years to advance equity, diversity, and inclusion through community engagement and research activities, “$50,000 per year has been committed to Black community engagement projects and $250,000 per year to Black research and knowledge mobilization projects, beginning in 2022.”\xa0\n“The Department of Community Safety has taken steps to undertake a review of services and to explore alternative community safety models,” the statement also said, adding that the The Centre for Human Rights, Equity and Inclusion will continue to offer its Anti-Racism Training to community members.\nSo, Did YU Do It…Right?\nThe list of changes that have already been made within our university sounds, to be frank, impressive.\xa0\nThe very fact that the town hall was held with the consideration of the opinions of 200 Black folks from our university is a sign that York is paying more attention to Black voices, which is keeping with the notion that Black, Indigenous, and racialized individuals must be the ones at the forefront of this conversation.\nThe hiring of 12 new faculty members means more skilled and talented Black folks getting a stable income — this is money that more than likely gets funneled back into Black families and communities.\nThe establishment of the Black Excellence at York University (BE YU) mentorship program is also a definite plus as it serves as a safe space for incoming Black students to learn and grow from older students who know what it’s like to be in their shoes. This is most definitely worthy of celebration, isn’t it?\xa0\nAnd let’s not forget the funding of projects within Black communities, as well as the lending of further support to Black scholars — these are all wins, are they not?\nWhile these changes sound — and are — impressive, they cannot fundamentally resolve any issues regarding racism because they are what Wilson defines as “add-ons.” In responding to a question about the changes being made within the City of Toronto, Wilson articulates that “the work that they’re doing there is really important and impactful; it has an impact for the community. But when I think about what’s truly needed to address racism, it requires a transformation of the entire system, not just add-ons.”\xa0\nShe further proposes that “the reality is that to address the fundamental issues of racism that we’re experiencing, it requires an entire overhaul and transformation of culture and policies, procedures and how we operate.”\xa0\nMoving forward, structural changes need to be made, or else the ‘progress’ made will not last.\nIn an announcement made in September 2020 by York’s AMPD sector titled ‘AMPD’s Commitment to Equity,’ it is detailed that the AMPD department intends to enforce “Diversity in Faculty Hiring, Increasing BIPOC Student Support, Ongoing Anti-Oppression, Anti-Racism Training,” and more. These changes are all well-intentioned, but to what extent have these changes been implemented effectively by the department, and to what extent are these changes even effective to begin with?\nA Black AMPD student — who wishes to remain anonymous — gave a detailed response as to what their experience has been at York and within the AMPD department, going as far as to explain how York could make more meaningful improvements.\xa0\nThe student says that while they can’t speak for all of AMPD, they have felt safe on campus with some of the initiatives made at York in the past years. “For example, the changes made in course materials provide a better-rounded education that is more inclusive of BIPOC theatre history in North America,” they say.\xa0\n“But I still think that we have quite a long way to go in terms of decolonizing the curriculum. Combatting racism has to go outside of the curriculum and into the daily lives of students, and part of that is having BIPOC instructors in our learning spaces. Students need to be able to see what their lives could potentially look like, specifically in the production area. I’ve noticed that when first-year BIPOC students are making their choice to stream, more go into acting conservatory or devised theatre, and rarely do they go into production.”\nThe student adds that they believe an important part of these choices have to do with the lack of instructors that look like them and that they can relate to.\n“You see a lot of Black actors and performers in the media, but never really see any who work in the background as production managers or sound designers or video editors. And I think it would be beneficial to have more BIPOC instructors in the space to show them that doing production work is a viable career,” they conclude.\nThis student’s response echoes the previous motion that structural changes need to be made.\nFurther evidence of this is the act of vandalism on York’s Keele Campus in January, in which “deliberate damage was caused to Skennen’kó:wa Gamig,” as stated in a York wide email sent out by Lenton. The fact that we are still dealing with racially motivated acts of vandalism on our campus is a clear sign that we still have a long way to go.\nWe Must Embrace Proactive Strategies\nWe have added on new initiatives, bursaries, and racialized faculty. We acknowledge that we are visitors on this land and that change needs to be made. We have been responding to the tragedies of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery.\xa0\nBut responsive strategies can only take us so far.\n“The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions.”\nThere are no two ways about the fact that we have indeed taken steps forward, as a university organization, and as a community. But the only way we can truly make lasting progress from here on out is to embrace proactive strategies.\nWhen addressing the basis of her position as Senior Manager of Anti-Racism Response, Wilson notes that the existence of her job serves as a starting place.\xa0\n“The problem with creating these roles is that they often become glamorized. They often become seen as ‘this is the solution to all our issues’ when I — as one person doing an anti-racism response — can never be the solution. The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions.\xa0\n“I think that there is value and purpose in these roles needing to exist right now because racism is real; it is hurtful,” adds Wilson. “It is impacting Black people, Indigenous people, and racialized people on a daily basis. However, it’s not the end-all-be-all. So, when someone says, ‘our solution to the problem is to create this role to respond to racism’ that tells me that clearly there is not enough understanding of what needs to happen in order for there to be true transformation to implement anti-racism work and to do that work fully.”\nThe most proactive thing our university can do is look inward and change its structure so that it truly embraces and enforces the elevation of Black, Indigenous, and racialized students, staff, and professors.\xa0\nWe as individuals must also embrace the proactive strategy of honest reflection, as it inevitably leads to honest and lasting change. By establishing a lasting change within ourselves and our communities, we can better engage with one another, whether we are the oppressors or the oppressed. This engagement results in the cultivating of meaningful relationships with each other — and isn’t this truly the answer to winning this fight?\xa0\nRacism truly is relational, so, hand-in-hand, let’s continue to push forward for better together here at York.\nA special thanks to Jennisha Wilson for entertaining my questions and lending her time, as well as to the student who willingly contributed their voice to this article.

Or, maybe you’ve noticed that BIPOC characters are not included whatsoever in a story or series where they should be?\nThis is whitewashing.\nMerriam Webster’s dictionary describes ‘to whitewash’ as altering something in a way that favours, features, or caters to white people. As an example, this might be portraying something in a way that increases the prominence, relevance, or impact of white people and minimising or misrepresenting BIPOC people.\n“The erasure of Black, Indigenous and Asian people — especially the darker skinned people within these groups — in order to centre whiteness, is something that I have witnessed countless times,” says Aysha Campbell, a masters student in the department of humanities with a research focus in Black studies. Campbell is specialising in the use of sound and space to depict Black life within literature.\nPratik Virwani, a first-year student studying public relations, says that, “whitewashing, I believe, is more common when it comes to politicians and the side that the news channels are inclined towards. The most common cases and widely used scenarios are when a news channel majorly focuses their coverage on an external event if something negative surfaces about the side they support, instigating ignorance.”\nEvidence of whitewashing is not difficult to find when looking at the statistics — 52 per cent of the members of parliament in Canada are comprised of white males, while they only make up 36 per cent of the population. In an article published by The McGill International Review in 2020, it was found that less than 15 per cent of staff at CBC were BIPOC.\xa0\n“I feel like white washing is very prevalent in historical and contemporary western cultures and media,” says Campbell. “The fact that I read and watched The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo in and outside of school growing up and I never found out that the author, Alexandre Dumas, was a black man until I was an adult is an example of whitewashing.”\xa0\nAlong with politics and journalism, Hollywood films are notorious for whitewashing. As an example, Mickey Rooney, a white actor, played Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961). The role is described as “horribly racist” through Rooney’s over portrayal of stereotypes. Despite being a white actress, Emma Stone played the role of Allison Ng in Aloha (2015), a character who described herself as being a quarter Hawaiian and a quarter Chinese.\nOlivia McClymont, a second-year education student, explains that, “a big example of whitewashing is the overwhelming negative reaction to the new live-action The Little Mermaid being played by a woman of colour instead of someone who is white. Some people are claiming the character as ‘their princess’. The fact that it matters a lot to the community that she can’t be Black is ridiculous.”\nThe Little Mermaid (1989), a popular animated Disney film about, well, a mermaid, is fictional. Ariel is quite literally a mythical creature who has a tail — part of what makes myths and fairy tales so important is that they become cultural products, reflective of our own social evolution.\xa0\nCampbell says that, “the type of erasure that occurs when whitewashing is demoralising to communities of colour because it tells Black people, Indigenous people, Asian people, and other people of the global minority that they are not worthy to be at the centre, to be seen, or to tell their own stories. The lack of representation also hinders the imagination of children of colour when they don’t get to see themselves in the media they are being offered.”\n“Less subtle and more overt examples are the use of white actors to play the roles of characters or depictions of real life Black, Asian or Indigenous people in cinema and TV,” adds Campbell.\xa0 “More recently with TikTok, we have black creators making viral dance trends and white creators copying them, becoming the face of these trends, and getting the credit for them.”\nSheldon Pearce’s article, “The Whitewashing of Black Music on TikTok” published by The New Yorker in 2020, discusses just how prevalent the whitewashing of Black art, specifically music, is on TikTok. They also consider how “the optics play into a long, infamous history of white appropriation of Black arts.”\nCampbell explains that, “the impact that whitewashing has on the financial gains of people of colour can be seen with TikTok and the likes of Addison Rae and Charli D’Amelio, who rose to fame and riches off doing dances and not giving credit to the Black dancers who created them — like Jalaiah Harmon and her Renegade dance —ultimately denying Black creators access to the money, fame, and sponsorship deals they were getting off of doing those dances.”\nAlong with music and dance, whitewashing can also be found in various fashion or makeup trends, including the “clean girl aesthetic”.\nThe clean girl aesthetic, as explained by Nena Lezama in their article “Why the #CleanGirlAesthetic TikTok Trend is Problematic” is a tightly slicked back bun with hair parted in the middle. The look is completed by adding simple gold jewellery accessories, such as hooped earrings or necklaces. This look has been garnered by famous influencers and celebrities, such as Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber, and Kendall Jenner.\nBy becoming a trend, it implies that this look is something new and innovative — but, it’s been rocked by women of colour for decades.\n“This phenomenon with TikTok is not new but part of a long history of white people appropriating Black cultural production and getting the recognition and money off it while the Black creators are erased from history,” explained Campbell.\nMajor fashion companies, such as Louis Vuitton, are exploiting the keffiyeh, a scarf that has become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism, as a high-end fashion item. Meanwhile, individuals are suffering due to political unrest in the Middle East.\nSarah Ayoub, a fourth-year film and media arts student, says that, “I notice in the media how the keffiyeh is being seen. What once was a symbol of resistance for my people is now being portrayed as a fashion symbol that people wear without knowing the meaning of. My family will wear a keffiyeh during the war, but people will wear it as a cool pattern and don’t know why we wear it, nor what it means.”\n“In the fashion world, women are able to wear a scarf over their head and it’s seen as peak fashion, but when I wear the hijab, I get called names and people assume I don’t speak English or that I’m oppressed,” adds Ayoub.\nWhat’s more, religious clothing has historically been stigmatised and persecuted. In countries such as France, Denmark, and India, the hijab has been banned while headscarves flooded runways this past spring.\n“Whitewashing is harmful because the history of these issues gets erased,” continues Ayoub. “When hijabs become just a scarf and no longer a piece of clothing women use for modesty, and keffiyehs become just a pattern being sold by Gucci and Shein, our history gets erased.”\nWhitewashing even goes as far as to impede on the wellness industry.\nReema Kumar, a first-year environmental engineer and biology PhD student says, “I was born and brought up in India and have observed numerous traditions and cultures across the country. After social media took over, I saw a lot of these practices being altered according to the West. Indeed, there is a lot to aspire to, however, certain traditional practices fade away in the masses,”\xa0\nKumar explains that, “yoga and meditation are often ‘sold’ as different products. However, because of the lack of clear understanding of yoga, people are unaware that one is a part of the other. Yoga has been practised in the Indian subcontinent for ages, long before globalisation.\xa0\n“There are numerous aspects to it, and it is not just exercising. It is indeed a great practice of inclusion in one’s life, but a thorough knowledge would bring a lot more wonders than picking up just a few points out of it.”\nNabihah Parkar, in their article published by the Huffington Post in 2022, explains how a yoga teacher was banned from using Sanskrit terms in their practices, as well as chanting “Om” or saying “Namaste.” In addition, there is a general lack of representation of BIPOC yoga teachers in Canada.\n“Everytime I see these occurrences happen, I experience a mixed bag of emotions: frustration, anger, disappointment, annoyance, and even resignation because it’s been happening for so long and so often,” says Campbell. “Even as I’m discussing this topic now, I’m getting heated because of the harm this racist practice causes Black communities and communities of colour.”\nUnfortunately, these examples only scratch the surface of where whitewashing might be experienced. Ayoub further encourages consumers to critically assess items and educate themselves before making purchases. \n“Ask yourself, is this new or have I just seen this on a different skin tone? Is this new or might this have a history behind it, and how can I educate myself?”\n“Whitewashing is a way of diminishing the meaning behind something in one’s culture. Everyone’s culture and background matters, so the fact that someone could think that theirs is more important than anyone else’s is wrong, especially when they claim things that are not theirs to own,” explains McClymont.\nKumar adds to McClymont’s thoughts, saying that there is a vast variety of cultures and traditions in the world and many experiences to be had. “If everything gets seen or experienced from one perspective, we lose the authenticity of it. It’s true that we share our experiences but imposing our perspectives as the ultimate truth does injustice to the original experience,” says Kumar.\nWhile adverse impacts of whitewashing are evident in various forms, it is important to have an open mind, stay informed, and to be aware of the harm that it causes.\n“People need to gain information from various perspectives, even outside their scope of learning,” says Virwani. “Most things taught during our childhood may turn out to be wrong as there is new research and evidence surfacing everyday, so it is important to keep an open mind.”\xa0\n“It is important to develop an understanding about anything you see around you, even if it doesn’t concern you at the moment, it might hold some relevance or connection to a part of your life. Ultimately, and most importantly, don’t judge people or information blindly, negative or positive,” continues Virwani.\nWe must remember to approach new (and already established) ideas with an open mind, always being ready to learn and to show respect to one another. Experiencing and learning new things outside of your own culture can be extremely enriching and provides a well-rounded perspective on the world. While it’s encouraged to appreciate cultures, it’s not okay to appropriate or whitewash.\narts@excal.on.ca                \nSydney is in her third year at York University studying Dance.

Through dialogue and conversations around lived experiences, we examine the kinds of stories we often hear about, and the ones we don’t in hopes that a sense of belonging becomes accessible to all”\nDirk Jonathan Rodricks, director of student engagement, explains that, “this second instalment is part of a series that is dedicated to examining the complexity of identities we hold. The series was inspired by the student stories I encountered in my short time at York as director of student engagement and the many conversations I have had with colleagues such as Marian McGregor, the executive director for the centre for human rights, equity and inclusion.”\n“And really, the idea was born out of the words and magnificent writing of black feminist lesbian poet, writer, and activist Audre Lorde who said in a speech at Harvard University 40 years ago in February 1982, ‘there is no such thing as a single issue struggle, because we do not lead single issue lives’,” continues Rodricks.\xa0\nThis Wednesday, the speaker series will feature Yacobi-Harris, a multidisciplinary artist, educator and filmmaker, whose film, Periphery, will be featured at this event.\n“Periphery is an evocative film that bears witness to ethnic diversity in the Jewish community of Toronto, Canada. Through dance, poetry, and personal narratives, ten Jews of Black/African, Korean, Iraqi, Indian, and South American ancestry challenge perceptions of who is a Jew. Periphery creates space to look, listen, and learn from participants as they share their experiences and explore ideas of representation, intersectionality, ethnicity, race, and sexuality, all while illustrating the feeling of grappling to belong,” says Khalid.\nYacobi-Harris is also co-founder of No Silence on Race, a non-profit organisation dedicated to creating spaces for multi-ethnic Jews across Canada, which she mentions “is crucial to the vitality of Jewish life and the nuanced way we define who is a Jew.\xa0 Whether it be through art, food, tradition, or the cultural differences of how we commemorate life cycle events, featuring diverse Jewish cultures is paramount to our communities in Canada. Periphery was created to be part of how we educate and learn about the diversity that exists within Jewish life in Canada both for Jewish audiences and non-Jewish audiences.”\nTo register for this event, click here.

Now as they redesign the toonie in commemoration of her, this article is written in hopes to expose the dichotomy of a \xa0 government which acknowledges that the land that their institutions were built on were initially inhabited by Indigenous communities, but continues to hold the very colonial relics in place that took these lands.\nSimply put, you can’t apologize to Indigenous communities for the crimes committed against them and then continue to run your government in the name of the British monarch under whose seal these atrocities were carried out. Because, are you really apologizing then?\xa0\xa0\nFirstly, why do we choose to hold onto the monarchy? There aren’t any economic benefits to being a part of the Commonwealth Realm — a term for countries which acknowledge the British monarch as their figurehead. The Commonwealth is the broader term which refers to an international organization largely composed of the United Kingdom’s former colonies, even if they choose not to acknowledge the monarch as their head. The Canadian government’s website concerning Canada and the Commonwealth \xa0states that the Commonwealth is “a forum for deliberation, problem solving, consensus decision making and action on matters of importance to its membership.”\nThis goal can be achieved without making the monarch our official figurehead. After all, we are the second largest contributor to the Commonwealth, having spent around $11 million on the organization last year, as reported by the Government of Canada.\xa0\nI believe the solution is to run a government in the name of our Indigenous communities.For a start, the constitutional figureheads of our country could be representatives from the indigenous population. So, instead of the British monarch as the nominal head of Canada you could have the ‘Chief’ or any other title that the indigenous communities of Canada settle upon as appropriate. The same should apply to other largely ceremonial positions like ‘the Lt. Governor’ and ‘Governor General’. The term ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be phased out by a new phrase that represents the claim of the indigenous population over Canada. If we had to have a monarch, shouldn’t it be an indigenous person? Or perhaps words like ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be changed to a phrase which acknowledges Canada as the land of all people, but in the language of the indigenous population, to change the starting point of Canada’s history from one based on British expeditions to one that begins with this land’s settlement by the First Nations.\nWe can simply have Indigenous communities vote for a leader they believe should be the constitutional head of our country and for each of the provinces and territories. Organizations like the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) and Congress of Aboriginal People (CAP) represent the interests of a substantial portion of Indigenous people, and the chief of the Assembly of First Nations is elected by the representatives of its Member Nations. The procedures for elections to the post of a First Nations Chief and Councillors have also been laid down under the Indian Act and First Nations Elections Act. Hence, these elected individuals would be a representation of the will of the indigenous population of Canada and if there is any party who deserves at least a nominal claim over this wonderful country, it is Indigenous communities.\xa0\nThis also sits very well with our ideas of truth and reconciliation. The relative benefit is representation. How many Canadians know the National Chief of AFN, RoseAnn Archibald, as compared to Queen Elizabeth II? At the very least, this change would bring 14 more members of the Indigenous community to the fore of national politics and the public eye, replacing the Monarch, Governor General and Lt. Governors of the provinces with representatives from the indigenous community. These would be 14 people who have been selected because of their relationships to Indigenous communities and identity, making\xa0 it their job to represent the interests of their community with these ceremonial powers given to them, instead of a vestige of a foreign power. It might also make the Indigenous community feel better represented, as they find their place in this diverse nation. The only additional cost is changing the names on the paperwork.\xa0\xa0\nThe island nation of Barbados recently stopped acknowledging the British monarch as their\xa0 constitutional head. While King Charles III continues to remain the official head of 16 nations, the process of removing the King as the constitutional monarch of Canada requires unanimous approval by the Senate, the House of Commons, and the legislative assembly of each of the provinces. This is the highest standard of amending the constitution as laid down under Section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\xa0\nWhile this is an arduous task, this solution is a far more reasonable take on present day reality.The treaties signed between the Crown with the Indigenous communities many years ago would now be governed by a government structure which places their own heads at the helm, perhaps creating a little more trust in the system.\xa0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau referred to Canada as the world’s first postnational state in a 2015 interview with the New York Times, even while Canada technically continues to exist under the seal of the “UK”, and public lands are called “Crown Lands”, and the monarch’s face is printed on our money.\xa0\nIs this not reminiscent of a more colonial Canada? It doesn’t take into consideration the impact that bearing allegiance to the Queen has on immigrants coming from countries which were also colonies of the British Empire. Doesn’t this solution truly bring Canada into its identity as the first postnational state while also reconciling with its indigenous people?\xa0\n2023\xa0 is the perfect time for effectuating such a change. Holding on still would be holding onto the vestige of a past that Canadians are not nostalgic about.\xa0\n \nInterested in becoming a contributor? Check out our   Get Involved Page \n\nAmazing! This seems like a good way to honor the indigenous community.\nGod save the King.\nInteresting idea. However, how do we reconcile the treaty-crown relationships that are foundations of modern government. By removing the crown you also remove the nation to nation relationship shared between indigenous communities and the settler population. Without a solution for this constitutional corner stone, the crown must stay in some form to continue honouring these relationships.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nOutside, oil spills gelatinous, glimmering black rainbows.But online, on the news, oil spills marmalade flames.Before it was motorboats scrawling spiderwebs,Over water, now it boils, roiling thermohaline.\nFor oil rigs collapse, pipelines burst, carbon spewsIn the air, acid in the rain, plastic piles into islands —We need more than Dawn’s ™ duck soap for what it does\nWhere it goes; it’s in the system — outside in, ultimately, onMy screen, from me, oil human grease as we scroll, scroll, scroll.The tides increase not from a leak nor flames, but neglectAs our pointing fingers claw for more, more, more.
