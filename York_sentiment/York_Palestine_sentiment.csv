Long time?!\nNot a hideous misuse if you pretend that “group’s” is supposed to be followed with “policy”.\nIs it just me or does excalibur give wayyyyyyy too little space to any group that stands in solidarity with Palestine in their paper? One and a half sentences from a SAIA spokesperson and half an article of b.s from the admin and blatant lies from a “professor” at York, Who’s obviously working with Hillel.\nIs it a prerequisite for editors that they must be in love with Israel? Maronese, in his piece does a bad job hiding his bias and clear attempts to mislead readers. The group in this article is not asking for divestment from companies that they “feel” vioates international law. These findings have been made by experts of International law: academics, UN investigations, Amnesty International, Human rights watch have found Israel’s actions and the bodies that support it are in constant violation of international law.\nExcalibur, readers are tired of this open love for apartheid.\nI agree, Steve. Just google the professor Anne Bayefsky. She is a pretty outspoken Israel sympathizer. I understand that the writer of the article felt that they were balancing SAIA with this professor, but it’s actually unbalanced.\nUsing a professor’s (expert’s) comments against a student group’s comments is not leveled. Why not get Dr. Rahnema to comment? After all, he only teaches the most popular course on Israel/Palestine Relations in all of York. Or any other political professor who specializes in Middle East Politics?\nThe end of this article is atrocious. Bayefsky’s blatant apologetics are just embarrassing and shouldn’t be taken seriously at all. They’re clearly tacked on and they completely divert focus away from rest of the piece.\nAlso, the most verbose lead in existence\nUm… since when is a country democratic when it has already titled itself as a “Jewish State”. The dominating ideology and bias is clear in that alone, and does not in any circumstance create a space for democracy.\nI am really glad to see this dialogue at York and online. These are important questions for universities and their communities.\nI want to invite you to the 1st national symposium to examine social and environmental issues affecting university investments (June 21, 2011, Victoria, BC).\nplease visit: http://www.curi.ca\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nBrent Rose\nManaging Editor\nIf you have ever parked in The Village while you dash off to your three-hour class to avoid having to pay York University’s parking fees, one day you might find a bright yellow ticket slapped to your windshield.\nParking by-laws in the streets around The Village at York neighbourhood south of campus changed recently, from a maximum three hours to one hour between 8 am and 8 pm. According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.\nWhen the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed\ninformation.\nThe new by-laws have left some York students furious.\nIt’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.\n“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”\nMany students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.\nCouncillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.\n“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.\nHe urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.\n“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”\nPeruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.\nStudents that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.\nThe university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.\n“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.\nAccording to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.\nWith the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from\xa0 8 am and 8 pm.\nYork currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.\nWith files from Amelia Ruthven-Nelson\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/03/30/you-cant-park-here/'],0.5703209042549133,0.8687111139297485,0.3903513252735138

The event, which serves as an alternative to traditional orientation, centres around issues of social and environmental justice.\nThe Radical Walking Tour, the first event, took students on a walk through campus, focusing on places of political significance at York.\n“We start off by looking at the governing structure and how York is managed,” says tour guide Imran Kaderdina. York’s mission statement “speaks of having a community that values freedom, social justice, and accessible education, but those are not always upheld by the university through its actions.”\nKaderdina also explains where many of York’s building names came from.\n“The buildings are often named the way they are because of donations, which come with strings [attached] that many students don’t know about,” he says.\nParticipants ranged from students to faculty to community members.\n“It’s a pretty diverse group,” says Aruna Boodram, volunteer and programming coordinator at OPIRG York. “I’d say it’s for people who want to learn more about the issues happening around their community and around the world.”\nViola Huang immersed herself in DisOrientation activities all week—including the walking tour and a screening of Slingshot Hip Hop, a film presented by the Toronto Palestine Film Festival—and hopes other students will show more interest in politics.\n“I can understand this indifference to a certain degree when I think of all the busy schedules students have here,” says Huang. “I think it is pivotal for students themselves to get engaged in politics, to know what’s going on, and to educate themselves.”\nKaderdina also believes it is important for students to be engaged in campus politics.\n“I think it’s impossible for students to stay politically neutral,” says Kaderdina. “If the students aren’t engaging with the university, they are essentially supporting the status quo.”\nDisOrientation events—which include workshops, film screenings, and a free concert—are being held every day until October 1.\nForthcoming are a workshop on the decriminalization of sex work, a discussion on Canadian immigration, and a workshop on alternative media.\n\xa0\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/09/28/alternative-orientation-week-focuses-on-social-justice/'],0.3643247187137604,0.10734114050865173,0.09965591132640839

There are crumbling walls, piles of rubble, and garbage surrounding them all. The men and women who live in these poor conditions are victims of prejudice. This is where Tyler Koverko, a York law student, finds himself with a pit in his stomach.\nKoverko, a second-year criminal law student at Osgoode, had a lot of interest in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but he had no genuine understanding of the situation before visiting Bethlehem.\nHowever, last summer, he was awarded $5,000 to plan a trip to Jerusalem where he saw firsthand what the long-standing conflict looks like.\nKoverko left for Jerusalem having no partiality for either side. He considered himself an interested third party. With a general understanding, he wanted to better comprehend the conflict and also experience what everyday life was like. Being stationed primarily in Israel, he decided to go out and see what waited for him. That was when he saw Aida.\nAida was established in 1950, and holds over 4,000 refugees. It is just one of 19 refugee camps in the West Bank. There are 62 Palestinian refugee camps across Jordan, Syria, Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon. These camps house more than four million refugees that were displaced as a result of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.\nThese people were either forced out of their homes or chose to leave the country.\nKoverko was able to see much more than what is reported in the North American media. Even though he began this trip with an open mind towards both sides, biases were unavoidable. However, seeing firsthand a decrepit Palestinian refugee camp and victims of suicide bombings, Koverko felt these biases “beaten out of him,” leaving behind the difficulty to find a “human side” of the issue.\nThese people were not characters in a movie; they have to continue to live this way everyday. Koverko was surprised to discover that not just the camp’s leaders, but also the children spoke fluent English. Not only did they speak English, most of them were fairly sophisticated and bright—welcoming him wholeheartedly. He saw “human beings with souls behind all the political madness.” It became clear how irresponsible it is to generalize an entire group of people that are caught up in politics that expand far beyond their power.\nA major surprise for him was the amicability of Jerusalem.\nThis trip was very important for Koverko, but he does not want you to simply take his word for it.\n“This experience was awesome, unforgettable, a slap in the face and it opened up a major world conflict to me,” he says. These same opportunities are available to all students who wish to take advantage of them. “I learned immediately that you can’t understand why people believe so strongly in the cause, until you know the history.”\nJerusalem was “a life changing experience,” for Koverko.\n“Whatever I thought was immediately transformed through personal experience,” he says.\nKoverko says he left Canada with little bias towards either the Israelis or Palestinians and came back with even less. It was no longer “this group or this group,” but simply people caught up in defending their rights and beliefs that they hold so sacred.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2012/04/04/a-strangers-look-into-bethlehem/'],0.8846771717071533,0.8487240076065063,0.3086528480052948

They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.\nWhile both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.\n“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.\nVanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.\n“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”\nThe BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.\nAs of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.\nThe campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.\nMembers of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012. They celebrated the YFS’s endorsement after the meeting at around 1:45 p.m. with a march around campus, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “victory.”\nThe Graduate Students Association at York endorsed the BDS campaign on November 16, 2012, as have other student organizations including the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association and the University of Toronto Graduate Student Union.\nHillel at York and Hasbara @ York condemned YFS’s endorsement of the BDS campaign on behalf of York’s undergraduate students and issued a statement through the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.\nIn the statement, Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara @ York, says Hasbara is “extremely disappointed” that the YFS passed this resolution. He alleges the YFS is “blacklisting and boycotting Israelis.” Lax also alleges the YFS’ resolution is “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”\nCherkasov says as a union representing the interests of 55,000 undergraduates, the YFS should not take a political stance on an issue that does not affect all students on campus.\n“I understand that we all have our personal opinions, but the fact that [the YFS] took a stance on a very touchy issue for Israeli and Palestinian students, I think that was inappropriate,” says Cherkasov. “Now, they have marginalized a group of students and created a hostile environment because they adopted the BDS movement.”\nLax echoed Cherkasov’s opinion, saying the YFS should not take a political stance that could divide the campus.\nHe says 4,000 students have signed a petition against the GSA’s endorsement of BDS, created in November 2012 by Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York.\n“It showed a substantial amount of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.\nHusein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.\nShe says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she would be happy to meet with them to discuss it.\n“Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important,” says Husein.\nHusein says to remain silent on issues of basic equality is often a tacit endorsement of injustice.\n“We engage in anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, and anti-sexism campaigns not because they are popular, but because they are right, and they are important to our members,” she says.\nJoanne Rider of York media says university administration has not been contacted by the YFS or any other student groups regarding this campaign.\nSAIA will be holding a protest March 27 in Vari Hall at 1 p.m. to call on university administration to address their demands.\nMelissa Sundardas, News Editor\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2013/03/27/yfs-endorses-bds-campaign/'],0.30214473605155945,0.9749630093574524,0.44409507513046265

The fact that York Security threatened another Palestinian alumnus with arrest and trespass makes the question more pressing.\nMoreover, former director of Security Services, Rob Kilfoyle told Office of Student Conflict Resolution Director Debbie Hansen by email that although my status as an alumnus complicates things, he “would love to” trespass me.\nIn another instance of disregard for the role of alumni, when SAIA met with the administration, VP Academic Rhonda Lenton refused to include me because “the offer was made to meet with current members of the York community.”\nI feel compelled to state my history at York, for the record.\nI was a student of psychology and political science from 2001 to 2007. The attacks of September 11 occurred after I arrived to Canada and following my frosh week.\nMy world was changed.\nI became radicalized as bombs fell over Afghanistan and Iraq, and as the second Palestinian uprising was crushed under blood-soaked tank treads and the rubble of thousands of demolished Palestinian homes.\nThat’s when I joined the anti-war movement and, through the mentoring of a group of Iraqi students, honed the skills of activism.\nI was co-founder of Amnesty International at York, a member of Now End War and Sanctions on Iraq, an executive member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, and a member of the Grass-Roots Anti-Imperialist Network.\nI took part in the barricading of the entrances to campus on March 10, 2003, and helped to organize lectures, film screenings, and protests.\nI worked for the Student Christian Movement at York and for the York University Telemail Program. I was elected to the York Federation of Students as the Stong College director, submitted articles for Excalibur and the YU Free Press, sang with the York University Choir, and performed with Vanier College Productions.\nI experienced the corporatization of campus, repressive changes to university policies, and the numerous sanctions imposed on outspoken students and faculty as a result of those changes.\nI went to pub nights when Founder’s Cock&Bull and Calumet’s On the Edge were more popular than The Underground. I lived at Stong Residence and Assiniboine. I walked through the graffiti-laden, weed-scented underground tunnels before they were closed, pulled all-nighters alone at the Student Centre and watched the sun rise from rooftops.\nAfter I lost my home in Palestine, the York community became another home to me.

I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.\nWhile I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.\nBut it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.\nSome believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.\nHave students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?\nThere are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.\nI’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.\nThere are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.\nWhen it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.\nBut more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.\nIf you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York.

However, the event proceeded as scheduled.\nThe BGSC was not available for further comment.\n“Rania Khalek is a well-known supporter of Black Lives Matter and the call for reparations for past and present injustices inflicted on black people in the United States,” says Merate Atare, member of SAIA. “Those who levelled the allegation that Khalek is anti-black, with no evidence, lack a progressive worldview based on mutual solidarity.”\nAtare explains SAIA reached out to the individual, but couldn’t come to an agreement.\n“We in the Palestine solidarity movement at York will not throw our friends and supporters under the bus, and we stand firmly behind them.”\nKhalek has come under fire in the past for allegedly overstating the similarity between the movements for Palestinian and black rights, particular on social media.\nIn the aftermath of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri in late 2014, for example, Khalek made a connection between the repression of Palestinian protests in Israel and of black protests in the United States.\nShe faced backlash on Twitter, where she was referred to as “an anti-black, ahistoric troll” and was threatened with violent retaliation.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2016/03/31/black-graduate-students-collective-takes-issue-with-apparent-anti-black-speaker/'],0.07716068625450134,0.811028778553009,0.014551447704434395
156,York,2016-09-29,journal_data/txt/York/2016_09_29.txt,"[' York University Community Newspaper \nAs an international student, I come from a country where student activism and politics are banned across university campuses and journalism has become a guise for promoting a corporate agenda.\nComing to York, colloquially referred to as a “social justice university,” I found a sense of freedom in expression and joined many social justice groups on campus in various leadership capacities.\nI also ended up becoming the assistant news editor at Excalibur, York’s largest student newspaper. Given my involvement, many have branded me as playing a contradictory role of both an activist and a journalist.\nI disagree with this characterization.\nThe terms “activism” and “media” mean different things to different people. The former could imply anything from justice and equality to radicalism and extremism while the latter could imply anything from truth and accountability to lies and propaganda.\nBoth terms can have widely contrasting connotations depending on factors involved and context of discussion, yet we can perhaps agree that a combination of the two generally provokes unease and cognitive dissonance among people.\nWhile that may be true, it is just one perspective of looking at things. During my time at Excal, I have personally come to experience the converging influence of the two fields.\nJournalists and activists are not enemies nor always at loggerheads with each other. Most of the time, our work is complementary and collaborative, not in the sense that journalists endorse any particular activist agenda, but rather that we consistently keep track of and report on any arising developments within activist groups. In short, we both need each other, regardless of our differences.\nThe idea of objectivity, in context of journalism, is very misplaced. Journalism, like activism, in many ways is agenda-driven. While we aim to offer unbiased, critical perspectives, one cannot deny that there are always dominant themes and angles, a by-product of stories with cracks left unexplored.\nStudent activism has the power to expose one to hot-button issues, ranging from anti-tuition fees campaigns, campus racism and sexual violence campaigns to international issues such as the Israel-Palestine controversy and other cases of nationalistic self-determination struggles.\nWhile some may find certain campus politics disagreeable, it undeniably sparks a degree of critical thinking, which in itself is a sign of progress. Yet student politics is not immune to criticism, whether it be allegations of romanticizing and oversimplifying struggles or simply being written off as ineffective.\nThis is where we student journalists play a key role. Besides putting a spotlight on emerging issues, we indirectly give activist groups a greater impetus to act while maintaining a historic memory of community events through our extensive documentation.\nDespite points of criticism, I think it is safe to say that both activism and journalism are inevitable outcomes of challenging the status quo in an unfair world, and they are here to stay. Both are united by common themes of community, shared networks and storytelling.\nMy point is to move beyond the concept of binary thinking, of pro- this and anti- that, labelling things as right and wrong and pigeonholing ideas into neatly packaged definitions. Instead, we should aspire to create a space where we can have honest and challenging discussions about our current paradigms, where we are constantly redefining our roles and open-heartedly embracing the conflict-ridden process of changing the world.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/op-ed/2016/09/29/breaking-the-ice/'],0.7764971256256104,0.8547208905220032,0.5063280463218689

A university that values the safety of its community should not be investing in companies that put the safety of its community members at risk, along with many other innocent people,” it reads.\nYork makes investments through its endowment fund, a pool of money utilized to generate profits that finance scholarships, bursaries and university projects.\nEvery financial quarter, a detailed investment holdings report is produced, along with a statement of investment policies and procedures.\nAs of December 2016, York held no investments in the aforementioned companies and continues to consider the integration of environmental, social and governance risk factors in its investment selection process.\nNonetheless, many do feel that there is nothing concrete stopping the university from reinvesting in them in the next financial quarter.\n“[York’s actions] prove that it is possible to ethically manage a successful endowment fund,” said YU Divest.\n“Divestment does not only require the university to pull their existing investments from these companies but also to make a binding commitment not to reinvest.”\nStudies of divestment campaigns have shown that they in fact do little to directly impact the share prices of the companies involved.\nIt is believed, however, that divestment campaigns create an impact through the generation of stigma surrounding certain industries, leading to fewer people wanting to work there or to greater popular support for policy at a university or government level.\nMore than 80 campus organizations endorse the YU Divest campaign, but it has faced criticism from numerous groups citing it as a means of promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions policy against Israel.\nSteph Baker, political liaison for Hasbara, says that they do not agree with the campaign due to the negative connotation surrounding it that makes peaceful dialogue around the topic difficult.\n“While YU Divest does not focus only on Israel, a large amount of energy is focused on promoting divestment from it,” says Baker.\n“It makes it very difficult to create a peaceful dialogue about the country when such actions are fighting against it,” she adds.\n“While some people may think that it is impossible to help Palestine while supporting Israel, it is untrue.”\nRawan Habib, vice-president campaigns and advocacy for YFS, states that the divestment campaign focuses solely on ensuring that university funds be channelled into education and the lowering of tuition fees.\n“Divestment from weapons manufacturing by [the university] and the redirection of those funds into post-secondary education is directly linked to the reduction of tuition fees and improvement in the quality of education,” she says.\nTrudy Pound-Curtis, assistant vice-president finance and CFO at York, notes that the Advisory Committee on Responsible Investing includes staff, faculty and students.\n“The committee has held […] panel discussions over the past two years to enable the community to hear diverse viewpoints on responsible investing,” says Pound-Curtis.\nDivestment remains a highly contentious topic that has created many heated exchanges, so Excalibur sought to establish what York students really think.\nAs far as I am concerned, [this] investment isn’t ethical. This is an institution that spreads inclusivity and acceptance, but at the same time makes money from wars around the world. It doesn’t seem right. For myself, divestment would make me feel better about the institution I attend. Reinvestment into more sound ethical industries feels a lot better. This campaign is the definition of a student movement. We cannot allow our beloved institution to make money off weapons manufacturing.\nI’m personally against York investing in weapons manufacturers. Universities should focus all their resources on education, especially at a diverse university like York where weapons investment is an issue that hits close to home for many. Weapons investment causes a distraction, and some students may feel they are directly contributing to conflict.\nI only discovered that York was behind this quite recently. I can see why York’s involvement with this investment would be kept on the down-low. If you look at power, it is often sustained and cultivated by ignorance. They should look at the needs of students and lower fees, for the greater good and for people wanting an education who are unable to afford it. I can, however, appreciate if the investment was done with the good intention of establishing scholarships and bursaries; I don’t see much wrong with that.\nYork is an enormous institution that can invest in other companies that are economically large enough to fund our scholarships. By investing money in companies that create such deadly weapons that lead to destruction, death and horror for the entire world to fear, York is being included in this problem. Instead of using money to help these companies grow, York should really think about lowering our fees so that scholarships wouldn’t need to be funded by these companies.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2017/02/10/york-drops-opinions-divestment/'],0.4473259449005127,0.5696942210197449,0.1669754683971405
