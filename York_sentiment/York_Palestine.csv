It is York’s money, and it is York’s ethical obligation.”\nLapointe said the university’s investment philosophy is inherently flawed.\n“As long as our university remains invested in companies that profit from war crimes, it continues to make a mockery of its stated commitments to human rights and social justice,” she said. “‘Active engagement’ is a very\nslow and ineffective tool [and it’s] not possible at all when the company’s main business is to manufacture weapons which are, by definition, death machines.”\nOmar Dominguez, chair and co-founder of the Coalition of Universities for Responsible Investing, said York is on the right track.\n“Issues like military spending are bound to be controversial,” he said. “But if you divest from these companies, it really leaves you out of an opportunity to negotiate with the companies and try to address your concerns.”\nNevertheless, Dominguez appreciated SAIA’s efforts to include students in these discussions.\n“We encourage universities to combine the university trustees – who are ultimately responsible for these decisions – with faculty who have expertise on the very issues, to include the views of students, who are some of the beneficiaries, and to include multiple stakeholders,” he said of his coalition’s goals.\nPound-Curtis also pointed out that since they switched investment managers in late February, York is no longer investing in Hewlett-Packard or Northrop Grumman, and that they have not invested in Lockheed Martin since August 2010.\nIn fact, York is currently invested in only one of SAIA’s four target companies, BAE Systems, via the university’s pension fund.\n“We’ve about a million dollars [in BAE Systems] out of our total pension fund, which is $1.4 billion dollars – it’s insignificant,” said Pound-Curtis. “We will have a discussion with our investment manager to ask if they’d considered any of the facts [of SAIA’s report].”\nLapointe emphasized that York has not yet promised not to reinvest in these companies.\n“Pound-Curtis has not addressed any of the three demands of our divestment campaign,” she said.\nAnne Bayefsky, a political science professor at York University who specializes in international human rights, thinks the campaign is wrongheaded because of its focus on Israel as an apartheid state.\n“Israel, like all states, is entitled to the rights of self-defense,” she explained. “Efforts to deny Israel’s right to self-defense are, in fact, the inverse of the declared intention of people concerned with apartheid because it would deny the Jewish people a homeland where they can find protection and security.”\nIn their report, SAIA compares Israeli policy to apartheid South Africa, citing a study, “Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?” by the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. But Bayefsky thinks the evidence points in the opposite direction.\n“Everyone should be concerned about human rights, but we have to take a good hard look at the facts,” she said. “The evidence clearly indicates that Israel – a country where one-fifth of the population is Arab with full democratic rights and representation at the highest levels of Israeli society – is not an apartheid state.”\nTo read SAIA’s full report, “Holding York University Accountable,” visit\xa0 www.toronto.saia.ca.\nWith files from Brent Rose and Yuni Kim\n ', 'Am I seeing things, or is there a hideous misuse of the possessive apostrophe in the title?\nHi Harrison! Long time?!\nNot a hideous misuse if you pretend that “group’s” is supposed to be followed with “policy”.\nIs it just me or does excalibur give wayyyyyyy too little space to any group that stands in solidarity with Palestine in their paper? One and a half sentences from a SAIA spokesperson and half an article of b.s from the admin and blatant lies from a “professor” at York, Who’s obviously working with Hillel.\nIs it a prerequisite for editors that they must be in love with Israel? Maronese, in his piece does a bad job hiding his bias and clear attempts to mislead readers. The group in this article is not asking for divestment from companies that they “feel” vioates international law. These findings have been made by experts of International law: academics, UN investigations, Amnesty International, Human rights watch have found Israel’s actions and the bodies that support it are in constant violation of international law.\nExcalibur, readers are tired of this open love for apartheid.\nI agree, Steve. Just google the professor Anne Bayefsky. She is a pretty outspoken Israel sympathizer. I understand that the writer of the article felt that they were balancing SAIA with this professor, but it’s actually unbalanced.\nUsing a professor’s (expert’s) comments against a student group’s comments is not leveled. Why not get Dr. Rahnema to comment? After all, he only teaches the most popular course on Israel/Palestine Relations in all of York. Or any other political professor who specializes in Middle East Politics?\nThe end of this article is atrocious. Bayefsky’s blatant apologetics are just embarrassing and shouldn’t be taken seriously at all. They’re clearly tacked on and they completely divert focus away from rest of the piece.\nAlso, the most verbose lead in existence\nUm… since when is a country democratic when it has already titled itself as a “Jewish State”. The dominating ideology and bias is clear in that alone, and does not in any circumstance create a space for democracy.\nI am really glad to see this dialogue at York and online.

According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.\nWhen the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed\ninformation.\nThe new by-laws have left some York students furious.\nIt’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.\n“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”\nMany students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.\nCouncillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.\n“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.\nHe urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.\n“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”\nPeruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.\nStudents that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.\nThe university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.\n“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.\nAccording to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.\nWith the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from\xa0 8 am and 8 pm.\nYork currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.\nWith files from Amelia Ruthven-Nelson\n ', 'To those of you who read this – you CAN take action.

(David Foster)\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe UVSS has officially endorsed the “no” side, implying the current board believes it is not in the best interest of students to continue to be\npart of the CFS.\nCoccola said he was aware there was going to be a number of people flown out to campaign for the CFS during the\nreferendum.\n“It’s happened at every school [that votes to defederate from the CFS] […] it’s quite common, so it doesn’t surprise me at all that Jeremy’s here,” he said.\nCoccola also suggested York students should reflect on the fact their student union executive director had flown out to “campaign on the other side of the country, something that arguably doesn’t affect York students.”\n“This is a referendum for UVic students. Why would someone from York be able to speak to the issues that UVic students are facing?” questioned Coccola. “Not all issues are the same across the country, despite what people say.”\nWhen asked about whether the YFS covers the expenses for its members to travel to other campuses during a CFS referendum, Saravanamuttu responded via email, “The answer is no.”\nSaravanamuttu couldn’t comment on who did, in fact, pay for the trip.\nAccording to UVic student David Foster, there have been attempts for many years to break from the CFS.\n“We don’t get a lot of value for our money, and the money could be better used in another way or even just by putting it back in our pockets,” said Foster. “This year we’re using even less of the CFS services than we ever have.”\nHe explained that UVic students do not use the CFS health plan, website services, and, since they found a company that could produce yearly handbooks at a lower cost than the CFS, even the handbook service has gone unused.\nKarstens-Smith added that the referendum has been a long time coming for the university.\nThe original petition to begin a referendum was circulated by a number of students and began in 2009, but was declared invalid by the CFS because of a counter-petition started by the former UVSS.\nAccording to Coccola, both petitions were submitted to CFS, which used the second petition to deny a referendum, although there was no way to tell which petition was signed first or whether students knew what type of petition they were signing.\nThe issue was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada in November, where the judge ruled the petition valid.\nNevertheless, the CFS began claiming the UVSS owed a debt to the CFS from the ’90s to the tune of\xa0 $129,000. CFS bylaws state that student unions cannot have a referendum if they owe any outstanding membership fees.\nNevertheless, the court granted and set a date for the referendum on the basis that the debt was released by the CFS two days prior to a court date.\n“The judge ruled it prejudicial and said they could not submit the affidavit and that they should’ve done so sooner – they had plenty of time to do so,” said Coccola.\nThe campaign period for the referendum started March 21 while the voting period started March 29 and ends March 31.\nWhile Excalibur obtained a photo of Saravanamuttu on the UVic campus, Karstens-Smith said that Salter avoided all photos.\n“Is he trying to hide the fact he’s here or something? Because we can definitely confirm that he is,” stated Karstens-Smith via e-mail.\nExcalibur attempted to reach both Salter and Saravanmuttu by phone, text and email regarding these issues but did not get a comment from them as of publication.\nSalter has a very strong tie to the CFS, and received an ‘A’ in a report card-like document accidentally released by CFS-British Columbia about three years ago. The document ranked CFS members based on loyalty, and recommended which members would be well-suited to advocate at universities holding a CFS defederation referendum.\nWhen\xa0 Salter was president of Continuing Education Students at Ryerson (CESAR), he helped along the referendum to make CESAR a permanent member of the CFS. He was also the former Northern Ontario Commissioner for CFS-Ontario, while he served as the Lakehead University Student Union president.\n ', 'Jeremy Salter also came to the University of Regina to campaign for the ‘yes’ side last October. We questioned then, how can the Executive Director be gone from work, campaigning in Saskatchewan for three weeks?\nThanks for the coverage, Excalibur! Happy to say that your students will be returning to their home campus shortly, as UVic voted overwhelming to defederate, removing the CFS and their representatives from our campus. Kindest regards from the west coast, from a ‘NO CFS’ side supporter.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nHufsa Tahir\nContributor\nTAHIR: Why the name “SlutWalk”? Wouldn’t people find it offensive?\nTEEKAH: If folks were to try and bury this story and shove it under the carpet, all that does is replicate and increase the power words like “slut” have. We want to confront this power and change it. By calling it SlutWalk, we are acknowledging his comment – and want to open up dialogue. We can take concepts “slut” points to – women having sex, who should have sex and what kind of women there should be – and completely rework these concepts in the interest of an actual gender-equal world.\nTA: What’s the aim of this event?\nTE: One of our main aims is to reappropriate the word “slut.” We are also looking for increased transparency, accountability and greater anti-oppression training for police. We are coming to this with a politic that can mean different things for different people who attend the march.\nTA: Some might call it an overreaction to blame the entire police force for a reckless comment made by one officer.\nTE: When a police officer puts on the uniform of the police force, he is not a lone person. For York and the Toronto police to select this officer to come and speak for “campus safety awareness” events, they are sending him as a rep of the Toronto police. Police officers are the result of police culture and training. Either the culture indirectly supports his point of view, or the training does not do a good enough job to train out of them this ignorance.\nTA: How important is SlutWalk Toronto?\nTE: We are not doing this event to say, “Fuck the police.” We are looking to have a dialogue with them, to open up real interaction between them and the community they serve. We want to improve their approaches toward minority groups, and make change for the better. This march is one of the steps in that process. We’ve had enough of these cases. It’s time to do something real and tangible about them.\nTA: What kind of changes to attitude are you looking for?\nTE: It’s easier to blame the victim than to look at the larger picture. Why are we telling women to police their bodies, to stay indoors, to dress in certain ways while men have absolutely none of this “policing” on them? Victim blaming actually works to support the rapist. How can you say that a rapist is ever “justified” in raping? We need to start looking at the larger picture – sexism in different places – and how these sources that spawn things like rape are not being addressed.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMatthew Goulet\nContributor\nPeople all live with viruses, most of them benign; when these harmful tunes infect the brain, the average listener displays no signs of being completely subsumed by unexceptional music. They’re sort of like the sonic version of the human papillomavirus: symptoms don’t always show up, though the results can be deadly.\nBut creating public awareness for devastating viruses is not my intention – it’s to establish awareness in regard to the rapid spread of bad music (in most cases anything that falls under the umbrella of “mainstream”) and its ultimate destruction of formerly genuine bands.\nInstrumental band Scale The Summit at one of their tour stops in Austin, Texas. (Prosthetic Records)\nLet’s scale the summit of reason, shall we? To back up my salvo of accusations and labels, I’ve formed an armada of alternatives, a formidable flotilla of funk and folk that will freak your frontal cortex. My smart bomb comes in the form of an unorthodox, independent-minded group of people that helped build up a genre and simultaneously smash it down with complicated chord progression, sporadic melodies and overall awesomeness.\nScale The Summit is out with their latest album, The Collective.\nFormed in 2004, Scale the Summit has peaked on many music charts and weathered many attacks from their perch, but they’re far too high up this mountain of musical mastery to notice the petty criticisms from down here. Ass-kissing, you say? Maybe, but the accolades are well deserved.\nWhat sets Scale the Summit apart from other bands in the same metal subgenre is their lack of vocals. ‘Instru-metal’ is their brand of vocal-free metal, and they make up for the vocals elsewhere. The music literally speaks for itself, and lacks nothing in the frontman department.\nEven more astounding is how young the band members are. Their average age is just 22, so they’ve many years ahead to develop as a band. If they’re at this level now, imagine their progress in five, 10 or 20 years.\nTheir stylistic elements are peculiar and wonderful. The music is hard with moments of softness, always maintaining a level of complexity even in simple harmonies. It maintains a happy atmosphere, something metal bands before them have seldom achieved. Songs like “Gallows” should be listened to on headphones while walking down a sunny street. Certain parts of the songs scream uncertainty, while the mood is cemented in the very atmospheric quality of “Colossal,” the opening track of The Collective.\nWhereas many bands have to rely on sound editing to get their cohesive, unified quality, Scale the Summit has it on their own. It’s a quality that makes for outstanding live performances: all of the musicians are constantly on the same wavelength.\nTaking time to savour The Collective is a transcendental experience of self-reflection, comparable to the effects of psychedelic drugs. Many fans of the band have described their music as a journey, a form of exploration both musically and personally for the individual; drifting into oneself after listening to the entire album is easy. Scale the Summit’s music lends itself to introspection, and that’s why critics have coined the term “adventure metal” to replace the tired old horse that is “progressive metal.” I’m not knocking the “prog,” but change is good.\nEveryone’s level of musical knowledge and fondness is different and we listen to music for different reasons. For those unseasoned listeners, your level of critical listening isn’t the same as that of a professional. You may not pick out the minuscule elements of each song, but you don’t need to be an expert to enjoy expertly performed music.\nWhat is bad music? What is good music for that matter? The subjectivity is the attraction to the medium – what’s certain is that The Collective will take you on a musical journey through passages of the mind rarely ever examined, without ever having to leave the comfort of home.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nPaul McLaughlin\nContributor (This Magazine)\nNina Arsenault has spent a fortune changing her appearance from male to female. The 37-year-old used to work in the sex trade, but now supports herself as a playwright, performer and motivational speaker to queer youth. Her one-woman show, The Silicone Diaries, recently had a second highly successful run in Toronto, was later performed in Montreal and will open in Vancouver next year.\nMCLAUGHLIN: Where did you grow up?\nARSENAULT: In Beamsville, Ontario in the Golden Horseshoe Trailer Park. It was a really tight knit community. My memories of it are just great. But we moved when I was about six to a house in Smithville. It was very difficult to make friends because I was so feminine. Growing up in the trailer park and going to school with those kids, they always knew how girlish I was. With everyone on top of each other you have no choice but to accept people. [Then I moved and] being the new kid it was very, very difficult to make friends. I have been a bit of a lone wolf all my life.\nNina Arsenault, who holds a York graduate degree in theatre, supports herself as performer. (Tony Fong)\nM: In The Silicone Diaries you talk about seeing a female mannequin in a store at age five. What was it that affected you that day?\nA: I think just the harmony and symmetry of the face spoke to me. I knew that I was a girl inside but I had this boy body. Then, for my visual gaze to rest upon a face that was a sculpture of a woman’s face, I just seized on that as a child. It affected me, the perfection of it.\nM: When did you decide to begin plastic surgery?\nA: About age 23, but I didn’t have my first procedure until I was 25.\nM: What did you have done?\nA: At first, just transsexual procedures to feminize myself. It got to a point where I looked as much like a normal woman as I possibly could; however, I still had masculine features. It was really traumatic on a daily basis to see those features. So I made the decision to really push the cosmetic procedures, knowing I would no longer look natural, that I would start to look plastic and artificial.\nM: Like a mannequin?\nA: Yeah. But I can’t say at the beginning of the journey I was trying to look like a mannequin or a Playboy bunny. I was just trying to be a woman.\nM: Did you literally have 60 surgeries?\nA: There were actually more. Some were just procedures, like a lip injection.\nM: When was the last one?\nA: In 2006.\nM: How much did they cost?\nA: Upwards of $200,000.\nM: How did you afford that?\nA: I was working in the sex trade and made an incredible amount of money so quickly there.\nM: Men like “shemales”?\nA: Yeah. In terms of supply and demand, there just aren’t a lot of us, but there’s a lot of interest. The first day I put my escort ad in the paper, I had 250 calls. I don’t think that’s something that’s spoken about that openly amongst otherwise heterosexual men. I could have worked from morning until night if I had wanted to.\nM: What was it like working in the trade?\nA: It was physically very tough. And I only did oral, no fucking.\nM: A lot of transgender women work in the sex business. Why is that?\nA: It’s one of the few places you can get work and feel safe. If you’re visibly transgender you’re going to be one of the most disenfranchised and disadvantaged people in culture.\nM: You have two graduate degrees, right?\nA: I do. But it’s tough to get straight work. You can’t imagine the amount of transphobia out there.\nM: How long have you been out of the trade?\nA: About three years. I support myself now as a performer.\nM: In the play you mention that you have had your testicles removed. But you kept your penis. Why was that, if your goal was to be as close to a woman as possible?\nA: I never knew what would happen to me financially so [if I still had my penis] I could always return to the sex business.\nM: What has the play done for you?\nA: It has been an incredibly healing ritual. I think I wrote it because I had a lot of emotional angst and suffering that I needed to express, that I needed someone to bear witness to. It makes me stronger every time I perform it.\nM: Do you feel 100 percent female now or still a bit male?\nA: I’ve always known I was a woman but I was socialized as a male. I have some qualities people see as male – I’m an aggressive thinker – but my core is definitely female.\nM: Do you feel beautiful enough now?\nA: I don’t work on the outside anymore. I concentrate now on inner work.\nM: Any more surgeries ahead?\nA: No. Not until I start to really visibly age.\nThis piece is reprinted with the permission of This Magazine.

Neal \nStaff Writer\nIncreasingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, you’ll find doctors and health care professionals turning to the ancient disciplines of meditation to deal with mental health disorders.\nMeditation is the most well-known – and certainly one of the most thoroughly studied – forms of medicine practiced by the Tibetan Buddhists for centuries.\xa0 Personified by the dignified and solemn Dali Lama for over 25 centuries, meditation has become a method of refining and exploring the inner self, probing and navigating inner space in much the same way we have preferred to examine our outer.\nSpending just a few minutes to mediate can help you relive stress that comes from a busy scheduel. (SXC.HU)\n“The monks, we believe, are the Olympic athletes of certain kinds of mental training,” said Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist from the University of Wisconsin who, as part of a select group of scientists and scholars, travelled to Dharamsala in 2000 to attempt to dissect problems of distress and human suffering.\nHe analyzed 150 ordinary brains and compared them to the brain of a monk, and discovered a monk’s brain was simply more active on the left, which represented happiness. “This is tantalizing evidence that these practices may indeed be promoting beneficial changes in the brain,” concluded Davidson.\nZindal Segal, a psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health who uses meditation to treat patients with mood disorders, finds that though we may never be able to reach the same heights as Buddhists who spend 10,000 hours sitting and meditating by just spending time clearing out minds we may be able to feel better.\n“We’re talking about paying attention, we’re talking about returning wherever our minds are to this present moment. These are things that we all have. We don’t have to earn them, we just have to find a way of clearing away the clutter to see that they are already there,” said Dr. Segal.\nThe key to meditation is to slow the mind down and examine one’s thoughts and thinking processes and connect that to the present moment. “[Meditation is] a way of training yourself to pay attention in the present moment without judgement [as] to what your experience is,” said Dr. Segal in a Globe and Mail article.\nThe health benefits are still very much debated, but researchers have found that meditation is good for relieving stress, and dropping blood pressure. This form of medicine changes someone’s attitude from sour to positive and can go a long way especially in our busy lives. “Meditation is a set of practices that have been around for more than 2,500 years, whose principal goal is to cultivate these positive human qualities, to promote flourishing and resilience […]” said Davidson.\nAt first glance this may seem simple, but it has been shown to be just as effective as antidepressants in treating and preventing depression relapse, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThe next time you are feeling blue, or stressed over exams, you shoulder consider your inner strength before popping a pill.\nWith files from The Globe and Mail\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nKate Hudson\nProduction Manager\nFinal exams may drive you to the edge of sanity, but compared to what Norio Ota, director of Japanese studies at York University, went through at his Japanese high school, our academic lives are a cakewalk.\n“When I was going through the entrance examinations, it was called ‘the exam from hell,’” said Ota. “I had to work until two to three in the morning every single day because I had to study for ten or twelve subjects at the same time, and then get up 6:30a.m. and go to school.”\nHe could tell I was shocked. Ota shook his head with a dismissive smile, “I wasn’t exceptional. Many people had to study the same way. We had a saying: If you sleep for four hours, you will fail the entrance exam. You have to sleep only for three. Seriously.”\nIt’s difficult for me to imagine an educational culture so different from my own.\n“Well, many people went through this in Japan at those times. We thought about dying, and all those things, because the pressure was just enormous.”\n“It was okay for me because I thought of it as one hurdle I had to overcome.”\nDecades later, Ota still works until 2 or 3 am many days of the week, teaches overtime, trains high school teachers across Canada via videoconferencing, and recently helped coordinate a new Japanese language program at Havana University.\nHis peaceful smile, balanced demeanour and humility gave me the impression of self-awareness, dedication, and a man truly in love with his work.\n“I feel appreciated by other people\xa0– I think that’s a source of work ethic for me,” said Ota. “It’s not just culturally ingrained. I love what\nI do.”\nA certain school of Western psychologists, however, might use a different word to describe his behaviour.\nWorkaholism.\nWork·a·ho·lic (n. circa 1968)\nThe term workaholic has been used informally to refer to white-collar and public service workers who ‘work too hard’ since it was coined in 1968 by American psychologist Wayne Oates.\nHowever, there has been much academic discussion about what the term actually means in a clinical context, and considerable difficulty reaching a consensus.\nSome early studies in workaholism looked at workers’ attitudes toward their jobs, while others focused on their behaviour, i.e. the number of hours worked per year. For example, Mosier (1983) defined a workaholic as someone who works more than 50 hours a week regardless of his psychological condition; Cherrington (1980) defined a workaholic as having an “irrational commitment to excessive work”; Machlowitz (1980) focused on the workaholic’s positive enjoyment of work.\nLater studies attempted to place workaholics on a spectrum of “work involvement, a feeling of being driven to work, and work enjoyment”, differentiating between workaholics who enjoy their work and those who resent it.\nThe ‘Japanese Work Ethic’\nThe Japanese have a reputation for outworking their Western counterparts. But do the numbers support anecdotal evidence like professor Ota’s high school entrance exam experience? Is Japan a nation of workaholics?\nAt Japan’s economic peak, the numbers indicated a resounding yes. In 1980, Japanese worked an average of 2121 hours a year while Canadians and Americans both worked just over 1800. To put that in perspective, if you took two weeks of vacation, you would have to work about 8.5 hours every day – not including breaks – to meet the Japanese average.\nWhile cultural collectivist attitudes are sometimes cited, Ota explained there is a clear economic explanation for this phenomenon.\n“For a long time, until the beginning of the bubble economy, many [Japanese] worked for the same company until they retired. That was the source of loyalty in the company. These people worked really hard because they identified with the company.”\nOverworking was such a serious issue that a word, kar?shi, was coined in the late ’80s to describe death or suicide attributed to work-related stress. Kar?shi prompted the Japanese government to begin research initiatives and enact legislation to force workers to take holidays.\nToday, the problem is less severe, but over 10,000 continue to die from kar?shi every year – almost as many causalities as the March 11 earthquake crisis this year.\nWhite collar workers and high level executives are among the most vulnerable. Even pre-university students, who are exposed to high levels of stress, are affected by kar?shi; Japanese students have one of the highest suicide rates for their age group in the world.\nBursting the Bubble\nWesterners continue to view Japan as a workaholic society, but the trend may be changing.\nIn 2009, Japanese workers laboured an average of 1714 hours a week – only 15 more than Canadians – and actually less than American workers, who worked 1768.\nThis statistic forces us to rethink typical stereotypes about cultural pre-dispositions and look at economic factors in defining trends in\noverworking.\n“After the economic bubble burst, what happened was that Japanese companies started laying off and firing people, so the so-called life-time employment system has collapsed since then.” said Ota. “Many people felt the same way I did: ‘Why should I spend my whole life working for a big corporation?’ A different value orientation was introduced. Not all at once, but gradually.”\nWhile Japanese workaholism may be subsiding, for Canadians, there are no signs the problem is going away. Since workaholics tend to be high-functioning members of society, their problems often go unnoticed.\nBryan Robinson, PhD., author of the best-selling Chained to the Desk, thinks the subject is, at least in some ways, taboo.\n“Cultural attitudes towards workaholism have changed very little,” said Robinson. “In a downturn economy, where people are desperate for jobs, they don’t want to talk about working too much.\xa0 Plus, with the advent of wireless technology, electronic devices are invading personal time more than ever before.”\nA lot of the problem is awareness.\n“People still don’t get how damaging work addiction is. It continues to be praised and misunderstood, especially in a time when many people don’t have jobs.”\nAccording to Robinson, university environments are particularly at risk, and desperately need to take action.\n“Universities are notorious for enabling work addiction with huge expectations and very few boundaries […] Universities and any workplace at risk for burnout should be encouraging self-care among faculty, not expect multi-tasking, which only activates the stress response, and they should hold seminars on the dangers of overworking and the damage done to marriages and children.”\nRobinson found it hard to think of a North American campus he could hold up as a positive example. “I don’t know of any who are doing it right,” he said.\nA Positive Outlook\nIn a very personal moment, I described my own struggle with workaholism to professor Ota. I spend up to 15 or more hours a day working at Excalibur as a designer, a writer and a manager, an ethic that differs little from the way I’ve approached my work since middle school.\nDespite all of this negativity, not everyone views intense commitment to work as a bad thing. The key to staying healthy and balanced for an intense worker, he said, is passion and\nhumility.\n“I used to think I worked for self-satisfaction; it was only after an important person in my life died that I realised, actually, my life is not for myself. When you can feel your life is not for yourself, all negative feelings like anger, jealousy, everything disappears. Once you reach that stage, you keep your peace of mind.”\nI told him maybe this was true, but my drive to work sometimes took over the rest of my life.\n“You are part Japanese, remember,” he laughs, referring to my one-quarter Japanese background. “It’s in your blood!”\nCompiled by Chloe Silver and Kate Hudson with files from oecd.com\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nYork is changing the way students are affiliated with their colleges.\nUnder the old regulation, residence students were automatically affiliated with whatever college residence they moved into – if a student lived in Winters College during first year and moved to Vanier residence, their college affiliation would be automatically switched from Winters to Vanier. Even if students submitted a form to maintain their original affiliation, a glitch in the system would prevent the request from being realized.\nThe university has now fixed that glitch, and students may now successfully choose to remain with their original college after their first year, even if they decide to move residences.\n“The bigger issue is after first year, should you still be forced to be affiliated with whatever college you live in or whatever college you choose?” said Founders College Council president Robert Cerjanec. “Under the current system, it almost tells you indirectly that if now you live in Calumet, you should be involved in Calumet. But you don’t have any connection with Calumet. You have a connection [with your original college].”\nVp students Rob Tiffin explained that the student information system would automatically change any college affiliation requests back to the college of residence due to a system pre-programming.\n“Even if students could change, or request a change, we discovered it was slipping students back into [the college affiliation of the residence they were living in],” he said.\xa0 “We are going to make certain that that doesn’t occur [anymore].”\ntudents must go through the registrar’s office to request to change college\naffiliation.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nYork housing is planning a commuter floor in Tatham Hall at McLaughlin College.\nThe second floor of the college residence will be converted into a floor for commuter students to rent out for a night during the school year.\n“[It will] offer York undergraduate students an overnight accommodation option,” said Debbie Kee, director of housing services. “The rooms will be available for students who plan to stay on campus late to study, or for students who are anticipating bad weather and do not want to commute.”\nKee said that the floor would include 16 single rooms and four double rooms, a total of 24 beds.

According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.\nWhen the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed\ninformation.\nThe new by-laws have left some York students furious.\nIt’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.\n“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”\nMany students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.\nCouncillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.\n“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.\nHe urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.\n“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”\nPeruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.\nStudents that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.\nThe university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.\n“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.\nAccording to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.\nWith the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from\xa0 8 am and 8 pm.\nYork currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.\nWith files from Amelia Ruthven-Nelson\n ']"

City council is simply trying to find what services are essential to Torontonians and to find efficiencies.”\nAlastair Woods, vp campaigns and advocacy for the York Federation of Students (YFS), agrees city service cuts—especially to transit and bike lanes—will have a huge impact on students.\n“We have a lot of students who travel from all ends of the city,” he says. “Any cuts to the TTC—whether it be in routes or whether it be in the number of times [buses] come or whether it be in the actual infrastructure—will end up hurting students in the end.”\nFourth-year York student Sean Dimnik depends on his bicycle to get around the city. The notion of less bike lanes worries him.\n“It would limit my mobility,” he says. “My primary resource is my bike in terms of transportation.”\nWoods also addresses the concerns of students who rely on childcare.\n“I think the common misconception is that students are 18 or 19 years old and don’t always have kids to take care of,” he says, “but that’s not entirely true.”\nTanya McFayden, vp gender issues for the Graduate Students Association, has a child in the Lee Wiggins Childcare Centre at York.\n“I know many people in my life with children who end up putting them in childcare they don’t feel comfortable with,” she says. “They put them into unlicensed daycares and into home daycares simply because they need a spot and they have to work.”\nIf she didn’t have a spot, says McFayden, she would not be able to pursue her graduate studies.\nHudson says the massive outcry from residents across the city has resulted in city council delaying some service cuts, such as those to public libraries.\n“[People] here today are demonstrating for two reasons: one is a bit of a celebration because it looks like some of the cuts that were on the table […] before have been delayed or will be, at the very least.”\nHowever, Palacio believes there won’t be any radical changes.\n“[In reality], there won’t be any closures to city libraries in Toronto […] and the city is still going to provide daycare services,” he explains. “What we’re asking is simply for the province to subsidize the additional funding that we need to provide the 2000 additional spaces [to daycare].”\n“The main thing is that we’re in a crisis right now, and we have a chronic financial problem and deficit of $470 million dollars,” Palacio points out. “In the last administration, nothing was done.

Although it may sound like a fusion of Spike Jonze’s Adaptation with Federico Fellini’s 8½, Braff is quick to point out that, although depicted from a writer’s perspective, the film is more about “creative block” in general, something that “everyone can relate to.”\nFor Braff, creative block is a universal concept. Whether at home or at school, writing screenplays or writing essays, the process of formulating thoughts into tangible results is an everyday struggle, and in the enterprise to overcome, we often alienate those around us.\n“When you sit down with your notebook, it’s just you and your notebook,” says Braff. “There’s nothing else in the world except those two things. And when you’re absorbed into your world, it’s very difficult to bring someone else in and to see anything other than what’s in your focus.”\nBraff insists that his philosophy background has helped him see and approach the film differently.\n“In a lot of cases, a person only sees things one way,” says Braff. “Philosophy allows you to think outside the box and see different viewpoints.” Because he was taught to look at things differently and from varying perspectives, Braff describes how he can add fresh, creative, and unconventional insight. The result, he says, is a more nuanced and layered film.\nIn the making of Framed, however, Braff had a very different story to tell. He says the film was a byproduct of his mantra for seizing the day and the begetting of a beautiful friendship with the film’s director, John Virtue.\n“The only reason this film was my project and the director’s, is because I’ve known the director for a long time and we’re good friends,” Braff explains. Virtue sent him a copy of the script while he was in Japan at the time, and he instantly liked it. Braff replied by saying the pair could turn the script into something meaningful.\nIn way of offering advice for budding filmmakers, Braff says that if a friend comes up to you with a good idea for a movie, give them five to 10 minutes.\n“If someone approaches you with a great idea, don’t say you’re too busy for it. Take a moment and look at it,” suggests Braff. “Framed all started because a friend sent me a document that he had written out of fun.”\nTo Braff, having fun is what\xa0life, and university, is all about. University, he says, should be about meeting people with great ideas and adding your own creativity on top of that. If he wasn’t at York, Braff admits, the process of making a film would never have crossed his mind.\nBraff says networking is the most important thing.\n“At the end of the day, it’s who you know and how you know them,” he says. “Six degrees of separation ends up working for you.”\nHis personal convictions and hard work have paid off, culminating in a confirmation email from the Cannes Film Festival that booked him, his director, and their film, a ticket to France.\n“It was the best day of my life,” Braff says.\nBut just because he has booked a ticket to Cannes, it doesn’t mean Braff will be taking a break from his producing duties. Along with his upcoming exams, his schedule is full.\nHe and Virtue are currently in the process of securing venues to screen their film with at the TIFF Lightbox—and on campus—before they embark for Cannes.\nOn top of that, Braff sees Cannes as a great opportunity\xa0to generate interest for the film and to connect with possible distributors, producers, and other eminent members of the film industry. When asked whether or not he thinks Framed will win any awards, Braff says that producing the film was an achievement in and of itself.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nPurniya\xa0Awan\n\nStaff Writer\n@excalweb\nAccording to calendars created by the Mayans (an advanced Mesoamerican civilization that existed from 2000 BCE until their destruction by the Spanish in 1697 CE), the end of humanity will come December 21, 2012 when some catastrophe is predicted to demolish the world. Many theorize that the end of the world will come from astronomical events, from a “killer” solar flare to a huge asteroid.\nOthers, like Young, however, theorize that the end of humanity may just come from a nuclear war.\nYoung started preparing for Doomsday after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, even after peace was maintained. His thoughts on surviving things like nuclear war stayed with him throughout his childhood and even now.\n“I wrote a short story when I was 12 about my age group in school withstanding the Soviet invasion,” says Young who has read about hundreds of wars and deadly disasters. “So things like that were on my mind as I grew up.”\nYoung is not alone though. The preparation-centric fiction he writes and publishes on the internet has a readership of well over 10,000 and the number of people who have started preparing seems to be increasing as days go by.\n“There are thousands upon thousands of other people doing their best to get ready for anything from a loss of a job, to medical emergencies, all the way up to Doomsday,” says Young.\nThe amount of people preparing for the end has grown big enough that there is a network dedicated to helping them known as the American Preppers Network (APN).\nThe network defines these “preppers” as a group of people who have started preparing for Doomsday, or TEOTWAWKI—The End of the World as We Know It. There are “preppers” in the United States and in parts of Canada, Australia, and Italy, according to Tom Martin, founder and chief visionary officer of the APN\nThe network already has over seven thousand “likes” on their Facebook page and has gained the attention of organizations like the BBC and Popular Mechanics.\nThe way Young and Martin both see it is that the world right now is not very sustainable, whether you look at it from a financial point of view or an environmental one. The radical weather patterns and the frequent occurrences of natural disasters around the world indicate to them that something big is going to happen which will either destroy the world or change the world that we know today.\nWhich is why Young says that it’s important to be prepared for not only “Doomsday,” but for accidents and disasters which can occur at any time.\nWhile Young does not believe the popular Mayan prophecies about the world ending by the end of this year, he does however, believe that several natural cycles are reaching either peaks or lows, depending on the type of cycle, with the sunspot cycle one of the key ones, indicating that some bad natural disasters will occur.\nWhen asked what kind of advice Young has for university students, he suggested that we forget about preparing for “Doomsday” for the moment and make preparations for basic human needs first.\nMartin’s advice reflected the views of Young: “Students need to learn how to budget and manage their finances since things like credit cards and loans will not be useful when a disaster strikes. Students should learn how to make their own meals and make sure they have enough food stocked up for at least three months.”\nSome preppers may follow the Mayan calendar, but they all have one common goal: to be prepared on a daily basis just in case they are faced with a natural disaster of some sort.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMatthew Danton\nContributor\nThe streets are decrepit in Aida, a Palestinian refugee camp located just two kilometres north of Bethlehem.

This is where Tyler Koverko, a York law student, finds himself with a pit in his stomach.\nKoverko, a second-year criminal law student at Osgoode, had a lot of interest in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but he had no genuine understanding of the situation before visiting Bethlehem.\nHowever, last summer, he was awarded $5,000 to plan a trip to Jerusalem where he saw firsthand what the long-standing conflict looks like.\nKoverko left for Jerusalem having no partiality for either side.

These camps house more than four million refugees that were displaced as a result of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.\nThese people were either forced out of their homes or chose to leave the country.\nKoverko was able to see much more than what is reported in the North American media. Even though he began this trip with an open mind towards both sides, biases were unavoidable. However, seeing firsthand a decrepit Palestinian refugee camp and victims of suicide bombings, Koverko felt these biases “beaten out of him,” leaving behind the difficulty to find a “human side” of the issue.\nThese people were not characters in a movie; they have to continue to live this way everyday. Koverko was surprised to discover that not just the camp’s leaders, but also the children spoke fluent English. Not only did they speak English, most of them were fairly sophisticated and bright—welcoming him wholeheartedly. He saw “human beings with souls behind all the political madness.” It became clear how irresponsible it is to generalize an entire group of people that are caught up in politics that expand far beyond their power.\nA major surprise for him was the amicability of Jerusalem.\nThis trip was very important for Koverko, but he does not want you to simply take his word for it.\n“This experience was awesome, unforgettable, a slap in the face and it opened up a major world conflict to me,” he says.

They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.\nWhile both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.\n“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.\nVanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.\n“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”\nThe BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.\nAs of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.\nThe campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.\nMembers of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012.

of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.\nHusein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.\nShe says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she

Messages of gun violence, theft, and other crimes run rampant through its pages, with the finger of disapproval constantly pointed towards members of her own community, Jane and Finch.\nJohnson skims the pages with a familiar feeling of dismay. The picture of Jane and Finch’s youth population is painted clearly in the paper’s narrative: troublesome, delinquent, and even criminal.\nJohnson, 27, was born in Jamaica. She is a former resident of the Jane and Finch area. The community has always held a special place in her heart, but it is aggrieved by the constant stereotyping of its inhabitants.\nPerpetuated by popular media, the “danger” myth of Jane and Finch is widespread—even amongst York students and faculty, a population situated mere minutes away. Johnson recognizes that a communication barrier between York and the Jane and Finch community has resulted in a damaging reputation for the neighbourhood.\n“I think the relationship between York and the Jane and Finch community needs a lot of work. It’s an institution versus [the Jane and Finch community’s] youth, and youth in the media are either seen as unable to represent themselves or as rebellious,” says Johnson.\xa0\nJohnson has taken a stand against the stigmatization of her heart and home by founding Boss Magazine. While others dwell on mainstream media stories of gun violence and poverty, Johnson works ardently to inspire a better informed public.\nThe youth-led Boss aims to dispel the danger myth of the neighbourhood by showcasing positive activities of the Jane and Finch community and its vibrant youth population. The publication covers a range of lifestyle and fashion topics to appeal to a diverse audience.\n\n“There was nothing for us to voice our own views of what we like, what’s really happening in the community, and the creative vision that youth have,” says Johnson on the pre-Boss Magazine era.\nJohnson has attempted to engage the York population by reaching out to students, specifically those interested in fashion and business, and encouraging them to get involved with the magazine.\n“[York] shouldn’t be a separate entity from the area,” she says. “It is part of the Jane and Finch community, it should have a mandate to engage.”\nJohnson continues, “There are a lot of students that are [at York] for writing, and I wanted to give them a platform to [promote] their own talents.”\nCurrently, Johnson is still looking for more York students to work with Boss. She wants the magazine to be a vehicle for talent and to bring in youth to be a part of a project they can be proud of.\nJohnson is extremely proud of her accomplishments with the magazine thus far. For her, the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Boss Magazine from the Jane and Finch community is its own reward.\n“People from the community opened the magazine and saw themselves,” she says.\xa0\nJohnson feels strongly that reconnecting York and the Jane and Finch community will be mutually beneficial because their proximity allows them to share resources.\nLorna Schwartzentruber, manager of York University’s Community Engagement Centre, is deeply focused on repairing the relationship between the\xa0two communities as well.\n“Most understandings of the Jane and Finch community don’t reflect its reality. Stereotypes have been processed year after year, and students don’t often take the time to experience the community, which perpetuates a power imbalance,” says Schwartzentruber. “We need to challenge some of those stereotypes by getting a more holistic view of the community.”\nThe Community Engagement Centre is making efforts to strengthen university’s ties to the community by making York a better neighbour.\n“York has a social responsibility as a large organization to be a good neighbour, and contribute in positive ways to the community it is a part of,” says Schwartzentruber.\xa0\nTheir “Student Orientation to Working in Jane and Finch,” for example, will pilot this September in an effort to unpack some of the issues faced by this community for students so they may better understand systemic oppression in marginalized communities and be able to engage with the community without fear or judgment.\nSchwartzentruber strongly feels that this is just the beginning of uniting York with Jane and Finch. “Through community engagement, we can increase the learning potential for students, while simultaneously strengthening the community,” she says.\nNatalie Coulter, a communications studies professor at York, is another strong advocate for community engagement. Through her classes, she has given her students the opportunity to participate in various community engagement projects with different organizations in the Jane and Finch region.\n“I hope [York students] have a new understanding of [the] richness of the community that goes beyond school,” says Coulter. “I hope when students leave [York], they are proud that they both went to York University and that York University is in the Jane and Finch community.”\n“The separation is not just physical—it’s also in terms of knowing and understanding the community,” she says. “I realize that there are incredibly rich resources in this community that represent a huge array of opportunities for students.”\nProjects like Johnson’s and Coulter’s provide a channel of communication between the two communities that students can get involved in.\nJohnson is amazed that Coulter’s students have become involved with the magazine, and this exemplifies how Boss is one step closer to reaching this common goal.\nAlthough Johnson is excited about the current progress and attention to these initiatives, she realizes there is much more work to be done, and that the process will be an arduous one.\nAs a York student and a Jane and Finch native, the burden of the stigma against her community is her own, and it pains her to see her school and her home at odds when the media so often targets them both. But she is hopeful that more people will join her fight for change. When that happens, the students of York and the people that make up Jane and Finch may stand together in a celebration of diversity, talent, and a sense of unity.\nBy Demitiria Neofostistos and Amara Hannah\nWith files from Samantha Chelsea and Samantha Herson\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThere’s been a dialogue about whether switching to an online voting system would be a better way forward for York Federation of Students elections.\nTo me, this is sort of like a debate on whether or not you should find a place to live by looking at pictures online and sending your first and last deposit by email transfer or by doing your research and then going in person to ensure you are getting what you’re paying for. Sure, the former is convenient and might save some time, but the risks are far too great for my liking.\nWe have seen far too many examples of elections going horribly wrong when online voting is employed, and these many instances of corruption give me doubts about the true integrity of the online elections.\nThe Western Gazette reported that in 2012, their university students’ council elections had been hacked by a former student, “who took advantage of a weakness in the site,” and that all 10,000 votes were invalidated, requiring a re-vote to be held two weeks later.\nSimilarly, in 2013, “poorly-timed human error lead to voters being presented with the wrong choices.”\nAt the University of British Columbia, in an online vote held in 2010, The Ubyssey reported that people were able to log in, clone the voting page, and submit fake ballots. This resulted in 731 ballots being submitted from a single IP address, alerting the elections committee that something was wrong.\nUnsurprisingly, the votes were thrown out, but whoever received the extra 731 votes could have won if the flaw wasn’t discovered. And of course, students were a little angry at the system that allowed this to happen.\nRecently, Queen’s University students saw their fall referendum postponed by a day because a miscommunication between the software behind their online voting system and their email server resulted in 6,000 email ballot logins not being sent out.\nI think you see the trend here. The list goes on.\nLet’s also acknowledge that in Canada, our federal, municipal and provincial elections operate\xa0on paper ballots.\nThe paper ballot voting system does not work at the touch of a button, but at least we know it’s a system that allows the integrity of the elections to stay intact.\nAt the end of the day, I like knowing I can have my space to vote without someone looming over my computer, that the candidates can’t hack in and vote for themselves 1,000 times over, and that people won’t be prevented from accessing the system due to glitches.\nYou can keep your “convenient” shortcut—I would much rather spend the time on ensuring quality.\nJenny Sellathurai\nContributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nI was banned from York University almost a year ago for exercising my freedom of expression by organizing and participating in a peaceful protest for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions and against York’s investments in weapons manufacturers.\nThe administration singled me out as an instigator, and they now may be attempting to paint me as an outsider to the York community.\nDespite the dubious claim that I was banned for disrupting classes during the protest (York’s own local adjudicator found no disruption), I initially received a letter from VP Students Janet Morrison stating: “The University does not give permission for members of the public—including alumni—to enter our campus lands for protests or demonstrations, or to engage in forms of speech or action that are, in any way, racist or that advocate racism, violence, or hatred.”\nAside from the fact that alumni participate in on-campus protests regularly, Morrison’s statement raises the question of whether I was banned for disruption, for my political beliefs, or because I’m Palestinian. The fact that York Security threatened another Palestinian alumnus with arrest and trespass makes the question more pressing.\nMoreover, former director of Security Services, Rob Kilfoyle told Office of Student Conflict Resolution Director Debbie Hansen by email that although my status as an alumnus complicates things, he “would love to” trespass me.\nIn another instance of disregard for the role of alumni, when SAIA met with the administration, VP Academic Rhonda Lenton refused to include me because “the offer was made to meet with current members of the York community.”\nI feel compelled to state my history at York, for the record.\nI was a student of psychology and political science from 2001 to 2007. The attacks of September 11 occurred after I arrived to Canada and following my frosh week.\nMy world was changed.\nI became radicalized as bombs fell over Afghanistan and Iraq, and as the second Palestinian uprising was crushed under blood-soaked tank treads and the rubble of thousands of demolished Palestinian homes.\nThat’s when I joined the anti-war movement and, through the mentoring of a group of Iraqi students, honed the skills of activism.\nI was co-founder of Amnesty International at York, a member of Now End War and Sanctions on Iraq, an executive member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, and a member of the Grass-Roots Anti-Imperialist Network.\nI took part in the barricading of the entrances to campus on March 10, 2003, and helped to organize lectures, film screenings, and protests.\nI worked for the Student Christian Movement at York and for the York University Telemail Program. I was elected to the York Federation of Students as the Stong College director, submitted articles for Excalibur and the YU Free Press, sang with the York University Choir, and performed with Vanier College Productions.\nI experienced the corporatization of campus, repressive changes to university policies, and the numerous sanctions imposed on outspoken students and faculty as a result of those changes.\nI went to pub nights when Founder’s Cock&Bull and Calumet’s On the Edge were more popular than The Underground. I lived at Stong Residence and Assiniboine. I walked through the graffiti-laden, weed-scented underground tunnels before they were closed, pulled all-nighters alone at the Student Centre and watched the sun rise from rooftops.\nAfter I lost my home in Palestine, the York community became another home to me. York and I even share the same birthday. So rest assured, I am here to stay, and attempts at erasing my history at York University have already failed.\nHammam Farah\ncontributor\n ', 'BDS is a campaign that marginalizes Jewish and pro-Israeli students.

[/su_heading]MyMail, Moodle, the York homepage, and Flex accounts were all affected by the outage, which started at 7:20 p.m. on March 19.\nChristopher Russel, director of ICT infrastructure and information security officer at York, says the outage was caused by a breaker being tripped during inclimate weather on the evening of March 19.\nThis caused a power outage on the Keele campus, and University Information Technology supply units failed. Some elements of York’s core network then lost power.\n“With some exceptions, nearly all services were affected since they rely on the network,” says Russel.\n“In some cases the service itself was still functioning, but it wouldn’t have been possible to connect to it. Parts of the network, including internet access for Keele campus student residences, were not directly impacted and continued to function.”\nPardis Aliakbarkhani, a third-year professional writing and anthropology student, says, “I had an assignment due that night through Moodle, and I was locked out of everything York-related. It was really frustrating.”\nBetween 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 20, nearly all services affected by the outage were restored. Some services however, were not fully restored until midday on March 20.\nRussel says a network error would not allow for correct diagnosis of network problems right away, and technical teams referred to a process of elimination to figure out what the problems were.\n“In all, over 800 servers and systems were checked on and brought back into service,” says Russel.\nRussel says scenarios like this have been successfully tested in the past.\nUIT is currently working with the network vendor to ensure this problem is fully understood to reduce chances of this happening again.\nAshley Glovasky\nDeputy Copy Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe election voting period for CUPE 3903, the union that represents York’s contract faculty, teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and research assistants, has been extended to the end of this week as neither candidate for chair received more than 50 per cent of the votes.\nThe third candidate was dropped from the ballot since he did not have enough votes, leaving only Faiz Ahmed and Christina Rousseau running for chair. According to CUPE 3903’s bylaws, the union must have a run-off election for this position.\nThe run-off election runs until March 28.\nRyan Moore\nStaff Writer\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThree York employees were arrested in relation to a fraud that occurred at York over seven years.\nThe fraud, alleged to have occurred between November 2005 and October 2012, is estimated to have cost the university $1.6 million. Police allege the employees issued fake invoices to the university.\nToronto Police announced the arrests on March 20. This is an ongoing investigation, and police expect more arrests to be made and further charges to be laid.\nVittoria Caparello is being charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, Yossi Zaidfeld is charged with one count of fraud over $5,000, and Melissa Caparello faces a charge of possession of property obtained by crime of under $5,000.\nMalissa Caparello is still employed as an administrative assistant in the dean’s office at the faculty of environmental studies and has been employed by the university since January 2005.\nIn regards to the future of her employment status, Joanne Rider of York media says the university is currently doing a review of the matter, and once a decision has been made, appropriate action will be taken.\n“As soon as the university was informed that there was a suspicion of fraud, we did two things: we informed the police and we engaged an external firm to conduct a forensic audit,” says Rider.\n“The university has already recovered the money estimated to be lost plus additional costs since the university initially found out about the alleged fraud in October of 2012,” she says.\nYork was notified of the fraud when a whistleblower came forward with the information around the same time the university implemented new policies and procedures to detect fraud, says Rider.\xa0\nThese policies were developed following a 2012 case in which two former York executives were accused of taking part in a massive phony invoice scheme and of defrauding the university of $1.2 million.\nThe Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation of Funds Policy developed as a result helped strengthen the university’s controls against fraud. The changes included an updated whistleblower policy, a conflict of interest policy, and the implementation of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment initiative.\n“So it was at that time an individual came forward and indicated that they suspected suspicious activity,” says Rider.\nAs part of this policy, the identity of the whistleblower remains confidential.\nHamid Adem\nNews Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nProminent York faculty and community members spoke in the Student Centre on March 25 to publicize alleged violations of student rights and civil liberties by York’s administration.\nProfessors David McNally, John Greyson, and Penni Stewart, as well as CUPE 3903 Chairperson Faiz Ahmed and alumnus Hamman Farah all spoke at the event.\nFarah, who was banned from campus in the spring of 2013 following a rally held by Students Against Israeli Apartheid, says administrators cannot be allowed to continue to intimidate and harass students in unrestrained manner.\xa0\nFarah also points to York’s revocation of SAIA’s club status on March 27, 2013, as an example of this harassment and intimidation from York’s administration.\nDespite being banned from campus, Farah still spoke at the event.\nJoanne Rider of York media responded to Excalibur’s request for comment via email, stating that freedom of expressions is one of York’s guiding principles.\n“Members of the York community have the right to express their views and to test and challenge ideas, provided they do so within the law, and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner that does not disrupt academic activity,” Rider continues.\xa0\nShe also adds that York’s responsibility is to protect the academic environment, while ensuring all community members abide by agreed upon standards of conduct, which allow students to pursue their studies “free from unwelcome disruptions.”\n“York has and will continue to ensure these policies are communicated, understood, and adhered to in a consistent manner,” says Rider.\nThe event was not prevented by York administration, as it was approved by the Student Centre board and included participation from the York Federation of Students.\nFarah is pushing for York to amend their Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Senate Policy on Disruptive and/or Harassing Behaviour in Academic Situations, and the Temporary Use of University Space policy to reflect Canadian values of freedom of expression.\n“Free speech and free assembly are important to students,” he says. “This is where we learn the most about these basic democratic values, and where the most opportunities arise to exercise them.”\nDavid McNally, a political science professor, spoke out in support of SAIA and Farah. Hereferenced a letter signed by 150 faculty members urging the administration to recognize civil rights violations and begin amending policies on the use of student space and the student code of conduct.\n“You cannot maintain any of kind of democratic culture in a society unless basic rights to express opinions and assemble on behalf of those opinions is secure,” says McNally.\nHe cites the treatment of SAIA and Farah as a specific problem within York’s democratic culture. McNally also believes the York administration is attempting to “roll back the gains that student and social movements have made in regards to free speech and free assembly, particularly those with dissenting opinions.”\n“Speaking as a political scientist, I don’t see how I can go into my classes and try to transmit to students the importance of basic civil rights in a democratic society, and then not speak out when I see my own administration violating them,” he says.\nMcNally says the event will only have been successful if it contributes to increasing pressure on the York administration to “get serious about civil rights and student rights.”\nMichael Burton\nExecutive Editor (Online)\nWith files from Ryan Moore\n ']","['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/editorial/2014/03/26/york-is-trying-to-ban-me-from-my-home/', 'https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2014/03/26/new-details-revealed-in-village-murder-trial/']","[' York University Community Newspaper \nI was banned from York University almost a year ago for exercising my freedom of expression by organizing and participating in a peaceful protest for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions and against York’s investments in weapons manufacturers.\nThe administration singled me out as an instigator, and they now may be attempting to paint me as an outsider to the York community.\nDespite the dubious claim that I was banned for disrupting classes during the protest (York’s own local adjudicator found no disruption), I initially received a letter from VP Students Janet Morrison stating: “The University does not give permission for members of the public—including alumni—to enter our campus lands for protests or demonstrations, or to engage in forms of speech or action that are, in any way, racist or that advocate racism, violence, or hatred.”\nAside from the fact that alumni participate in on-campus protests regularly, Morrison’s statement raises the question of whether I was banned for disruption, for my political beliefs, or because I’m Palestinian.

The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.\nExcalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.\nWhen they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.\nWhether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.\nOne reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.\nWhile I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.\nBut it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.\nSome believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.\nHave students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?\nThere are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.\nI’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.\nThere are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.\nWhen it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.\nBut more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.\nIf you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York.

She was found naked and face down in her room the next day after Meng managed to get word out to her friends and landlord that she could be in danger.\xa0\nOn April 1, the court heard that DNA found on Liu’s abdomen, groin, fingernails, and chest matched Dickson’s DNA profile.\nForensic biologist Melissa Kell also testified that Liu could also not be excluded as a source of the DNA found on the bloodstained shirt collected from Dickson’s residence.\nForensic pathologist Dr. Christopher Milroy said Liu’s death may have been caused by mechanical asphyxiation, which is blockage of airways through neck or chest compression, as indicated by bruising on her neck and bleeding in her eyes.\nHer roommate, Zahid Abdullah, who also testified on April 1, may have helped identify the shirt with the matching DNA sample.\xa0\nHe told the jury he saw an unknown Caucasian male in the house the night of Liu’s death, wearing a shirt that matched the description of the one investigators eventually retrieved and tested.\nAbdullah, however, did not directly identify Dickson.\nDickson’s lawyer, Robert Nuttall, is seeking a manslaughter ruling, arguing the cause of death needs to be definitive before one can determine intent beyond reasonable doubt.\nNutall also argued that Dickson’s mental capacity was reduced, based on his claim that he was medicated and intoxicated, but no evidence to prove this combination affected him has been presented as of publication.\nLyra Madriaga\nContributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe York University Student Centre’s board of directors has decided to increase security surveillance and lighting in the building.\nCameras will be installed facing the exits of the building, and lighting in the walkway and exterior of the building will be increased.\nJessica Thyriar, York Federation of Students president and spokesperson for the board of directors, says after discussions with stakeholders and groups in the Student Centre, a compromise was made to increase surveillance for safety reasons, but also ensure student privacy.\n“We needed to find a balance between ensuring that folks who use the space for various reasons, such as support services, felt comfortable [and that their information remained confidential] and ensuring other students did feel safe when using the building,” says Thyriar.\nImran Mohamed, third-year kinesiology and psychology major, says the change is a positive one.\n“It’s not exactly monitoring student activities inside the Student Centre. We still have our sense of privacy, [but] we know who is coming in and who is leaving,” says Mohamed.\nMohamed adds that while he supports the decision to add cameras facing the exits, he would not feel comfortable with cameras being installed in the food court or by the couches upstairs.\n“If there is a sense of people watching you, you just do not feel right. It doesn’t add to the festivities or the atmosphere [that the Student Centre is trying to promote],” says Mohamed.\nThyriar says the board of directors is constantly reviewing ways to improve the Student Centre and ensure students feel safe.\n“I think it’s important for the community to come together in various ways to share various things that we can do in regards to safety, and if we continue having these discussions and [making] efforts to actually put these things forward, it’s more of a community,” says Thyriar.\nCurrently, York has over 660 CCTV cameras overlooking parking lots, buildings, and classrooms, but there are none in the Student Centre.\nVictoria Alarcon\nAssistant News Editor\nWith files from Michael Burton\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/editorial/2014/04/02/york-students-silenced-or-unmoved/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nWhen I started my term as editor-in-chief last May, I was pretty naive.\nThe vision I pitched in my job interview was one of Excalibur as a driving force for change on campus.\nThis has proven to be difficult though. The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.\nExcalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.\nWhen they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.\nWhether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.\nOne reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.\nWhile I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.\nBut it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.\nSome believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.\nHave students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?\nThere are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.\nI’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.\nThere are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.\nWhen it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.\nBut more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.\nIf you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.\nThis year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause.

This included nine regular season games overall and three crucial victories, without which the Lions gave up their spot in the OUA playoffs.\nThe player, who was not named, had participated in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport at another institution during the preseason and hence was not supposed to take part in the Lions’ games this season.\nPrior to the debacle, the Lions had spent the final weeks of the regular season fighting their way through tough games. They lost to the Windsor Lancers by a score of 86-85 and to the Western Mustangs by 81-80. The Lions then edged the Algoma Thunderbirds by 68-67 and finally secured themselves a playoff spot by defeating the UofT Varsity Blues in a huge overtime victory by a score of 97-93.\nThe Lions lost to the dominant Ryerson Rams by a score of 81-72 in their final game of the regular season, perhaps taking it easier knowing they had already achieved their long-sought goal of making the playoffs. Two days later, on February 29, Athletics and Recreation finally broke the bad news to the team, the OUA, and the CIS.\nHowever, instead of brooding over that, athletes on the team are reflecting on their performance throughout the season.\n“I honestly don’t think we reached our full potential as a team,” says guard Shane Reader. “Mostly because of injuries, but we were definitely better than our record showed. We lost a handful of games by three or fewer points that could have gone either way.”\n“We did everything well at some point or another,” he adds, “but (we) just couldn’t bring it all together consistently.”\nReader believes that the team needs to especially work on defense, which he says can be done by careful observation of the opponent’s strategy and game planning. “Our offence does need work,” he adds, “but we have enough weapons to score when chances come around.”\nLooking forward to next season, Reader says that it will take more than just better defense and a summer of intensive workouts to get the team to where it needs to be.\n“The goal for next season is to get a new coach that will help [our program],” he says. “It’s obviously time for a change after six long seasons of backing out in the first round of the playoffs, and you’ve all seen how this season ended.”\n\nFollow us on instagram,  @excalphotos \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nFarah Isahack, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\nThe subject of illiteracy among women has not been talked about enough and it is time to change that. Adults who are illiterate or have low literacy have been shamed as beings of idiocy or laziness in today’s society, unless they seek to improve themselves or merge into the mainstream education system. In Canadian society alone it is noted that four out of 10 adults’ literacy skills are too low to be fully competent for most jobs in the economy.\nIlliteracy rates among racialized women have a critical effect in Canadian society. To be an immigrant to Canada, one must be capable of learning a language outside of their mother tongue, if not English or French, and be able to adapt to the new economic structure in place here.\nWhat many seem to overlook about immigrants in Western society is that a majority are coming from situations of poverty, political upheaval, or social structures that have not allowed them to seek further education.\nLiteracy is a fundamental right for all, but in regions where agendas of domestication are pushed onto women, literacy and higher-education do not become a priority.\nBefore jumping to theories, it is important to note the life of a lot of immigrant women and how they have adapted into Canadian society. It has become necessary that women provide the domesticated services they have been trained to do, under the sacrifice of an education. Unpaid domestic labour that goes on in the home is often considered invaluable.\nA lot of people in Western society and in our current generation are used to having the ability to read and write. Many cannot imagine what it feels like to look at something and not be able to understand it. You may say, well then go out and learn, but once these women come of age they take the knowledge and notion they learned in their home country and migrate to Canada, and start a new life.\nThey come here for work and to start a family. You will find a lot of immigrant women and men working in factory settings because more often than not, the job does not require a lot of comprehension for reading and writing, but rather is more labour focused.\nOnce these women marry and start a family, the structure in the household changes to focus not just on themselves but on their children. These women tend to put themselves second to their children, and education is prioritized for their child. Over time, their notion of improvement gets lost, because they become roped into a routine of work and home life, and the idea for a second chance at literacy is put on the back burner.\nBut the stigma of women not having that ability is still in place. Women who do not have the skills that modern education provides lose the ability and skill set that they could have had to manage their own income and expenditure. Children of literate mothers are known to be more likely to complete their education.\nDoes this mean we need to start forcing people to take educational tests and literacy examinations before entering the country? No. That is only fueling the taboo around the whole topic. What needs to be done is accepting the fact that they are people who’ve had to sacrifice more than they’ve had to gain, especially these women.\n This is still an empowerment movement for women. Even though some women may lack mainstream education in Canadian society, they still provide for themselves and their families in the best way that they can. They are not lesser beings because they didn’t get the chance at modern education. You wouldn’t make fun of an individual in a wheelchair, therefore there should be no hatred or fuel for ignorance against women for their disposition.\nInstead, please praise them and encourage more women to better themselves and take a second chance at learning. What many miss when they cross paths with a person who is illiterate is the fact that in a society built upon languages and literature, despite them not being able to fully comprehend what is being written, they still made a life and have overcome that barrier. Women who have this trait are no less than women who have the educational means to succeed in life through positions greater than their own.\nA factory job does not under any circumstances demean you as lesser than others, because what many forget is that we are all striving towards supporting ourselves and others. These women face this stigma harsher than anyone else, and they still stand strong and make it through a lifestyle that does not accept their lesser implication. So stop shaming them, start praising them, and help them when you can. Take an interest in adult illiteracy because many people have family and friends who are going through this and everyone deserve a second chance.\n\nFollow us on instagram,  @excalphotos \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJustyna Korczynski, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Meghana Kulkarni\nCaught your professor jamming with earbuds in at York Lanes?

We’re partnering with community groups across the city to stand up for a living wage for all, good jobs in our communities, affordable housing across the GTA, a Toronto that works for young people and equal rights under the law for immigrant- and service-workers,” reads a media advisory released by Marc Hollin, coordinator for UNITE HERE Local 75.\nMelissa Sobers, food service campus coordinator for Real Food Real Jobs campaign, states the main goal of the Toronto Rising summit was to be a kick-off event for the 2,000 low-wage food service workers who will potentially be entering into a strike across the city, including at universities like York.\n“The strike would be a collective bargaining for living wages and benefits with the goal of ultimately breaking the cycle of precariousness, lack of dignity and stigma that food service jobs hold,” she says.\nSobers recounts the event’s historical origins, saying hotel workers across the city used to make poverty wages similar to what food service workers are paid today, approximately $12 per hour with no benefits.\n“Due to their tireless acts of solidarity and demonstrations, hotel workers in downtown Toronto are currently making approximately $20 per hour with decreased workloads and full benefits, thus setting a standard for the vast majority of hotel workers in the city in terms of wages,” says Sobers.\nSobers states that food service workers are now trying to achieve the same standards of employment. Allies like Fight for $15 & Fairness in Canada and the United States, the Changing Workplaces Review in Ontario and the organizing efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement make this goal seem more achievable.\n“The event also hosted discussions on how the labour laws in Ontario presently discriminate against contract service workers, such as the York Aramark food service workers, ultimately targeting racialized people since they are over-represented in this line of work,” explains Sobers.\nFor instance, Filipino workers alone compose 75 per cent of hotel workers in Toronto, according to The Philippine Reporter. \n“We understand that low-wage jobs for Filipino immigrants is a growing issue. We have many skilled and educated Filipinos struggling at the bottom of the job market,” said the Filipino Student Association at York, or FSAY, in a statement to Excalibur.\nMany Filipinos get stuck in these positions because they are trapped balancing 40-hour work weeks and raising a family, all while getting used to their new environment, according to FSAY.\nMeanwhile, the Ontario Public Interest Research Group at York, or OPIRG, intends to collaborate with other campaigns to address issues of unfair treatment of immigrants in the workforce, minimum wage, exorbitant tuition fees and unaffordable rent.\n“OPIRG York attended in order to help connect student issues to the broader movement as well as to provide support to the food service workers at York who are currently fighting for more respect in the workplace and better conditions,” says Imran Kaderdina, admin and information coordinator for OPIRG York.\nOne of the highlights of the event was the Fairbnb coalition, which aims to hold Airbnb, a popular home-sharing platform, accountable for its short-term rentals.\n“Airbnb was discussed in the context of its threat to affordable housing access in the city to people like us, the working poor, students in debt as well as the great living-wage jobs that hotel workers have fought so hard to establish,” says Sobers.\nSobers claims Airbnb is a threat because of its non-taxed, non-regulated nature.

While Airbnb alone didn’t cause Toronto’s housing affordability crisis, it certainly isn’t helping.”\nFilipino Canadian Youth Alliance at York, Ethiopian and Eritrean Workers Network, Federation of Metro Tenants Association, CUPE 3903, U of T’s student union and members from the Osgoode Hall Law union were some of the community groups in attendance.\n\nYork activists joined UNITE HERE Local 75 union members last week in celebrating “Hotel Workers Rising,” a decade-long campaign centred around securing rights for hospitality workers.\n“With Toronto Rising, we are taking the next step. We’re partnering with community groups across the city to stand up for a living wage for all, good jobs in our communities, affordable housing across the GTA, a Toronto that works for young people and equal rights under the law for immigrant- and service-workers,” reads a media advisory released by Marc Hollin, coordinator for UNITE HERE Local 75.\nMelissa Sobers, food service campus coordinator for Real Food Real Jobs campaign, states the main goal of the Toronto Rising summit was to be a kick-off event for the 2,000 low-wage food service workers who will potentially be entering into a strike across the city, including at universities like York.\n“The strike would be a collective bargaining for living wages and benefits with the goal of ultimately breaking the cycle of precariousness, lack of dignity and stigma that food service jobs hold,” she says.\nSobers recounts the event’s historical origins, saying hotel workers across the city used to make poverty wages similar to what food service workers are paid today, approximately $12 per hour with no benefits.\n“Due to their tireless acts of solidarity and demonstrations, hotel workers in downtown Toronto are currently making approximately $20 per hour with decreased workloads and full benefits, thus setting a standard for the vast majority of hotel workers in the city in terms of wages,” says Sobers.\nSobers states that food service workers are now trying to achieve the same standards of employment. Allies like Fight for $15 & Fairness in Canada and the United States, the Changing Workplaces Review in Ontario and the organizing efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement make this goal seem more achievable.\n“The event also hosted discussions on how the labour laws in Ontario presently discriminate against contract service workers, such as the York Aramark food service workers, ultimately targeting racialized people since they are over-represented in this line of work,” explains Sobers.\nFor instance, Filipino workers alone compose 75 per cent of hotel workers in Toronto, according to The Philippine Reporter. \n“We understand that low-wage jobs for Filipino immigrants is a growing issue. We have many skilled and educated Filipinos struggling at the bottom of the job market,” said the Filipino Student Association at York, or FSAY, in a statement to Excalibur.\nMany Filipinos get stuck in these positions because they are trapped balancing 40-hour work weeks and raising a family, all while getting used to their new environment, according to FSAY.\nMeanwhile, the Ontario Public Interest Research Group at York, or OPIRG, intends to collaborate with other campaigns to address issues of unfair treatment of immigrants in the workforce, minimum wage, exorbitant tuition fees and unaffordable rent.\n“OPIRG York attended in order to help connect student issues to the broader movement as well as to provide support to the food service workers at York who are currently fighting for more respect in the workplace and better conditions,” says Imran Kaderdina, admin and information coordinator for OPIRG York.\nOne of the highlights of the event was the Fairbnb coalition, which aims to hold Airbnb, a popular home-sharing platform, accountable for its short-term rentals.\n“Airbnb was discussed in the context of its threat to affordable housing access in the city to people like us, the working poor, students in debt as well as the great living-wage jobs that hotel workers have fought so hard to establish,” says Sobers.\nSobers claims Airbnb is a threat because of its non-taxed, non-regulated nature.

Perhaps you’re a fantasy sports enthusiast, and have had to adjust your lineup because one of your starters was knocked out with a concussion. Or maybe you just really like Will Smith and saw the 2015 film.\nBut what is a concussion?\nConcussions, often referred to by athletes as the c-word, are traumatic brain injuries usually caused by hits to the head.\nOther injuries are fairly easy to detect—if you break a bone, for example, there is usually a visible indication of the injury, as well as an incredible amount of pain. But concussions are an invisible injury, and are harder to detect.\nFortunately, advancements in technology and increased research have allowed us to learn more about the nature of concussions.\nA recent study by Purdue University found that concussions are possibly caused by multiple hits to the head over time, as opposed to the previous notion that they were caused by a single impact. Another common misconception about concussions is that they go away after a certain amount of time, without any lingering side effects. In reality, many people who experience concussions also experience post-concussion syndrome, where symptoms last for more than six weeks.\nBut what are the symptoms, and how do you know if you have a concussion? According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms include headaches, loss of consciousness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, fatigue and slurred speech.\nIn severe concussions, a person’s pupils may appear different sizes, with one dilated more than the other.\nSome symptoms may take longer to show up, such as memory loss and an inability to concentrate, irritability and personality shifts, sensitivity to light, erratic sleeping patterns and even psychological disorders such as depression, according to Mayo Clinic.\nMore alarming are the findings by the researchers at York’s Centre for Vision Research, who found that athletes who suffer concussions may also have neurological deficits that are typically not detected in standard clinical assessments.\nThe study compared the cognitive-motor integration between 51 athletes who had never been diagnosed with a concussion, and 51 athletes who had a history of concussions but were no longer showing symptoms.\nThe goal of the study was to determine whether athletes with a history of concussions displayed any impairment when asked to “think and move at the same time.” Participants were asked to perform two separate tasks that tested their cognitive-motor integration.\nAccording to the results, athletes who had never suffered a concussion performed the tasks roughly 50 milliseconds faster than athletes who had.\nWhile that doesn’t sound like a large difference, it could be the difference between getting hit or not, according to Professor Lauren E. Sergio.\nThese tests could also provide a more accurate assessment for determining when a player is safely able to return to the field or rink. If a player returns to their sport too soon after experiencing a concussion and suffers another, known as second impact syndrome, the results could be devastating and even fatal.\nSide effects of second impact syndrome include swelling in the brain, possible herniation, loss of consciousness, acute metabolic changes and cerebral blood flow alterations, according to brainandspinalcord.org.\nHopefully as we learn more about the brain and how it functions, we can find ways to ensure player safety and better diagnose concussions—or prevent them from happening at all.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\nLet’s face it: staying focused in class is hard—especially in the age of technology, where laptops and cellphones are everywhere you look. Since 2000, when the mobile revolution began, the average attention span dropped from 12 to eight seconds. It is hard to focus when you’re distracted by chatter in the back of the class and a never-ending stream of late students. This difficulty increases with lecture lengths.\nAlthough the average attention span has dropped quite a bit, fourth-year psychology student Shakil Mirza says it heavily depends on the lecture. “I have sat through three-hour psychology lectures once a week, and one-hour biology lectures three times a week. I’ve been alert and more attentive in the latter, because I’d be more interested [and] there is no time to doze off. Even with a middle break in a three-hour lecture, not everyone comes back to class,” says Mirza. One of the perks of hour-long lectures is that there’s no time to stop—so you’d better write notes and stay focused as if your life depended on it.\nBut what about the dreaded three-hour lectures? How do students possibly stay focused? Are they simply wasting their time? The answer is, surprisingly, that there are some benefits to long lectures. For one, commuting times can be reduced, saving time and money. Rather than travelling to campus several times a week, stacking up longer classes could cut down on days travelling to school, thus saving those pricey tokens. You know that a broke student is willing to do anything to save those valuable dollars.\n“All of my courses are three-hour classes, and sometimes they are back-to-back. I actually prefer three-hours lectures over [hour-long] lectures as it cuts down on commute time. But I do often struggle with paying attention. I try to sit close enough to the [professor] that I can engage in discussion, but far enough so that I can slip out easily if I need a break, which is often,” says fourth-year global health policy, management and systems student Anmol Yagnik.\nThree-hour lectures allow for more opportunities to spend time with the professor and fellow students to develop a strong connection with them. “I love long lectures as I feel the professors cover more of the material in detail. They are more prone to tell their personal stories regarding the text or theories presented, which I enjoy. It makes it easier to comprehend and more interesting,” says third-year psychology student Waverly Pegelo.\nThat being said, if you are planning to take or currently taking three-hour-long lectures, try to find a different course offering that can break them down into one-hour lectures. If you cram your schedule with class after class of three-hour lectures, be mindful of the hazards and honest with yourself: are you actually learning and retaining the material, or are you just wasting your time and money? It does depend on preference and on the specific person.\nIf it is nearly impossible to split your class schedule, here are some tips. Turn off all devices, such as your cellphone and laptop, if possible. This prevents the possibility of opening time-wasting applications. Sitting in the front of the class will keep you focused and be an incentive to not use your devices. Ask yourself if you really need to bring a laptop to take notes. Recent research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton University and the University of California found that writing notes by hand requires a different type of cognitive processing than when typing notes. Since writing by hand is a slower method, it also allows for more time to digest information. Try finding a professor with favourable ratings.

Maybe your friend tattooed his ex-girlfriend’s name on his arm, or maybe your grandpa has a tattoo hidden away from his rock n’ roll days. Maybe you have a tattoo yourself. If so, you might have found yourself exploring this unique art form in a museum exhibit. \nThis year the Royal Ontario Museum, or ROM, hosted an exhibit dedicated to showcasing the diverse body art form of tattooing. Tattoos: Ritual. Identity. Obsession. Art, opened its doors on April 2, 2016 and closed on September 5, 2016. Visitors were invited to an exhibition that not only displayed the uniqueness and variety of tattoos, but also the traditional, historical and cultural context associated with this intrinsic art form. \xa0\nThe exhibit enabled onlookers to have a multifaceted learning experience. Spanning over the course of 5,000 years, the exhibit provided a history of both ancient and modern tattoos, while also paying tribute and highlighting some of the world’s most famous and talented tattoo artists, such as Sailor Jerry, and their respected pieces. This was done using various visual aids, artifacts, posters and silicone figures that were used to reproduce tattoo pieces. \nTools that were used to draw tattoos were scattered all over the museum. One of the more complex and inventive tools featured was a handmade tattoo gun crafted by prison inmates. Using the limited supplies available, the prisoners were able to use ball point pens, wire and spool to create electric and manual machines. \nThe exhibit also provided a historic and cultural context for tattoos, exploring how tattoos are regarded in America, Asia and Europe. In a historical context, the museum displayed photographs of the chests of Auschwitz prisoners in Nazi camps and the identification tattoos the Nazis’ inked onto the inmates’ skin. Juxtaposed with these pictures were the bodies of the grandchildren of some of these survivors, who tattooed the identification numbers onto their skin as a way to remember and honour their family and family history. \nOn a cultural level, the museum explored what tattoos meant to different cultures, such as the Japanese. This was explored through a documentary video that interviewed famous and rewound Japanese tattoo artist Horiyoshi III, who specializes in full body tattoos. Horiyoshi III said that tattoos are important to the Japanese culture he caters to because they view tattoos as a symbolic and personal expression. When a person goes out to the workplace, they are seen as that person; a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher. However, once they are in their naked form, their tattoos became their own personal, symbolic expression of their true inner identity. In a Japanese cultural context, tattoos are essential in cultivating modes of personal identity and expression. \nEvery empty space, every wall and every corner of the tattoo exhibit was scattered with unique information on tattoos and the rich history that accompanies it. Whether you have your own obsession with tattoos, want to learn more about this ancient form of body art, or have a burning passion for history, the exhibit satisfied all these interests. What was most amazing about the exhibit was the way it took tattoos and gave them an identity not many would expect. In modern society, tattoos are met with mixed reactions, but a spectator who went to the exhibit would have left with a newly found perspective that hopefully allowed them to see that tattoos are more than just ink on skin; they are a tool for cultures to cultivate identities that penetrate external surfaces.\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAs an international student, I come from a country where student activism and politics are banned across university campuses and journalism has become a guise for promoting a corporate agenda.\nComing to York, colloquially referred to as a “social justice university,” I found a sense of freedom in expression and joined many social justice groups on campus in various leadership capacities.\nI also ended up becoming the assistant news editor at Excalibur, York’s largest student newspaper.
