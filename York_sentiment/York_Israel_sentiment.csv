There are about 8 to 10 LCD screens, all with the same info. Meanwhile, some kid is struggling to pay tuition.\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nYuni Kim\nAssistant News Editor\nTwo weeks after York history prof. David Noble mailed a letter to the university’s president, Mamdouh Shoukri, about York’s policies on student club activities, he received an official response from the administration, as well as several unsolicited press releases from on and off campus Jewish groups.\nNoble, whose original letter to Shoukri alleged the Hillel@York Jewish student group serves as, “in effect, an agent of a foreign government,” said he was “dismayed” after having gone over the content of the response letter.\n“It is the right of any community member to express his or her view within the law and without fear of intimidation or harassment,” wrote Rob Tiffin, vice-president students at York, in a letter to Noble dated Oct. 21. “This extends to the members of a student organization such as Hillel.”\nNoble, who is on sabbatical this academic year, is not satisfied with the response. “They’re not answering the question,” he said.\n“It’s much more than disappointment. I’m dismayed.”\n“[York] is continuing to endorse Hillel’s acting as a de facto agent of a foreign government,” Noble added.\n“The significance of Tiffin’s letter is that the university has now moved from a tacit endorsement […] that any state that wants to establish themselves using a student organi- zation as a lobbying agency is now officially sanctioned. That’s what that letter means.”\nTiffin’s letter noted that, according to Presidential Regulation 4, a “student organization” is defined as a group of students who voluntarily congregate with common interest, and may include “organizations formed for purposes of carrying forward a particular activity, cause or project” and not necessarily associated with an academic discipline.\nBrandon Crandall, president of Hillel@ York, insisted his club does not work for any governmental organization and is in full compliance with university rules and regulations.\n“We’ve been on campus as the primary voice for Jewish life and for non-Jewish students who are interested in Judaism and Jewish culture,” he said. “We hold no political alliances with any parties […] we firmly deny being agents of a foreign government.”\nNoble’s take on Hillel@York’s activities was apparently inspired by a Facebook group called “Israel Affairs – Hillel @ York,” moderated by Jennifer Cogan Diamond, who, according to the Hillel of Greater Toronto website, is the Israel Affairs Program Associate for the Toronto organization.\nNoble attached a screen capture of the group’s front page to his initial letter. The group’s description begins, “We are the advocates for Israel on York campus.”\nWhen asked about the “Israel Affairs” Facebook group, Crandall explained that the group is indeed involved with Hillel@York, but that their support for Israel is historically rooted in the Jewish faith.\nMeanwhile, several Jewish and Israeli groups both on and off campus expressed disdain for Noble’s interpretation of Hillel@York’s activities. Sammy Katz, managing director of the Canadian Network for Israel Affairs and former president of Hasbara at York, felt that Noble was unjustified in condemning Hillel as serving as an agent of a foreign government. “Supporting Israel on campus does not mean that you are acting on behalf of a foreign government,” Katz said in an Oct. 20 press release.\n“Rather, students and organizations that support Israel on campus are supporting democracy, human rights, equality and peace.” Aaron Rosenberg, president of B’nai Brith OnCampus York, felt that Noble’s claims were isolating Jewish student groups on campus.\n“Numerous groups and a large number of students at York University […] stand behind the democratic Jewish State of Israel,” said Rosenberg in a statement made to Excalibur.\n“[Noble] continues to make a mockery of this university’s claimed policies of inclusion. Should this be tolerated at our proudly multicultural university?”\nNoble is still pursuing a defamation lawsuit he filed in 2006 against Hillel of Great- er Toronto, as well as several other Jewish groups and the York University Foundation, for $19 million in relation to press releases they’d issued about a pamphlet he’d distributed in 2004.\n ', 'Right on Mike!!\nI laugh everytime I see that space. What a complete joke. More quiet study rooms might have been nice! This is a library, not a lounge. Welcome to York, leave your common sense on the way in.\nLiving that awful architectural desecration right now over here at UBC in Vancouver where the Old Main Library was gutted to make this look like something high end casual Oxford. What happens? Now I have students bellowing on phones and playing with facebook because the old serious space has been gutted for something I consider the lowest common denominator where students can hang out and say they were at the library . We get to call ours the Barber Learning Commons.

The abortion debate is definitely one of the most emotionally charged debates that exist, but there’s apparently nowhere for people to hear and learn about the issues surrounding it anymore.\nIt is frankly unacceptable that several pro-life, tuition-paying students at Carleton University were arrested because they refused to take their protest signs into a closed classroom.\nThese students have the right to a peaceful protest. A protest, by definition, is an expression or declaration of an opposing view. Protesting in a closed classroom isn’t really a protest, now is it?\nUniversity campuses are paid for mainly by the government, and by student tuition. Thus, the campus belongs in part to the students and the government. It seems funny that government-given rights seem to be the ones getting trumped by an administration that is not part of either group.\nAs students, we are challenged to think outside the box, develop our own opinions and listen to those of others, no matter how ridiculous they may sound to us. Heaven forbid we put this into practice and actually try to spread a message to a broader audience or show our disapproval with something going on around us.\nThe fact is, the abortion debate is rarely ever mentioned inside classrooms today. As many of my previous university professors have said, they just don’t want to get into something as emotionally charged as that.\nIf we can’t talk about it in the classroom, and we can’t talk about it out of the classroom, where can we talk about it?\nErin Stewart\n\nRe: “Pro-life students arrested at Car- leton,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nI am appalled to hear pro-life students were arrested at Carleton University Oct. 4, 2010 after attempting to put up a pro-life display on campus. What is this saying to a generation of students who are supposedly in an environment where education and learning are embraced? Pro-life groups on university campuses all over the country are constantly being silenced while groups of the opposite view are openly embraced. Universities should be allowing an atmosphere where students can freely debate those issues that can be hard to face. Why reject all ideas that are different than those of a popular view?\nJust because a view isn’t widely supported in certain arenas, doesn’t mean that it should be swept under the carpet. Canada was built on equality and freedoms. Most take things like freedom of expression and freedom of speech for granted until they are put in a position like these students were. For the sake of this nation, we need to take a stand against this type of injustice.\nRachel Barrett\n\nRe: “YFS Schulich director accused of harassment,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a student from the Schulich School of Business, I would like to commend Gregory Kay for his efforts to try to represent our faculty, which is already underrepresented at our university, at the Canadian Federation of Students annual general meeting. I read in the article that Kay tried to apply to attend the meeting and was refused by another member. This makes me question Jeremy Salter’s comments on the lack of tension between him and Kay, especially since there was controversy surrounding the disqualification of Kay and other members during last year’s election process.\nIn addition to the concerns surrounding Kay’s case, I find it strange YFS board members are not permitted to share information discussed in meetings with non-members. I agree that this demonstrates a lack of transparency in our university’s student union, which is supposed to be working to represent us. I do hope that this issue gets resolved and Kay’s name is cleared, as I have always known him to be an excellent representative who does his best to serve the constituents he represents.\nAlicia Gutierrez\nRe: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a Jewish student at York University, I am offended and insulted by prof. David Noble’s remarks against a Jewish student group at York. By attacking and isolating the Jewish student group, Noble is making a campus that’s already toxic and unwelcoming for Jewish students a more poisonous environment.\nBeing a Jewish student in Canada means many things to me. It means broadening my horizons and gaining knowledge. It does not mean feeling ostracized by students and faculty. It does not mean professors using the classroom as a podium to reveal their personal political leanings. It does not mean Jewish students hiding their religion, ideas and opinions for fear their professor will grade them lower.\nIt is the responsibility of the administration and faculty to ensure students feel safe, something they have failed to do. York is perceived as unfriendly because of the actions of people like prof. Noble.\nMarlee Mozeson\nRe: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010\nAs a Jewish student in York University’s community, I am offended by prof. David Noble’s remarks against a Jewish student group at York. In particular, I disagree with his calling on president Shoukri to end York’s support of Hillel due to the club’s advocacy on behalf of the state of Israel. Comments such as these, especially from the university’s so-called “noble” and “elite,” have no place in any university, and more importantly, incite intolerance and hatred, which is all too common at York University.\nNobility is not something received at birth, it is a virtue earned through the tolerance and respect of others.

We report all of our activities at monthly [BoD] meetings through well-documented and well-developed board reports,” said Saravanamuttu.\n“In addition, I would respectfully say that that’s an asinine-type logic. If we were to follow that logic, that means I wouldn’t be able to respond to an email or pick up a phone call until our monthly board meeting,” he argued.\nAlex Bilyk, York’s director of media relations, confirmed the YFS hired five Toronto police officers\xa0at a cost of approximately $3,500 while York provided five of its own security officers for $2,400, a total of $5,900.\nSaravanamuttu said he could not comment on the security costs because they have not yet been finalized.\nAccording to Bilyk, in addition to the five officers already provided, Toronto police 31 division made their own assessment and decided to send an additional 15 officers for the event.\nToronto Police Constable Trish Mills, 31 division community relations officer, was not available for comment at the time of the publication.\nKay argued the YFS should never have spent any money in bringing in such a controversial figure to the campus.\n“I think the YFS was founded to promote unity and they’re clearly not accomplishing that goal,” said Kay. “They knew this would be very divisive.”\n“These aren’t the average views of the York population and for […] the YFS to advance their own political agenda through bringing in George Galloway appals the mainstream student body and is a huge misappropriation of student funds,” he added.\nSaravanamuttu maintains that aside from the money spent on security, no student funds were spent to host the event.\n“I think Kay may be unaware of or simply choosing to ignore the fact that the YFS made no financial contribution to have Mr. Galloway speak at York University,” said Saravanamuttu.\nHe also stated the money made from selling tickets for the event were donated to the Canadian Peace Alliance for their upcoming anti-war convention in March.\nGeorge Galloway spoke at York Nov. 16.

It is York’s money, and it is York’s ethical obligation.”\nLapointe said the university’s investment philosophy is inherently flawed.\n“As long as our university remains invested in companies that profit from war crimes, it continues to make a mockery of its stated commitments to human rights and social justice,” she said. “‘Active engagement’ is a very\nslow and ineffective tool [and it’s] not possible at all when the company’s main business is to manufacture weapons which are, by definition, death machines.”\nOmar Dominguez, chair and co-founder of the Coalition of Universities for Responsible Investing, said York is on the right track.\n“Issues like military spending are bound to be controversial,” he said. “But if you divest from these companies, it really leaves you out of an opportunity to negotiate with the companies and try to address your concerns.”\nNevertheless, Dominguez appreciated SAIA’s efforts to include students in these discussions.\n“We encourage universities to combine the university trustees – who are ultimately responsible for these decisions – with faculty who have expertise on the very issues, to include the views of students, who are some of the beneficiaries, and to include multiple stakeholders,” he said of his coalition’s goals.\nPound-Curtis also pointed out that since they switched investment managers in late February, York is no longer investing in Hewlett-Packard or Northrop Grumman, and that they have not invested in Lockheed Martin since August 2010.\nIn fact, York is currently invested in only one of SAIA’s four target companies, BAE Systems, via the university’s pension fund.\n“We’ve about a million dollars [in BAE Systems] out of our total pension fund, which is $1.4 billion dollars – it’s insignificant,” said Pound-Curtis. “We will have a discussion with our investment manager to ask if they’d considered any of the facts [of SAIA’s report].”\nLapointe emphasized that York has not yet promised not to reinvest in these companies.\n“Pound-Curtis has not addressed any of the three demands of our divestment campaign,” she said.\nAnne Bayefsky, a political science professor at York University who specializes in international human rights, thinks the campaign is wrongheaded because of its focus on Israel as an apartheid state.\n“Israel, like all states, is entitled to the rights of self-defense,” she explained. “Efforts to deny Israel’s right to self-defense are, in fact, the inverse of the declared intention of people concerned with apartheid because it would deny the Jewish people a homeland where they can find protection and security.”\nIn their report, SAIA compares Israeli policy to apartheid South Africa, citing a study, “Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?” by the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. But Bayefsky thinks the evidence points in the opposite direction.\n“Everyone should be concerned about human rights, but we have to take a good hard look at the facts,” she said. “The evidence clearly indicates that Israel – a country where one-fifth of the population is Arab with full democratic rights and representation at the highest levels of Israeli society – is not an apartheid state.”\nTo read SAIA’s full report, “Holding York University Accountable,” visit\xa0 www.toronto.saia.ca.\nWith files from Brent Rose and Yuni Kim\n ', 'Am I seeing things, or is there a hideous misuse of the possessive apostrophe in the title?\nHi Harrison!

These findings have been made by experts of International law: academics, UN investigations, Amnesty International, Human rights watch have found Israel’s actions and the bodies that support it are in constant violation of international law.\nExcalibur, readers are tired of this open love for apartheid.\nI agree, Steve. Just google the professor Anne Bayefsky. She is a pretty outspoken Israel sympathizer. I understand that the writer of the article felt that they were balancing SAIA with this professor, but it’s actually unbalanced.\nUsing a professor’s (expert’s) comments against a student group’s comments is not leveled. Why not get Dr. Rahnema to comment? After all, he only teaches the most popular course on Israel/Palestine Relations in all of York. Or any other political professor who specializes in Middle East Politics?\nThe end of this article is atrocious.

According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.\n(Pippin Lee)\nThe new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.\nWhen the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed\ninformation.\nThe new by-laws have left some York students furious.\nIt’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.\n“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”\nMany students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.\nCouncillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.\n“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.\nHe urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.\n“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”\nPeruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.\nStudents that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.\nThe university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.\n“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.\nAccording to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.\nWith the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from\xa0 8 am and 8 pm.\nYork currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.\nWith files from Amelia Ruthven-Nelson\n ']","['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/03/30/york-policy-on-ethical-investment-counters-student-groups/', 'https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2011/03/30/you-cant-park-here/']",0.30950121581554413,0.5521184206008911,0.20245538279414177

Contrary to cyberbullying fears, the blogosphere provides teens “with a safe area for self-exposure.” Blogging can “improve self-image, increase self-confidence, and gather friends.”\nThe study says blogging is considered ideal for anyone who is stressed, depressed, and anxious.\nPsychologists have recommended writing in the past as a method of emotional venting and problem solving. Writing, the authors of the study say, “influences the emotional state, as well as the social behavior of the writer.”\nBut blogging is different from writing in a journal. “Online writing enables free expression, easy rereading and editing, and convenient communication with others,” the study goes on to say.\nBloggers are in control of the interpersonal conversation online. Teenagers can modify their thoughts and decide if they would like their blog to be open to other peoples’ posts. The interpersonal sharing with others helps teens reduce their social stress.\n“The virtual environment gives [teens] a feeling of privacy and a sense of protection from exposure[…]or physical contact,” the study says, “which might be threatening in face-to-face encounters.” Bloggers can hide personal information from family and friends, but can engage in conversations with strangers who can give them advice.\nGenerally, teens are confident sharing their feelings online due to the anonymity and invisibility of the internet. Instead of seeing others’ reactions by sharing their problems publicly, they can focus on the content.\xa0 Because of this, blogging is a bigger release for teenagers.\nIn the study, a total of 161 teens participated, with 124 girls and 37 boys. They were asked to rate themselves by their level of self-esteem, peer relationship, and interpersonal activities. During the study, experts evaluated “the participants’ social–emotional condition” by reading their blog posts.\nIn total, participants were\xa0rated on 30 posts. The first and second group posted messages in their blogs on “their thoughts and feelings concerning their social\xa0circumstances and interpersonal relationships.” The first group opened their blog to others, the second did not. The third and fourth groups wrote “about any subject they wished.” The third group opened their blog to the public where the fourth group\xa0did not. To balance the study, a fifth group served as a control by writing entries in their personal diaries.\nUnlike diarists, the study shows that, “online writers describe their writing process as a dynamic dialogue.”\nBlogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter combine public and private worlds. Writers can construct identities online. By constructing their own identity, teens can manage the intimate details they choose to share or withhold from others.\nBloggers, the researchers imply, are in control even if their situation is spiralling out of control-—a comforting thought whenever a blog is updated.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2012/01/30/the-benefits-of-blogging/'],0.7007854580879211,0.04531155899167061,0.03467704355716705

There are crumbling walls, piles of rubble, and garbage surrounding them all. The men and women who live in these poor conditions are victims of prejudice. This is where Tyler Koverko, a York law student, finds himself with a pit in his stomach.\nKoverko, a second-year criminal law student at Osgoode, had a lot of interest in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but he had no genuine understanding of the situation before visiting Bethlehem.\nHowever, last summer, he was awarded $5,000 to plan a trip to Jerusalem where he saw firsthand what the long-standing conflict looks like.\nKoverko left for Jerusalem having no partiality for either side. He considered himself an interested third party. With a general understanding, he wanted to better comprehend the conflict and also experience what everyday life was like. Being stationed primarily in Israel, he decided to go out and see what waited for him. That was when he saw Aida.\nAida was established in 1950, and holds over 4,000 refugees. It is just one of 19 refugee camps in the West Bank. There are 62 Palestinian refugee camps across Jordan, Syria, Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon. These camps house more than four million refugees that were displaced as a result of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.\nThese people were either forced out of their homes or chose to leave the country.\nKoverko was able to see much more than what is reported in the North American media. Even though he began this trip with an open mind towards both sides, biases were unavoidable. However, seeing firsthand a decrepit Palestinian refugee camp and victims of suicide bombings, Koverko felt these biases “beaten out of him,” leaving behind the difficulty to find a “human side” of the issue.\nThese people were not characters in a movie; they have to continue to live this way everyday. Koverko was surprised to discover that not just the camp’s leaders, but also the children spoke fluent English. Not only did they speak English, most of them were fairly sophisticated and bright—welcoming him wholeheartedly. He saw “human beings with souls behind all the political madness.” It became clear how irresponsible it is to generalize an entire group of people that are caught up in politics that expand far beyond their power.\nA major surprise for him was the amicability of Jerusalem.\nThis trip was very important for Koverko, but he does not want you to simply take his word for it.\n“This experience was awesome, unforgettable, a slap in the face and it opened up a major world conflict to me,” he says. These same opportunities are available to all students who wish to take advantage of them. “I learned immediately that you can’t understand why people believe so strongly in the cause, until you know the history.”\nJerusalem was “a life changing experience,” for Koverko.\n“Whatever I thought was immediately transformed through personal experience,” he says.\nKoverko says he left Canada with little bias towards either the Israelis or Palestinians and came back with even less. It was no longer “this group or this group,” but simply people caught up in defending their rights and beliefs that they hold so sacred.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2012/04/04/a-strangers-look-into-bethlehem/'],0.652434229850769,0.6965954899787903,0.37733152508735657

They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.\nWhile both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.\n“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.\nVanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.\n“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”\nThe BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.\nAs of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.\nThe campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.\nMembers of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012. They celebrated the YFS’s endorsement after the meeting at around 1:45 p.m. with a march around campus, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “victory.”\nThe Graduate Students Association at York endorsed the BDS campaign on November 16, 2012, as have other student organizations including the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association and the University of Toronto Graduate Student Union.\nHillel at York and Hasbara @ York condemned YFS’s endorsement of the BDS campaign on behalf of York’s undergraduate students and issued a statement through the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.\nIn the statement, Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara @ York, says Hasbara is “extremely disappointed” that the YFS passed this resolution. He alleges the YFS is “blacklisting and boycotting Israelis.” Lax also alleges the YFS’ resolution is “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”\nCherkasov says as a union representing the interests of 55,000 undergraduates, the YFS should not take a political stance on an issue that does not affect all students on campus.\n“I understand that we all have our personal opinions, but the fact that [the YFS] took a stance on a very touchy issue for Israeli and Palestinian students, I think that was inappropriate,” says Cherkasov. “Now, they have marginalized a group of students and created a hostile environment because they adopted the BDS movement.”\nLax echoed Cherkasov’s opinion, saying the YFS should not take a political stance that could divide the campus.\nHe says 4,000 students have signed a petition against the GSA’s endorsement of BDS, created in November 2012 by Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York.\n“It showed a substantial amount of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.\nHusein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.\nShe says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she would be happy to meet with them to discuss it.\n“Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important,” says Husein.\nHusein says to remain silent on issues of basic equality is often a tacit endorsement of injustice.\n“We engage in anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, and anti-sexism campaigns not because they are popular, but because they are right, and they are important to our members,” she says.\nJoanne Rider of York media says university administration has not been contacted by the YFS or any other student groups regarding this campaign.\nSAIA will be holding a protest March 27 in Vari Hall at 1 p.m. to call on university administration to address their demands.\nMelissa Sundardas, News Editor\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2013/03/27/yfs-endorses-bds-campaign/'],0.2759419083595276,0.9856772422790527,0.44632115960121155

After\xa0receiving warning letters, the Students Against Israeli Apartheid had their club status revoked for\xa0“repeated disruption of academic activities.”\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid’s status as an officially recognized student group at York was revoked by the university following a rally held in Vari Hall on March\xa027.\nJanet Morrison, vice-provost students, who makes decisions with respect to club statuses, de-listed SAIA as an official club until January 2014 for “repeated disruption of academic activities,” according to Joanne Rider of York media.\n“Specifically, SAIA will not be able to book space or otherwise access university resources directly or through another student organization,” says the notification letter from Morrison. SAIA is also “debarred from re-registering for official student group status” until January 1, 2014.\nRider says this isn’t the first time that SAIA has “disrupted academic activities” during one of their rallies and that this action wasn’t taken lightly. The university follows a similar process with any student club, association, or organization when university policies are violated, she explains.\n“We followed due process including warning SAIA a number of times before we made the decision to sanction them,” says Rider.\nSAIA was notified on May 3 by York that their club status had been revoked via email and letter delivered by Morrison.\nAlong with SAIA, a number of other groups were present at the rally, including the York University Black Students’ Association, York’s chapter of the Filipino Canadian Youth Alliance, the Middle Eastern Students’ Association, Ontario Public Interest Research Group-York, Independent Jewish Voices – Toronto, Fightback, and CUPE 3903.\n“An unprecedented attack on academic freedom and freedom of speech on the York University campus.”\xa0\nA few members of student groups involved in the rally received warning letters from the university.\nExcalibur obtained a copy of the letter sent from the university to Arshiya Lakhani, one of the students who spoke at the March 27 rally.\n“By this letter, the University is giving you notice that should you in future fail to comply with applicable regulations of the University […] York University may invoke disciplinary action against you in accordance with applicable University rules,” the letter said.\nLetters were also sent to the presidents of YUBSA and the Middle Eastern Students’ Association, among other students.\n“The warning letters sent from the university definitely felt threatening,” says SAIA member Huda Al-Sarraj.\nYUBSA and Rider were contacted concerning warning letters but were unable to be reached in time.\n“Receiving the letters and threatening us is problematic because all these clubs involved are fighting for fundamental rights, like YUBSA who fight against racial profiling and for black rights,” says Al-Sarraj.\nThe rally in question took place one week after the York Federation of Students endorsed the Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign at a board of directors’ meeting, joining York’s Graduate Students’ Association in their support of the movement.\nIn a post on SAIA’s Facebook page, the group writes that the university’s decision to revoke their status is an “unprecedented attack on academic freedom and freedom of speech on the York University campus.”\nWhen asked for a response, Rider says, “York University encourages freedom of expression and debate of controversial issues, and values diverse perspectives.\xa0 The university does not permit such expression to compromise or disrupt classes or other academic activities.”\n“With the March 27 rally, we wanted to show that York didn’t have an ethical investment strategy and that we needed to push for that,” says Al-Sarraj. “We cooperated with York security, and we also had a security liaison and marshal keep things under control.”\nFollowing the same rally, York alumnus and SAIA activist Hammam Farah was banned from entering York property as of April 25.\nAccording to a letter sent to Farah by Gary Brewer, vp finance and administration, Farah was banned from campus because of his participation in two demonstrations — the first on November 29, 2012, and the other on on March 27, 2013,\xa0 — where he was observed by York security using an amplification device to speak to a gathering of students and others.\nRider says Farah was banned for violating university policy.\n“Acting in violation of any York University policy or procedure may result in a review process,” says Rider. “Actions by the university as a result of the review may include banning an individual or group from campus.”\nThis is the first incident since 2009 that a club has been sanctioned by the university.\nIn 2009, SAIA and the Hasbara Fellowship were each suspended for 30 days and fined $1,000, the Tamil Students’ Association was suspended for 15 days and fined\n$500, and Hillel was fined $500 for “for their part in recent activities which disrupted classes adjacent to Vari Hall rotunda,” according to a York Media Relations press release.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2013/05/23/the-end-of-saia/'],0.1562599241733551,0.731660783290863,0.05613067001104355

This year, like any year, changed the world and added its unique stamp on history — politically, socially, and culturally. Here are some of the moments and movements that shaped the last 365 days (give or take a month).\nIn entertainment:\nJust this week, 40-year-old • Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died, tragically and ironically, in a car crash. Cory Monteith, the 31-year-old star of TV’s Glee, died of a drug overdose in July. Other notable deaths in the entertainment industry this year included singer-songwriter and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, espionage-fiction writer Tom Clancy, Sopranos star James Gandolfini, and famous film critic Roger Ebert.\nAs of publication, • Iron Man 3 was the year’s highest grossing film, while Justin Timberlake’s The 20/20 Experience and Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2 were notably successful albums. Grand Theft Auto V was the top video game, and had the biggest debut of any entertainment release in history.\nGravity• and 12 Years a Slave are currently the frontrunners for Best Picture at next year’s Oscars. The former was a giant leap for mankind in terms of technical innovation; the latter is one of the most brutal accounts of history to come from Hollywood — this decade’s Schindler’s List.\xa0\nBreaking Bad • had record ratings for a cable series in its final episodes, and furthermore, cemented its legacy as what some are calling the best television show of all time.\nMiley Cyrus and Amanda • Bynes: two famous female tweens grew into raunchy, notorious adults… seemingly in months. Cyrus has found success and new fandom thanks to her racy persona, but Bynes has been deemed mentally unstable due to her self-destructive, concerning online presence.\nEvents:\nThe Chelyabinsk Meteor collided with Earth, causing major destruction and injuries in Russia. It was the largest object to enter the planet’s atmosphere in over 100 years.\nThe Boston Bombing: two \xa0explosives detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 264. It was one of the most shocking acts of terrorism in the U.S. since 9/11.\nPope Benedict XVI resigned: the first pope to do so in 600 years. He was succeeded by Pope Francis of Argentina.\nIn April, an eight-story building collapsed in Bangladesh, killing 1,129 people. Over 2,500 more were injured.\nNovember saw one of the \xa0worst natural disasters of the decade: Typhoon Haiyan, which killed 5,653 people in the Philippines and Vietnam.\nPrince William and Kate Middleton had their first child together. Prince George, the “Royal Baby,” could hypothetically be king in the future, if the monarchy is kept.\nGeorge Zimmerman, who shot and killed an unarmed black man named Trayvon Martin in 2012, was acquitted of the charge, in the year’s most contentious court case.\nAt York:\nCanadian filmmaker and York professor, was imprisoned in Egypt on August 16th, along with Dr. Tarek Loubani. The two-month arrest included a hunger strike. Greyson was finally freed on October 5th.\nThe subway extension, which is set to bring a stop on the TTC metro system all the way to York in 2015, continued this year.

This year, like any year, changed the world and added its unique stamp on history — politically, socially, and culturally. Here are some of the moments and movements that shaped the last 365 days (give or take a month).\nIn entertainment:\nJust this week, 40-year-old • Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died, tragically and ironically, in a car crash. Cory Monteith, the 31-year-old star of TV’s Glee, died of a drug overdose in July. Other notable deaths in the entertainment industry this year included singer-songwriter and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, espionage-fiction writer Tom Clancy, Sopranos star James Gandolfini, and famous film critic Roger Ebert.\nAs of publication, • Iron Man 3 was the year’s highest grossing film, while Justin Timberlake’s The 20/20 Experience and Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2 were notably successful albums. Grand Theft Auto V was the top video game, and had the biggest debut of any entertainment release in history.\nGravity• and 12 Years a Slave are currently the frontrunners for Best Picture at next year’s Oscars. The former was a giant leap for mankind in terms of technical innovation; the latter is one of the most brutal accounts of history to come from Hollywood — this decade’s Schindler’s List.\xa0\nBreaking Bad • had record ratings for a cable series in its final episodes, and furthermore, cemented its legacy as what some are calling the best television show of all time.\nMiley Cyrus and Amanda • Bynes: two famous female tweens grew into raunchy, notorious adults… seemingly in months. Cyrus has found success and new fandom thanks to her racy persona, but Bynes has been deemed mentally unstable due to her self-destructive, concerning online presence.\nEvents:\nThe Chelyabinsk Meteor collided with Earth, causing major destruction and injuries in Russia. It was the largest object to enter the planet’s atmosphere in over 100 years.\nThe Boston Bombing: two \xa0explosives detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 264. It was one of the most shocking acts of terrorism in the U.S. since 9/11.\nPope Benedict XVI resigned: the first pope to do so in 600 years. He was succeeded by Pope Francis of Argentina.\nIn April, an eight-story building collapsed in Bangladesh, killing 1,129 people. Over 2,500 more were injured.\nNovember saw one of the \xa0worst natural disasters of the decade: Typhoon Haiyan, which killed 5,653 people in the Philippines and Vietnam.\nPrince William and Kate Middleton had their first child together. Prince George, the “Royal Baby,” could hypothetically be king in the future, if the monarchy is kept.\nGeorge Zimmerman, who shot and killed an unarmed black man named Trayvon Martin in 2012, was acquitted of the charge, in the year’s most contentious court case.\nAt York:\nCanadian filmmaker and York professor, was imprisoned in Egypt on August 16th, along with Dr. Tarek Loubani. The two-month arrest included a hunger strike. Greyson was finally freed on October 5th.\nThe subway extension, which is set to bring a stop on the TTC metro system all the way to York in 2015, continued this year. With heavier work underway, there were more bussing delays, and some total reshaping of the campus.\nFor no good reason but democracy, York’s students voted in favour of a new Student Centre, which will set our financially-challenged school back another few million dollars.\nThe Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) have played a major role in recent York University news: security has had alumni protestors leave the campus, a past student was banned for his involvement in a SAIA rally in March, and the group’s official status as a York club was revoked.

It’s extremely unproductive and totally misrepresents the work of these activists at York University.\nThis is not an issue of Palestine vs. Israel. This is an issue of whether a public institution which ostensibly promotes itself as an advocate for social justice and human rights issues uses tuition dollars to invest in bombs, guns and other weapon paraphernalia to kill other human beings across the world.\nIt is a matter of morality.\nTo distort the BDS argument as simply, “marginalization of pro-Israeli students” misses the point entirely and confines the divestment argument to an entirely self-imposed narrative that comes from one’s own insecurity and fear of the “other”.\nThere is only one side, that is humanity.\nWithout a doubt York is an organization feasting on our tax dollars, with low educated lifers making 6 figures and completely unqualified for the positions they occupy.

She heard a knock on her door, said Pirraglia. Meng then saw a man attempt to hug Liu before pushing his way into her bedroom and knocking her webcam off the computer.\n“He shoved Ms. Liu causing her to fall off camera in the direction of her bed,” said Pirraglia. “Mr. Meng, no longer able to see any images, heard Ms. Liu saying the word ‘no’ in both English and Mandarin.”\nPirraglia said after two muffled bangs, Meng never heard Liu’s voice again, and before the screen was shut, he saw the man approach the computer, naked from the waist down.\nRobert Nuttall, the lawyer representing Dickson, asked the jury to return with a verdict of manslaughter, stating at the beginning of the trial, “This is not a case of who did it; this is a what happened case.”\nHe also stated that the jury members should pay close attention to the forensic evidence.\nDickson’s trial is expected to last three to four weeks with a 14-member jury.\nA doctor who examined the body is expected to testify as a witness on March 25, along with Detective-Sergeant Frank Skubic, a lead investigator in the case.\nVictoria Alarcon\nAssistant News Editor\n\x1f\x1e\x1e\x1d\x1e\x1c\x1f\x1b\x1c \x1b\x1a\x19\x1e \x1a\x18\x1d\x1c\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nProminent York faculty and community members spoke in the Student Centre on March 25 to publicize alleged violations of student rights and civil liberties by York’s administration.\nProfessors David McNally, John Greyson, and Penni Stewart, as well as CUPE 3903 Chairperson Faiz Ahmed and alumnus Hamman Farah all spoke at the event.\nFarah, who was banned from campus in the spring of 2013 following a rally held by Students Against Israeli Apartheid, says administrators cannot be allowed to continue to intimidate and harass students in unrestrained manner.\xa0\nFarah also points to York’s revocation of SAIA’s club status on March 27, 2013, as an example of this harassment and intimidation from York’s administration.\nDespite being banned from campus, Farah still spoke at the event.\nJoanne Rider of York media responded to Excalibur’s request for comment via email, stating that freedom of expressions is one of York’s guiding principles.\n“Members of the York community have the right to express their views and to test and challenge ideas, provided they do so within the law, and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner that does not disrupt academic activity,” Rider continues.\xa0\nShe also adds that York’s responsibility is to protect the academic environment, while ensuring all community members abide by agreed upon standards of conduct, which allow students to pursue their studies “free from unwelcome disruptions.”\n“York has and will continue to ensure these policies are communicated, understood, and adhered to in a consistent manner,” says Rider.\nThe event was not prevented by York administration, as it was approved by the Student Centre board and included participation from the York Federation of Students.\nFarah is pushing for York to amend their Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Senate Policy on Disruptive and/or Harassing Behaviour in Academic Situations, and the Temporary Use of University Space policy to reflect Canadian values of freedom of expression.\n“Free speech and free assembly are important to students,” he says. “This is where we learn the most about these basic democratic values, and where the most opportunities arise to exercise them.”\nDavid McNally, a political science professor, spoke out in support of SAIA and Farah. Hereferenced a letter signed by 150 faculty members urging the administration to recognize civil rights violations and begin amending policies on the use of student space and the student code of conduct.\n“You cannot maintain any of kind of democratic culture in a society unless basic rights to express opinions and assemble on behalf of those opinions is secure,” says McNally.\nHe cites the treatment of SAIA and Farah as a specific problem within York’s democratic culture. McNally also believes the York administration is attempting to “roll back the gains that student and social movements have made in regards to free speech and free assembly, particularly those with dissenting opinions.”\n“Speaking as a political scientist, I don’t see how I can go into my classes and try to transmit to students the importance of basic civil rights in a democratic society, and then not speak out when I see my own administration violating them,” he says.\nMcNally says the event will only have been successful if it contributes to increasing pressure on the York administration to “get serious about civil rights and student rights.”\nMichael Burton\nExecutive Editor (Online)\nWith files from Ryan Moore\n ']","['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2014/03/26/new-details-revealed-in-village-murder-trial/', 'https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2014/03/26/professors-and-union-representatives-speak-out-in-fight-for-student-rights/']",0.057702564634382725,0.4296642243862152,0.024490146432071924

The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.\nExcalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.\nWhen they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.\nWhether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.\nOne reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.\nWhile I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.\nBut it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.\nSome believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.\nHave students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?\nThere are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.\nI’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.\nThere are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.\nWhen it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.\nStudents Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.\nBut more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.\nIf you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.\nThis year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause.

BDS has no place in an Ontario that welcomes everybody,” he adds.\nIn a phone call with Excalibur, representatives for Horwath say the MPP wasn’t aware of any SAIA members at the meeting, while the purpose of the meeting was to discuss anti-racism initiatives.\n“The Jewish community at York is home to a diversity of political opinions,” says Manisha Joshi-Vijayan, second-year English student, and the SAIA member allegedly featured in the photo.\n“The York chapter of Independent Jewish Voices, for example, advocates for equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians.

The views do not reflect Excalibur, its publishers or masthead.\nMatthew Chin\nThe media war against Israel still continues at York and has manifested itself in the well-known forms we’ve come acquainted with. It was only recently that an anti-Israel parade had made itself publicly known to the student body in the February 4 YU Divest protest in Vari Hall and the Student Centre.\nThe anti-Israel and anti-Zionist agendas are seen by many as a humanitarian-aid effort to help those who are under an alleged occupation. Yet, Jewish people whose beliefs, customs, and origins came from the very land that’s being disputed among the world’s powers is seen as illegitimate. It’s true that many of us have been conditioned by the media on this campus to think of Israel as an apartheid state and that war is being waged every second of everyday, but the truth is, as I found it, surprisingly different. Israel does what’s necessary to protect her people, her history, and her existence. For the reader who’s ignorant of Jewish history, allow me to educate you – throughout history, the Jews were constantly exiled, slaughtered, and discriminated, but they kept on believing in a future for themselves. A future where Jews could find peace and return to the place they always called home. This was re-established in 1948 – the year Israel gained independence.\nIs it not okay for one to dream? To not aspire? To defend his right to exist on the soil of their forefathers? I implore the readers to please educate themselves and to actually talk with those who are being ostracized (the Jews), rather than blindly accept the biased material being excreted by anti-Zionists on campus, who strategically disguise themselves as a human rights council, when they are not.\nWith my first visit to the Promised Land, I was expecting soldiers to be in their numbers and the possibility of a missile raining down on my family. Okay, I confess, soldiers and police were almost everywhere I went, but it was their presence that made me feel okay. I didn’t have to turn around every second to make sure no one was going to stab me to death.\nAs the Trinidadian that I am and as a student who chooses to educate himself, I have a deep concern for the kind of information and the politicized atmosphere being dispersed at York. But as the proud Zionist that I am, I remain unafraid to express my love for Israel on this campus, as it is a testimony and monument of people who refuse to be swayed, assimilated, and judged by the world’s standards.\nThe next time you observe the extremist bandwagons of those who oppose Israel in the Student Centre, those oppose the Jewish people and the refuge in which they yearned for, try putting yourself into the shoes of a Jew and simply ask yourself, what would coming home feel like after 3,000 years of being away from it? If you said it was good to come home, then I say to you, mazel tov! You’re a Zionist and being unapologetic for it is one of the bravest things you could be at York.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/op-ed/2016/02/29/community-editorial-media-wars-on-israel/'],0.9240692257881165,0.8646102547645569,0.03152751177549362

Halévy, spokesperson for Independent Jewish Voices York.\n“Independent Jewish Voices’ presence on campus, which is comprised of Jewish and non-Jewish students working together, is evidence that inclusion is possible outside of political Zionist-led narrative,” he adds.\nGroups such as CIJA do not represent the entirety of the Jewish population, as there are other Jewish-led groups, both on- and off-campus, that understand the Israeli government’s motives and \xa0advocate for the human rights of Palestinians and equality of all peoples in the region, says Halévy.\nShoukri said this “discrepancy” of views in the Jewish community is because there are students and faculty at York who support the Palestinian causes and who are critical of policies of the State of Israel.\n“Some of this criticism is part of a legitimate political dialogue, while part of it can be seen by some as a cover for anti-Semitic sentiment,” he said.\nWhile York is in a good position to protect and support academic freedom and freedom of expression, and to draw the line when it comes to hate or other forms of discrimination or intimidation, the emotional aspects of an issue may affect some students and can make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe, according to Shoukri.\n“[T]he mostly unfair targeting of York by several Jewish organizations and individuals – perhaps in their zeal to combat anti-Semitism, which I can understand – has had a negative effect on some of our young students and has contributed to making them feel worried and victimized,” he added.\nPreviously, Shoukri said that while acting within the limits of the law, vigorous yet respectful dialogue and exchange of ideas can be deeply enriching to the academic life of an institution.\n“I believe it is the responsibility of those with strong views on any debate to act in a way that does not demonize and threaten others or make others feel unsafe,” he said.\nIndeed, the balance between freedom of expression and ensuring that all members of a community feel safe in sharing their views without intimidation is a subject worthy of discussion in a collegial environment, according to Shoukri.\n“We have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism or other forms of racism, or the advocacy of hate and violence by any group or individual,” he added, “however, it is understandable that there will be individuals who may feel challenged by some ideas.”\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2016/05/20/jewish-groups-diverge-bds-york-inclusion-committee/'],0.586097776889801,0.6017772555351257,0.49090614914894104

Given my involvement, many have branded me as playing a contradictory role of both an activist and a journalist.\nI disagree with this characterization.\nThe terms “activism” and “media” mean different things to different people. The former could imply anything from justice and equality to radicalism and extremism while the latter could imply anything from truth and accountability to lies and propaganda.\nBoth terms can have widely contrasting connotations depending on factors involved and context of discussion, yet we can perhaps agree that a combination of the two generally provokes unease and cognitive dissonance among people.\nWhile that may be true, it is just one perspective of looking at things. During my time at Excal, I have personally come to experience the converging influence of the two fields.\nJournalists and activists are not enemies nor always at loggerheads with each other. Most of the time, our work is complementary and collaborative, not in the sense that journalists endorse any particular activist agenda, but rather that we consistently keep track of and report on any arising developments within activist groups. In short, we both need each other, regardless of our differences.\nThe idea of objectivity, in context of journalism, is very misplaced. Journalism, like activism, in many ways is agenda-driven. While we aim to offer unbiased, critical perspectives, one cannot deny that there are always dominant themes and angles, a by-product of stories with cracks left unexplored.\nStudent activism has the power to expose one to hot-button issues, ranging from anti-tuition fees campaigns, campus racism and sexual violence campaigns to international issues such as the Israel-Palestine controversy and other cases of nationalistic self-determination struggles.\nWhile some may find certain campus politics disagreeable, it undeniably sparks a degree of critical thinking, which in itself is a sign of progress. Yet student politics is not immune to criticism, whether it be allegations of romanticizing and oversimplifying struggles or simply being written off as ineffective.\nThis is where we student journalists play a key role. Besides putting a spotlight on emerging issues, we indirectly give activist groups a greater impetus to act while maintaining a historic memory of community events through our extensive documentation.\nDespite points of criticism, I think it is safe to say that both activism and journalism are inevitable outcomes of challenging the status quo in an unfair world, and they are here to stay. Both are united by common themes of community, shared networks and storytelling.\nMy point is to move beyond the concept of binary thinking, of pro- this and anti- that, labelling things as right and wrong and pigeonholing ideas into neatly packaged definitions. Instead, we should aspire to create a space where we can have honest and challenging discussions about our current paradigms, where we are constantly redefining our roles and open-heartedly embracing the conflict-ridden process of changing the world.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/op-ed/2016/09/29/breaking-the-ice/'],0.7116608023643494,0.8647554516792297,0.5755804181098938

Since office space is in high demand, it is allocated annually,” the website continues.\nNikessa Joseph, promotions representative for the Caribbean Student Association, or CSA, says her club deserves more space because it has a large and active membership.\n“As far as I know, space allocation is based off of membership, events [and] presence on campus. And I feel like not only CSA, but all cultural clubs are somewhat brushed under the rug when it comes to assessing each club for space allocation and renewal,” alleges Joseph.\n“I think the process needs to be better outlined and defined.

A university that values the safety of its community should not be investing in companies that put the safety of its community members at risk, along with many other innocent people,” it reads.\nYork makes investments through its endowment fund, a pool of money utilized to generate profits that finance scholarships, bursaries and university projects.\nEvery financial quarter, a detailed investment holdings report is produced, along with a statement of investment policies and procedures.\nAs of December 2016, York held no investments in the aforementioned companies and continues to consider the integration of environmental, social and governance risk factors in its investment selection process.\nNonetheless, many do feel that there is nothing concrete stopping the university from reinvesting in them in the next financial quarter.\n“[York’s actions] prove that it is possible to ethically manage a successful endowment fund,” said YU Divest.\n“Divestment does not only require the university to pull their existing investments from these companies but also to make a binding commitment not to reinvest.”\nStudies of divestment campaigns have shown that they in fact do little to directly impact the share prices of the companies involved.\nIt is believed, however, that divestment campaigns create an impact through the generation of stigma surrounding certain industries, leading to fewer people wanting to work there or to greater popular support for policy at a university or government level.\nMore than 80 campus organizations endorse the YU Divest campaign, but it has faced criticism from numerous groups citing it as a means of promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions policy against Israel.\nSteph Baker, political liaison for Hasbara, says that they do not agree with the campaign due to the negative connotation surrounding it that makes peaceful dialogue around the topic difficult.\n“While YU Divest does not focus only on Israel, a large amount of energy is focused on promoting divestment from it,” says Baker.\n“It makes it very difficult to create a peaceful dialogue about the country when such actions are fighting against it,” she adds.\n“While some people may think that it is impossible to help Palestine while supporting Israel, it is untrue.”\nRawan Habib, vice-president campaigns and advocacy for YFS, states that the divestment campaign focuses solely on ensuring that university funds be channelled into education and the lowering of tuition fees.\n“Divestment from weapons manufacturing by [the university] and the redirection of those funds into post-secondary education is directly linked to the reduction of tuition fees and improvement in the quality of education,” she says.\nTrudy Pound-Curtis, assistant vice-president finance and CFO at York, notes that the Advisory Committee on Responsible Investing includes staff, faculty and students.\n“The committee has held […] panel discussions over the past two years to enable the community to hear diverse viewpoints on responsible investing,” says Pound-Curtis.\nDivestment remains a highly contentious topic that has created many heated exchanges, so Excalibur sought to establish what York students really think.\nAs far as I am concerned, [this] investment isn’t ethical. This is an institution that spreads inclusivity and acceptance, but at the same time makes money from wars around the world. It doesn’t seem right. For myself, divestment would make me feel better about the institution I attend. Reinvestment into more sound ethical industries feels a lot better. This campaign is the definition of a student movement. We cannot allow our beloved institution to make money off weapons manufacturing.\nI’m personally against York investing in weapons manufacturers. Universities should focus all their resources on education, especially at a diverse university like York where weapons investment is an issue that hits close to home for many. Weapons investment causes a distraction, and some students may feel they are directly contributing to conflict.\nI only discovered that York was behind this quite recently. I can see why York’s involvement with this investment would be kept on the down-low. If you look at power, it is often sustained and cultivated by ignorance. They should look at the needs of students and lower fees, for the greater good and for people wanting an education who are unable to afford it. I can, however, appreciate if the investment was done with the good intention of establishing scholarships and bursaries; I don’t see much wrong with that.\nYork is an enormous institution that can invest in other companies that are economically large enough to fund our scholarships. By investing money in companies that create such deadly weapons that lead to destruction, death and horror for the entire world to fear, York is being included in this problem. Instead of using money to help these companies grow, York should really think about lowering our fees so that scholarships wouldn’t need to be funded by these companies.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2017/02/10/york-drops-opinions-divestment/'],0.3567355275154114,0.47281646728515625,0.15816275775432587

Maybe say that World Vision is an agency – orient people with it?\n\n York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nMatt Render | Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Jordan Chu,\xa0Photo/Video Editor\nI hear a lot of apologizing today. A lot of people are made to feel ashamed of themselves and their identities. A lot of people who are being silenced based not on what they say, but who they are. I’ve seen people who accept the role assigned to them as some sort of enemy based on what they look like or what they believe in. People who apologize for their own existence. I’m not one of those people. I do not apologize for being white. I do not apologize for having red hair, either. And I surely won’t apologize for being Jewish. I’d like to emphasize that last point. I will neither apologize for being Jewish, nor will I remain silent while the cloud of anti-Semitism looms darker by the day.\nInstead of listing off the daily news events in the Jewish world, from the ongoing anti-Semitic attacks that have gone rampant in France, England, and throughout North America, I will single out two Canadian events. They speak to a larger issue that is at hand. These are not isolated incidents. They are indicative of the current political climate in Canada, and surely in other parts of the world as well. These are not the exception, but rather, the new normal.\nInstead of generating intellectual discourse, university campuses have become a breeding ground for hatred and thought control. At McGill University, it has been outlawed by the school newspaper to publish any pro-Zionist content whatsoever. This has been passed and enforced under the guise that any pro-Zionist speech is “hate speech.”\nForget the fact that I’m writing this as a Jew. This is a university we’re talking about here. A university that has effectively silenced an entire group of people. I don’t care who you are or what you stand for, that is anti-democratic. How that could ever pass is beyond my imagination, but I will venture to explain it this way: hating Israel (and Jews by default) is not just trendy, it is now politically correct.\nIf you are confused as to why Jews were included in that equation, you shouldn’t be. It’s simple math, really. If people hate Israel, believing it to be an evil, apartheid state, without the right to exist, and Israel is the homeland for Jewish people, is it a big intellectual leap to say those same people who hate Israel probably hate the Jews? That, coupled with the statistically most violent last couple of years in the history North American Jewry and the rise of anti-Zionist activist groups may help to elucidate the point a little clearer. If Israel is the enemy, then so are the Jews.\nLet’s be clear: the point isn’t to say anyone can’t disagree with Israel (or Judaism for that matter). Go right ahead and disagree. But, don’t forcefully break up a lecture being given by a veteran of the Israeli army while hurling anti-Semitic slogans and death threats under the guise of “social justice.” Here, I am referring to the incident on York’s campus where a pro-Israel group had their event shut down by a protest from Students Against Israeli Apartheid which quickly resulted in violence, anti-Semitic slogans, and death threats.\nIf this is what’s going on in our universities today, and if students are being bullied, belittled and denied their own voice, then the future is looking pretty bleak. Censorship and physical violence have no place in any democratic institution.\nThis has nothing to do with me being Jewish. This has nothing to do with me being pro-Israel. This is about hatred. No group deserves to be bullied into silence. No group deserves violence against them.\nI don’t care what group you belong to or what you think you stand for. I stand for what’s right. I stand for the truth. If that makes me the enemy, then so be it. I will not apologize for that.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/opinion/op-ed/2020/01/29/sorry-not-sorry/'],0.3097972273826599,0.856918215751648,0.3232753574848175
415,York,2023-03-23,journal_data/txt/York/2023_03_23.txt,"[' York University Community Newspaper \nAs a Jewish student at York, I was both frustrated and upset to come across a recent post on the York University Fessions Instagram (@yu.fessions) account. This post, which boasted hundreds of likes and included three different confessions, is not only deeply antisemitic and offensive, but it could not be further away from the truth.\nThe first confession stated that the York Federation of Students (YFS) was right to not let Israeli students participate in CultureFest because Israel has no culture and “is a country built on the genocide of Palestinian families”. This statement is both factually incorrect and deeply offensive. Israel is a legitimate, democratic country that was founded in 1948 on the back of a rich 3000-year-long connection to the land of Israel, dating back to biblical times. This connection is not only religious and cultural, but also historical.\nClaims that Israel “has no culture” are simply false. Israel’s culture is deeply rooted in the Jewish religion and its diverse population has contributed to its dynamic, creative, and diverse culture with contributions in areas such as art, literature, music and cuisine.\nThe claim that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people is an ugly distortion of reality. Genocide is defined as the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation. The reality is millions of Arab citizens live peacefully and freely in Israel, with equal rights and opportunities under the law. Arab citizens hold positions of power in government, business, and academia and they are represented in the Israeli parliament and judicial system. Israeli hospitals treat Palestinian patients alongside Israeli patients, Israeli universities admit Palestinian students alongside Israeli students, and all citizens enjoy full opportunity to participate in Israel’s vibrant economy.\xa0\nThe conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is complex and reducing it to a simplistic narrative of genocide is not only inaccurate but also dangerous. It is important to recognize that Israel is not committing and has never committed genocide. Both sides have suffered in this conflict. This February alone, 13 Jews, as young as six years-old were murdered by Palestinian terrorists solely for the fact that they are Jewish. Most people on both sides desire a peaceful resolution that recognizes the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians, and to end the non-stop suffering from terrorism that Israeli people have endured — Jewish and non-Jewish, alike.\nComparing Israel to Nazi Germany, as the second confession post does, is not only absurd, but also deeply offensive to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Such comparisons trivialize the atrocities committed by the Nazis and demonstrate a profound ignorance of history.\nThe third confession is the face of today’s antisemitism. It is a cheap coverup of the same old, vile forms of antisemitism Jews have suffered from for thousands of years. While you could technically be pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel without physically hurting Jews, the notion that taking an anti-Israel position is not only detrimental to Jewish people, but is also utterly foolish from all viewpoints. It is important to note that there is a line between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. Denying the legitimacy of millions of Jews living in their ancestral homeland and denying their right to self-determination is antisemitic. This is not a matter of political opinion, but a basic human right that is afforded to all people, even to those without a rich history and ties to a land like the Jewish nation.\nWhat is particularly concerning about these confessions is not just that they are offensive and frightening to Jewish students, but also that they contribute to the spread of antisemitism in our society. Antisemitism is a type of hatred that not only harms Jewish people but one that perpetuates fundamental flaws in society and negatively affects everyone.\nWe have seen time and time again throughout history the horrific consequences of allowing antisemitism to take hold.\xa0\nIt is crucial that we, the York student community, come together to fight against antisemitism in all its forms. This means standing up against hate speech and discrimination, and fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect for all students, regardless of their background or beliefs. For future events held by the YFS, we must demand from the federation to be truly inclusive and allow for the fair representation of all students, including those of Israeli descent. We must all work together to create a campus community that is inclusive, respectful, and free from hate speech and discrimination.\n \nInterested in becoming a contributor?
