Reservoir flood destroys years of work
McGill’s urban gardening initiative Campus Crops is forced to go back to the drawing board after the McTavish reservoir flood on January 28. The group had been working on the garden located behind the McGill School of Environment  (MSE) since 2007. A container garden managed by the group is located in the courtyard behind the James building.
The flood badly damaged the James Administration, Wong, and Birks building. The administration reported on Wednesday that the Wong Buildings and the basement of Birks are still closed due to damage, leading to class re-allocations.
As a result of water from the reservoir flooding the group’s main garden behind the MSE, considerable damage has been incurred. 
According to the group’s website, the water flow carried bricks from a path connecting campus to University. The bricks were swept in to the garden along with rocks and other materials.
Campus Crops said that it had success with their garden this past year and that they had been working to improve their soil.
“The area had poor quality soil, lots of clay,” explained Carl Dion Laplante, a member of Campus Crops. “Over the years we have been improving the soil; we add compost twice a year, for example. When we closed in November, we added a lot of mulch. We have supplied the soil with a lot of organic matter.”
The damage from the flood, however, destroyed much of these efforts, washing away the group’s work put in to nourishing the topsoil.
“A lot of time and money was lost in one night,” Laplante explained.
The prospects of Campus Crops opening the garden for summer 2013 are uncertain. In the past, the  group normally start working on their garden in the spring. 
“Normally we have another garden behind the James building, but we were told there is going to be construction on Dr. Penfield this summer and the dust and cement from the construction complicates things. We are not left with very much growing space. ”
The group had been working on removing a patch of Japanese knotweed – an invasive species – which has been growing adjacent to their plot for many years. 
The flood washed away a tarp covering the patch of knotweed, and Laplante fears that the invasive plant may now spread to the garden, according to the group’s website.
The group is still in the process of organizing discussions on how to move forward.
“We need to discuss what we can do this summer. We usually have time to develop the soil but because of the flood, our long-term amendments can’t be put through,” said Laplante. “We might have to take the summer to restore the soil. We might try a temporary container garden, but there are bureaucratic obstacles to this that delay the process. Ultimately we still need to discuss with horticulturalists, McGill ground services, and the MSE director to see what our options are.”

Operating procedures ambiguous, give University too much discretionary power
Story updated February 8, 2013.
The University’s latest demonstration guidelines do not adequately protect rights of association and assembly, and reflect no substantial changes from the protest protocol that was withdrawn two weeks ago, representatives from prominent national and provincial civil rights groups said this week. 
Following the protocol’s hasty withdrawal amid mounting off-campus criticism, the administration released two new documents this Monday. The first, a statement of values, will be based on the protocol’s uncontroversial preamble. The second consists of “operating procedures” defining acceptable forms of protest. 
Like its predecessor, the operating procedures defines when a protest will be “deemed to be peaceful” according to the metrics of “intensity, intentionality, duration and location.”
According to Cara Zwibel, a director at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), who authored the CCLA’s statement last month denouncing the University’s demonstration protocol, “the same concerns remain.” 
“They recognized in the preamble language that some measure of inconvenience is expected, [but] the nuts and bolts of the protocol seem to suggest that really any interference with everyday activities […] might not be tolerated. That problem of not establishing a high enough threshold still exists with the new operating procedures,” Zwibel told The Daily.
For Philippe Robert de Massy, a spokesperson for Quebec’s Ligue des droits et libertés, a prominent provincial human rights group, the operating procedures are too ambiguous, and grant too much discretionary power to the administration to determine whether a protest is acceptable.
“The responsibility is put on protesters to conduct themselves in a manner which is respectful of non-participants, but at the same time somebody else gets to determine when the party is over, and according to very subjective criteria,” he told The Daily in French.
De Massy plans on bringing the University’s new guidelines to the Ligue in order for them to determine an official position on the matter, he told The Daily. De Massy noted that the Ligue was currently studying similar measures at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM). 
The administration will hold two consultations – one downtown, and one at Macdonald Campus – this month to solicit feedback on the documents. Although the statement of values will be brought before Senate and the Board of Governors (BoG) for final approval, the operating procedures will not be ratified by either body. 
Student groups and campus unions also say the new operating procedures are more of the same, and have expressed serious concern that the operating procedures will not go before Senate or the BoG before permanent adoption. 
This is “shockingly undemocratic,” said McGill’s teaching union (AGSEM) President Lilian Radovac, who added that, “AGSEM has not had faith in the administration’s consultation process. And given the divorce between that process, and the ultimate means of implementation, it seems we have reason to have even less faith.” 
“I wasn’t aware that this was a dictatorship,” McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) President Kevin Whittaker told The Daily in response to the administration’s decision not to bring the operating procedures to the University’s governing bodies. 
MUNACA, which represents the 1,700 non-academic workers at McGill, has a representative on the BoG. 
The University’s graduate students’ society (PGSS) executive noted some positive changes reflected in the operating procedures following consultations with administration, but believes the document “still [puts] too much power in the hands of McGill security personnel, with little oversight or accountability, and a vague sense of how they should make decisions,” according to their External Affairs Officer, Errol Salamon. “Who will measure the ‘intensity’ and ‘duration’ of actions, and how will they measure these criteria? Can these criteria even be measured?’”
The provisional protocol regulating campus protests, released in February 2011 following a five-day occupation in the James Administration building, will remain in effect until the adoption of both documents.

Pro-hike supporters file motion at Quebec superior court
Two students from Quebec City’s Laval University went to Quebec’s superior court on January 23 to file a constitutional challenge against the Act respecting the accreditation and financing of students’ associations. The Act outlines the rights and duties of student associations in the province.
The plaintiffs are Laurent Proulx who was a leading member of the pro-tuition green square movement during the student strikes, and Miguael Bergeron. They intend to end what they call the “monopoly on representation” of student societies. 
Proulx and Bergeron’s complaint was filed against various aspects of the Act, stating that it violates the freedom of association and freedom of expression guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Act indicates that every student in Quebec is automatically a member of the student association of the institution they attend, unless they take the necessary measures to opt out.
Their motion argues that “it is no more justifiable for the State to force students to join any given association than it would be in forcing hospital patients to join a patients’ association.”
In Quebec, only one student association is allowed per faculty and per department. The plaintiffs want students to have other options if they feel their university’s student association does not represent their political views. The plaintiffs’ motion cites examples from the student strikes of last year.
“These associations directly imposed a particular mode of conduct on their members by, for example, blocking access to classrooms. They also indirectly imposed a mode of conduct on their members by using their dues for political purposes,” their motion reads.
SSMU executives were unaware of whether there was a way to opt out of the society. According to SSMU President Josh Redel, no one has recently tried to opt out of SSMU. 
Redel was unsure of the effects that the lawsuit would have at McGill. 
For him, a scenario in which students were able to completely opt out of SSMU would be “very unfortunate,” since it would significantly weaken the Society. 
According to Redel, were two or more student associations to exist at McGill, the funds for each one would not be sufficient to provide for larger events.
“There is no point in having two services that duplicate each other,” he told The Daily.
While SSMU does not advertise a formal process of leaving the union, it does give students the option to opt out of some of their services.
A spokesperson of Confédération des associations d’étudiants et étudiantes de l’Université Laval (CADEUL), Laval University’s student union, explained how students could opt-out.
“[The students] just have to fill out a form with information about opting out before a certain date. […] After some period of time, they will get a full reimbursement of the fees,” the spokesperson told The Daily by phone. 
As reported by Radio-Canada on January 23, only a few dozen students used this process, escaping CADEUL’s $13 annual fee. Neither Proulx nor Bergeron have opted out of CADEUL. 
Alexandre Meterissian, co-founder of Fondation 1625, the foundation backing the plaintiffs, told The Daily in a phone interview that students should be allowed more choice.
“Many students don’t feel represented by their student associations and they have no time to participate in the assemblies. Different voices on campus could give them more choice. […] If students think they get their money’s worth for contributing [in an association like SSMU], they will.”
Foundation 1625 is also behind the class action lawsuit filed last August against 25 educational institutions for having suspended classes during the Winter 2012 semester.

Lack of motions leads to rescheduling
SSMU has decided to reschedule the winter 2013 General Assembly (GA) to February 27, due to a lack of student-submitted motions.
With only two motions submitted, SSMU President Josh Redel expressed his concern regarding the efficiency of the GA. “A lot of logistics [go] into a GA,” Redel told The Daily. “From the student perspective, would it be fair to ask students…to come in and sit for just two motions?”
SSMU Equity Commissioners Justin Koh and Shaina Agbayani submitted one of the two motions, addressing the importance of the community’s support for the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office. “We decided to draft the motion in support for SEDE because we wanted SSMU to officially recognize the importance of the work that SEDE does in social justice, diversity and equity issues on campus,” Koh told The Daily by email.
Despite McGill’s previously released documents on the Principal’s Taskforce on Diversity, Excellence and Community Engagement, SEDE still requires a permanent funding structure and support from the university community, Koh said. 
When asked about the effect of the GA’s scheduling delay on his motion, Koh said, “We don’t think the delay will have a big impact on the motion, this support needs to be affirmed for SEDE regardless, we might change some of the wording for the motion depending on the situation.”
The other motion submitted to the GA, which called for support of the Idle No More movement, had previously been submitted at SSMU Legislative Council. It was committed to the GA to be put to vote by the larger student body, as it was deemed to be an external issue. 
This year’s GAs have experienced difficulties in generating student attendance: the fall semester’s GA briefly met its quorum of 100 students – with a maximum of half from any faculty or school – before transitioning into a consultative forum as people left. In the case of a consultative forum, motions are sent to a Legislative Council meeting, where councillors take into account the votes of the students.
When asked if students were losing interest in the GA format, Redel was unsure, but agreed that more discussion needed to be held on the actual content of a GA rather than simply the logistics.
Last semester, SSMU offered motion writing workshops in the weeks leading up to the GA. They also offered two workshops specific to the fall GA on the day of the assembly. 
Redel said the turnout last semester was “okay,” with about thirty people in attendance at the workshops on the day of the GA. He said that SSMU hoped to continue offering these workshops once a week before the upcoming winter GA.
In the past, Redel said, students have submitted half of the motions, while councillors have submitted the other half. “I think there’s a lot of mystery around the GA because people think it has to be political,” Redel said. “I think that we want to better inform students not just about coming to the GA…[but also] helping them figure out how to make different kinds of motions so that we have a good balance of internal and external.”

McGill principal calls summit on higher education a “farce”
Less than a month before the government’s summit on higher education, Pierre Duchesne, the minister of higher education, reiterated yesterday the Parti Québécois’ opposition to free education. The government would not bar students from broaching the topic at the summit, but it was “obvious” that the government “could not afford free education,” he said.
“If they want to discuss different subjects, such as free education, they can submit documents and studies,” Duchesne told reporters in French. “We even have an internet page where people can submit documents.”
The remarks from the minister came days after the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) issued an ultimatum that called for Duchesne to recognize free education as a “viable option.”
At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Jérémie Bédard-Wien, a spokesperson for ASSÉ, said that the group was not satisfied with the minister’s announcement and reiterated that the association would withdraw from the summit if free education was not seriously considered as an option.
“If we demonstrate the viability of free education and its social necessity, will the government hear our proposal?” he said in French. “By excluding ASSÉ, they would exclude a position that is defended by a large portion of those attending the summit.”
“More than half of those attending defend a tuition freeze, a reduction of fees, or free education,” he added.
However, in an interview with The Daily, Éliane Laberge, president of the Federation étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ) said it was important for the summit’s actors to “understand that no process is perfect” and that it was up to them to ensure that the conference was as “conclusive and as productive as possible.”
“We have to be there, because if we’re not there, students won’t be heard and their condition won’t be bettered,” Laberge said in French. “It’s true the government could be more attentive by considering, maybe not free education, but a tuition freeze, which is a position put forward by a number of actors at the summit.”
“We’ll wait before the morning of the summit before deciding whether or not the process is viable,” she added.
Skepticism toward the summit was also expressed this week by members of the Conférence des recteurs et des principaux des universités du Québec (CREPUQ), an organization that represents the administrations of universities across the province.
McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum told Le Devoir on Wednesday that the conference was a “farce” and was “so choreographed” as to preclude debate.
“There is one person from the Quebec Council of Employers, but they don’t have a formal voice. And the rectors have to sit and listen to someone telling us how to manage our universities,” she said in French.
“At Sherbrooke University, a teacher from Senegal compared our educational system to the Senegalese system from twenty years ago. What do we think of that?” she added.
According to Munroe-Blum, universities such as McGill and the Université de Montréal should receive more money from the government because of their commitment to research. Tuition should also vary depending on the program of study, she said.
