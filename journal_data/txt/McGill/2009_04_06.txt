Kimmie Weeks wanted to help fix “the poverty that kills”
A compassionate audience listened attentively as child rights activist Kimmie Weeks recounted his traumatic civil war survival that inspired him to found Youth Action International (YAI), an organization that focuses on providing aid for children in the war-torn West African nations of Liberia, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Weeks was nine years old when the Liberian civil war erupted, and it was after this experience that he vowed to dedicate his life to helping innocent victims of war.
“I didn’t know how or when [I would be able to], but I knew that I wanted to make change,” Weeks told The Daily after his address.
In 1989, when the war began, young Weeks and his mother were forced out of their home in the capital, Monrovia, by invading rebels. They spent the next six months at a refugee camp, where Weeks first confronted real misery – what he describes as “the poverty that kills.”
At the camp, food was scarce and the refugees ate roots and boiled dirty water to survive. Weeks contracted cholera, and later was almost buried alive. Weeks stressed, however, that he was more affected by the suffering of other children than his own.
“[The children] had nothing to do with the war, but they [were dying] because of it,” Weeks explained to the audience of 75 in the Adams Auditorium.
Weeks then explained that he found Monrovia in ruins when he returned from the refugee camp, and organized a neighbourhood clean-up.
The clean-up was the first step toward Weeks’ decision to begin the YAI. He said that from that point on, “there was no coming back.”
At 13, Weeks co-founded Voices of the Future, Liberia’s first child rights advocacy group. Four years later, he issued a report on the Liberian government’s role in training child soldiers and almost faced assassination. Weeks was then granted political asylum in the United States, where he attended Amherst College in Massachusetts, and founded YAI.
YAI has five branches in North America and is currently developing ten more. Each branch has its own specific goal. McGill University’s division – the first in Canada – focuses on the rehabilitation of ex-child soldiers and their reintroduction into society. Concordia is in the process of starting its own chapter.
YAI’s McGill chapter was excited to have Weeks come to speak.
“[Weeks’] story is one of great courage. [His story] invokes inspiration in many and is worth hearing by all,” said YAI VP Communications Matthew Cherian.
Through educational services, vocational training, micro-loans to start small businesses, and healthcare awareness programs, YAI helps victims of war achieve economic independence. Projects include helping Ugandan ex-child soldiers plant a field of rice and teaching young women in the slums of Sierra Leone how to run their own businesses.
Despite Weeks’ bleak portrayal of modern Africa – rife with the devastating effects of AIDS and burdened by inadequate healthcare – Weeks remains positive that poverty can be eliminated.
“I don’t think I’ll end [poverty] on my own,” he said, “but I hope to be the one to set the machine in motion.”

McGill’s final labour offer includes nine per cent raise over three years
After 16 months of tense negotiations between the McGill      administration and the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), the two parties reached a settlement on March 26.
MUNACA, which represents over 1,700 workers across the two McGill campuses, voted 667 to 127 in their General Assembly (GA) held last Thursday to accept the University’s final proposal – a roughly 83 per cent approval rate.
The final settlement, submitted to both parties on March 25 by the government-appointed conciliator Robert Dupuis, represented a compromise between the two parties.
“We’re pleased that the negotiations have come to an end,” said Lynne Gervais, Associate Vice-Principal of Human Resources. “The workers of MUNACA are a vital part of the University community.”
MUNACA, however, was less enthusiastic.
“It [was] an arduous fight. I would have liked more for our members, but unfortunately there were a lot of other factors in play,” said MUNACA president Maria Ruocco.
Since the GA vote approving the proposal, Ruocco has also said several times, “It is without enthusiasm that we accept this offer.”
As it stands, the collective bargaining agreement will provide MUNACA members with a nine per cent pay increase over three years, and will honour the promise of night and weekend premiums, among other things. This contract will be valid until November 30, 2010.
Professor Anthony Masi, Provost of the University, saw the MUNACA agreement as a significant step toward McGill’s efforts to cut $12- to $15-million from its budget while minimizing the impact on staff.
“We will do everything in our power to prevent layoffs, and all the suggestions we have received [from the town halls] will help. But it is possible that as positions become available, replacement will be on a case-by-case basis. Where possible, we will also have to cut back on casual and temporary employment,” Masi wrote in an email to The Daily.
 Masi maintained that administrative management of hiring in the economic downturn will have little to no impact on students.
“Now is the time to reassess the things we do and how we do them with the objective of providing long-term savings without sacrificing quality of McGill’s educational offerings, extra-curricular activities, and research programs,” he wrote.
According to Robert Comeau, the University’s negotiations spokesperson, because MUNACA has already missed two of the pay-upgrade deadlines, the changes will be applied retroactively using December 2007 and 2008 salary figures. The final adjustment will be made in June 2010.
These terms are a significant downgrade from what MUNACA originally asked for. In September 2008, MUNACA wanted a 13 per cent pay increase over four years and premiums for members who work nights and weekends.
At that time, the University rejected the proposal, and negotiations came to halt for several months in the fall after a second suggestion of a ten percent increase over three years was denied by the University.
The next counter-offer came in December  2008, when the University proposed an 8.5 per cent pay increase over three years – nearly the proposal offered on March 25, which MUNACA accepted.
With contracts settled for the next 15 months, Ruocco said MUNACA is looking to the future.
“With  elections coming up [for MUNACA], hopefully the members will vote in a team that is strong, a team with a plan for the future,” Ruocco said.

Using secret evidence and an assumption of guilt to detain non-citizens indefinitely under threat of deportation, security certificate legislation inflicts high consequences on detainees with extremely low standards of justice, members of the Coalition Justice for Adil Charkaoui said at a Refugee Research Project event Wednesday.
Throughout the talk, Montreal French teacher and PhD student Adil Charkaoui detailed his decade-long struggle with the federal government over broad allegations of posing a threat to “national security,” or fitting the profile of a “sleeper agent” – terms that remain undefined in his case.
Last month, however, the judge hearing his public trial removed many of the strict conditions imposed upon him after his release from prison in 2005, stating that no evidence before her suggested Charkaoui was or might be dangerous.
Charkaoui – who does not have access to the supposed evidence in his file, and who has never been charged with a crime – said now is a critical point in his ongoing fight to clear his name.
For a full recording of the talk, see the Daily/CKUT audio blog at mcgilldaily.com.

Students criticize organizers’ tactics
Not one to give up easily, the Association for McGill Undergraduate Student Employees (AMUSE) has regrouped, and is once again preparing to apply for union accreditation to represent all non-academic casual employees – or “casuals” – employed at McGill.
The union’s organizers have been soliciting support from casual employees on McGill’s campuses since September. They requested union accreditation in December, when they believed they had acquired the signatures of 35 per cent of casual employees.
“Non-academic casuals include everything from cow milkers on the Macdonald campus, to bookstore employees, to library shelvers, to office replacements,” said Max Silverman, former SSMU VP External Affairs and current AMUSE organiser.
McGill’s administration suggested that non-students should be included in the union as well, on the grounds that many student and non-student casuals do similar work on campus. AMUSE acceded, and temporarily withdrew their application.
“We’ve met many managers on campus who think this is a great idea. It’ll mean that the workplace is a lot more structured and that there are more rules in place,” said Silverman.
Since withdrawing their first application, AMUSE has received signed union cards from over 35 per cent of all student and non-student non-academic casuals – the minimum required to gain union accreditation from the Quebec Labour Relations Board. They anticipate that their application will be submitted within a couple of months.
“The goal is to extend the benefits and protections of unionization to every student who works on campus,” Silverman stated.
Casual workers would be granted certain job protections after creating a union, including written contracts, access to grievance procedures, salary increases, and benefits through a collective agreement mechanism.
The Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) is assisting AMUSE in its efforts by signing up invigilators and salaried graduate research assistants, along with graders and markers.
But not all workers believe that joining a union will benefit them.
“I love my job, I think I get paid well, and I can get days off when I need to,” said Alexis Zimberg, a McGill Bookstore employee. “It’s not a benefit to join a union when I’m graduating in December.”
AMUSE organizers have admitted that they don’t know what workers would demand from the union, but now that they have 35 per cent of required signatures, they expect to hold a referendum vote by ballot.
Zimberg was also critical of the methods union organizers used to sign up workers, explaining that she received numerous calls from them even when she asked to be taken off their list.
“I don’t have a problem with what they’re doing, I have a problem with how they’re doing it,” Zimberg said. “They come up to you when you’re alone, or in the library, or on a date  – it’s so intrusive.”
AMUSE will eventually include academic as well as non-academic casuals, but still has not filed for their unionization, partly because they were unsure of whether or not they had already received signatures from 35 per cent of them.

Government claims Galloway is a national threat
The government of Canada has banned the British Parliamentarian (MP) and anti-war activist George Galloway from entering Canada on the grounds that he poses a threat to national security.
The MP had been slated for a speaking tour, which included an appearance at Concordia on April 1.
However, Galloway was able to speak at Concordia’s Hall building  via videolink from New York. He began by sardonically thanking the Stephen Harper and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney for bringing more attention to his speeches in Canada than he would have received otherwise.
“Because of their efforts to stifle dissent, far more people have attended these lectures than they otherwise would have,” Galloway said.
Galloway also announced his intention to pursue legal action against Bernie Farber, the head of the Canadian Jewish Congress, as well as Canadian broadcaster CTV, for airing an interview with Farber in which he asserted that Galloway is a supporter of terrorism.
“There’s enough that I say for you to criticize me, but you cannot lie about me,” he said. “I am not a supporter of Hamas, but I am a supporter of the right of the Palestinian people to resist the occupation that has destroyed their country. That might make me controversial in Canada, but it does not make me a terrorist.”
Galloway recently visited Gaza in order to deliver medical supplies, as well as $45,000, to the Hamas-led government of Gaza. Alykhan Velshi, a spokesperson for Kenney, stated that Galloway has been banned for violating the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which stipulates that supporters of terrorist organizations may not be permitted into Canada.
Galloway contended that the attempt to criminalize those who support the Palestinian cause is at the heart of the anti-war struggle.He ended his speech by calling for a binational state in which both Israelis and Palestinians would be granted equal human and civil rights.
“There’s no place for white states or Jewish states or black states in the 21st century. There is only a place for democratic states in which every man and woman is treated as equal,” Galloway said.
Laith Marouf, a member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) who was involved in organizing Galloway’s visit, saw the Canadian government’s decision as a violation of free speech.
“This is part of a pattern that we’ve seen clearly for the past three months from the Conservative government,” Marouf said, pointing to the Canadian government’s criticism of Israeli Apartheid Week and its funding cuts to the Canadian Arab Federation. “This attack on Galloway’s freedom of speech is part of that. It’s an attempt to silence all those who criticize the Israeli government and the Canadian government’s policies in the Middle East.”
In response to the ban, SPHR filed an emergency injunction in federal court, claiming that the allegations that Galloway posed a threat to national security were entirely based on hearsay. Though SPHR’s concerns were recognized by the court, the presiding judge, Justice Luc Martineau, refused to overturn the Immigration Ministry’s decision.
“Because we were going to broadcast Mr. Galloway to the lecture halls, the judge found that there wasn’t enough harm done by the ban to overturn the government’s decision,” said Marouf.
Alykhan Velshi could not be reached for comment.

Kay Turner President
Turner jumped into 2008-2009 with many challenges ahead of her. She was forced to implement the outgoing Council’s decision to hand over Caférama’s lease to Café Supreme, a corporate chain, despite personal and vocal student support for a sustainable, student-run operation. Turner was also attentive to student input, even though it was admittedly the Gaza motion that finally spurred a large turnout at a General Assembly, not the organizational skills of the executives. Turner also has finally secured the SSMU nursery a spot, with construction expected to finish by the end of May.
Most importantly, however, was that when the VP Finance & Operations Tobias Silverstein resigned in October, the executive barely missed a beat, divvying up the tasks, running things fairly well, and writing a reasonable budget. Leadership is important in a crisis, and Turner kept SSMU running smoothly, even if some projects – particularly with large projects like retooling the inventory system at Haven Books, signing food service leases, and creating a functional and bilingual web site – took longer than we would have hoped.
Nadya Wilkinson VP University Affairs
If SSMU is supposed to check-and-balance the administration’s patronizing restraints on student life, Nadya Wilkinson certainly led the students’ defense. Brand new to SSMU this year, Wilkinson really stepped up to organize the Senate caucus, lobby the administration against the travel directive, and slash her way through the bureaucratic red tape. She organized some great research projects into campus food services, room booking reorganization, and at the same time worked closely to get the Office of Sustainability launched late this winter. After attending countless taskforce and Senate committees, we’re thrilled with the way Wilkinson has gracefully and professionally handled her portfolio, and we hope that she works closely with her successor to facilitate the continuation of all her hard work.
Devin Alfaro VP External
Devin Alfaro has had a tough year. He worked hard on Reclaim Your Campus, a campaign to preserve and recoup student rights. But after it fizzled out by early fall, he had trouble finding  even five people to attend its relaunch. He tried to lobby for international tuition to remain at a reasonable level at McGill amidst provincial deregulation, but new international management undergraduates will pay nearly $7,000 more yearly than last year’s students. However, SSMU’s external position is stronger than before. By aligning SSMU with other independent student unions, Alfaro has built up the “table de concertation” enough to start formalizing the unions’ relationship, a massive task. We doubt the student federation will succeed without a more concrete plan, but it still holds promise, considering the abominable state of other student federations in this province and country. Alfaro has also increased awareness among students of late night disturbances and other problems they create for residents in the Milton-Parc Community – the McGill Ghetto – a noble and often forgotten goal.
Samantha Cook VP Clubs and Services
While Samantha Cook was largely treading water on two of her most important stated goals – defending student groups’ rights to use the McGill name and fighting McGill’s opt-out fee system for certain groups – she has not lost much ground either, while accomplishing other significant goals. She deftly maintained a professional, unemotional position on Choose Life’s status as a club, and recently oversaw the return of club funding to nearly $50,000 after it was cut by more than half in the last year. Gerts has also been run reasonably well – a responsibility Cook assumed after VP Finance & Operations Tobias Silverstein resigned. Cook also convinced the administration to grant students two more rooms for their use in the Arts Building. Overall, no news is good news; we have neither noticed nor heard many complaints from clubs or services this year, especially compared to the past. We can therefore honestly say that we hope that next year’s VP C&S, Sarah Olle, who worked under Cook, continues in the same vein – even if we would prefer a bit more ambition.
Julia Webster VP Internal
Julia Webster was so much more than a party-planner this year. Thanks to her efforts, SSMU has a new web site that’s usable, although still lacking in many areas, especially the much-anticipated French version. Although Webster promised last Thursday it would be released the following day, it remains hidden, and what we uncovered online was described by a member of the Commission on Francophone Affairs as “deficient” in its translation. Still, many campus events like Frosh and Snow AP had a more sustainable outcome, and Webster strengthened relations with McGill Varsity Athletics and francophone students, in spite of the web site problems. She also brought back two editions of 4Floors – although the Valentines edition was confined to the Ballroom – and picked up a couple VP Finance portfolio duties. She wasn’t able to get her big year-end concert and party, something she’s attributed to funding limitations. Now Webster is training her replacement, Alex Brown, who will probably follow in the Websterian school of thought next year, running a tried-and-true repertoire of events, along with some diversification.

McGill expert Frederic Megret discusses the signifiicance of the UN-Cambodian tribunal
On March 30, Kaing Khev Iev, the first of six Khmer Rouge leaders, stood trial for mass murder and crimes against humanity in a landmark tribunal. Iev was the head of the Khmer Rouge’s notorious S21 prison, where over 15,000 men, women, and children were tortured before being executed in the nearby “killing fields.”
From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia under the leadership of Marxist leader Pol Pot. During this period, the brutal regime forced millions of city dwellers to work on communal farms. Their vision of social engineering resulted in the killing of an estimated 700,000 people – over a third of Cambodia’s population – by execution, starvation, and overwork.
The Daily sat down with Frederic Megret, assistant professor in the Faculty of Law, and director of the McGill Clinic for the Sierra Leone Special Court, to discuss the tribunals that many hope will bring a just closure to this dark period in Cambodia’s history.
McGill Daily: Why has it taken so long to begin prosecution of crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge?
Frederic Megret: Initially the Cambodian government was not interested [because] it was still too dangerous. When the Cambodians decided that they wanted to go ahead with the trials, they wanted international legitimacy by doing this with the help of the United Nations (UN). The negotiations [between the UN and Cambodian government] dragged on for seven or eight years because they could never come to an agreement on the ideal formula. The Cambodians, I suspect, wanted international legitimacy without paying the price, [and] keeping control over who got prosecuted. The UN was adamant that certain minimum human rights standards be respected, and the rule of law guaranteed.
MD: After 30 years of waiting, what kind of interest is there in the country for the trials? How will the trials benefit the people of Cambodia?
FM: I think if you asked people before the trials you would find that most people are not really interested. The interesting thing will be to ask the same people after the trials have taken place. This isn’t simply about averting the next genocide…but it is also about averting the lesser violations of human rights that still occur routinely by creating a sense that there will be no impunity for certain crimes.
MD: Who is being tried, and for what crimes? What punishment can we expect if these suspects are found guilty?
FM: In terms of the accused, there are six. The jurisdiction is for crimes against humanity, genocide, and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  As for punishment, it will be life sentences – no death penalty.
MD: The Canadian prosecutor Robert Petit has demanded that other key suspects be tried as well. However, his motion was blocked by his Cambodian colleagues. Many believe that the motion was blocked by the Cambodians to avoid possibly implicating other individuals currently affiliated with the government.
FM: I think that this is very much a moment of truth in that the Cambodians want to keep full control over who is going to be prosecuted. They want to make sure that it is mostly small fish. They don’t want this to become an indictment of the current regime.
MD: Won’t such a limited trial undermine justice?
FM: Of course, if people who have committed grave offenses are not indicted it undermines the faith people have in justice. These sorts of tribunals were never meant to try everyone. Probably it is still the case in Cambodia that too many people were involved at all levels.

Canadians push the government to lend money to the national broadcaster
CBC, Canada’s national television and radio network, will likely lay off 800 employees and implement major cuts to programs and services according to its 2009-2010 business plan, announced two weeks ago.
The cut-backs come in the wake of dramatic decreases in advertising income, which at one time accounted for one-third of the CBC’s revenue.
“We’re projecting a revenue shortfall of $171 million,” said Jeff Keay, CBC spokesperson. “The CBC has less flexibility, because we can’t go to capital markets for revenue.”
Keay said the programming reductions would be widespread, including cuts to news, children’s programs, radio programming, and music recording.
The cuts will be equally distributed throughout English-language CBC, French-language CBC, and Radio Canada, and will include cuts to CBC Montreal and other regional stations. CBC’s total workforce will be reduced by approximately ten to 12 per cent, and 393 employees are slated to be laid off from anglophone programming.
According to James Moore, Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Conservative government will not increase funding to the CBC to compensate for the drop in advertising revenues.
In an email to The Daily, Moore wrote that the Conservative Party has supported the CBC with a record $1.17 billion this year, and cannot scrounge up any more money for the network.
Last fall, the CBC approached the government and requested a “bridge financing” plan. The plan would provide the CBC with increased loans to survive the downturn, which would be paid back in later years.
The government subsequently turned down the CBC’s request, forcing the CBC to dip into their reserves to mitigate a $65 million shortfall last year.
Moore explained that the Conservatives worried the bridge loan would have burdened the CBC and tax-payers in the long-term, especially if advertising revenues remained sparse in the coming years.
In response to the government’s decision, the global action web movement avaaz.org’s 300,000 registered Canadian members initiated a petition urging the Conservatives to provide loans to the CBC.
“The government is the only source of [CBC’s] funding, and the government is denying it to them,” said Ricken Patel, co-founder and executive director of avaaz.org.
Patel said the petition was presented to the government last Friday, accompanied by several other displays of protest, including a plane over Ottawa flying a banner in support of the CBC.
Patel believes that the cut-backs within the CBC are part of a larger trend involving the consolidation of media by large private conglomerates, many of which are allied with Canadian political parties.
 “The decision to deny bridge funding was an ideological decision. The government has an ideological preference for privatizing the CBC,” said Patel.
Patel said that it is vital to preserve the CBC as an independent, impartial public media outlets, and a source of Canadian culture.
“The [purpose of CBC] is not to turn a profit, but to be a powerful source of Canadian culture, to provide an independent, non-corporate, Canadian perspective,” said Patel. “Big business has no incentive to promote Canadian culture.”

Student initiative may bring McGill up to speed
Students in conjunction with the Society for Equity and Diversity in Education Office (SEDE), have been navigating through administrative red tape since September in the hopes that in the coming years,  McGill will offer a First Peoples minor.
Pamela Fillion, U3 anthropology and a Daily staff writer, who is spearheading the effort, explained that by lobbying for a minor instead of a major, they avoided having to secure approval from the Quebec Minister of Education. Further, because the minor would be interdisciplinary and capitalize on existing resources in already-established departments, it would create little financial strain on McGill.
“Student interest is already there [for the minor] and a lot of professors are knowledgeable [about First Nations issues]. We really think this is something that could happen. There is a sentiment that this is doable,” Fillion said.
When Fillion circulated a survey sheet in three small classes focusing on First Nations, she gathered more than 50 signatures. She also participated in producing KANATA- McGill Undergraduate Journal on Indigenous Peoples of North America, McGill’s first-ever journal on First Nations issues. Fillion saw the journal as a telling barometer for interest in the potential minor program.
“The biannual KANATA journal proves there is enough material being produced at McGill by students who are interested in First Nations issues,” she said.
Catherine Duclos, U3 anthropology, who worked as the Publication and Finance editor for KANATA, looked forward to the possibility of a minor at McGill.
“There’s a high level of interest for International Development Studies and going abroad to volunteer and to help. [The First Nations minor] would acknowledge that our own country isn’t perfect,” Duclos said.
There is currently no aboriginal studies program on campus, though students have compensated for its absence by pursuing “ad-hoc” or independent Arts degrees focused on indigenous studies.
“I’ve taken several courses about First Nations and there are always five or six students [in the class] trying to create [a First Nations minor] for themselves,” Fillion said.
Presently, all aboriginal course content  can be found in the “First Nations and Inuit Education programs” in the Faculty of Education, at the “Centre for Indigenous Peoples’ Nutrition and Environment” at Macdonald Campus, or sporadically across course listings in the Faculties of Arts and Law. Currently no program akin to the programs across Canada exists at McGill.
Morton Mendleson, Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) and former chair of the working group, explained that any plans drafted by the group would rely on government funding, and would take a long time to go through the necessary bureaucracy.
Mendelson agreed on the importance of promoting aboriginal education.
“[Education] must play a central role in alleviating problems in aboriginal communities, so there is a social responsibility for institutions like McGill to contribute as best as it can.”
Mendelson, though, would not confirm his support for an aboriginal studies program at McGill, as “it is not up to the central administration, but a choice of the local level.”
After seven years of planning and coordination, Concordia University is also finally approaching its final administrative hurdles before its First Nations major can be implemented.
Daniel Salée, a political science professor at Concordia and central architect of the program, said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the program because the proposal will be “a first for Quebec.”
However, the province is still behind the times – over the past 40 years, First Peoples, aboriginal, indigenous, and native studies programs have become well established across Canada with the establishment of faculties, programs, and degrees aimed to analyze and address the dynamics between indigenous people and European settlers.
Salée blamed the proposal’s tardiness on the mindset of Quebec’s population as a whole.
“Aboriginal reality is abstract, far away in the north and outside of the mind of Quebeckers,” he said.
Aboriginal presence on campus is low at McGill. Lynn Fletcher of the First Peoples House estimated that the total number of aboriginal students at McGill amounts to less than 300, or one per cent of McGill’s student body, although exact numbers are always difficult to ascertain. The University also only employs two full-time aboriginal professors.

Students call for a better system to ship generic HIV/AIDS drugs
Two dozen “dead” students slowed traffic at campus’s Y-intersection on Wednesday to demand speedier delivery of medication to developing countries.
The die-in was spearheaded by the McGill Global AIDS Coalition (MGAC) and protested the inefficiency of Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR). The regime was passed in 2004 as an amendment to the Patent Act which allows drug manufacturers to synthesize cheaper versions of patented medications for export to countries that do not have access to them. However, CAMR has only exported AIDS drugs once since its establishment, sending drugs to Rwanda.
After about ten minutes on campus, the group of roughly 40 students marched to Phillip’s Square on Ste. Catherine, chanting “Children can’t wait, cut the red tape” and “Harper, stop acting like a fool, make CAMR a useful tool!”
The students repeated the demonstration across from The Bay, undeterred by the wind and rain. Volunteers circled the dead students and urged passersby to sign postcards to Parliament demanding CAMR reform.
“I think this was a great success,” said MGAC director Jamie Lundine, who distributed postcards for the duration of the protest. “We lasted a lot longer on campus than we expected and got more than 100 postcards signed.”
Joan Sherwin, a member of the Grandmothers to Grandmothers Campaign, which seeks to provide aid to Africa, joined the die-in in solidarity with MGAC.
“Canada needs to keep a full promise,” said Sherwin. “It’s time to pay our fair share of global aid.”
Apotex, a company that used CAMR to send HIV treatment to Rwanda in 2008, has committed to sending pediatric formulas of AIDS medication to Africa only if Canadian export restrictions are made less cumbersome and costly. Several MGAC volunteers wearing pill bottle costumes struggled against a stretch of red cloth to symbolize the red tape that has bogged down the delivery of AIDS medication to developing countries.
 MGAC has hosted a multitude of on-campus AIDS awareness events this year, including World AIDS Week in November and a Disparity Dinner in March. The die-in was MGAC’s final event of the school year, which coincided with a long-awaited development in Canada’s foreign aid.
Last Wednesday, federal Senator Yoine Goldstein tabled legislation to streamline the complicated processes resulting from CAMR. Lundine hoped that further improvements would be made to CAMR legislation in the coming year.

Kimmie Weeks wanted to help fix “the poverty that kills”
A compassionate audience listened attentively as child rights activist Kimmie Weeks recounted his traumatic civil war survival that inspired him to found Youth Action International (YAI), an organization that focuses on providing aid for children in the war-torn West African nations of Liberia, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Weeks was nine years old when the Liberian civil war erupted, and it was after this experience that he vowed to dedicate his life to helping innocent victims of war.
“I didn’t know how or when [I would be able to], but I knew that I wanted to make change,” Weeks told The Daily after his address.
In 1989, when the war began, young Weeks and his mother were forced out of their home in the capital, Monrovia, by invading rebels. They spent the next six months at a refugee camp, where Weeks first confronted real misery – what he describes as “the poverty that kills.”
At the camp, food was scarce and the refugees ate roots and boiled dirty water to survive. Weeks contracted cholera, and later was almost buried alive. Weeks stressed, however, that he was more affected by the suffering of other children than his own.
“[The children] had nothing to do with the war, but they [were dying] because of it,” Weeks explained to the audience of 75 in the Adams Auditorium.
Weeks then explained that he found Monrovia in ruins when he returned from the refugee camp, and organized a neighbourhood clean-up.
The clean-up was the first step toward Weeks’ decision to begin the YAI. He said that from that point on, “there was no coming back.”
At 13, Weeks co-founded Voices of the Future, Liberia’s first child rights advocacy group. Four years later, he issued a report on the Liberian government’s role in training child soldiers and almost faced assassination. Weeks was then granted political asylum in the United States, where he attended Amherst College in Massachusetts, and founded YAI.
YAI has five branches in North America and is currently developing ten more. Each branch has its own specific goal. McGill University’s division – the first in Canada – focuses on the rehabilitation of ex-child soldiers and their reintroduction into society. Concordia is in the process of starting its own chapter.
YAI’s McGill chapter was excited to have Weeks come to speak.
“[Weeks’] story is one of great courage. [His story] invokes inspiration in many and is worth hearing by all,” said YAI VP Communications Matthew Cherian.
Through educational services, vocational training, micro-loans to start small businesses, and healthcare awareness programs, YAI helps victims of war achieve economic independence. Projects include helping Ugandan ex-child soldiers plant a field of rice and teaching young women in the slums of Sierra Leone how to run their own businesses.
Despite Weeks’ bleak portrayal of modern Africa – rife with the devastating effects of AIDS and burdened by inadequate healthcare – Weeks remains positive that poverty can be eliminated.
“I don’t think I’ll end [poverty] on my own,” he said, “but I hope to be the one to set the machine in motion.”
