First General Assembly in “living memory” adopts motion opposing upcoming tuition increase
A motion for a one-day strike failed by four votes after being brought to the Architecture Students’ Association (ASA), McGill’s official representation of undergraduate Architecture students, yesterday evening.
ASA, part of the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) since 2011, voted on two motions in what was the association’s first General Assembly (GA) in “living memory,” according to VP Communications Meredith Toivanen.
The motion for Architecture students to strike on March 22, the provincial day of action against tuition hikes, was struck down in a secret ballot vote with 39 in favour of the strike, and 43 against. 7 students abstained.
A second motion regarding accessible education resolving for ASA to “specifically oppose” the incremental $1,625 tuition increase slated to begin in September, passed with a vast majority.
One of three movers of both motions, U3 Architecture student Julia Manaças, said she wasn’t surprised the strike motion failed.
“On the one hand, I’m happy that it was tight, because it shows that there was a real debate, and that people came out and voted,” she said.
However, Manaças noted her disappointment. “It would have been really great to show that people in Architecture, and in McGill especially, do care about this,” she said.
Manaças added that the close vote “says something in itself.”
ASA’s constitution states that quorum for the GA is 30 per cent of the Architecture undergraduate student body, amounting to 48 students for last night based on Toivanen’s count. The GA maintained quorum throughout the nearly 2.5-hour meeting.
“I was really surprised at the turnout,” she said. “The people who are against the strike are very not vocal, I find, so they kind of surprise you.”

SWSA the first McGill student association to join the unlimited general strike
The McGill Social Work Student Association (SWSA) voted to go on unlimited general strike yesterday in opposition to upcoming tuition increases ordered by the Quebec government.
The SWSA, which represents the 242 undergraduates in McGill’s School of Social Work, is the first McGill student association to join the unlimited general strike, which currently has over 180,000 students participating across the province.
In a press release sent to The Daily last night, SWSA VP External Echo Parent-Racine explained that social work is a profession “established to improve the situation of marginalized people and to critically examine societal structures which oppress.”
“As a faculty that values social equity and the promotion of social justice and advocacy, it is appropriate that the undergraduate Social Work students voted in favor for an unlimited strike, in order to promote the belief that education is a right and not a privilege,” continued Parent-Racine in the press release.
The vote was conducted as part of SWSA’s first-ever General Assembly (GA). 94 students attended the GA, with the final vote tallying 47 in favour and 29 against joining, with one abstention. Quorum for the GA was 24 students.
The GA was held in the Wendy Patrick Room in Wilson Hall, which has a capacity of between seventy and eighty students. Parent-Racine explained that they had to find an overflow room for some portions of the GA.
The GA passed two amendments to the strike motion. The first required SWSA to hold the next GA to renew the strike mandate in one week, as opposed to two. The second moved the start date of the strike from March 21 to March 19.
Parent-Racine described the ninety-minute debate on the motion as “passionate” in an interview with The Daily after the GA.
“Students were really engaged,” she said. “There was a lot of respect in the room. People were courteous to each other despite different opinions held, and it was reflected in the comportment of the students.”
Media was barred entry into the GA yesterday afternoon. Parent-Racine explained that it was to ensure students felt comfortable during debate, and also because of space constraints.
“We value making people feel comfortable, and, especially because it was our first GA, we didn’t want any outside influence to sway the students’ opinion one side or the other,” said Parent-Racine.

CKUT referendum to be non-opt-outable fails
Josh Redel, current president of the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), was elected SSMU President by 0.4 per cent of the vote last night. Redel edged out his only opposing candidate, current SSMU VP Finance and Operations Shyam Patel, by a slim margin of about 24 votes.
The referendum question seeking to make campus-community radio station CKUT non-opt-outable was voted down with 42 per cent of the vote.
Anniessa Antar, co-chair of the CKUT Yes Committee, told The Daily she was “disappointed” by the results of the question.
“I’m really interested to know how this word spread out that CKUT is no longer a viable thing. I am actually so confused as to why nothing was said when we made the information available,” said Antar.
CKUT says the volume of online opt-outs in recent years endangers its existence. Tim Beeler, who was elected as one of the undergraduate representatives to the CKUT Board of Directors (BoD), spoke to The Daily about the consequences of the result.
“My position now goes from worrying about what a radio station should be doing, like planning stuff for students and enriching campus environment, and it’s just once again going to be about trying to keep the station alive and breathing,” said Beeler.
“It’s gotten to a point where the reason we ran these two questions is because the station cannot cut anything else out of its budget; we cannot lose another staff member,” he added.
Current SSMU VP Clubs and Services Carol Fraser was elected as the second undergraduate representative to the CKUT BoD.
“I really didn’t see that coming, there was nothing in the press as far as I know that was in opposition, there was no ‘no’ committee and it came out of nowhere,” she said.
Current Senator for Religious Studies Haley Dinel was elected VP University Affairs with 33.8 per cent of the vote, beating out fellow student senators Matt Crawford and Emil Briones, who received 23.5 and 13.7 per cent of the vote, respectively.
“I think we are going to have a lot of challenges, and the big thing for me will be uniting student voices and giving back to the community,” said Dinel following the results.
The VP Clubs and Services (C&S) position went to Allison Cooper, who received 46.5 per cent of the vote compared to 24.3 per cent obtained by current C&S councillor Sahil Chaini.
Robin Reid-Fraser will be the SSMU VP External next year after receiving 37.8 per cent of the vote. Her opponent Raphael Uribe Arango, current VP External for the Inter-Residence Council, got 24.8 per cent.
Reid-Fraser said she was surprised by the number of people who chose “no opinion” in the vote for VP External – 37.4 per cent.
“I am going to do the best that I possibly can, and I will be looking for input from all kinds of people,” said Reid-Fraser.
Michael Spzejda won VP Internal with 18 per cent of votes – 24.1 per cent voted “no opinion” – and JP Briggs will be the VP Finance and Operations after obtaining 37 per cent of the vote.
Redel told The Daily he was “happy and proud of the support received” after the results were announced.
“I think that next year we have the opportunity to work with the campus that’s fallen apart a bit, and I’m really excited to work hard as hell to bring it back together,” said Redel.
“It’s a very diverse group of people – it will certainly be a challenge to get diverse opinions and backgrounds to work together, but we have a great team,” he added.
Patel said the narrow margin in the presidential election “shows that we’re both qualified, and either of us would do a great job, and I think Josh will be great.”
Maggie Knight, current SSMU President, also commented on the challenges for next year.
“Next year’s exec is a very different political composition from this year, so we’ll see how that shifts and how that changes things,” said Knight.
“Hopefully it’s all on people’s recent minds what a negative effect it has in the society when an exec becomes so divided that it is dysfunctional, so everyone will be committed to working together,” she added.

Principal states Board’s position on unlimited student strike
The University’s Board of Governors (BoG) held its fifth meeting of this academic year to discuss recent incidents, including the breach of confidentiality in the office of Development and Alumni Relations (DAR) by the anonymous group McGillLeaks.
Chair of the Board Stuart Cobbett started the open session of the meeting by congratulating the members at large for “[the] exceptional job in…dealing with situations of 10 November, the Jutras Report…[and] creating open sessions around the campus.”
Cobbett then addressed Principal Heather Munroe-Blum.
“Despite the unfortunate occupation of February…you and your team have handled [the situation] well,” he said.
On the meeting’s agenda was a discussion concerning documents leaked from DAR’s portfolio.
“Immediate and aggressive measures have been taken,” Munroe-Blum said, but added that the investigation is not complete.
“[McGillLeaks] raises profound questions about our security measures,” she said.
In response to McGillLeaks, Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) President Roland Nassim questioned the administration’s decision to forgo issuing a public statement to the University community.
“Some members of the University society are trying to create stories with McGill’s relationship with the corporate world,” Nassim said.
Munroe-Blum responded that the administration does not “respond to every story.”
“If there is an academic intent to discuss McGill’s [relationship] with the corporate world, we’ll be happy to do that,” she said.
BoG members also discussed the subject of student strikes. The meeting took place as the Arts Undergraduate Society held a General Assembly with a motion to enter an unlimited student strike.
Munroe-Blum stated, “Two student associations have voted to boycott classes…[and] there will be other votes. Our position is that…anyone has the right to fulfill their work responsibilities. McGill will continue, and the expectation is that everyone will fulfill their [academic] responsibilities.”
After the meeting adjourned, Cobbett spoke to The Daily about BoG’s awareness of the student strikes against tuition hikes.
“The Board is very well aware of what’s going on and the Board is updated regularly,” he said. “But frankly, most of the immediate responses to any of those issues…are responses that come from the Principal and her team.”
Macdonald Campus Students’ Society BoG representative – who is considered a student observer by the Board – Audrey Hasegawa said that MCSS “supports the strike; we support the one-day solidarity.” As a student observer, Hasegawa has speaking rights as BoG but cannot vote.
“We have voted for a solidarity strike on Thursday. This is the first time that [a Macdonald campus GA] has reached quorum,” she continued.
“We feel that we don’t have as much communication with the downtown administration. There needs to be implemented…supplementary support for the Macdonald Campus,” she added.
The agenda concluded with a report presented by Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi on developments in research and undergraduate programs.
The Board will hold its next meeting on April 24.

Student media to cease publishing on contents of McGillLeaks documents
The Daily Publications Society (DPS) – publisher of The Daily and Le Délit – has issued a press release condemning McGill lawyers’ threat of legal action against one of its publications, The Daily, for publishing an online article on the leak of hundreds of confidential documents from McGill Development and Alumni Relations.
On its now-defunct website, McGillLeaks stated that it would release further documents in later weeks.
After publishing an article on March 5, “McGillLeaks publishes confidential internal documents,” on mcgilldaily.com, The Daily received a letter from McGill’s lawyers, McCarthy Tétrault LLP, that evening.
The letter stated that “the documents and information disclosed or about to be disclosed by McGillLeaks are owned by McGill and are protected by intellectual property rights owned by McGill, and their disclosure is in violation of McGill’s rights.” The letter further demanded “that you take immediate necessary measures to remove any link on the mcgilldaily.com website… We also require that you immediately delete any reference to these documents and information and also delete any comment made on them.”
“Please be advised that McGill University is determined to use any available legal recourse to protect its rights and the rights of the third parties and of the individuals affected by this legal disclosure,” the letter continued. “We expect that you will confirm, within the next three hours, that you have governed yourself in accordance with this letter.”
After consulting with its legal representative, The Daily agreed to remove only the hyperlink to  McGillLeaks’ website within the time frame requested.
The DPS explains in its press release that, due to limited funding – as well as the fact that most of its funding is provided by students – “DPS publications will, for the time being, refrain from publishing any hyperlinks leading to the documents and from publishing anything on the actual content of the documents,” in order to avoid legal proceedings with McGill.
“DPS publications may, however, continue to report, comment, or editorialize on the relevant fact as to the existence of McGillLeaks and McGill’s position on and investigations of it,” the press release continues.
The press release adds, “Our decision does not entail, however, that we agree to the soundness of these legal threats, nor that we agree with McGill University’s oppressive tactics. It is lamentable that small independent organizations such as The McGill Daily and Le Délit cannot properly report on matters that directly pertain to their readership because of their limited financial and legal clout.”
“We find the actions and intimidation tactics of McGill University and its legal representatives to be suppressive of our and any organization’s rights to freedom of speech,” the press release concludes.
The online publications Canadian University Press and Milton Avenue Revolutionary Press received similar letters from McGill’s legal representatives after publishing hyperlinks to the McGillLeaks website. Both have removed the hyperlinks.
More recently, on March 13 Dawson College student and representative of the Dawson College Student Union (DSU) Michael Forian received a letter from McGill legal representatives demanding that he remove a post on his Twitter account that referenced content leaked by McGillLeaks.
The letter from McGill’s lawyers demands that Forian “immediately remove this tweet and refrain from releasing, posting and, in any other way, making reference to any confidential information that may have been illegally communicated to you relating to documents stolen from McGill University.”
In response to a tweet that Forian previously posted and has since removed on Twitter stating: “Is that a copy of confidential documents from McGillLeaks in my inbox?”, the letter states that “we hereby demand that you immediately destroy all of said confidential documents that you may have illegally received.”
Forian explained that at this time, he will refrain from publishing further links or tweets regarding the content of the McGillLeaks website, but does not plan on deleting his Twitter post unless further action is taken by McGill. Forian is currently receiving legal consultation from the DSU.
“I was just a little taken aback,” said Forian. “It’s intimidation, and it’s trying to get people to do things that they don’t necessarily have to do.”

Increased tension with administration one of the biggest challenges of the year 
For Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) President (and newly-elected SSMU President) Josh Redel, this year has been one of great success within the Engineering community, in spite of increasing tensions with the McGill administration.
Redel began the year with several new initiatives intended to create “a more solid internal structure” for EUS. The first of these initiatives was a weekend retreat held to train all 45 Engineering councillors on how to write motions and hold productive discussions. Redel said that EUS has also worked on instating measures designed to increase the transparency and accountability of the executive.
As a result of his efforts, Redel said there has been “so much more engagement in Council” than in previous years.
Redel’s other major focus has been on improving student space. EUS has begun renovation plans for the General Store and the Nook – a space right next to the store, inside the McConnell Engineering building – which Redel hopes will becomes “more of a social space.” EUS is also finalizing plans to turn the locker area in the basement of McConnell into a multi-purpose club space.
$2,000 of this year’s EUS Space Improvement Fund has been allocated to renovating space for Architecture students. Redel said improvements included small studio renovations like newly-waxed floors and new ceiling tiles. EUS is also contributing an additional $4,000 to renovate the Cellar, the space that used to be the Architecture Café.
“We’ve worked really hard this year to make sure that [Architecture students] feel at home in EUS,” Redel said.
That’s not to say Redel has not encountered substantial challenges over the year. Redel and EUS have been at odds with the administration on numerous occasions over issues such as the use of the McGill name in the EUS logo.
Redel expressed frustration over his dealings with McGill on this issue. He explained that he had personally committed to working on improving EUS branding and marketing during his term as EUS VP Communications last year and that McGill had not once brought this to his attention.
“We’ve just worked a year and a half on all this branding and then find out, ‘Oh, you know the logo – the core of your branding – you can’t use that anymore,’” Redel said.
According to Redel, EUS and the University had come to an “agreement” to this dispute, but stressed that the solution is still a work in progress.
Planning the Open Air Pub (OAP) has also been a contentious issue for Redel because of increasing difficulties in booking space to hold the event.
“McGill is…cracking down on how space is used [and] on insurance,” Redel said. “[McGill] has become more stringent, and they’re less easy to talk to.”
In addition, since the Quebec Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux made changes to its regulations, Redel explained that EUS has been having trouble obtaining the necessary liquor permits to hold OAP. While they have managed “to work around” the new regulations, Redel said that this had made the process “extremely shady.”
“McGill [administration] needs to help us more,” Redel added. “They need to play a stronger role… We don’t have assistants who can email or call them all day.”
