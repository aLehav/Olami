Hydro-Québec linked to aboriginal  displacement and environmental destruction
In September of last year, volunteers ran relay marathons of 42 miles each from Matagami in Quebec’s James Bay region to the Romaine River near the North Shore, stopping at the Montreal offices of Hydro-Québec along the way to deliver a message: environmentalists and local communities do not want their river dammed to generate hydroelectric power, or for any other purpose.
“All the rivers of Quebec are under siege by Hydro-Québec. These rivers need to flow for our future generations. They are true life-givers and we need not forget this,” read the message written by Roger Orr, a Cree resident of James Bay.
The marathon was organized by the conservation coalition Alliance Romaine to draw attention to pending plans for a large hydroelectric complex on the Romaine River in the lower North Shore area of Quebec, about 1,100 kilometres northeast of Montreal.
Green energy
Hydro-Québec is a giant in the power sector. The company is responsible for meeting most of the domestic electricity demand in Quebec as well as substantial amounts in Ontario, New England, New York, and the maritime provinces. As 97 per cent of Hydro-Québec’s electricity is hydro, its stature has only increased with the global focus on climate change. Hydroelectricity is often considered a safe, renewable alternative to petroleum, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power – and Hydro-Québec is working to promote this image.
When asked if Hydro-Québec saw itself as a “green” corporation, spokeswoman Marie-Élaine Deveault said, “We don’t self-identify as a green company. We are identified as a green company…. I think hydro is part of the solution [to climate change].”
Deveault’s assertion points to Hydro-Québec’s increased focus on energy export, especially to the United States, which is seeking alternatives to coal in the era of climate change. American greenhouse gas emissions, Deveault stated, have been offset by 37 million tons through Hydro-Québec’s provision of hydroelectricity between 2001 and 2007.
Innu resistance
When constructing massive dams and flooding areas the size of Delaware, as in the case of the Churchill Falls project, social and environmental losses can result.
In the sixties and seventies, the development of the Upper Churchill Falls by Nalcor and Hydro-Québec proceeded without any consultation of local Innu communities. The permanent alteration of the Churchill River and the creation of a reservoir meant the loss of Innu hunting, trapping, and burial grounds that had been used for centuries. The Innu protested in 2006, Nalcor began exploring the possibility of a Lower Churchill Falls project downstream from the original development.
After protest and negotiations, in September 2008 the Innu brokered the Tshash Petapen – “New Dawn” in Montagnais – agreement with the Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams to receive annual compensation for the Upper Churchill Development, as well as land claims and a possible stake in the Lower Churchill Falls project.
The agreement was considered a major victory by the leaders of the Innu Nation and a step forward for the aims of Nalcor. However, currently neither the compensation nor the power station itself has come to fruition, and some activist efforts persist.
Peter Penashue, deputy grand chief of the Innu Nation, said by text message, “Thirty years later we have a commitment for redress and hopefully the agreement will be a reality soon. It would have been so much better to deal with these issues at the beginning as opposed to 30 years later.”
Hydro-Québec consulted with and reached agreements with the communities surrounding the Romaine complex, including Minganie, Nutashkuan, Unamen Shipu, Pakua Shipi, and Ekuanitshit. These agreements include cultural and economic support as well as employment.
Alliance Romaine
While Alliance Romaine has associated with some representatives from the communities affected by the Romaine Complex, they approach the issue strictly from the perspective of environmentalism and conservation.
“We understand negotiations will take place and different groups will seek compensation, but as we see it large-scale hydro is not renewable,” said Fran Bristow, another member of Alliance Romaine.
Environmental consequences of large-scale hydroelectric development can include the release of methylmercury from soil due to flooding, which poisons fish and can contaminate the food chain, as well as alteration of downstream ecosystems and the possible reduction of biodiversity. Paradoxically, large hydroelectric projects can also become a source of greenhouse gas emissions. When areas of dense forest or other vegetation are flooded, CO2 and CH4 are released at a higher rate.
Hydro-Québec & climate politics
Hydro-Québec insists that hydroelectricity is a sustainable, “green” alternative. Many dams have been removed throughout the United States to bolster fish populations decimated by hydroelectricity projects, but Hydro-Québec advertises measures to maintain biodiversity and minimize the size of reservoirs in the Romaine Complex.
What is certain is that Hydro-Québec has adapted its image well to the onset of global anxiety about the climate, aggressively emphasizing its role as a large-scale provider of safe, renewable energy. While massive dams are a hard sell environmentally, hydroelectricity providers tend to argue that such developments are the best of all current options. “We think hydroelectricity is one of the best choices. We do large-scale environmental assessments…to ensure the ecological footprint is at a minimum,” said Deveault.
Bristow opposes this logic. “We’re not asking for something utopian. In our present situation we have a choice on that impact and it can be positive or negative, and dams are not positive. Energy conservation is positive. It should no longer be a question of the best of two evils.”

Audit of Shatner building finds room for improvement
On Friday, SSMU executives received the initial results of an audit that measured the Society’s energy consumption. The audit showed how most of SSMU’s energy is consumed through ventilation and heating of cold air. The areas that use the most energy are the Shatner ballroom because of its size, and Gerts Bar, which is open the latest.
BPR, the Quebec-based environmental engineering company that conducted the audit, recommended that SSMU install energy-efficient light fixtures and improve the building’s ventilation systems. The retrofit’s cost is estimated to be more than $410,000, but would be recovered in the long run through reduced electricity and maintenance costs.
“The idea is that you invest a lot of money in the beginning for all the renovations but then it pays itself off in five years through all the money that you save,” said Sarah Olle, VP (Clubs & Services).
The audit was a result of a fall 2009 General Assembly (GA) motion penned by Olle, which resolved that SSMU should “undertake large scale projects” to decrease energy usage in the Shatner building. SSMU’s constitution emphasizes the importance of reducing its environmental impact.
According to Olle, concerns about energy use are “something that students have brought up so many times: our number one environmental footprint is our building”.
SSMU’s focus on improving the sustainability of the Shatner building is also part of “the incredible and influential Five Year Sustainability Plan,” described by Ivan Neilson, SSMU president, at the GA last Wednesday.
The GA motion stated that SSMU’s energy use is “40 per cent higher than the average for Canadian university buildings,” which is 2.87 gigajoules per square metre.
However, the BPR audit found the statistic, which was provided by McGill Facilities, to be an overestimate. According to the audit, the Shatner building uses less energy than McGill had previously claimed. Nevertheless, SSMU is planning to start renovations in the summer of 2011.
The renovations should also be an important bargaining tool for SSMU’s lease renewal negotiations with the University next year. According to Olle, it is in SSMU’s financial interest to renovate their utilities. “[McGill] pays our utility bill…but our rent is based on our utility bill,” Olle said.
SSMU is planning to ask the new Sustainable Projects Fund (SPF) for funding for these renovations and infrastructural changes. SPF was approved in this year’s fall referendum and will make an estimated $840,000 available annually to campus initiatives that promote environmental sustainability.
“This is the perfect pilot project,” stressed Olle. “This is exactly what this study is for. I can’t think of a better way to use the Sustainable Projects Fund than giving back to students through improving their student centre.”
In addition, BPR suggested that Hydro-Québec could provide about $36,000 in subsidies if the building’s environmental conditions were improved.
 According to Olle, BPR was hired by McGill to conduct similar tests to the Redpath and McClennan libraries and the McGill Sports Centre, and suggested that SSMU do the same.
McGill sustainability director Dennis Fortune said that McGill is also “proposing to look at five buildings a year for straight energy retrofit.”
A recent audit of the Rutherford Physics Building by McGill Facilities found that replacing light fixtures and installing occupancy sensors could decrease electricity use from lighting by 39 per cent. Fortune remarked, however, that efficiency shouldn’t be the only focus. He commented that the overall energy use is itself an important side of the problem, and that turning off computers or using fewer refrigerators was also necessary to ensure sustainability.
Maggie Knight, SSMU sustainability coordinator, helped to compile a SSMU environment committee progress report, which was released last November.
Knight stressed the importance of an audit: “It’s to take a look at how we’re doing now and what the main issues are. There are a lot of barriers,” she said. “I mean, it’s definitely not a walk in the park, it’s gonna be a challenge, it’s gonna require some dedicated people to really see it through, but I think it can be done.”

Two years after arrests and protests, community still concerned with environmental impact
A  dispute between Frontenac Ventures Corporation (FVC), a business specializing in uranium exploration and development, and a non-status Ardoch Algonquin community over territory near Robertsville, Ontario has ended with the company acquiring full access to the land.
FVC began to stake out the territory in 2007, despite the fact that the Algonquin community had an ongoing land-claim involving the area. The dispute continued until 2008, and came to a head with a series of protests, jailings, and prosecutions.
Almost two years later, honorary Algonquin chief Harold Perry said the community has exhausted itself.
“[We have] reached a point where we’ve done all we can do,” Perry said.
At the height of local protests, the Ardoch community attempted to blockade a site near Sharbot Lake, Ontario, where FVC began testing for uranium deposits. The Shabot Obaadjiwan also lent their support to the blockade and eventually participated in their own mediations with the Ontario government.
But the legal dispute ultimately ended in favour of FVC. After failed government negotiations, Ardoch Algonquin co-chiefs Rob Lovelace and Paula Sherman were fined $15,000 and $25,000, respectively, for their participation in the protests and contempt of a court injunction granting FVC access to the land.  Both were sentenced to six months jail time, though Sherman eventually conceded to court injunctions and her sentence was withdrawn.
Although the nearby Shabot Obaadjiwan collaborated with the Ardoch Algonquin to oppose the uranium company’s takeover, Perry said he was disappointed with the lack of support from the First Nations community at large. “We’re the only ones who came out against the uranium.  They [other First Nations tribes] signed documents saying that we were the ones against it,” he said.
According to FVC president and CEO George White, his claim received adequate permission for uranium exploration in Ontario and has legal claim to the land. White added that FVC  creates 600 to 700 “primarily local jobs” in their exploration and development of low-grade uranium.
Canada is currently the world’s largest uranium exporter, and White pointed to its positive use in what he believes is the country’s nuclear future. “Canada and the U.S. trail far behind in nuclear power.  France gets over 70 per cent of its power from nuclear energy,” he said.
Perry has cited public health and pollution to nearby lakes and streams as his major concern for development of the lands into mining or mining exploration sites. However, Rob Ferguson, a represenatative of Ontario’s Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, and Forestry said the site of contention was not used for mining.
“There was no mining.  This was an exploration site, consisting of mainly mapping and geological samples…. If the company had found minable deposits, substantial requirements would have kicked in [for mining],” Ferguson said.
When asked if he thought the First Nations involved in the FVC protest were aware of governmental procedures, Ferguson answered, “That’s complicated.”
 Perry still laments the dispute that was eventually settled in favour of FVC exploration rights. “People don’t realize the impact that this holds on the future,” he said. “But at least we can say we tried.”

Three McGill professors weigh in on the future of  energy and the environment
Earth Day, retrospectively
Thomas Jundt is a visiting instructor in the McGill Department of History. Jundt presented his paper “Earth Day and the Creation of the Green Middle Class,” at the annual convention of the American Society for Environmental History in 2003.
The McGill Daily: You say that the environmental movement had its beginnings in the United States prior to the first Earth Day in 1970 and Rachel Carson’s Silent Springs,  published in 1962.  What led you to this conclusion?
Thomas Jundt: When I first set out to write my book, I was going to write about the first Earth Day – April 22, 1970, which really was a huge event. There were 20 million Americans [who] took to the street…. The environmental movement explained [this number] away one of two ways…but neither of those worked for me.
I started to think about what was going on in 1970. Had anything changed? There was anxiety about the [atomic] bomb, at that point, still. We all grew up in an era where there were fall-out shelter signs on public buildings. And so I decided to look at that, examine the bomb and [public] anxiety, and sure enough, what I found was that there was an apocalyptic sense that accompanied the bomb, understandably, from the beginning. That inspired narratives of other ways that we might be destroying the earth. People started writing in the late forties. There were books by Fairfield Osborn and William Vogt, who immediately began talking about environmental narratives of apocalypse.
MD: Throughout the fifties and sixties, how did changing circumstances lead Americans to reconsider the way that energy was produced, consider alternate sources of energy, and re-examine the way in which they were consuming energy?
TJ: In the early fifties, there were already some moves toward solar energy, and there were groups that were meeting to do this. But at the same time, there was atomic energy, and the government wanted to convince Americans who were very frightened in the atomic age that there were great benefits [to atomic energy] too…. [They] wanted to convince people that it would be a great, very cheap, very plentiful energy source, and [the U.S. government] put enormous funding into it. So at the same time that there were beginning movements for solar energy, it was greatly outdone by atomic energy [that had] both industrial backing and government funding.

Energy’s just the beginning
Robin Thomas Naylor is a professor in the McGill Department of Economics, who specializes in the black market, money laundering, environmental crime, and the financing of international terrorism. He has published 10 books.
The McGill Daily: What is your interest in climate change issues?
Robin Thomas Naylor:  My work on this and interest in this is a little more general. I got a feeling that too much energy is being co-opted by the climate change issue. There are all kinds of other things out there, and some of them are related. There is no question that there will be feedbacks between them, but all of the energy and all of the big debate is talking about the impact of more CO2 – while we have a huge problem with the spread of reactive nitrogen in the biosphere. We have problems – enormous problems – of soil exhaustion, water quality and quantity decline, biodiversity loss, slashing of rainforests, general chemical toxification of the biosphere, and on, and on, and on. But the problem is, it’s not that climate change isn’t important…but the problem is all the energy directed at just this. As a result, I think people are expecting some sort of a magic bullet to solve all of these problems.
It’s as if you took away carbon-based fuels the world would suddenly be a more wonderful place – well, it isn’t if you’re losing 30 billion tons of topsoil every year. It won’t be if the oceans are emptying out.
MD: So you think this focus on the production of energy within this discourse of carbon reduction is counterproductive?
RTN: Not counterproductive, except to the extent that everybody bandwagons and forgets the other issues. I think the carbon issue has to be looked at in the context of how human beings have screwed up the biosphere for 10,000 years. And in a sense, rather than it being a cause, the carbon increase in the atmosphere is a symptom of our collective stupidity.
So the basic issue is this high-energy, high-consumption economy – how long it can last without destroying the entire biosphere. And that’s going to be a problem no matter what energy source you choose.

Technologically-oriented
Christopher Green is a professor in the McGill Department of Economics. Last December, Green and PhD student Isabel Galiana co-authored an article entitled “Let the global technology race begin” in Nature. The article argues that the best way to respond to climate change is to adopt a technology-led climate policy, rather than to set emissions targets.
The McGill Daily: What do you mean when you refer to a “technology revolution”?
Christopher Green: Currently, 85 per cent of the world’s energy comes from fossil fuels. If you want to stabilize climate by the end of this century, you need to reduce that to a very small amount. [This means that we need] a revolution in [energy-producing] technologies that are no longer carbon-emitting. Now, except for nuclear, we don’t have any large-scale technologies to do that. Nuclear finally began to overcome the bad name it got, and they’re starting to rebuild. [As for] solar and wind [energy], we don’t know how to store it. Biomass: we haven’t gained anything, but we have driven up food prices.
Technologies are not developed overnight. There are basic breakthroughs that have yet to be made [on the levels of] testing, demonstrations, and scalability. There’s a lot of work going on. Who’s putting money into this? Corporations: Exxon [has put] $800 million into algae [fuel]. I’m not here to support Exxon, but they know that it’s a technological problem.
One of the technologies that must contribute is carbon capture and storage. We’ve got so many coal-fired plants that we’ve got to capture carbon and bury it. It’s been done, on a small scale, but a modestly-sized, 400 -megawatt coal-fired plant generates 2.8 million tons per year of CO2 – and because there’s an energy penalty, if you try to capture it, it may take as much as four million tons of CO2. And we have no experience of capturing and burying that amount, and of making sure it doesn’t come out.
MD: So a green technology revolution means building on the kind of green energy technologies that are nascent, but that we don’t have adequate capacity to make full use of?
CG: [You’ve got to be careful when using the term] green energy technology, because some people would say that nuclear [technology] isn’t green. So maybe the best word here is “low carbon-emitting” technologies. Carbon capture and storage, which doesn’t mean getting rid of a coal-fired plant, would certainly not be considered green by many people. But we probably need, over the life of these plants, to do something along that line, if possible. Otherwise there are just too many emissions. We need to work on [carbon capture], and we need to work on nuclear.

Company investigated for serious violations of safety standards
On February 7, the Kleen Energy power plant exploded in Middletown, Connecticut, killing five and injuring at least 12. The explosion was one of the worst industrial disasters in the U.S. in recent years.
Employees there had been working around the clock to complete the plant, which was slated to be the largest in New England and among the largest nationwide. The explosion was so powerful that it was felt 20 miles away.
Edward Badamo, chief of the Middletown fire department’s south district, was one of the first responders to reach the site of the explosion. “I wasn’t prepared for what I found when I showed up on scene,” he said, adding that he had spent 12 to 14 hours a day at the site since the explosion. “I leave my house, I go to the site, I come home from the site. I haven’t had any socialization off the site since the explosion.”
At the time of the explosion, plant operators had been performing a process known as “gas purging,” or the clearing of air from main gas lines. Purging is highly dangerous, and led to the explosion of a ConAgra plant in North Carolina in June 2009.
On February 4, three days before the Middletown explosion, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) released urgent recommendations to change the codes that govern gas purging after months of investigation at the North Carolina plant.
CSB public affairs director Daniel Horowitz said that the Middletown explosion was one of the “largest [the CSB had] ever dealt with.” Horowitz declined to comment on the details of the investigation, while maintaining that investigators would be at the site for at least weeks to come.
The site is also being investigated by a team from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. A central focus for investigators involves hearing from workers, some of whom have claimed that they had been under pressure to finish the project, working as many as 80 hours a week in the days before the explosion. Workers have also reported smelling gas as little as an hour before the explosion.
“We will look at all aspects of workplace safety,” said OSHA spokesman Ted Fitzgerald, while noting that he was not aware of any standards that regulate hours worked at the plant.
The Hartford Courant has reported that no safety officials were present during the purging of the gas lines at the plant, the construction of which had been contracted to O&G Industries, which is also a minority shareholder.
O&G’s director of human resources, Dan Carey, declined to comment on the safety proceedures surrounding the purging, saying, “It’s really inappropriate for us to respond to individual allegations.”
A review of OSHA’s records on O&G Industries revealed that the company paid a $6,300 fine in January 2008 for “serious” and “other than serious” workplace safety violations.
Since the explosion, Kleen Energy Systems has outsourced its media relations to a New York firm, which declined to comment.

Increased extraction of fossil fuels and minerals endangers the environment and international relations
After abandoning Arctic resource exploration in the eighties due to lack of profitability, the combination of rising oil and mineral prices and melting Arctic ice have reopened Canada’s North for extraction. The immense wealth of Arctic resources, believed to have enough undiscovered oil to fuel the world for three years, has attracted the interests of governments and private companies alike.
The five nations with Arctic borders – Canada, the U.S., Russia, Norway, and Denmark, via its control of Greenland, are in the process of proving the extent of their sovereignty over the Arctic and its resources by researching the reach of their continental shelf. Since each country has different international water rules, overlapping territorial claims have complicated the hunt for Arctic resources.
Amid this resource exploration and diplomatic sparring, the rapidly-warming Arctic and the volatile chemicals that are now beginning to be extracted from it are threatening local wildlife and the well-being of indigenous communities that rely on them.
The tip of the iceberg
The competition for Northern Canada’s natural resources and minerals has been well underway for the past two years. In 2008, the Harper government launched the five-year Geo-mapping for Energy and Minerals (GEM) program to gain a clearer understanding of the resources available in Canada’s North. The federal government has already poured $34 million into the program, which will come to a cost of $100 million when finished.
Oil and natural gas have been known to exist in the Arctic for decades, but exploration had been put to a halt until recently. The economic viability of exploring oil reserves in the Arctic has been resurrected due to concerns over depletion in conventional oil-producing regions.
“[The Arctic] is an expensive place to work,” said  James Ford, a professor in McGill’s geography department who researches climate change vulnerability in Canada’s North. “But it becomes more profitable. With the prices of oil and metal increasing, it becomes more economically viable to explore.”
According to Wayne Pollard, a professor in McGill’s geography department who runs McGill’s Arctic Research Station, the U.S. is also looking for solutions to this potential crisis.
“Americans are interested [in Canadian Arctic reserves]. Oil and gas reserves in northern Alaska are running out,” said Pollard. “They are looking to develop gas on the Canadian side [of the border]. Oil and gas are some of the key resources.”
While oil and natural gas may be the most abundant resources in the Arctic, mineral deposits uncovered by the GEM project have also attracted attention both domestically and internationally.
“There are gold prospects in the Northwest Territories, [which are especially profitable] with the world prices of gold so high,” said Pollard. “Some people want diamonds to be mined, but there’s a market control of the diamond industry,” he said.
Pollard cited De Beers, the international diamond mining company founded in 1888 by Cecil Rhodes and based in South Africa, as a company that could have significant interests in the volume of minerals excavated in Canada’s North.
“There’s a tremendous potential for more [mineral deposits], but De Beers doesn’t want to flood the market with diamonds,” said Pollard.
According to Tracy Sarazin, spokesperson for the government of Nunavut, the province is currently being explored for gold, silver, uranium, base metals, and diamonds, but also has an estimated 25 to 75 billion barrels of oil and 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas undiscovered beneath the territory.
“Mineral exploration activity, which leads to new mines, is very strong in Nunavut; this is important not just for the North, but for all of Canada,” said Sarazin in an email.
A new Cold War?
On August 2, 2007, Russia ignited a global controversy by piloting two mini-subs, Mir-1 and Mir-2, to the seabed 40 km below the North Pole and planting a one-metre-high titanium Russian flag.
The mission was compared to planting a flag on the moon, and drew the ire of the four other nations with competing Arctic sovereignty claims.
This act was in direct violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) signed in 1982, which says that a country has economic rights over resources 200 nautical-miles from their coastline. However, the convention is open to appeal, and all five Arctic nations are attempting to extend their legal jurisdiction beyond the area spanning their continental shelf. Though the U.S. helped draft UNCLOS, it has not ratified the convention.
According to Ford, if nations are able to prove that their continental shelf extends beyond the 200 nautical mile zone, then they can exercise sovereignty over territory 350 nautical miles from their shoreline. This could have significant implications for determining rights over oil and natural gas reserves.
Russia’s claim to an extended territory was rejected by an international panel in 2003. The country is in the process of developing another claim, which will have to be proved to a panel by 2013. Canada is expected to submit a claim by 2015.
Pollard discussed the difficulties Canada faces in exerting its sovereignty in the Arctic as more nations claim their stake in the region for future resource exploration.
“There’s money going into national defence to create a fleet of six patrol ships,” said Pollard, who said the money is coming from the Arctic Research Infrastructure Fund.
While this increasing militarization of the Arctic seems alarming, the sovereignty issues involved may in actuality be fairly trivial.
“We only have a couple of very small boundary disputes along the eastern and western edges of the Arctic,” said Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and one of Canada’s leading polar experts.
“[The disputes] concern 6,000 square miles of sea bed. [In a region where] distances are measured in thousands of miles, it’s not that big a dispute,” he said.
The issue of the Northwest Passage is particularly significant to Canada. As Arctic ice melts, the Passage has recently become more navigable, and with a higher volume of Arctic traffic, issues of policing the area are now more severe and complicated.
“The Northwest Passage is defined as an international waterway,” said Pollard.  “It’s unresolved as to the degree Canada can police which ships go through and what they do, and there are no clear ideas how to resolve it.”
The third coastline
The Arctic is warming faster than any other region on Earth. According to Ford, this phenomenon, called polar amplification, is a result of melting snow and ice, which reveals the dark surface beneath– further escalating absorption of the sun’s heat.
The changing climate affects more than the companies operating in the Arctic, however, and local wildlife and indigenous populations are increasingly at risk.
“Oil takes a longer time to break down in the North [because of the cold],” said Ford, who also said that there is still oil trapped in the ice around the site of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
These developments, while directly attributable to the use of the very fuels being extracted from the Arctic and shipped south, are not only harmful to the environment but are also detrimental to companies seeking to operate in the region.
Changing conditions will make it more difficult to extract minerals. The ice roads that companies rely on to bring in equipment and to ship resources out become unusable after melting in the summer.
Pollard cited a lack of awareness of environmental risks in earlier Arctic explorations and said that there remained a lack of preparedness for potential oil spills – though he noted the shift toward greater consideration of the environmental impact. He cited the recently approved Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, a proposed pipeline that would carry oil through the Northwest Territories from the Beaufort Sea, as an example of the new rigours of environmental assessment.
“Environmental regulation has finally caught up [with industrial practices],” said Pollard. “[The pipeline] has gone through a full environmental assessment, and every indigenous group has signed on [to support its construction].”
Indeed, Pollard also elaborated on the greater inclusions of native communities in current resource exploration.
“There’s a high proportion of native employment [in the local energy companies], and the companies give financial compensation to nearby communities,” he said.
According to Sarazin, exploration projects in Nunavut are held to high environmental standards and nearby communities benefit significantly from the ventures.
“The regulatory processes that operate in Nunavut are very community-focused and ensure that communities potentially impacted by activity have the opportunity for input into all decisions,” said Sarazin in an email.
Despite these improvements, researchers say that the short-term economic gains do not outweigh the long-term environmental consequences. The ultimate contradiction of companies extracting resources in Canada’s North is that their actions will jeopardize the ecological stability of the region they rely on.
“There’s a bit of a contradiction there,” said Pollard. “But [the environmental issue] is offset between world economics. Countries’ need for things drives this,” he said.

Debate continues over metro expansion, Turcot re-design, and tramways
Montreal is buzzing with transit development plans that will shape the city for decades to come.
From the proposed metro expansion into Laval, Longueil, and Anjou, to the redevelopment of the Turcot Interchange in the Southwest, and the perennial promise of the streetcar resurrection, transit has once again emerged as a central issue in the city’s political scene.
“In a way, transport makes the city,” said Étienne Coutu, an architect and urban designer working with Projet Montréal at City Hall.
A central tenet to the burgeoning municipal party’s platform is the installation of 250 kilometres of tramway track to the city, ten per cent of which they hope to have completed by fall 2012. Mayor Gérald Tremblay, meanwhile, has pegged the opening of a tramway line connecting Côte-des-Neiges to downtown and the Old Port for 2013.
“With a tramway, we’re giving space back to public transit,” Coutu said.
“The point is the experience – it’s calm, and it’s stable,” he said, adding that building tramways in Quebec would create jobs, and would also provide an incentive to redesign the streets around the new lines by widening sidewalks and adding green space.
Under Projet Montréal’s plan, a tramway would return to Parc – the most frequently serviced bus route in the city, and a major streetcar artery until the City swapped streetcars for buses in the mid-fifties.
At an estimated cost of $40- to 60-million per kilometre, however, others are not convinced that tramways are the best option for the city.
McGill urban planning professor Ahmed El-Geneidy favours increased bus frequency and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems.
“Exclusive bus-only lanes still take space away from cars – and cost much less,” said El-Geneidy, whose Transportation Research At McGill (TRAM) group works closely with STM, the regional transit authority, and the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) on projects such as the implementation of the express bus route 467 along St. Michel.
On January 22, the STM issued a press release stating it was about to finalize a $3-billion contract with the Consortium of Bombardier-Alstom SA for 765 new cars to replace its aging fleet, with an option for an additional 288.
However, the plan has stalled while China’s Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive attempts to join the bidding process with its steel-wheeled trains. These wheels can run outside, and are regarded as more energy-efficient than the rubber tires currently used in Montreal’s metro system, which is set to expand soon.
Last September, Quebec premier Jean Charest announced that the provincial government would move forward with a plan to connect the orange line in Laval, extend the yellow line by five stops into Longueil, and add five kilometres on the east side of the blue line, at a potential cost of about $150 million per kilometre.
With the majority of the construction on the North and South Shores, however, both Coutu and El-Geneidy expressed concern that the proposals could clog the already-congested east side of the orange line.
El-Geneidy stressed that for the extension into Anjou to be successful, the metro expansion must be coupled with a land-use plan to attract retailers, offices, and businesses around the metro lines.
“Without a land use plan, it will succeed at the same level as the old blue line,” he said.
Coutu added that Projet Montréal would also like to see the west side of the blue line extended through Snowdon to connect to Montréal-Ouest, and a tram connecting Trudeau Airport to downtown.
As for the yellow line, “Longueil is going to be a joke,” said El-Geneidy, adding that he would rather see an enhanced BRT service to feed into the existing metro.
However, recent squabbles between the STM, Laval, and Longueil over operating costs suggest the expansion may hit more political roadblocks in the future.
Laval withheld its annual $1.5-million share of operating costs until Longueil joined them in the TRAM 3 fare zone. Longueil is threatening to do the same.
“It’s like we’re in kindergarten, and no one wants to pay for the service,” said Coutu.
The argument raises the issue of the multitude of transit operators and fares in the region, with the STM’s single-fare metro and buses, the AMT’s multi-fare zone commuter trains, and separate suburban bus services like the Réseau de transport de Longueuil on the South Shore.
El-Geneidy said that competition between the agencies is a positive thing, but that the AMT should designate a consistent fare-zone system across the region.

Ontario community concerned with the proximity of wind farms to residents
R     esidents of Prince Edward County, Ontario, are opposing the push of several large wind power developers eager to begin building in the area. Situated south of Belleville between the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario, the region is a peninsula. The high and relatively consistent airflow makes it attractive to wind-powered energy developers. However, business and citizen groups in the county argue that wind power developments pose a threat to human health and safety, wildlife, and the economic prosperity in the region.
Orville Walsh, a representative of the County Coalition for Safe and Appropriate Green Energy (CCSAGE), explained some of the health effects of living near wind farms. “On a global basis, you’ll find people that are living close to [turbines] are having a lot of troubles with either noise or low-frequency vibrations – and by close I mean less than two kilometres,” Walsh said.
Commonly reported side effects of living near turbines include “sleep disturbance, fatigue, nausea, headaches, dizziness, and tinnitus,” or a ringing in the ear, according to Neal Michelutti, an environmental scientist at Queen’s University.
Michelutti has undertaken research to discover whether a new wind farm on Wolfe Island in Lake Ontario will lead to adverse health effects on the island’s residents.  Research began before the installations were built, giving the Queen’s team an opportunity to study people’s health over time, before and after the wind farm.
“A lot of the [scientific] literature that’s out there is not really scientifically sound,” said Michelutti, whose group consulted epidemiologists at the University to ensure an appropriate research design. The researchers are using two separate questionnaires to monitor general health and also specific symptoms associated with wind turbines elsewhere.
The non-profit group Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, co-founded by Krystyn Tully, first became involved with wind developments because of environmental concerns regarding 12 turbines on Wolfe Island. “For every turbine that is built a road also has to be built. In the case of Wolfe Island, you’re talking about roads being built, through wetlands and sensitive marshlands”, explained Tully.
In Prince Edward County, the problem is scale. “If every project that is proposed for [the county] were to go through, it would be 285 turbines, including 142 offshore,” said Tully. “It’s the cumulative effect of all those put together that nobody has looked at.” She insisted that no less than an individual environmental assessment will be adequate.
Groups like CCSAGE and others across Canada are not opposed to wind power, but simply aim to have wind farms constructed in a way they deem responsible. A central issue for such groups is setbacks, the regulated distance of a turbine or group of turbines from “receptors,” like homes, schools, or businesses.
“Regardless of the merits of wind energy, just don’t put them close to people,” said Walsh.
In Canada, each province establishes its own setback regulations.  Currently, Ontario’s Ministry of Environment is proposing setbacks of 550 metres for individual turbines and up to 1,500 metres for groups of turbines, depending on noise levels. This regulation, however, would still fall short of the two-kilometre range that groups like CCSAGE are seeking.
Despite opposition and a weakened global economy, wind energy grew at a rate of up to 40 per cent in Canada and 31 per cent globally in 2009, according to the Canadian Wind Energy Association (CanWEA).
Part of this growth is linked to new legislation, like Ontario’s Green Energy Act, implemented in May 2009. The act’s feed-in tariff program guarantees premium prices for electricity produced by industrial wind projects. CanWEA is currently petitioning the federal government to extend its ecoEnergy Renewable Power Program, which fed $1.48 billion into renewable energy projects from 2007 to 2009.
Many groups, however, remain unconvinced of the benefits of large-scale wind power, which has been marketed as leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, reduced pollution, and new jobs and stimulus for the green economy.
“It’s politically appealing to the governments in power that generally people living in urban areas are not threatened by [wind farms] and so it’s basically being foisted on the rural populations,” said Walsh. “[Politicians] talk about green economy and employment, but even that looks suspect when you look at the experience in Europe where rising energy costs basically have created a net loss of jobs.”

Alternative energy source linked to cancer and environmental concerns
A  fter a 16-hour debate and facing strong local opposition, the Durham Region Council voted 16 to 12 to recommend an energy plan to the provincial government on June 17, 2009. The plan requests $235 million to build an energy-from-waste incinerator in Clarington, Ontario. The toxic emissions from waste incinerators have been linked to asthma, cancer, congenital birth defects, and neurological impairments in children. The incinerator will be the first of its kind to be built in the greater Toronto area in 16 years.
The plan was opposed at the council meeting by over 80 citizen delegates who claimed that the environmental concerns are too grave, and that the proposal should be voted on by referendum this year. A citizen activist group called The Durham Environment Watch has been collecting signatures, and organizing events and demonstrations to protest the construction of the incinerator since 2005.
The Durham Environment Watch has gained the support of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Durham Region Labour Council, the Canadian Labour Congress, and the Durham Regional Environmental Council, as well as Prevent Cancer Now, an organization whose goal is to do away with all preventable causes of cancer in Canada.
“Should we continue to buy local if the food that we grow and eat becomes contaminated with cancer-causing dioxins and other pollutants?” asks a flyer on the Durham Environment Watch’s web site. The site also includes links to over 300 letters to local newspapers regarding the construction of the incinerator. A group of 75 Durham doctors also petitioned unsuccessfully for the Durham Region Council to reject the incinerator.
CUPE-Ontario has publicly called out for district organizations to fight the toxic incinerator. CUPE- Ontario president Sid Ryan warned members of the dangers associated with constructing a power plant that emits noxious fumes within 10 kilometres of 20 schools. Ryan also warned that the corporation that will be appointed to build the power plant has a history of disrespecting regulations.
“Covanta, the American company that is the preferred vendor, has a record of safety and labour regulations violations in the U.S. that is a mile wide,” said Ryan.
In 1992, the NDP’s minister of environment, Ruth Grier, banned all construction of solid waste incinerators in Ontario due to environmental and health concerns. The incinerator ban was lifted on February 15, 1994, by Mike Harris’s Conservatives as part of the “Environmental Bill of Rights Act” which was intended to permit municipalities to open their decision-making processes to freely select any energy policy.

Hydro-Québec linked to aboriginal  displacement and environmental destruction
In September of last year, volunteers ran relay marathons of 42 miles each from Matagami in Quebec’s James Bay region to the Romaine River near the North Shore, stopping at the Montreal offices of Hydro-Québec along the way to deliver a message: environmentalists and local communities do not want their river dammed to generate hydroelectric power, or for any other purpose.
“All the rivers of Quebec are under siege by Hydro-Québec. These rivers need to flow for our future generations. They are true life-givers and we need not forget this,” read the message written by Roger Orr, a Cree resident of James Bay.
The marathon was organized by the conservation coalition Alliance Romaine to draw attention to pending plans for a large hydroelectric complex on the Romaine River in the lower North Shore area of Quebec, about 1,100 kilometres northeast of Montreal.
Green energy
Hydro-Québec is a giant in the power sector. The company is responsible for meeting most of the domestic electricity demand in Quebec as well as substantial amounts in Ontario, New England, New York, and the maritime provinces. As 97 per cent of Hydro-Québec’s electricity is hydro, its stature has only increased with the global focus on climate change. Hydroelectricity is often considered a safe, renewable alternative to petroleum, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power – and Hydro-Québec is working to promote this image.
When asked if Hydro-Québec saw itself as a “green” corporation, spokeswoman Marie-Élaine Deveault said, “We don’t self-identify as a green company. We are identified as a green company…. I think hydro is part of the solution [to climate change].”
Deveault’s assertion points to Hydro-Québec’s increased focus on energy export, especially to the United States, which is seeking alternatives to coal in the era of climate change. American greenhouse gas emissions, Deveault stated, have been offset by 37 million tons through Hydro-Québec’s provision of hydroelectricity between 2001 and 2007.
Innu resistance
When constructing massive dams and flooding areas the size of Delaware, as in the case of the Churchill Falls project, social and environmental losses can result.
In the sixties and seventies, the development of the Upper Churchill Falls by Nalcor and Hydro-Québec proceeded without any consultation of local Innu communities. The permanent alteration of the Churchill River and the creation of a reservoir meant the loss of Innu hunting, trapping, and burial grounds that had been used for centuries. The Innu protested in 2006, Nalcor began exploring the possibility of a Lower Churchill Falls project downstream from the original development.
After protest and negotiations, in September 2008 the Innu brokered the Tshash Petapen – “New Dawn” in Montagnais – agreement with the Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams to receive annual compensation for the Upper Churchill Development, as well as land claims and a possible stake in the Lower Churchill Falls project.
The agreement was considered a major victory by the leaders of the Innu Nation and a step forward for the aims of Nalcor. However, currently neither the compensation nor the power station itself has come to fruition, and some activist efforts persist.
Peter Penashue, deputy grand chief of the Innu Nation, said by text message, “Thirty years later we have a commitment for redress and hopefully the agreement will be a reality soon. It would have been so much better to deal with these issues at the beginning as opposed to 30 years later.”
Hydro-Québec consulted with and reached agreements with the communities surrounding the Romaine complex, including Minganie, Nutashkuan, Unamen Shipu, Pakua Shipi, and Ekuanitshit. These agreements include cultural and economic support as well as employment.
Alliance Romaine
While Alliance Romaine has associated with some representatives from the communities affected by the Romaine Complex, they approach the issue strictly from the perspective of environmentalism and conservation.
“We understand negotiations will take place and different groups will seek compensation, but as we see it large-scale hydro is not renewable,” said Fran Bristow, another member of Alliance Romaine.
Environmental consequences of large-scale hydroelectric development can include the release of methylmercury from soil due to flooding, which poisons fish and can contaminate the food chain, as well as alteration of downstream ecosystems and the possible reduction of biodiversity. Paradoxically, large hydroelectric projects can also become a source of greenhouse gas emissions. When areas of dense forest or other vegetation are flooded, CO2 and CH4 are released at a higher rate.
Hydro-Québec & climate politics
Hydro-Québec insists that hydroelectricity is a sustainable, “green” alternative. Many dams have been removed throughout the United States to bolster fish populations decimated by hydroelectricity projects, but Hydro-Québec advertises measures to maintain biodiversity and minimize the size of reservoirs in the Romaine Complex.
What is certain is that Hydro-Québec has adapted its image well to the onset of global anxiety about the climate, aggressively emphasizing its role as a large-scale provider of safe, renewable energy. While massive dams are a hard sell environmentally, hydroelectricity providers tend to argue that such developments are the best of all current options. “We think hydroelectricity is one of the best choices. We do large-scale environmental assessments…to ensure the ecological footprint is at a minimum,” said Deveault.
Bristow opposes this logic. “We’re not asking for something utopian. In our present situation we have a choice on that impact and it can be positive or negative, and dams are not positive. Energy conservation is positive. It should no longer be a question of the best of two evils.”
