Criminal Code of Canada continues to create unsafe working conditions 
“In order to avoid getting arrested, they’ll just hop into someone’s car as soon as they stop so that they can avoid being charged with communication. That has been reported as increasing the dangers towards people who are working,” Robyn Maynard told The Daily when speaking on the current legal restrictions that risk the safety and dignity of sex workers.
Maynard is a street worker with the community-based initiative Stella, a ‘by sex workers for sex workers’ group that strives to provide resources to, and improve the health and safety conditions of, sex workers.
Currently, being a sex worker in Canada is legal; however, certain sections of the Criminal Code of Canada (CCC) restrict the freedom with which sex workers can operate.
According to Article 210 of the CCC, “Every one who keeps a common bawdy-house is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.” However, according to Maynard, the consequences of Article 210 have the potential to profoundly affect the livelihoods of sex workers.
“A lot of women like to work together with a larger group of people, so that they can work with security,” Maynard told The Daily, “but this was made illegal by 210, which means people can be evicted, lose their apartments, and be charged criminally just for being in a place where they’re working.”
According to Maynard, this also means the workers are less likely to keep condoms and other safe sex materials onsite, for fear of the materials being used as evidence against them in a criminal charge for being found in a bawdy-house.
Among other things, Article 212 of the CCC makes it illegal for third parties to procure or solicit sex workers for clients, and makes “enticing another person to engage in prostitution” illegal.
“There’s a part of [Article] 212 called ‘living off the avails’ that makes it illegal for women who are working in the sex industry [to] hire security [… or] a receptionist to screen their calls,” Maynard said. “[There are many] things that people put in place for their safety. [These are] currently illegal and treated the same as, say pimping, or exploitation, which no one is fighting to decriminalize. They’re also treated as one and the same under the law.”
Article 213, on the other hand, details the restrictions of sex work, limiting solicitation in “public places.” Sex workers may not receive clients in the same place more than once. As a consequence, time and space for consensual agreements become limited.
“[Article 213 essentially] makes it illegal for people to actually discuss any of the details around sexual services, whether that’s negotiating condom use, or even taking time to talk with the client to feel out if this is somebody that they would or would not like to see,” said Maynard.
Some strides are beginning to make way. In 2009, sex workers Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch, and Valerie Scott brought forward their case, which came to be known as Bedford v. Canada, to court in Toronto. After a year of deliberation, in 2010, Justice Susan Himel struck down these articles on the grounds that they were in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The federal government later appealed the decision. In 2012, the Ontario Court of Appeals struck down the bawdy-house provisions as unconstitutional; however, it maintained that Article 213 – which deals with solicitation – did not go against the Charter.
The applicants of Bedford v. Canada, which is currently on appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada, argue that these articles directly violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 7 of which reads, “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”
In addition, the applicants also claimed that the CCC makes their right to communicate with their clients illegal, and that this is another violation of the Charter, which is supposed to protect “freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression.”
“A lot of those laws that seem like they’re for women’s rights […] actually have extremely negative effects in terms of the working conditions and safety of sex workers,” said Maynard. “Those laws are not being brought forward by sex workers – they’re being brought forward by people who want sex workers to not exist in general.”

Graduate student who left McGill receives no financial compensation
Gary Dunphy, the McGill professor charged with issuing death threats to a graduate student, has appealed the decision rendered by the McGill Committee on Student Grievances. Earlier this year, the Committee ruled against the Natural Resource Sciences professor. The committee decision qualified Dunphy’s behaviour as constituting “harassment” and “threat of physical violence” toward his student, Amr El-Orabi.
The case began on November 19, 2012. When El-Orabi was departing the professor’s office upon announcing that he was leaving his lab, Dunphy yelled at him to “get the fuck out of the country.” And in response to El-Orabi asking if there was anything else the professor would like, Dunphy replied, “Yes, your death.” El-Orabi captured the exchange on tape.
The Senate Committee on Student Grievances, which arises out of University regulations, received a grievance from the graduate student against his supervisor on February 14. In his grievance, El-Orabi outlined three violations to his rights as described in the Charter of Students’ Rights: “death threat,” “religious, cultural and personal offences,” and “intrusion of his privacy.”
The Committee, with its nine voting members – four students and five professors – has final authority within University jurisdiction, and is “empowered to order such final or interim actions as it sees fit” for appropriate redress. However, Professor Frank Mucciardi, an academic member on the Committee, clarified that “the Committee cannot impose any kind of decision, it makes recommendations higher up and it is up to them to implement the decision.”
In September, the Committee wrapped up its investigation. While the decision was in favour of El-Orabi for the most part, his application for redress – or financial compensation – toward the money he invested in an interrupted education at McGill was denied. Moreover, the Committee found no violation of El-Orabi’s rights under section 2.1 of the Charter of Students’ Rights, which ensures that the right to equal treatment by the University “not be impaired by discrimination.” This is despite the fact that the recording clearly establishes Dunphy saying, “You have nothing new to offer […] your race is not that unique.”
In order to appeal the Committee decision, Dunphy had to notify the Secretary of Senate of his intention to do so within 14 days of receiving official notice of the decision. The Code of Student Grievance Procedures outlines that an appeal procedure can be sought only: “(1) Where new evidence which was not available to a party at the time of the original hearing has been discovered; or (2) Where a breach of natural justice has occurred,” and where the decision taken by the Committee could have been “substantially affected by any of the above circumstances.” If the Appeal Committee determines that the decision of the Senate Committee on Student Grievances was reasonable, the original decision is final and “implemented without delay.”
In September, several authorities at McGill responded to reporters from The Daily by saying they had to keep the information confidential “given the ongoing investigation,” despite the fact that the decision was already reached in August.
Additionally, McGill told El-Orabi he was not to divulge the nature of the decision and the possible sanctions against the professor “to avoid breaching a clause of confidentiality.” McGill cited section 1.4 of the Code of Student Grievance Procedures, a section that states that all documents submitted to the Committee must remain confidential. Nowhere in that section was there a mention about a non-divulgence of the decision.
Doug Sweet, McGill’s Director of Internal Communications, later informed The Daily that it was University regulation for McGill not to reveal the results of the process; however, “the parties themselves can, in the sense that the regulations do not spell out that they can’t.” Although the Secretariat encourages parties to maintain confidentiality, “there is no power to compel compliance in that regard.” In the decision El-Orabi agreed to share with The Daily, the Committee found that Dunphy’s verbal comments “constitute harassment of Mr. El-Orabi,” explicitly violating El-Orabi’s student rights under Article 3, which states, “every student has a right to the safeguard of his or her dignity and a right to be protected by the University against vexatious conduct by a representative of the University acting in an official manner.”
Regarding Dunphy’s mention of El-Orabi’s death in the context of an abrasive conversation, the Committee ruled that the comments “were legitimately interpreted by Mr. El-Orabi as a credible threat of physical violence.” Dunphy therefore violated El-Orabi’s rights under Articles 7 and 8, and “made Mr. El-Orabi fearful for his physical safety and his life ultimately leading to his departure from McGill and from Canada.”
The Committee also discussed possible actions of redress for the “psychological damage that Mr. El-Orabi may have suffered;” however, El-Orabi was informed that financial compensation was outside the purview of the Committee and was therefore not considered.
Finally, the Committee recommended that the Department of Natural Resource Sciences, the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, and the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies “move to ensure that Prof. Dunphy’s other graduate students, and any postgraduate researchers in his labs, be protected from harassment of this sort” because of his “bizarre and sometimes confrontational style.” One of the actions proposed by the committee included “insistence on co-supervision of all researchers and on the presence of a third party during all conversations.”
When asked to evaluate the process for filing a grievance complaint at McGill in retrospective, El-Orabi stated that he has heard of various similar incidents going unreported because “students are afraid to complain as they might jeopardize everything they are working for. I felt the same thing.”
Before El-Orabi decided to make his case public, and before filing a grievance complaint, he was in touch with various professors at McGill and with the Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau. At that time, he said, there were a lot of signs that something was not right. “I quickly realized that nothing would happen, I wouldn’t have had my grievances heard if I would not have gone public.”
In fact, from January until March, nothing much was done by the University, according to El-Orabi. An unofficial investigation was opened when El-Orabi first talked with McGill personnel, and further closed without any prior notice to him. Prior to the closing, there was no contact from McGill, according to El-Orabi. “They didn’t tell me what they were doing and suddenly the case was closed […] somehow the actions are confidential and I can’t even get a written documentation.”
Since April 11, however – the date that the first news article and audio clip were released by Global News – El-Orabi stated, “the University has been consistent in contacting me.”
According to the last annual report on the “Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Discrimination Prohibited by Law,” the number of overall harassment complaints has decreased in the past six years, from 43 in 2010-11, to 24 in 2011-12. Complaints based on discrimination, however, have increased in proportion to other complaints, rising from 2 per cent in 2006-07 to 21 per cent last year.
Amira Elghawaby, Human Rights Coordinator at the National Council of Canadian Muslims, told The Daily, “Especially now with the context in Quebec, and the Charter of Values, we hope that students won’t be further marginalized on campus.”
The Council had contacted El-Orabi to provide counsel and support throughout the grievance process, and is seeking to work with the University to change their policies to prevent Islamophobic harassment in the future.
Close to a year has gone by since El-Orabi left McGill to return to Egypt, and he does not consider going back to McGill an option. “For the University to say that they have found alternatives for me, in order for [me] to finish this degree, is a lie.”
As a former student of anatomy and cell biology, El-Orabi does not see the possibility of a future career in his field in Egypt, and therefore changed his career path. “I started to look into different things and [to] re-evaluate what I wanted to do.” He ended up switching into aviation and recently graduated from the Egyptian Aviation Academy.
Dunphy is still offering two classes this semester, BIOL 350: Insect Biology and Control, and AEBI 120: General Biology. “Every year I like to do that. Students seems to like to have that class offered,” he said during a call with The Daily in September. He did not comment on the case itself at the time, and again for this story.
When The Daily reached Alan Watson, Dunphy’s advisor during the case, he declined to comment.

Centre addresses need to combat prevalent rape culture
On November 11, after two years of campaigning, protesting, and petitioning, a Sexual Assault Resource Centre will finally open at Concordia University. Jennifer Drummond, a social worker and McGill graduate, will be the new centre’s coordinator, managing both volunteers and the centre’s services.
Located on the downtown campus at the Guy-Metro building, the new centre will offer “crisis intervention, advocacy, accompaniment, a resource room, referrals, volunteer opportunities and educational outreach,” according to Drummond.
She also said she hoped that the centre would “provide students, staff, and faculty a space for support, discussion and learning,” in order to create “a culture of respect and consent on campus.”
Julie Michaud, Administrative Coordinator at the Centre for Gender Advocacy, described Drummond’s approach as “very survivor-oriented,” as she “help[s] survivors take the steps that they feel are right for them, whatever those may be.”
The Centre for Gender Advocacy, which offers services and resources to the Concordia and greater Montreal community in addition to campaigning for social justice causes, is at the center of the two-year long push. Their petition received over 1,000 signatures, pushing the university into action back in April 2013.
Michaud highlighted the importance of a resource like this on campus. “Sexual assault centres should be in place at all [educational] institutions because around one in four students will experience some type of sexual assault during their post-secondary education.”
“The fact that a quarter of all students go through this is obviously very concerning, but even if the rate were lower it would still be worth addressing,” Michaud continued, adding that the definition of sexual assault is not limited only to rape, but “all unwanted sexual contact.”
Michaud says that the statistic “is hard to believe because we tend to think of sexual assault as a penetrative act that is perpetrated by a violent stranger in a dark alley.” In reality, she said, “over 80 per cent of survivors know their perpetrator, and it doesn’t have to [involve] physical violence.”
Survivors often face many other problems when dealing with sexual assault, such as skepticism and victim-blaming when deciding to share this information with friends or family. “Survivors learn quickly not to speak out” for fear of not being helped or even taken seriously, she said.
“It’s the unfortunate reality of living in a rape culture,” Michaud said, adding that it was “essentially the knowledge of [these] fact[s] that motivated [the Centre for Gender Advocacy] to campaign for the creation of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre.”
Unlike the administrative support for Concordia’s sexual assault centre, McGill has the Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS), a volunteer-based centre located inside the Shatner building. SACOMSS has run on student fees since the 1990s.
Michaud pointed out that there are similarities and differences between the two resources. “Like SACOMSS, the Sexual Assault Resource Centre will offer meaningful volunteer opportunities, but unlike SACOMSS, it will not put the burden of running the centre on volunteers.”
Drummond’s full-time position, according to Michaud, “will provide an important degree of reliability in the availability of service – something that can understandably be lacking in volunteer-run centres during busy times for students.”
Staff and volunteers from the Centre for Gender Advocacy will also be lending support to the Sexual Assualt Resource Centre.
“The opening of the centre is a very important step forward for Concordia, and I believe [it] will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of the entire Concordia community,” Drummond told The Daily.

Students bike in opposition to cycling policy
Morning campus traffic was disrupted on Wednesday morning as a group of around 35 demonstrators rode bikes through campus to protest McGill’s continued investments in fossil fuels. The protest also aimed to support the idea of bike lanes on campus, which would allow cyclists to ride their bikes across the lower campus, rather than walk them, as they are currently required to do.
The demonstration began at 10:30 a.m. near the Milton Gates. Around two-thirds of the demonstrators rode their bikes in a circuit passing by the Arts building, Leacock, and McTavish Street, before ending up on the steps of the Arts building.
No significant security action was noted in response to the demonstration. One lone guard was seen vigorously pointing to a sign instructing cyclists to dismount and walk their bikes.
“Divestment is the tactic, climate justice is the goal,” the demonstrators chanted as they rode through campus.
The remaining demonstrators walked to the Arts building waving signs and banners encouraging the University to divest from fossil fuels.
The demonstration was put on by Divest McGill, a group which seeks to end the University’s continued investment in fossil fuel companies. The group came into the spotlight in May when it unsuccessfully petitioned McGill’s Board of Governors to divest from investments in companies profiting from fossil fuels.
“[We’re] highlighting the contrast […] between all of the energy that goes into targeting bikes versus like basically none of the energy that goes […] into addressing tar sands [and] climate change,” remarked local climate activist Curtis Murphy to The Daily.
“We think that we should be focusing not on blocking sustainable solutions, like having bikes on campus, but more on things that are productive.”
“We think that we should be focusing not on blocking sustainable solutions, like having bikes on campus, but more on things that are productive,” noted Divest McGill member Kristen Perry.
“It supports the rejection of fossil fuels,” said a demonstrator who identified only as Loïc, when asked about the potential for bikes on campus. “It’s a better way to commute around.”
The demonstrators were quick to point out that their main focus was not specifically bikes on campus, but rather the broader issue of divestment from fossil fuels as a whole.
“The climate crisis is now,” yelled protest organizer Lily Schwarzbaum from the steps of the Arts building.
“When we talk about taking down the [fossil fuel] industry, we are taking down the most powerful group […] in the world. Their business plan, which is to burn through the reserves past our carbon budget, puts all of our lives at danger. By taking them down we are fighting for our very survival,” Schwarzbaum continued.
“Our hope is that they’ll divest,” Perry remarked when asked how she hoped the University would respond to the demonstration.
“Just making sure that [the University] knows that we’re not going to go away just because they said no the first time is really important. […] Just keeping the pressure up and just making sure that they understand that we’re here to stay because climate change is not going away,” Perry noted.

Council faces deficit once again in recently released budget
The Legislative Council of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) convened for their bi-weekly council meeting on November 7, discussing Halloween costumes, the upcoming Special General Assembly (GA), and SSMU’s revised fall budget.
VP University Affairs Joey Shea and VP Internal Brian Farnan reported their satisfaction with the annual 4Floors Halloween event hosted by SSMU. This year, SSMU put together a Costume Campaign in an attempt to avoid last year’s incident, which saw photos of students wearing blackface at the party and sparked controversy on social media.
The Costume Campaign, inspired by the Costume Sensitivity Campaign at Ohio University, asked students to consider, among other things, whether their costumes “mock or condescend historically oppressed people and/or cultures.” However, the Campaign drew some ire when it was posted on Facebook, with some questioning whether it was appropriate to create a new campaign featuring students in blackface and other racist costumes, instead of using existing campaigns.
According to both Shea and Farnan, most students dressed in accordance with these guidelines, which also falls in line with SSMU’s Equity Policy. Anyone who was wearing a questionable costume was “taken into another room to discuss it,” Shea said.
There were a few costumes that fell into a grey area, the two said, including one attendee in particular who dressed up as a basketball player with an afro. Services representative Élie Lubendo commented, “That person came in with a purpose […] He was trying to challenge the rules.”
Emily Yee Clare, former VP University Affairs in 2011-12, presented a motion for Council’s support of a proposal for funding from the Sustainability Project Fund (SPF). Her presentation described the project as an initiative that would “expand the scope of Rez Project to include training on issues of race, religion, and privilege.” Clare wants the project to “support first-year students and ensure that they have the mechanisms in place to access the support that they need.”
President Katie Larson expressed her delight that Clare was applying to the SPF for “something that is outside of environmental sustainability.”
The motion passed, with Council voting to endorse the proposal.
VP Finances and Operations Tyler Hofmeister presented the revised SSMU fall budget for 2013-14. This year, a new Information Technology (IT) budget was split off, as a permanent staff position was added. In addition, according to the budget report, the department faces larger expenses due to outdated hardware.
Once again, SSMU faces a large budget deficit, a result of “the ongoing lease negotiations with the University and the foregone revenues from tenants in the SSMU building,” according to the report. To mitigate what the report called a “significant deficit,” cuts were made to executives’ personal budgets, General Administration, Building, IT, and Club budgets.
Last year, SSMU’s deficit totalled $274,751, due to higher expenses, lower revenues, and the uncertainty of lease negotiations with the University.
In addition, the professional fee for SSMU’s Legal Counsel has risen, largely due to lease negotiations with the administration and contributions to the current Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) legal cases, among other things.
Council approved the budget, with 21 in favour and 8 abstentions.
After losing quorum at the annual Fall GA, SSMU decided to hold a Special GA on November 13 to appoint members to its Board of Directors, a process that cannot be accomplished by the Council. Larson asked councillors to report on their promotion efforts for the upcoming Special GA so that quorum could be reached; many reported using social media or word-of-mouth.
The speaker also reminded councillors that if the Board of Directors were not elected, SSMU would have difficulty renewing its liquor permits for Gerts.

Addresses capitalism, technology, and a “declining” U.S.
Last Tuesday, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore delivered a keynote speech on “Technology and the Future of Democratization” during Media@McGill’s annual lecture at its Beaverbrook Conference. While both technology and democracy were addressed, the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate spoke more generally about the world’s current state of affairs and this generation’s imperative role in shaping its future.
After a 30-year political career, Gore unabashedly spoke of an increasingly capitalized and problem-ridden “Earth, Inc.,” as he termed it, as well as a “declining” U.S.. He drew upon historical and scientific anecdotes to address global issues in the economic, political, environmental, and societal spheres.
Gore explicitly criticized profit-driven capitalism. “The ‘one per cent’ is not an Occupy Wall Street slogan – it is a fact,” he said.
He called for systemic changes in economic policy toward a “sustainable capitalism,” one that abolishes “short-termisms,” changes incentives to account for externalities, and redefines growth.
As to what a new paradigm would look like, Gore was unable to give a clear picture. “I don’t know the answer, and I don’t think Al Gore does either,” said Saurin Shah, a U2 student in Cognitive Science. According to Shah, Gore’s message was that, “‘All the pieces are there, someone just needs to pick it up’ and not ‘we need to build a new system’ […] He didn’t say capitalism is not sustainable.”
Shah did agree, though, that Gore evoked “a sense of urgency.”
Gore also addressed both the potentials and consequences of rapidly developing technologies in today’s quickly changing world. “The future of democracy depends on the choices we make, in relation to these new [technological] capacities,” he said.
In this respect, Gore addressed the student crowd directly: “These times now call for young men and women such as you to shape the future and make it what it should be.”
Payal Patel, U3 student in Political Science and Psychology, said she felt empowered after the talk. Although the content was not new to her, she said, “It was cool to see things from my political science class, my arts and science class, and my psychology class all come together […] and made me think about how it’s all integrated.”
Gore spoke openly about the U.S. – its current decline as a superpower, and its dysfunctionality as a country “radiating into global governance as a whole.” Shah, an American student at McGill, appreciated that Gore took a critical stance on America’s “crushing bureaucracy [and] increasing inequality of a developed nation of its size.”
Gore even called the recent government shutdown “pathetic” and “pitiful,” a far cry from what he called “an avatar for democracy around the world.”
In addressing this “democracy in decline,” Gore optimistically pointed to the internet as a powerful tool to participate, collaborate, and “win the conversation of making the right choice” – though he did not specify which, or whose, conversation.
However, Shah pointed out that Gore ultimately equated real change with institutional decision-making. While Gore admitted to declining confidence in the current capitalism-democracy model, he rejected neither, and in fact believed that they remain the best paradigms in governing society today.
“[As] a career politician, he is not really willing to […] condemn any government and say [their] method of democracy isn’t working,” said Shah.
