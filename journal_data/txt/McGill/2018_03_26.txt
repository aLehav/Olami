“YES” to Motion regarding Fight for Free Education, brought forward by Socialist Fightback at Concordia and McGill
The Daily endorses a “yes” vote for the Motion regarding SSMU support for the fight for free education, brought forth by Socialist Fightback at Concordia and McGill. The motion calls on the VP External of SSMU to commit to building a campaign in support of free tuition and the cancellation of student debt. The motion also mandates that the VP External mobilize for a one-day student strike in the Fall 2018 semester, hold regular organizational meetings open to student participation, and work in solidarity with off-campus organisations advocating for free tuition across the province.
The Daily stands in favour of free education and believes in the value accessibility of all kinds within education. High tuition fees, textbook costs, administrative fees, and the cost of living make higher education inaccessible to most. As a major Canadian university, we believe McGill has the platform and responsibility to set a precedent regarding affordable or free education. We support Socialist Fightback in their efforts to bring down the financial barriers to education at our university and beyond.

SSMU Environment Committee organizes event as a part of Sustainable Eating Week
On Thursday March 22, the SSMU Environment Committee hosted a discussion titled “Food Security, Veganism, and Accessibility,” as part of its annual Sustainable Eating Week. The event series, organized in partnership with student organizations such as ECOLE and the Herbivore Society, aimed to raise awareness about food security, and encourage students to eat sustainably. The discussion was facilitated by Gel Gibson, who is studying Global Food Security at McGill and currently finalizing their research on the interactions between food security and migration. Gibson spoke about food security addressing three main topics: the role of veganism in mitigating world food security issues; the accessibility of veganism in light of financial, geographical, and health-related factors; and the ways in which one can act on these issues.
A personal journey
“The idea was to have a facilitated discussion that brought these questions to light,” said Caroline Lou, one of the SSMU sustainability commissioners and organizers of the event. “A lot of the time, when we talk about veganism or sustainable eating, we don’t recognize that it’s not accessible to everyone, whether it’s for socio-economic reasons, for reasons of personal health, or because of cultural ties to certain food. We really wanted to focus on a more intersectional approach to this issue.” Lou explained that the goal of the event was to show how everyone, including non-vegans, can make responsible choices with food consumption.
“Through this conversation, we [hoped] to show people that even if you’re not vegan and you don’t eat local all the time, it’s about making conscious choices to become more sustainable, and not necessarily about reaching this pinnacle goal that is unattainable. It’s a work in progress for everyone, and even if we’re not perfect, the point is that we’re trying every day.”
Alison Gu, another SSMU Sustainability Commissioner and organizer, mentioned that the discussion also aimed to address different perceptions and practices surrounding veganism.
“There are a lot of negative stereotypes around veganism, and I think it has a lot to do with white feminism veganism,” explained Gu. “If you only eat vegan products but you are heavily consuming chocolate, coffee or tea, products which are harvested and produced in a way that exploits workers and humans, there’s a contradiction in that if you care about animals, why don’t you care about humans?”
In response, Natalie Quathamer, a McGill alumni who studied dietetics, stated that the most sustainable option must be considered: “That’s true. For example, I am vegetarian most of the time, but if I go to a dinner party and am served meat, then I eat it because it is the most sustainable option. I guess the most important thing is trying to find the best route in all options.”
Consuming consciously
“The key is to find the right balance,” said Quathamer, emphasizing the importance of balancing health and environmental concerns when choosing the most sustainable option. “In the developing context, meat is very important. We have a privilege for the simple fact that we are growing up in this country. However, if you are in a developing country, eating meat may be the healthiest option, but also the most sustainable one. Yet, today, 80 per cent of agricultural land goes to feeding livestock. ”
They mentioned that eating meat can be an important part of people’s diets, as “one thing missing in every plant-based product [is] vitamin B12, which can only can only be found in animal products.”
“You can become anemic if you are missing B12 and feel fatigue,” Gu noted. “You can take supplements or eat a lot of nutritional yeast to keep a healthy diet.”
GMOs
One participant raised a question about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), and how GMOs impact food sustainability. Gibson explained that GMOs were created by crossbreeding plants: “There are the commercially produced plants that we eat, and other wild types of the same plants,” Gu said. “A lot of GMOs is just putting strong genes of wild plants into the commercial types. It’s not the mad scientist thing that is often portrayed. […] The general scientific consensus is that there are no adverse effects of GMOs.”
When asked about the health impact of GMOs, Gibson encouraged participants to look at systematic meta analyses, which, according to Gibson, compile hundreds of studies and create a more reliable sources of information. “There is a famous study of mice with huge tumors after eating only GMOs. But the truth is that most studies that are done against GMOs are not scientifically reliable. In this case, the kind of mice that were picked already had a greater risk of developing tumors.”
Veganism at McGill
When asked about vegan and vegetarian options available at McGill, Gu claimed that she has seen real progress on the availability of vegan options around campus.
“In my first year, there were barely any vegan products,” she said, “and everything that was vegan looked gross and was disgusting and expensive, and they didn’t change it at all. Now they’re getting much better. When they have a vegetarian option, they try to make it vegan, just because everything that is vegan is also vegetarian. And McGill recently started a partnership with Aux Vivres, which is a vegan restaurant. They are much better at being more inclusive.” She also stressed the importance of not only considering what we eat, but how we eat, highlighting the contradiction of heavily packaged vegan products. “Being vegan also does not necessarily mean eating sustainably. […] For example, the Aux Vivres products are all vegan but they are all packaged in plastic, which was recently changed to be non-recyclable. They started out with recyclable plastic but now they are going backwards. I think it’s important to try to balance out those two things, especially if your goal to be vegan is to be helping the environment.” Lots of vegans eat a lot of imported products, something that is detrimental to the environment,” added Gu.
Gu explained that with the promotion of the vegan lifestyle, we must be mindful of the products we consume. “Meat, for instance, contributes to global emissions in a significant amount, and more so than people realize,” she said. “[In promoting veganism] we also have to be careful about social sustainability as well, thinking about equity and treating humans well, as well as treating animals. And there are people who are only vegan because they care about the animals and that it is fine. But in just that, when you are trying to advocate for a cause that you care about, doing so in a way that is understanding of everybody’s different situations.”

Solidarity Across Borders holds demonstration outside hearing
On Thursday March 22, a rally was held in front of the Guy-Favreau Complexe to protest the declared deportation of Lucy Francineth Granados, an undocumented woman taken from her home by force by the Canadian Border Services Agency the morning of March 20. The rally was organized by the Immigrant Workers Center and Solidarity Across Borders. Granados herself is a prominent community organiser, and a member of the Non-Status Women’s Collective in Solidarity Across Borders.
Since being taken from her home by the CBSA, Grandos has been held in the Laval Detention Centre, and a review hearing for her case occurred during the support rally. Results of the hearing, revealed later, declared that Granados will be deported back to Guatemala on March 27.
Carmelo Monge, a man involved in advocating for people without status in the Mexican community within Montreal, explained that “it is evident that […] there is a total discrimination […] for all the people who live without status […] like Mrs. Francineth Granados.”
“It is necessary that [people without status] live a life […] with all services [made available to them:] […] the service of education, […] health, […] [and] a secured job,” Monge stated.“We have the right to live with dignity. It is important for us to remain humane, and organize […] [in order to resist] this type of violence.”
Mary Foster, a community organizer for Solidarity Across Borders, explained that “the situation of Lucy is […] extremely […] disturbing.”
“The city of Montreal making this decision to call itself a sanctuary city, […] [but] since Lucy has been arrested the response [of the city legislators] has been, ‘that’s a federal matter, there’s nothing we can do,’” said Foster.
“If us as individuals here can do a lot, and can think of a lot of things to do, I think the city of Montreal, with all its wealth and all its power, can find a couple of things to do to stop Lucy’s deportation, and ensure that she’s released from detention.”
Foster explained how Granados filed a humanitarian application for permanent residence in order to regularize her status in Canada, after her refugee application was refused upon entering Montreal nine years ago. She has remained in Canada without documentation in order to support her three children who have grown up here.
“The reason this [seizure by the CBSA] happened to Lucy is because she was trying to regularize her status,” explained Foster, “and it seems to be because of that they started to look for her and track her down.”
A representative from the South Asian Women Community Center explained that “Lucy is a mother, and like a lot of parents, she will do whatever is needed to support her family and her children, even if it means […] embarking on a very long, dangerous journey to come here and find work to support her family, and then living the hardship of being considered illegal.”
“As a temporary worker,” she continued, “[Granados] is a worker who’s contributing to society and the economy of Canada, and we need to inform the Canadian state and demand that we are not expendable. The Canadian state and the Canadian economy would collapse without the work and the hard labor of people like Lucy Granados.”
The representative further explained that “immigration is used to exclude people, and to bring people who are considered beneficial because of their money, their skin color […] and so we are calling everyone to write to Prime Minister Trudeau […] that here is a mother who is here because of her children.”
“He should act now, as somebody who presents himself as representing Canada which likes to present itself as a bastion of law and order,” she elaborated, “and we need to tell Minister Hussen [Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship for the Government of Canada] this is violating Canadian law itself because Lucy has every right to be here, not only as a human being, but also under Canadian immigration law […] [as] she has filed a humanitarian application and she is entitled by current Canadian law to be here.”
She concluded by saying that the rally in support of Lucy is in order to “send a message to Lucy to say that we’re shouting through the walls of Guy-Favreau. We are here for you, we want you to be liberated, and we are sure that you will be joining us in our homes, in our arms, in Montreal again, outside the horrid walls of prison. So, Lucy, love and solidarity to you.”

Abortion Laws in Poland
On Friday March 23, two demonstrations occurred in Poland; one titled “Black Friday,” for which demonstrators marched on Warsaw in protest of proposed tighter abortion laws, the other titled “White Friday,” a collection of prayer meetings held across the country in favour of stricter laws.
Poland already has some of the strictest reproductive health and abortion laws in Europe. Currently, condoms are the only contraceptive available over the counter. In addition, abortion is highly regulated, with is only legal in only three cases: when the health of the person carrying the fetus is in danger, when the fetus is ill or has a serious deformity, or if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.
A citizen’s bill called “Stop Abortion,” which proposed the banning of abortions in the case an ill or deformed fetus, the reason for 95% of the country’s legal abortions, passed through Poland’s 2015 elected right-wing parliament, and was later backed by a parliamentary review committee. However, it has yet to be fully approved and implemented. Anti-abortion groups claim that the reason for banning abortions in the case of ill and deformed fetuses is to protect the potential lives of fetuses with Down’s Syndrome, saying that this diagnosis is the main reason for termination of pregnancy in Poland.
At the same time the “Stop Abortion” bill was proposed, a bill to liberalise abortion laws called “Save Women” was struck down. The “Save Women” bill sought to legalize abortion until the twelfth week of pregnancy, introduce sex education in schools, make prescription-free emergency contraceptives available, and ban pro-life picket protests showing graphic images near hospitals and schools. Pro-choice groups say that stricter abortion laws in the country will only force more people to seek illegal abortions, an already significant problem in Poland, where the number of illegal abortions per year (up to 150,000) outstrips the number of legal ones performed (1,000-2,000).
Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has agreed to sign the bill into law if it passes through parliament, while the Council of Europe is prompting the country to drop the bill because of its incongruity.

Marielle Franco Murder
On Wednesday March 14, Brazilian activist and Rio de Janeiro city council member Marielle Franco was assassinated. That evening after leaving an event, an unidentified car approached her vehicle, and two men fired nine shots into its back window, killing Franco and her driver Anderson Pedro Gomes, and injuring a press officer. Authorities have yet to bring anyone up on charges in the case, and given the circumstances, the international community is calling for an independent investigation of Franco’s death.
Franco had become a champion for the city’s impoverished neighbourhoods — known as favelas — and was a known opponent of growing police and military control in Rio de Janeiro, often publicly criticizing the violent behaviour of law enforcement in the city. January of this year saw a 57 per cent increase in deaths resulting from police action, compared to January of last year. Franco called out the actions of Rio’s 41st police battalion, a group connected to several killings in the city, most recently those of two men from the Acari favela who were found in a drainage ditch earlier this month. Two days prior to her killing, she condemned the murder of Matheus Melo, a young Black man who was killed by police after leaving a church service in Rio’s Jacarezinho favela.
Franco, a gay Black woman from Rio’s Mare favela, was the fifth most-voted-for candidate in the 2016 municipal elections. Her death sparked international outrage and incited protests. A fellow activist and attendee at one of these protests, journalism student Daiene Mendes, told the Guardian that “Marielle was a symbol of our biggest conquests. A woman like us, Black, from the favela, who had a lot of strength to face the institutional challenges of the politics that always kept us distant.”

Debates on motion to amend role and duties of commissioners
On Wednesday March 21, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) convened at the Thompson House Ballroom for their monthly council meeting. Around 40 graduate students and councillors were in attendance. The council heard a presentation from Kathleen Godfrey, then entered a lengthy debate on the motion to amend the roles and duties of commissioners in PGSS.
Council voted on four motions: one regarding commissioner roles and duties, another regarding the appointment of a PGSS sponsorship commissioner, followed by a motion regarding the library improvement fund, and finally a motion to amend the PGSS budget. Three motions passed, two of which were amended. The motion regarding the sponsorship commissioner was tabled.
The council heard a presentation from Kathleen Godfrey, a representative of Kathleen’s Friends, an organization connecting intergenerational students to improve social and mental well being on campus. The initiative was started in partnership with McGill Community for Lifelong Learning (MCLL) and the undergraduate and graduate student communities.
“MCLL […] is primarily a retiree community. […] Essentially, what we are trying to do together with some funding from the dean’s office is start intergenerational conversation and community on the McGill campus,” said Godfrey.
Godfrey mentioned that Kathleen’s Friends is currently expanding, and may be seeking endorsement from the PGSS in the future.
“We’re trying to create a team […] of undergrads, grads, […] and older learners at McGill to try to enhance […] learning,” Godfrey explained.“We are going to […] try to formalize this group in a partnership […] under whatever heading that makes sense to the Dean of Students office. […] I’m bringing this to PGSS and other grad students perhaps down the road seeking some endorsement.”
The motion to amend the PGSS activities manual to amend the role and duties of PGSS commissioners was presented by Matthew Satterthwaite, the PGSS’ Financial Affairs Officer.
“We’ve come to the realization that the way commissioners are currently positioned within the PGSS is no longer sustainable, Satterthwaite explained. “Portfolios have expanded so much [..] over the past years that they [commissioners] now need more support from executives. […] You have commissioners who are working 30, 40 hours on certain portfolios, and that’s no longer sustainable.”
“The spirit behind these amendments is to better define the role and the scope of the role of the commissioner portfolio within the PGSS [and] align portfolios to allow support directly from the executives,” continued Satterthwaite.
According to Satterthwaite, the motions have been endorsed by the executive committee and approved unanimously by the commissioners caucus. According to PGSS Secretary General Maria Tippler, several commissioners have left their positions throughout the semester, prompting the motion.
However, concerns over the autonomy of the commissioner role was raised amongst audience members, prompting a debate on the issue. One of the audience members pointed out that one of the clauses consists of co-chairing meetings of executives and commissioners in portfolio meetings.
“The reason they were made co-chairs was to give executives a seat on that committee, in the case the commissioner can’t be there, responded Satterthwaite.“It’s just a way to place the executives in the meetings when required.”
Satterthwaite emphasized that the executive member would be a non-voting chair, and that commissioners take up to 3-4 hours to prepare for an Annual General Meeting (AGM), which could be allocated to portfolios if reporting was deferred to executives.
However, multiple councillors raised concerns that the role of the co-chair, and the reporting relationship to the executive was not clearly defined.
“All I see here is just a […] change in the reporting relationship where commissioners are no longer accountable to council, but rather […] to the executive. […] how does this define their activities more? Because that’s not what I see here,” said Amir Nosrat, PGSS Environmental Commissioner. “[In] PGSS, there is debate on whether we concentrate power or distribute power.
“This is to me is about concentrating power […] and authority,” he concluded.
Bradley Por, the Graduate Law Students’ Association (GLSA) representative, questioned why the proposed motion would place commissioners under the supervision of executives, as opposed to the current system, where the commissioner would report to the council.
“By using the word supervise, it actually does imply a power […] when somebody supervises someone else, it […] impl[ies] authority.”
Satterthwaite responded to Por by explaining that the intention was for the executive to “be more hands on and collaborative.”
Por also pointed out that the motion also changes the way in which commissioners are dismissed in writing.
“It […] does give power objectively to the executive in the text by writing the word supervise in, by writing in that executive can remove them from office even though it has to be ratified by the council,” Por stated. “They didn’t have that power before. It definitely, concretely, in writing, gives executives more power than the commissioners.”
After a lengthy question period and debate regarding the PGSS activities manual, the motion was amended to strike all items except for the whereas clauses and item 5.7, a line specifying the pay and hour of the commissioner. According to Satterthwaite, the motion would increase the commissioners’ salary by $200 per year, which would be reflected in the subsequent year’s budget. The motion was passed with three abstaining and one opposing vote.
The motion to create a PGSS Sponsorship Commissioner position supervised under the Financial Affairs was tabled after several councillors mentioned “there needs [to be] reflection on the relationship of the commissioner to council to executives.” For similar reasons, the motion to amend the Library Improvement Fund was also amended to exclude the clause concerning the Library Improvement Commissioner. The motion to amend the budget was passed without amendments.

SPHR organizes discussion on contemporary colonialism
On Tuesday March 20, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill hosted a workshop comparing the contemporary colonialisms of Tibet and Palestine, presented by Khando Langri, a Tibetan-Canadian member of SPHR McGill and an activist for the liberation of Tibet. The workshop was held in conjunction with other events as part of Israeli Apartheid Week in Montreal.
Langri began the presentation by explaining the need to recognize Palestine and Canada as both occupied territories.
“In order to resist colonization abroad, we must first address how we are complicit in the continuous colonial process in Montreal,” explained Langri.
She established that although there is a “universal perception within university settings that we have entered the age of postcolonialism […] colonialism is not only alive but is thriving in the modern age” as exemplified by the occupation of both Palestine and Tibet.
The NGO Freedom House, which according to its website is “an annual comparative assessment of political rights and civil liberties,” ranks the political rights and civils rights of the occupied territory of Tibet at -2/40 and 3/60, those of the occupied West Bank at 6/40 and 24/60, and those for the occupied Gaza Strip at 3/40 and 9/60, respectively. In comparison, Canada is ranked at 40/40 for its political rights and 59/60 for its civil rights.
Portrayal of child prisoners
Langri compared the occupations of Tibet and Palestine first in terms of child prisoners held in both regions. The eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a “high reincarnate Lama,” an important religious leader in Tibet, was recognized by the Dalai Lama on May 15, 1995 and was subsequently rejected by the Chinese government which “abducted both [the Panchen Lama] and his family,” explained Langri. Neither him nor his family have been heard of or seen since and no charges have been exposed nor have any trials have been held.
“[The Panchen Lama] was […] removed from Canada’s list of prisoners last year” which is a list of different prisoners compiled by Canada used in order to lobby against certain countries, stated Langri. “The list that was […] for China […] omitted the Panchen Lama so clearly China’s winning here since [Canada doesn’t] remember him anymore.”
This example was juxtaposed with the situation of Ahed Tamimi, a sixteen-year old child prisoner facing eight months in prison after slapping an Israeli soldier who trespassed onto her home in the occupied West Bank, and consequently is being tried in an Israeli military court.
“Because Tammi is portrayed as an adult in mass media and […] the Panchen Lama’s identity as a tuku […] a high reincarnate Lama […] are the forefront of any discussion involving these two people they are not allowed to exist as children in the popular psyche,” elaborated Langri.
“It’s important to talk about them even if they’re politicized so we can’t let the fact that […] many are perceived as being […] very controversial figure[s] […] to stop us from talking about them because this politicization does not [take away from] their childhood.”
Ecology of occupied land
Langri also discussed the concept of China’s “greenwashing” of the occupation in Tibet. Greenwashing is “the act of packaging something to make it seem eco-friendly and thus more acceptable to mainstream media,” she explained. This concept is part of China’s “Ecological Migration Scheme” which displaces Tibetan nomadic families and relocates them to “ghettos called ‘Socialist New Villages’.” These nomadic inhabitants do not have skills for the labor market, are not offered education, and face an increased living cost, Langri explained.
“What’s ironic is that […] the Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N. has recognized the role that pastoralists play in preserving the environment so in terms of Tibet the nomads […] were very crucial in maintaining […] soil carbon because the animal’s waste added nutrients to the soil […] maintaining fertility and also the hooves would aerate the soil by pressing in seeds and trampling dead plants.”
This concept of ecological manifestation of colonialist occupation is also present in Palestine. Langri used the example of the establishment of the “South Africa Forest,” a tree-planting initiative by the Jewish National Fund in the destroyed Palestinian village of Lubya published in article by Heidi Grunebaum.
“By using nature against indigenous people we can […] erase their narratives,” said Langri.
“Changing the land [of native peoples] physically […] translates into […] [a change in the] conception of national homelands.”
Apoliticism of traditional symbols
Langri explained how “we as a consumer culture really enjoy indigenous aesthetics but that means on the one hand as we consume them we render them apolitical.” She explained how in the case of Tibet, “Tibetan struggles [are] consistently erased from news struggles and has been substituted with this fascination for the Dalai Lama [the spiritual leader of Tibet] as a media personality.”
“As a society we are charmed by him but we don’t want to engage in Tibetan issues because they’re not very savory.”
For example, the use of Tibetan prayer flags, flags which contain mantras which are believed to blow in the wind and spread compassion and peace and the usage of the keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism and protest against Israeli occupation, as decoration and fashionable pieces is testament to a “love for Tibetan and Palestinian aesthetics but [a lack of] […] love for the people themselves.”
Tourism as a “tool of occupation”
In terms of tourism, Langri discussed how “tourism is in fact the tool of occupation.” She explained how in the case of Palestine, Birthright trips to Israel which are offered to Jewish young adults ages 18-32 “erase all traces of the land’s original […] inhabitants.” These trips represent an “unequal spreading of […] touristic resources” because Palestinian refugees cannot return to their homeland in the regions of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s prevention of Palestinians from returning to their homeland is parallel to China’s prohibition of movement for Tibetans even though China advocates for tourism within Tibet. All Tibetan passports have been confiscated by the Chinese government and only government-affiliated individuals are offered “semi-official public affairs passports,” Langri explained. Additionally, traditional Tibetan “sky burials,” a religious and sacred Tibetan custom, are being advertised as a tourist attraction and are being photographed and recorded.
Mobilization
Anna* a student who attended the workshop explained that “Tibet has now officially stopped requesting to be an independent nation and now wants […] political recognition […] these rights are inscribed in the Chinese constitutions and so it’s simply asking that China now respect these rights to autonomy […] but they’re not [upholding these rights] […] [and] in fact nothing is really being respected on paper.”
“That’s […] the political way that we could mobilize,” Anna continued. “Canada for example hasn’t taken a stance […] with regards to recognizing Tibet’s desire to […] have these autonomy rights respected and that’s something that the [Canada Tibet Committee] tries to do […] to [get] the Canadian government to take a stance.”
