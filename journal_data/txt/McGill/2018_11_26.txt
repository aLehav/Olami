Petition Opens Debate on Constitutionality and Student Care
content warning: gendered and sexual violence
The Judicial Board, a body of SSMU tasked with hearing disputes pertaining to the Society’s constitution, met on November 20 to hear the petition of Bryan Buraga (Arts and Science Senator) V. Juan Wang (VP Finance) and Tre Mansdoerfer (President). Buraga and Mansdoerfer were present; however, Wang was not in attendance. 
In his opening statements, the petitioner, Buraga, outlined his goals. He is seeking a verdict from the Judicial Board that would validate the alleged unconstitutionality of the Anti Violence Fee Levies passed on October 11 and 18 at Legislative council. Additionally, he is looking to nullify the fee levies and their referenda. Buraga stated that he wishes that VP Finance Wang and the Executive Committee both be found in violation of section 16.1 of the SSMU Constitution, which demands a standard of care for SSMU members. 
The petitioner maintains that the versions of both the Anti Violence Fee Levy (AVFL) motions passed on October 11 and 18 were not constitutional. The policies did not have enough movers in the eyes of the constitution, but did adhere to the Standing Rules and the precedent set by several motions from previous years, respondent Mansdoerfer pointed out. As confirmed by case witnesses Husayn Jamal (Speaker on Call) and Samuel Howard (Parliamentarian), the Internal Regulations, which designate the Standing Rules as the default, overrules the constitution when there is a conflict. Buraga, originally a mover of the motion, removed his own name from the October 11 AVFL through a Google doc, without notifying the other movers, thus causing the conflict. 
Because the AVFL, which would allow for the implementation of the Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy (GSVP), is not coming into effect until January 2019, nearly four months after it was passed in council, Buraga believes that this constitutes a breach in standard of care. In his opening statements, Buraga asserted that “if the Vice-President (Finance) and the Executive Committee had made the Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy a priority, they would have found the necessary permanent funding for it. […] This case isn’t just about the Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy today, this is to set a precedent that the Officers of the Society must act to keep students safe when they have the ability to do so.” 
He continued, “the Vice President (Finance) and the Executive Committee have used the Anti-Violence Fee Levy to abdicate their responsibilities and tell survivors that we need to wait to feel safe, and that is unacceptable. The Vice-President (Finance) and the Executive Committee have failed me, and I believe the Judicial Board will find the same.” 
Buraga also shared his own experiences with sexual violence in his speech. “To this day,” he said, “I still have to retraumatize myself every time I see my abuser at a SSMU function. To me, this represents a failure on the part of SSMU to protect its members through its duly-passed, and currently active, Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy.”
The respondent did not disagree that SSMU has a responsibility to respect its students. The respondent argued that the Executive Committee acted in “the best interest of the Society” when choosing to implement a fee to support the GSVP, emphasizing that SSMU does want safety for it’s students, and to ensure that measures to protect them are sufficiently funded. Throughout his arguments, Buraga insisted that not only should the GSVP be funded immediately, but that SSMU itself, not SSMU members should be the ones paying for it. 
Pointing to the $10,000 spent providing transportation for students at SSMU’s Children of the Corn Halloween party, Buraga argued that there is funding available for the GSVP. He specifically referenced a quote from VP Internal Matthew McLaughlin from the October 29 General Assembly: “my priority was to make sure that everyone got home safe, and of course, cost comes after safety.” The respondent countered by highlighting the difference between an emergency situation, like students being stuck at MacDonald Campus, after transportation refused to show up, and altering the operating budget for the Society. 
In an interview with the Daily, one of the respondents, President Mansdoerfer, said that there is a desire to restructure funding so that policies like the GSVP would not have to be the responsibility of the students. “I met with the head of McGill finance in September to talk about how we can restructure some of our fees. […] This discussion was going to happen regardless of [this case] or not.” He continued, explaining that “the finance committee has a new objective to relook at how Society fees are structured, and come March, they should have a proposal. The end desire would be to have not just this, [but other fees too] that we identify as part of SSMU, be in the operating budget. […] It’s ridiculous when you have a thousand fees. It’s not a fair structure.” 
In an interview with the Daily, Buraga summarized his goals. “One of the intentions I had filing this case was to strike down the AVFL as a way of forcing immediate funding.” He elaborated, saying, “I don’t want the funding to disappear from this [the GSVP] […] if the AVFL ends up happening it’s not the end of the world. It’s great, because there’s a permanent source of funding but I really hope it’s integrated into the operating budget as a permanent thing.” 
The Judicial Board now has two weeks to write a report outlining their recommendation. The report will then have to be ratified by the Board of Directors before any action is taken.

HanVoice McGill Hosts North Korean Refugee
On November 16, McGill Students for HanVoice, a non-profit club that increases awareness of North Korean refugees and fundraises for their cause, hosted the event “Alice Kim: The North Korean Defector.” Two speakers led the discussion: McGill International Development Professor Kazue Takamura, and Alice Kim a 23-year old student and North Korean defector.
Takamura described how there are currently 50,000 to 200,000 North Korean refugees believed to be taking refuge in China. “They are repressed [in North Korea] and repressed in other Asian countries that they have escaped to,” she said. “Advocacy is particularly important, but also we have to listen to the voices of refugees, for documenting those voices.”
HanVoice is also leading a project called North to North, which aims to provide private sponsorship opportunities for refugees from North Korea to settle in Canada. Kevin Seo, co-president of McGill Students for HanVoice, stated his belief that Canada will become a place for North Korean refugees to start a new chapter of their lives.
Alice Kim was born in 1995 in Pyongyang, North Korea, and the following year Kim’s family got the chance to escape North Korea when her father was promoted to a diplomatic position in China. North Korean diplomats who travel abroad must leave a family member in the country. Since she was a baby and was sick at that time, her family chose to take her with them, leaving Kim’s older sister behind, who was six years old. Kim did not know she was from North Korea until she was seven years old. Her peers at school in South Korea bullied her for her background. “My origin became a fact, I became Alice Kim the North Korean,” she recounted, “I didn’t understand why I was discriminated against. […] In South Korea, I am [considered] a North Korean with all the negative connotation attached to it.”
Kim also shared the economic struggles that her parents faced after moving to South Korea. They lived in poverty for years. She stated that many North Korean refugees were once elites, or government officials back in their country; however, these people ended up working in low paying jobs in South Korea. The government fund for North Koreans is not enough she said.
Closing her speech, she spoke to the split of South and North Korea. Kim stated, “the [border] shouldn’t be there in the first place.” She wished “to remind future policy-makers and young generations in this room, [their decisions] impact real people in real time. As my family story shows, this can leave devastating marks.” She continued, asking Canadians, especially young students, for their continued support. “Your determination is the driving force for change. With the right support, the right content, and with plenty of cooperation, maybe we can change the lives of North Korean refugees like me.”

Poet El Jones Delivers Keynote at Culture Shock
Poet El Jones gave the Culture Shock’s keynote address about the state of prisons in Canada on November 15 as part of McGill’s 13th annual Culture Shock. Every year, QPIRG organizes a series of events that highlights the voices of marginalized communities. El Jones is a writer, journalist, educator, and an advocate for prison abolition. She is also the fifth Poet Laureate of Halifax. In 2016, Jones co-founded Black Power Hour, a radio station where inmates could call in and recite their poetry, rap, or speak their mind.
During her speech, Jones read her poem “Canada is so Polite.” She discussed various stereotypes about Canadians: “they’re so polite, they always say sorry, they always say thank you, they always say please.” She then contrasted these stereotypes by pointing out how there was never a “please” when land was stolen from Indigenous peoples by the government.
She followed her poem with a discussion of the infamous wrongful conviction of Donald Marshall Jr. Marshall, a member of the Mi’kmaq community, spent 11 years in a Nova Scotia prison for a first-degree murder charge he did not commit. His case prompted a 16,000 page paper from a royal commision accusing the judges, prosecution and police of racism and miscarriage of justice. Jones, too, had a friend who was wrongly convicted and spent 17 years in prison; legal aid refused to take on his case. Drawing inspiration from Marshall’s case, she wrote a poem that denounced the Canadian courts’ assertion of justice. Eventually, Jones’ friend was found not guilty and released.
Jones then discussed juries, which are meant to render unbiased and impartial verdicts. Their job is to rely solely on the facts and arguments presented by both the plaintiff and defendant. She then read a poem which challenges the impartiality of all white juries when a person of colour is on trial. “One white, two white, all white jury,” the poem goes, bringing to light the inherent racial bias that was harboured in a group of 12 white people convicting an innocent Black man.
Jones believes that her greatest success is the attention she and others brought to the case of Abdul Abdi. Abdi arrived to Canada as a refugee with his sister when he was six years old. They became wards of the state, went through 31 foster homes, and were never granted citizenship. In his late teens, Abdi committed aggravated assault and was convicted to four years in prison. After serving his time, Abdi was detained by immigration and prepared for deportation. Because he never applied for Canadian citizenship, he was still a refugee and was subject to deportation after committing a crime. The courts blamed Abdi for not applying for citizenship, despite him being a child with no knowledge of the proper procedure when he first arrived. Jones helped fight the case alongside a lawyer and members of Black Canada, a group which aims to support people of colour. “We have to outwork them; that’s all we have,” she said of the Canadian Government.

Protest and Strike Against Unpaid Internships
More than 58,000 students across the province of Quebec went on strike this week, demanding that they be paid for their labour. A regional protest was organized in downtown Montreal by student associations on Wednesday November 21. Both Cégep and University organizations participated, with contingents from Cégep Marie-Victorin, Cégep du Vieux – Montreal, and Cégep St-Laurent, UQAM, Université De Montréal, and McGill’s Social Work Student Association. Other protests were also organized in Sherbrooke and Gatineau on the same day. 
Isabelle, a student in Social Work at UQAM, present at Wednesday’s protest, also echoed this message of inter-institutional solidarity: “we can see it today, as we’re all meeting at the same place and walking together for the same objective, I think that it’s very stimulating.” Isabelle believes the issue of unpaid labour to be a feminist one, a sentiment echoed by many others at the protest. The areas of work subject to mandatory unpaid internships often fall in the sector of care, a traditionally feminized and devalued area of labour. As many protesters asserted, expecting students to work in care sectors for free further perpetuates this notion. Student groups representing areas of study where unpaid internships are mandatory have been organizing against unpaid internships for some time. McGill’s Social Work Students Association (SWSA) has been actively working in collaboration with other social work students at UQAM and UdeM since the winter semester of last year. Vincent Mousseau, VP internal of SWSA, told the Daily that mobilization has not been easy. SWSA has encountered a strong resistance from the administration. Mousseau said they believe these attitudes to be a “complete disregard for the mobilization efforts of students, and the academic freedom of their own professors.” After professors in the School of Social Work voted to cancel their classes in support of the strike, the administration ordered them to continue holding their classes. Mousseau stressed how important it was for SWSA to be working in solidarity with students from other establishments. “There is a legacy of student protest in Quebec that has, for a long time, been regulated to the francophone spheres of postsecondary education,” they said. “A lot of the work that SWSA has been doing over the past couple of years has been to attempt to bridge the language gap between us, and to situate social work students at McGill in our communities (and thus in Quebec). We have been welcomed with open arms by francophone students, who are happy to see that these issues are finally traversing the linguistic barriers. I think it is clear that we can do so much more together than we can do individually.”

International News for the Week of Nov 26
Anti-Muslim Concentration Camps in China
content warning: concentration camps, Islamophobia, racism, religious persecution
On November 14, American legislators introduced bills in the House and Senate that aim to put pressure on the Trump administration to condemn Chinese detention camps. These camps currently house up to one million Uighur Muslims, as well as other Chinese Muslims. The legislation would impose sanctions targeting the sale of Chinese goods, but have no direct impact on individual members of the Chinese government. Canada, France, Germany, and other countries have written to the Communist Party leader of Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, asking him to explain the detention camps. 
In response to accusations of massive internment camps in Xinjiang, a western region of China, a Chinese Communist Party official said, “there is no arbitrary detention. […] There is no such a thing as re-education centers.” 
However, over one million ethnic Uighur Muslims are being detained in what the government presents as “re-education schools,” aimed at “combating religious extremism” through legal theory and language learning. Abdusalam Muhemet, who was arrested in 2014, describes the facility in which he was detained as “not a place for getting rid of extremism, [but] a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.” 
Roughly one tenth of the Uighur population of Xinjiang has been sent to these camps. These detentions target Muslim minority members exclusively. These camps are a result of a crackdown on the Uighur Muslim minority that has grown in the past four years, including a broader context of policies to erase, or at least conceal, Uighur Muslim identity in China. 
Legislation prohibits wearing headscarves and long beards, as well as religious instruction. Islamic-sounding names have also been banned. Uighur Muslims face extremely strict travel restrictions and have to relinquish their passports to authorities for “safe-keeping.” Specific prohibitions further target Uighur government officials, who are prohibited from practicing Islam. The expansion of security services and surveillance in Xinjiang have been described by BBC News as “some of the most restrictive and comprehensive security measures ever deployed by a state against its own people.” 
Wildfires in California 
Over 1,000 people remain missing and at least 81 have died as a result of recent California wildfires. Recovery crews in Paradise, California, are still searching for victims, while disaster relief organizations have set up sites for crisis relief. 
The fires in northern California, considered to be the deadliest in the state’s history, erupted on November 8, causing thousands to flee their homes. An estimated 13,000 homes and another 15,000 buildings have been destroyed. 
In addition to work by disaster and recovery crews, firefighting efforts have been underway for several weeks. Civilian firefighters have been joined by over 200 prisoners in California’s Conservation Camp program. Inmates are compensated $1.45 a day on average. California has a longstanding history of relying on its prison population to assist with firefighting, dating back to World War II. It is estimated that 40 per cent of firefighters are inmates from these working programs. 
Private firefighters have been employed by insurance companies and celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, to salvage expensive homes in the area. The use of private firefighting services, in contrast to the use of prison labour to quell fires, has called into question how divisions of labour exacerbate inequalities in the face of natural disasters. 
Rain storms this past week have brought deadly “Camp Fire” close to containment after several weeks of burning. With some relief, authorities are pushing evacuees out of tent cities, telling them to seek refuge in shelters that are already full. However the struggle is not over yet as the rainfall is also warranting flash flood advisories for about one million people in the area of Paradise.
