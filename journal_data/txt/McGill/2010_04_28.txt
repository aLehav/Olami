Set to open fall 2011, Courtyard Marriott will be converted to student housing
McGill has bought the Courtyard Marriott at 410 Sherbrooke O. to convert into student housing for fall 2011.
A member of the Board of Governors – the University’s highest governing body – as well as Doug Sweet, director of McGill’s Media Relations Office, confirmed the purchase.
The Marriott will join converted hotels New Residence Hall and Carrefour Sherbrooke, opened fall 2009.
The financial details of the transaction are currently unavailable. According to the most recent municipal evaluation, from 2007, the property was worth $11.4 million.
An official announcement from the University is rumored to be scheduled for tomorrow, when the hotel is also set to stop its current operations.
