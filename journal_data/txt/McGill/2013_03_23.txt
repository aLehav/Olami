The culture of impunity for senior staff at hospitals affiliated with McGill is putting patients at risk, according to Dr. Alexander Nataros, a first-year family medicine resident at Saint Mary’s hospital.
In November 2012, Nataros, who is currently on a forced paid leave of absence, received a patient after senior doctors made what he said were “significant life-threatening medical errors.” Nataros, who says he rectified these errors, and thereby saved the patient’s life, is now under fire for questioning his supervisors’ actions.
“As the junior doctor receiving the crashing patient, I acted as needed […] The tertiary hospital which received this patient on transfer recognized the corrective actions I took, as well as the senior doctors’ significant errors that threatened this patient’s life,” Nataros wrote to The Daily by email.
As a medical resident, Nataros, who received his medical degree from McGill in 2012, must work under the supervision of a fully licensed doctor at the hospital he works at. However, Nataros and other residents have experienced humiliation when asking questions of their supervisors, enough that this discourages open communication. This is detrimental pedagogically and negatively affects patient care.
“It’s a shame because there is definitely a culture that discourages medical students and residents from questioning or disagreeing with the decisions of their supervisors. Someone in a position of power can so easily shame and embarrass you if they feel their authority challenged due to the breadth of information in the medical field. It’s the exception to the rule, but it doesn’t take long to become socialized into the fear, and unfortunately there are no really valid avenues to go about removing these individuals from teaching,” another family medicine resident at McGill, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily by email.
McGill is not alone in having allegations against them that they treat their medical residents, who are the first point of contact for most patients that come through the hospital, as subordinates.
“Medical education,” wrote Dr. Pauline Chen in the New York Times in February, “[is] a process often likened to military and religious training, with elder patriarchs imposing the hair shirt of shame on acolytes unable to incorporate a profession’s accepted values and behaviours.”
Nataros, who says that his life is devoted to treating his patients, was put on academic probation in January by Dean of Postgraduate Medical Education Dr. Sarkis Meterissian after receiving two negative evaluations from his supervisors. These negative evaluations were based on perceptions that Nataros was argumentative.
However, many doctors who have worked with Nataros wrote to Meterissian saying that they believed that his standing up to authority was for patient safety. The authors of these letters, however, wished to remain anonymous, fearing the effect that publishing them would have on their careers.
The authors of the character references portray Nataros as a doctor who cares deeply for his patients. They cite Nataros’ commitment to social advocacy, including previous work he carried out with institutions such as the Red Cross and his position as Oxfam Canada’s national youth director. One of the references mentions that Nataros is only willing to challenge authority when his patients are threatened.
Nataros believes that senior staff at McGill affiliated hospitals who feel threatened by residents are trying to distract people from their medical errors by launching personal attacks on them.
McGill’s residency program is currently undergoing a periodic accreditation by the Collège des Médecins du Québec (CMQ), which ensures that the hospitals are properly educating residents. Failing accreditation would mean that McGill would be put on probation and need to undergo further reviews.
Nataros, who is vocal about the problems with McGill’s residency program, was told he was not allowed to be at the meeting with the accreditors due to his academic probation, even though other residents were required to be there.
Nataros’ case has been put in front of the CMQ, which grants residents their license. The outcome of this case will determine whether Nataros will be allowed back into his residency program, however, Nataros says he has not yet been given the chance to tell the CMQ his side of the story.
Nataros hopes he can return to Saint Mary’s soon. “I love Saint Mary’s. It’s what the future of medicine looks like – putting primary care first. I just want to be allowed to return to serve my patients,” he told The Daily by phone.
Citing confidentiality concerns, Meterissian declined requests for an interview.

Approximately 200 demonstrators kettled
 
A demonstration held to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the largest march of last year’s student strike ended quickly on Friday evening with police kettling. More than 200 protesters were issued tickets for $637.
The demonstration began at Place Émilie-Gamelin at 6:20 p.m. Protesters were blocked by police from marching east on Ste. Catherine, and so started to march east on Maisonneuve. The march was soon declared illegal under municipal by-law P-6, which requires protesters to give the route for large assemblies to police over 24 hours in advance.
Within minutes after the announcement, the police split the group of protesters and kettled two groups, each containing approximately fifty protesters. Others managed to evade capture by running through a mall, darting into stores, or running westwards on Maisonneuve.
Police escorted people from the kettles to a series of STM buses where they were detained, ticketed, and subsequently released.
The mass crackdown by the police is in stark contrast to last year’s protest, which saw over 200,000 students come out to  demonstrate against tuition hikes imposed by the Liberal government. That demonstration saw no arrests, injuries, or violence.
This year, students have taken to the streets again to protest the Parti Québécois’ (PQ) new plan to index tuition to inflation. At the education summit on February 26, the PQ announced that they would increase tuition by 3 per cent annually.
Since then, there have been weekly demonstrations, which have all been quickly declared illegal, and have all ended in mass arrests.
The past few weeks have seen a rise in the number of controversial policing techniques. The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) now often immediately resorts to kettling, a tactic that sees mass amounts of demonstrators – and sometimes bystanders – detained for long periods of time.

All referendum questions pass
Correction appended March, 23
Katie Larson was elected as SSMU President for the 2013-14 academic year with 59.5 per cent against Chris Bangs’ 40.5 per cent Friday evening. Larson is the former president of the Music Undergraduate Students’ Association (MUSA) and the current faculty representative to SSMU Council.
The voter turnout for this year’s SSMU elections was 29.1 per cent.
Larson ran her campaign on initiatives to promote the health and wellness of McGill’s undergraduate community, and an effective representation of the student body. Regarding the election results, Larson said, “I am excited…. Everyone has been working very hard on their campaigns for the last few weeks.”
“I am so exhausted… but it probably means I [campaigned] right… and it paid off,” she continued.
Bangs, whose platform included the transparency of administrative investments, confronted controversy regarding his involvement in last year’s student strikes. He faced accusations of deleting questions regarding the disruption of an English class from his campaign Facebook page.
The position of VP Clubs & Services went to music student Stefan Fong with 88.5 per cent approval. He ran unopposed and received 11.5 per cent ‘No’ votes.
Joint Honours History and Political Science student Samuel Harris, who ran a platform on bridging the gap between McGill and the wider Montreal community, also won with 89.3 per cent approval. Though he was unopposed, he received 10.7 per cent of ‘No’ votes.
On the election results, Harris commented that he was content with the newly elected SSMU Executive team. “Of course, to be perfectly honest, I had had my preferences, but I am willing to work with whoever is [elected],” he added.
Harris, who has been an active follower of the Table de Concertation Étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) discussions, looks to strengthen McGill’s ties with the Milton-Parc communities, and extend the inter-university discussions through workshops and new initiatives.
Political Science and Philosophy student Joey Shea claimed 52.1 per cent for the position of VP University Affairs, over International Development student Sam Gregory. Gregory, whose platform was similar to that of Shea, ran a close race with 47.9 per cent of the vote.
Current Arts Undergraduates’ Society (AUS) VP External Affairs Brian Farnan claimed the position for VP Internal with 51.8 per cent of the votes, beating fellow candidate Julia Kryluk by a slim margin of 3.6 per cent.
Economics and Finance student Tyler Hofmeister was elected as VP Finance and Operations with 71.7 per cent of the votes, beating Thomas Kim, who received 28.3 per cent of the vote. Coming into this position, Hofmeister will have to confront the prolonged problems of lease negotiations for the Shatner building and the impact on SSMU’s budget for the 2013 – 14 academic year.
“I am ecstatic,” Hofmeister said in his brief interview with The Daily.
“This is what I have been working really hard for the past two weeks…. I think this is going to be a great year. I’ve known Katie [Larson] and Brian [Farnan] for a long time…. It’s unfortunate that I won’t be working with Sam [Gregory] as much as I would have liked to, but I think this is going to be a great year and a great team,” he continued.
Referendum questions regarding the increase of the athletics fee and the student services ancillary fees passed and both fees will now be indexed to inflation. The questions regarding the creation of a McGill Writing Centre, the creation of a SSMU equity fund, and the SACOMSS fee renewal also passed.
