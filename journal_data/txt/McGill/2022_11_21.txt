COCQ-SIDA and other organizations co-sign letter in response to Montreal’s opioid crisis
The decriminalization of psychoactive drugs is gaining significant interest across North America. However, decriminalization in Quebec, where there is a high drug-induced death rate, is still highly debated. From January 2019 to June 2022, 1,258 deaths by opioid overdose were reported, with a 25 per cent spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. Illicit drugs are now responsible for an average of one and a half fatal overdoses each day. With evidence that the current strategy is failing to tackle the opioid crisis, there is pressure on the provincial government for an urgent reassessment of the situation and a new approach to drug addiction. 
In an open letter published on October 31 in La Presse and co-signed by 30 other organizations, the Coalition des organismes communautaires Québécois de lutte contre le SIDA (COCQ-SIDA), an organization fighting against HIV/AIDS, urges the city of Montreal to request an exemption on the possession of narcotics from the federal government. They address the failure of the criminalization of drugs as a strategy to reduce the ongoing opioid crisis. The history of drug control in Canada has been characterized by harsh prohibitionist policies, which eventually led to the association of addiction with criminality. By the mid-1990s, opposition movements emerged in response to Canada’s criminalization of substance use and identified the unintended consequences of such policies. Harm Reduction TO, a harm reduction advocacy group in Toronto, argues that mass incarceration illustrates the government’s failure in addressing the public health outcomes generated  by substance use. Drugs have historically been criminalized to disempower marginalized and racialized groups, for whom prohibitionist policies are disproportionately harmful. Moreover, prohibition has accelerated the development of synthetic drugs by clandestine laboratories. The lack of governmental control over the production of narcotics has thus led to the widespread distribution and consumption of fatal synthetic drugs. For instance, Nitazene (or Tonis) was identified in Quebec in 2019. Stronger than fentanyl, it has been deemed responsible for a significant number of overdoses in Montreal. Moreover, punishing drug use increases the stigma of addiction and restricts the options of people dependent on substance use for seeking help. 
Jurisdictions across Canada are starting to take action to address the inefficacy and harm of drug criminalization. In British Columbia, significant steps have been taken toward decriminalization and the adoption of  harm reduction policies. In response to a request from the province, the federal government has granted the province an exemption to the federal laws on drug possession, along with a three-year decriminalization plan. Applicable starting January 31, 2023, Canadians aged 18 and over will be able to possess up to a total of 2.5 grams of opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, and MDMA in BC. While the possession and consumption of those drugs remain illegal, there will be no arrests or charges for personal possession at or below the 2.5-gram threshold. This model has proven to be especially efficient in Portugal, which became the first country in the world to decriminalize the consumption of all drugs in 2001. Since then, the drug-induced death rate has dropped significantly, and it now stands at one-fiftieth of that of the United States. Overall drug use has also declined among the 15- to 24-year-old population. Mylène Drouin, Montreal’s Regional Director of Public Health, reported her motivation to implement such measures in Quebec as well in an interview with CBC, saying that “[decriminalization] could allow consumers to use drugs in much safer contexts and avoid all the prejudice associated with judicialization.” She blames Legault’s opposition to decriminalization for failing to represent Montreal’s public interest. She therefore supports the community’s initiative in calling for change at the municipal level. 
While Ottawa has expressed its openness to discuss decriminalization with provinces, Legault’s opposition presents a significant obstacle in bringing changes to drug control policies in Quebec. Most efforts have been redirected to the municipal level in an attempt to reduce the high fatality rate recorded in Montreal. Montreal mayor Valérie Plante states, “We have shown interest in talking with the federal [government] because we’re seeing people struggling and suffering and we want to put the right tools together to support these people while making sure our communities are safe for everybody.” Thus, by addressing their letter to the Montreal administration, rather than the Quebec government, the coalition requests that the city itself use its powers in lobbying the federal government to bring about change, writing “We demand that Montreal act immediately by asking the federal government for an exemption from drug possession laws to better protect Montrealers and take a step towards a city without overdoses.”
While political pressure can be an efficient tool to implement structural and systemic change in Montreal, efforts can be made at every scale. Harm reduction is one of the ways in which community-based organizations are trying to promote safer drug use. Several supervised injection sites have been developed on the island. Take-home naloxone kits are also available at most pharmacies. Finally, if you are experiencing addiction or wish to help someone you know, harm-reduction resources and addiction treatments are available, as well as a 24/7 helpline.

Discussion about unpaid internships, fair working conditions, and democratization of the university
On November 16, SSMU’s External Affairs Office hosted a Town Hall on Accessible Education where representatives of various student groups came together to discuss the barriers students face at their respective universities, and how SSMU can better advocate on these issues on behalf of McGill’s student body. VP External Val Masny, who was facilitating, explained that although holding such events is part of SSMU’s mandate, it hadn’t been done for several years. However, they believed in the importance of holding such events once more given that many groups on campus are currently organizing around issues related to accessible education. Representatives from Divest McGill, McGill Law Students’ Association (LSA), Education Undergraduate Society of McGill (EDUS), and L’Association des étudiantes et étudiants de la Faculté des sciences de l’Éducation de l’UQAM (ADEESE) were present at the town hall.
Alicia Prosser, from ADEESE, started off by discussing its ongoing strike which began on October 13 in response to poor working conditions when doing mandatory work experience programs. They brought forth six demands: fair workload, commute time, flexible absences, a better harassment policy, accommodations for students with children, and paid internships, with a particular focus on the last three. Prosser explained that UQAM’s harassment policy only applies within the university and not where the internship takes place, leaving people who experience harassment while on an internship with few options to address it. ADEESE also believes that student parents should get priority when choosing internship locations to ensure that it’s close to a daycare. Finally, they argue that it’s unfair to ask students to work for free at internships that are essentially work experience.
After four weeks of striking and protest, the university agreed to listen to their demands. As a result, UQAM created committees for a better harassment policy and accommodations for student parents, and they intend to continue organizing for paid internships. Prosser considers the strikes worth the effort, as they brought forth a lot of changes and helped to further democracy at UQAM. She encourages other students to do the same, adding that larger numbers will create a bigger statement.
Next to speak were Justin Liao and Anna Leung, EDUS VP Academics and VP Finance respectively. Like at UQAM, they explained that education undergraduate students at McGill aren’t fairly compensated for the work experiences they complete as part of their degree. Although EDUS has not yet mobilized for paid internships, they’re looking to develop a financial aid framework to offset some of the costs incurred with completing these mandatory field experiences. For example, Liao explained that transportation can be very costly as students are often placed very far away from where they live. He added that students have other responsibilities such as jobs, classes, and children, and field experiences often take up over 40 hours per week, with students being expected to take on the majority of the cooperating teacher’s work for none of the pay. Leung said that the recent strikes at UQAM resonated with the EDUS, which inspired them to push for increased financial aid. Although none of the current EDUS council would reap the benefits of these changes, they want to push for these reforms so that future education students can succeed.
After EDUS, Emily Thom, VP External of the LSA discussed the proposed Quebec Bar School reform, which would require law students to undertake more unpaid internships in order to complete their degree. Thom said that since law students often come into the program with prior degrees, they already have a lot of student debt. As it’s already difficult to make money while in school, mandatory unpaid internships would add additional challenges. Laura Doyle Péan, a law student present, added that this change would discourage students from pursuing more social-justice-oriented careers in law, as corporate jobs have higher salaries which makes paying off student debt easier. 
Masny presented a statement from the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) who weren’t able to attend the Town Hall. The statement focused on financial precarity among grad students, who often rely on grants and awards to fund their research. However, the funding offered doesn’t account for inflation and rising cost of living, and many graduate students have an income below the poverty line. They are requesting standardized funding processes and regulations across the university and a transparent process for resolving funding issues.
The last group present was Divest McGill, represented by Emily Hardie and Carley Dove-McFalls. Divest McGill has existed for almost ten years, and are planning actions to ‘celebrate’ their anniversary, including a collective scream in front of the James Administration Building and a Divest Birthday Party with free food and dancing. Divest McGill’s campaign revolves around divestment, democratization, and decolonization, particularly the democratization of the Board of Governors who refuse to divest from fossil fuels. In November 2021, they formed the Democratize McGill coalition alongside Queer McGill, Socialist Fightback at Concordia and McGill, McGill Corporate Accountability Project, and the Protestors Legal Information Clinic. During their two-week occupation of the Arts Building this year, they held three General Assemblies attended by more than 50 people, where they discussed what they wanted to see with regards to democratization. This includes the democratization of the Board of Governors, but also of other institutions such as student-led bodies, student housing, and food services, ultimately promoting community control over the University’s resources.
“At the centre of all these issues is the university’s undemocratic structure, which is what this campaign is trying to get people to realize,” explained Hardie. She also expressed frustration at the internal advocacy structures within McGill, saying that their bureaucratic nature forces groups to resort to protests and strikes to get what they need. Masny added that the Board of Governors can override decisions made by the democratically-elected Senate, another reason why groups may turn to alternate advocacy methods. Finally, they also argued that free tuition would reduce many financial burdens and make education more accessible to everyone, echoing the demands of the 2012 student strike.

McGill’s first faculty union certified by the Tribunal after facing resistance from university
On November 7, 2022, the Association of McGill Professors of Law (AMPL) was certified as McGill’s first faculty union by the Tribunal adminsitratif du travail. The AMPL represents 40 tenured and tenure-track professors at the Faculty of Law. They first petitioned the Tribunal for certification in November 2021, but sources say many of their grievances with the administration began years ago.
In an interview with the Daily, AMPL Interim President Evan Fox-Decent revealed that his “first inkling that [unionizing] might be something that’s appropriate was when we lost our pension or the kind of pension that we had.” All other universities in Montreal offer a defined benefit (DB) pension plan, which guarantees a set income for employees in retirement. McGill offers a defined contributions (DC) plan where retirement incomes are dependent on investments in the stock market. 
According to a 2011 newsletter by the McGill Association of University Teachers, until 2009, McGill offered a hybrid pension plan which primarily relied on returns on investment, but had a pension fund that would make up the difference if retirement incomes fell below the minimum defined in the plan. Fox-Decent explained that McGill professors essentially received “70 per cent of the income that [they] had earned during the last five years [..] as is standard in the public service, as is standard across all universities in Quebec.” 
Employees hired from 2009 onwards moved to a pure DC plan, where retirement incomes are now fully tied to the stock market. Fox-Decent said that the market “generally, odds on, does well. But sometimes it doesn’t. And when you have a crash and a third or half of the value is lost, it can take five to ten years to recover if it’s recovered at all.” 
This decision was made with no consultation or discussion with faculty members, causing Fox-Decent and other faculty members to question the way they are organized. Fox-Decent described that “for many of my colleagues, this has been a long time coming due to what they feel is a creeping centralization of the delivery of the academic mission of the various faculties in McGill.”
What Fox-Decent called the “bale of hay that broke the camel’s back” was the administration’s response to the vast majority of the law faculty’s request to require proof of vaccination for those returning to campus last fall. The only response from the Office of the Provost was a memo that encouraged chairs and deans to inform the Office of the Provost of faculty members who wished to teach from home. It stated that “fear about campus safety, residing in another jurisdiction, or concern about relatives who might be at heightened risk or exposure to COVID-19, including those living under the same roof” are not valid reasons to teach remotely. 
These conditions led Fox-Decent and his colleagues to decide that they would like to have more control over their workplace and work on the basis of a collective agreement rather than one-on-one negotiations. Collective agreements govern the conditions of work for a group of employees, and result from bargaining between an employer and a union. They are revisited every few years to better represent the current needs and concerns of the employees. 
Kiersten van Vliet, Mobilization Officer of the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), expressed the value of a collective bargaining position in an interview with the Daily: “It is much easier for McGill to negotiate with an individual rather than a collective. Collective negotiations are hard and they take a lot of resources. There’s a potential in that period when somebody is negotiating collectively that they could withhold their labor or they could have other sort of mobilization tactics.” 
According to Fox-Decent, the AMPL strives to use their bargaining position to “contribute to the mission of the university. Most of the time, our interests and the university’s interests are aligned, but we would just like to have a firmer say in the development of policy.” 
Van Vliet agreed that unions can align with the university’s interests, stating that “unions can actually make the workplace better for everybody.” AGSEM’s demands are “very focused on what would improve pedagogy, on what would improve teaching conditions, on what would improve learning conditions.” Van Vliet added that “if an employer is open to it, it doesn’t have to be adversarial […] But my concern from my experiences with McGill unionizing, negotiating, and in labor relations is that McGill is not necessarily ready to take that step.” 
This was proven by McGill’s decision to immediately pursue litigation after the AMPL petitioned the Tribunal for certification in November 2021. According to the Tribunal Decision Transmission, McGill’s argument was that the AMPL “does not take into account the converging interests of another group of employees that the Association is attempting to divide and the history of labour relations at the University.” Instead, they proposed a unit representing “all tenure-track or tenured faculty members of McGill University.”
Van Vliet explained that in order to unionize in Quebec, “you need 50 percent plus one of that group of workers to say ‘yes, I want that union’.” This threshold was surpassed by the AMPL in their 51-person faculty, but would become much more difficult with all 1744 McGill professors. McGill has used similar tactics with AGSEM, “changing the lists, changing the groups of employees that are included or not included, or what could count or not count,” currently demonstrated by AGSEM’s campaign to unionize Teaching Support workers such as graders or tutors who do similar work to teaching assistants, but are not protected by a collective agreement.
Due to the fact that there is no existing professors’ union, the court declared that “the Tribunal did not have the necessary demonstration that this unit cannot in any way serve as a basis for establishing collective labour relations.” The ruling was highly in favor of the AMPL. Fox-Decent reported that “we literally ran the table five for five, with the judge saying that not only did we meet the threshold, but in many cases, we far surpassed it.”
McGill is currently weighing whether or not to challenge the decision of the Tribunal through judicial review. Fox-Decent discouraged further litigation, arguing that it is “quite literally inconceivable that a reviewing court would set aside the decision of the tribunal.” He has “encouraged [his] friends in the administration to prepare for collective bargaining.”
The question remains as to whether other McGill faculties might follow the AMPL’s example. Fox-Decent noted that the judgment from the Tribunal suggests that “there are materials there that could be helpful for colleagues who may wish to organize either as individual faculties, as multiple faculties together, or potentially, McGill itself.”
“It’s amazing in terms of a type of building block,” van Vleit said. “If we think of the history of labor organizing on campus, like with AGSEM: you have one union that can lead to other groups of employees getting them.” 
Both Fox-Decent and van Vleit encouraged students to get involved with their own unions. “I think probably the most important thing for students to do is to support their student union that is authorized to represent them collectively,” Fox-Decent expressed. “And so when the student union asks you to go out for a march, for a protest, take part in an action to support them where you find your conscience allows you to do so.”
Many McGill student positions are unionized. “Know your union, know your contract, know your rights,” van Vleit urged. “If you want to be a part of a union, talk to your fellow workers, because that’s where it starts, right? It’s workers sharing their experiences and coming to the conclusion that if they work together, they will improve the conditions for everybody. And it just starts with a conversation.”
