McGill alumni working in Nigeria and the DRC discuss progress, challenges, and the role of Canada
On Tuesday morning the Canadian High Commissioner to Nigeria and the ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo gave an informal talk to a small group of McGill students and faculty at the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.
Professor Tim Johns from the McGill School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition hosted the event in association with the African Studies Student Association.
The diplomats – both McGill graduates – discussed the progress of the two countries, as well as Canada’s role in their futures. High Commissioners are senior diplomats who act as ambassadors between Commonwealth countries like Canada, Nigeria, and other former British colonies.
Chris Cooter, the High Commissioner in Nigeria, said that Canada characterizes Nigeria as a “strategic partner.” He praised Nigeria’s economic sector for the progress made outside of the lucrative oil industry.
“The oil sector, you could say, is the drag of the economy,” said Cooter, “It’s corrupted the politically elite [and] its prevented investment in other sectors.”
Last year in new industries, such as information technology, Nigeria saw a 9 per cent economic growth.
Cooter described Nigeria as “a crucible of regional trends,” playing an important role as an indicator in the continent, particularly in terms of urbanization and Muslim-Christian relations.
“It’s the only country I’m aware of where you have an even divide of such large Christian and Muslim populations. The way that they interact and don’t interact is really important beyond Nigeria,” he said.
Regarding the future of Nigeria, Cooter said, “As the World Bank told me the other day, it’s not a question of if, but when, it emerges as an economic and political giant.”
However despite hopes for progress, however, Cooter noted problems that still exist. “Nigeria could be a star that never quite rises,” he said. Cooter discussed the continued impunity of violence and corruption, increasing elements of fundamentalism, some of the worst socioeconomic indicators in Africa, and the existence of a political class “only interested in itself.”
Sigrid Anna Johnson, the Canadian ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), focused on a single aspect that could allow the Congo to lift itself out of years of turmoil and civil war.
“Congo has enough arable land to produce for one billion people,” said Johnson, “They are a very powerful country in terms of agri-food yet they’re importing food – they cannot produce enough food for themselves. It’s illogical.”
Johnson emphasized the importance of food production, and building roads. “When you have roads built, you have traffic, you have trade, and you have security,” she said.
Johnson also spoke about the importance of stopping the impunity of rape.
Though the rate of rapes in the country is decreasing – Lieutenant-Colonel Kibibi Mutware and eight Congolese soldiers were sentenced in February for over 60 rapes in the country – the priority towards ending the impunity of rape and violence is at the forefront of Canada’s relationship with the DRC.
“The rapes are not only against women; they are against men, children, the elderly. It’s terrible,” she said, “The Canadian government is very invested in this; they are spending millions.”
Despite facing challenges of various degrees of severity, the DRC has enjoyed recent stability and success in terms of macro-economic progress. Its inflation is under 10 per cent, the country’s exchange rate stabilized, and the central bank was able to build reserve. The International Monetary Fund was “so impressed” by the DRC that in June 2010 the IMF cancelled the country’s debt to commemorate fifty years since colonial rule ended in the country and mark its recent success – though the DRC will still be required to pay interest.
The largest country in the Francophonie, the DRC will host the organization’s summit meeting in 2012, something Johnson identified as “a sign of a country trying to emerge politically, and on the international scene.”

New Brunswick budget cuts could affect student loan repayment program
Fredericton, N.B. — Students rallied Tuesday against possible tuition increases and further cuts to post-secondary education in New Brunswick.
Approximately 250 to 300 students marched from the campuses of St. Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick to the provincial legislature, where they gathered near the steps to voice their concerns.
“The students united will never be defeated,” the crowd chanted as they waved posters and placards. Some read “Defenders of public education,” and “Fight tuition fees.”
The march and protest were organized by the St. Thomas University Students’ Union (STUSU), with help of the student group Unite.
Ella Henry, STUSU president, said student unions from across the province are meeting with New Brunswick Minister of Post-Secondary Education, Training, and Labour, Martine Coulombe on Wednesday to discuss funding.
“We don’t want to see cuts in [university] operating funding,” Henry said. “We’d like to see the tuition freeze maintained and investments in student financial aid, [and] some restructuring of programs, like the Timely Completion Benefit, so that the money is getting to the students who need it.”
Coulombe appeared on the legislature steps near the end of the rally to assure the crowd that student leaders will continue to be involved in budget consultations.
“I hear you,” she said.
“Then do something about it,” shouted back Colin Belyea, a third-year St. Thomas student from St. John, New Brunswick, who says he’s incurred about $25,000 worth of debt in his three years at university.
Protesters interrupted Cou-lombe throughout her megaphone address with cries for affordable education, while others hurled obscenities.
A freeze on tuition fees in the province is set to expire when the provincial budget is handed down this month, and student leaders in the province aren’t optimistic it will be renewed.
Last month, the government announced more than $3 million in cuts to post-secondary education, mainly aimed at the Repayment Assistance Plan, a program that gives loan repayment relief to former student borrowers based on monthly student loan payments, how much a former borrower earns, their family situation and how much money they owe in total.
A department spokesman said the cuts were a result of low program uptake and lower than expected interest rates.
The cuts are also a part of the Progressive Conservative campaign promise to reduce government spending by one per cent.
Members of Strax, a social justice student group, and the New Brunswick Federation of Labour (NBFL) also took part in the demonstration. Strax said in a media statement that the burden of debt forces students to overwork themselves in order to pay for their education.
“How could a real education be possible, one which requires critical reflection, if we must work twenty hours per week while we study?” the statement asks.
Alex Bailey, the NBFL’s vice-president for youth, said one way to offset the rising cost of education is to raise minimum wage in the province.
“Young students are also young workers,” said Bailey. “Students can’t pay their fees because wages are low.”

Montreal-based Moroccans ask for constitutional reform
This article has been modified to reflect corrections.
There has been another uprising in the Maghreb, but it has been less publicized than most.
On Sunday, about 25 Moroccan children, students, and older community members gathered in front of the Moroccan consulate on René-Lévesque to reprimand the regime of King Mohammed VI, in subdued solidarity with their compatriots. Despite the perception of a repressive and scrutinizing Moroccan government, there has been a dearth of public and media interest relative to the attention garnered by similar protests in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
One woman on Sunday held a sign that read in French, “We want a Morocco without tyranny.”
An older protester, who identified himself as Assou and has lived in Canada for 11 years, emphasized that the Moroccan youth were fuelling the political uprising in his home country, and that the basic grievances were poverty and unemployment.
“We have assembled here in solidarity with the youth of Morocco, who have mobilized around the 20 février movement,” Assou said in French.
February 20 marks the day that Moroccans took to the streets for the first organized movement against a centuries-old monarchy, according to a 22-year-old international law student who withheld her name due to fear of reprisals.
The student said she has not seen “any city that didn’t go [protest], which is interesting for a country like Morocco, which has been silent for a very long time.”
She attributed the small numbers of demonstrators in Montreal to the fact that many Moroccan immigrants in Canada belong to a financially comfortable upper class. She added that ten large families control the economy and government back in Morocco.
Moroccans are demanding constitutional reform that would see the king relinquish his sacred title and the institution of parliamentary democracy, as in England or Spain. As it stands now, Moroccans cannot question his authority. They are also asking for a new prime minister and the liberation of all political prisoners.
The student gave the example of Ali Lamrabet – the only qualified international Moroccan journalist – whose ten-year ban on practicing his profession ends in 2015.
Royalty is cultural in Morocco – the King is said to have descended from the prophet and as such, is designated to be the commander of all believers.
Morocco has been pursuing an economic stimulus program with the aid of the IMF, World Bank, and Paris Club creditors, but the student claimed that the existence of a “Ministry of Palaces” demonstrates a blatant misallocation of public funds.
At press time, the Facebook group for the 20 février movement had over 31,000 members – most of whom participate in discussions under false names, according to the student.
Though largely peaceful, protests in Morocco have also witnessed self-immolation.
“A woman burnt herself two days ago,” said the student. “She left behind two kids. I have heard of five other such attempts,” she added.
An estimated 15,000 have been in the streets since February 20 but have been repressed by the police through mass arrests and kidnappings. The government claims that the Polisario – the UN-recognized national liberation front for the Western Sahara – is at the root of this public movement, according to the student.
The student also said she knew of a friend who spent two nights in jail because she was accused of being a Spanish spy.
“There have been over 200 arrests this past week. People with PhDs are sleeping in front of ministries, asking for their basic right to work. They are the brains of the country – how could you say they are betraying the country?” she asked.
In the original version of this article, the source was quoted as saying that Ali Lamrabet’s prison sentence ends in 2015, when in fact a state ban on his practise of journalism will expire in 2015. The student spoke anonymously because of fear of reprisals, not necessarily threats from the Moroccan government, as originally indicated.
The Daily regrets the errors.

Multiple projects in residence continuing beyond scheduled deadline
Students living in McGill’s Carrefour Sherbrooke residence are mobilizing against construction projects that have been ongoing since the beginning of the fall semester. The students claim that noise and other resulting disturbances have compromised their living conditions, and have communicated their discontent to McGill Residences and Student Housing.
These complaints primarily concern roof construction. However, Carrefour’s construction projects throughout the academic year have also included renovations to the lobby, front desk, entrance, and cafeteria.
Students living in the former 4 Points hotel described the daily disturbances caused by the various constructions projects.
“There was drilling on the twentieth [floor], and it could be heard down to the 12th floor, although there was drilling on the eleventh, again, that could be heard down to the seventh floor,” said Julie Browne, a Carrefour Sherbrooke resident who is leading the efforts to voice students’ concerns.
“As far as the construction workers are concerned it’s just another job, or, like another site – it’s not a home,” added Madelaine Fromm, another Carrefour Sherbrooke resident.  “It’s not even the drilling, [it] is the people in the hallways, and the big machines outside.”
Students and parents expressed their discontent to Michael Porritt, the Executive Director of Residences and Student Housing, through emails and phone calls. Residents claim certain clauses of the lease, specifically regarding the peaceful enjoyment of the premises and the communication of maintenance or repairs, have been breached. Porritt maintained that the construction does not breach the lease.
“Roof work was not originally planned for this academic year,” said Porritt. “We had planned to wait until summer of 2011.”
Porritt explained that engineering estimates had suggested the roof and ventilation system in Carrefour should have been “fine” for the next two years.
“The choice was between fixing problems for eight months and having building-wide discomfort for eight months, or fix the roof earlier than we had planned and have a noise problem for a much shorter time.  Neither was a great option,” said Porritt.
In December 2010, the administration responded to complaints by giving each resident $350 in compensation as a token of appreciation for their patience.
“More students have expressed thanks than complaints in regards to the response to work requests and the work that was done in response to the original concerns,” Porritt said, explaining that the construction was in response to residents’ previous complaints.
“The heat problem would have become a cold problem,” said Porritt.
However, residents became more disgruntled as the roof construction continued after January 11. Porritt stated in an email to Carrefour residents in December 2010 that the roof construction would continue in January for ten working days in order to finish the project, and the process would be quieter than demolition of the old roof. Students claim construction has not ended, and that they were not informed in advance about the extended time frame.
Construction in the entrance to Carrefour has also continued past the projected deadline given to residents. The construction was to be completed February 27, however, the project is ongoing.
In a meeting between Porritt and concerned students last night, an agreement was reached to pay more money to residents of the floors affected by the construction. Johann Annisette, a Carrefour resident who attended the meeting, said Porritt was aware of the construction in the entrance going over the estimated end-date, and was trying to fix the situation.

Students discuss taking action against rising tuition in the U.K.
On February 18, students gathered in SSMU’s Lev Bukhman room for a Skype video conference with students from the London School of Economics (LSE) to discuss tuition hikes, protest tactics and student successes. Evident at the conference were similarities regarding the difficulties that students face when confronting university administration about fee increases.
Thousands of U.K. students have been protesting across Britain since the Conservative-led government announced plans to implement austerity measures late last year. These measures will raise the cap on tuition for U.K. universities to rise to £9,000. This is a three-fold increase on the current cap of £3,290 for students starting university full-time from October 2012.
Hero Austin, community and welfare sabbatical officer for the LSE Student Union, and Ryan Hickey, a Master’s student in Political Theory, discussed the efforts of the LSE students and faculty against tuition hikes.
They spoke of events that targeted the wider LSE student body, rather than only those involved in student activism. Events such as balloon drops and flashmob dances were used earlier in the year and were said to be particularly successful.
Austin explained that these activities engaged students who would not have been interested in participating in more radical activities, such as strikes and protests.
Speaking two weeks after the conference, organizer SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi, admitted that turn-out “wasn’t great” due to poor promotion and the upcoming reading week. She stated that this “made it less of a conference and more of a workshop” but maintained, “it was really needed.”
Students in Quebec have also been protesting proposed tuition hikes this year. Since 2007, the provincial government has increase tuition $100 per student per year, and students expect this number to increase even more when the five-year policy expires in 2012.
Both the provincial Finance Minister Raymond Bachand and Education Minister Line Beauchamp have called for a fee increase of approximately $500 per year for three years beginning in 2012, according to La Presse.
Although this is a far lower percentage increase than the one being forced upon students in the U.K., the atmosphere at the conference was that tuition hikes set a precedent that students must not accept.
“People say, ‘Well, this is okay, it’s just a little jump, whatever,’ but as soon as you surrender, there’s no limit to where they’ll go,” said Zaidi. “If you give up the right to education, if you can put a price on an education – whether it’s $100 or $10, 000 – you’ve lost a big fight.
“You’re accepting the rhetoric that…education is not a right, it’s an investment. … You’re removing the idea of education as being a social benefit and a societal institution. That’s what [universities] are supposed to be,” she added.
The proposed increase will also affect out-of-province students, whose tuition is comprised of the Quebec rate in addition to the out-of-province supplement.
“They [LSE students] realized that the bureaucratic way is not the way to get things done, and that now they had to do more direct action, as in going through civil society organization and grassroots organization,” said Zaidi. “And that was interesting because that’s what students have been trying here this year, and the government and the administration is not backing off.  So when you try everything, the only thing you have left is your sign and your voice to go outside and protest.”
Student groups at McGill protesting against the tuition hikes are using similar tactics to those employed at LSE.
U1 Arts student Robin Reid-Fraser attended the conference and is organizing the upcoming SSMU Mobilization Committee (Mob Squad) event “FlashMOB – Dancing Against Tuition Increases,” was inspired by the  discussed at the conference.
“Since the beginning of the year a number of us have been working on the issue of the coming tuition increases, and we’ve all been paying close attention to other student protests around the world,” Reid-Fraser said, “We had already talked about doing an action that would be quite visible in order to increase awareness on campus… After the video conference with the LSE students, we felt even more inspired and empowered, and the plan for the flashmob really started to come together.”
The flashmob is set to take place this afternoon in the Y intersection at 1p.m.

Quebec Minister of Education has yet to specify amount of penalty
Almost seven months after coming into office, Line Beauchamp Quebec minister of Education, announced in an interview with Le Devoir that McGill would face “financial consequences” for increasing tuition in their MBA program this year.
This week numerous media outlets confirmed Beauchamp’s intention to penalize the University for increasing tuition from approximately $2,000 a year to $29,500 a year for the two-year program. The announced tuition marks an increase of roughly 1,163 per cent.
“For us, it is not acceptable that a regular MBA sees such tuition fees,” said Beauchamp in the Devoir interview.
The provincial government has been threatening to punish McGill for the cost of its MBA program since the University made the announcement in the fall 2009.
Last spring, then-Minister of Education, Michelle Courchesne, threatened to cut McGill’s funding by $30,000 for every Quebec student registered in the program. She accused the University of violating Quebec’s educational accessibility policy.
The proposed penalty was based on two grants McGill receives annually from the provincial government – $19,000 to McGill’s general operating budget and $11,000 to the Desautels Faculty of Management – for each Quebec student registered in the MBA program. No concrete action was taken.
McGill Director of Media Relations Doug Sweet said the University has no comment on news reports related to the Quebec government’s position on the MBA tuition issue this week.
Since it announced the tuition increase, McGill has maintained that the increase will close a roughly $10,000 funding gap between what students pay and the cost of running the program. Formerly the MBA program was subsidized with tuition revenue from undergraduate programs.
The University also argues that the tuition increase will allow McGill to better compete with other elite private business schools like Harvard, where annual tuition is more than $50,000.
According to a CBC report, Beauchamp has requested a list of students registered in the MBA program in order to calculate financial penalties for the University. There are currently about 120 students in the MBA program.
SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi said that despite Beauchamp’s recent remarks, the minister has still not given enough information.
“I think she just wanted to answer to a lot of people’s concerns about what was happening with this, about whether this was a dead issue or not,” said Zaidi. “Right now they’re saying, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’ll still penalize the program. I just want to be clear about that. When? To what extent?” she asked.
Zaidi also expressed frustration over how long it has taken the provincial government to respond to the tuition increase. She pointed out that the government has not provided students registered in this year’s program sufficient financial support.
“I think it’s frustrating that they haven’t found a solution after all this time,” said Zaidi, “especially since we found out three weeks ago that Quebec students aren’t even receiving any governmental financial aid.”
Zaidi was skeptical that a financial penalty from the provincial government would result in McGill overturning their decision on MBA tuition hikes.
“Hopefully it will overturn their decision, however [McGill will] probably play again the victim of a lack of funding and the victim of under financing of universities,” she said.
The Dean of the Desautels Faculty of Management, Peter Todd, was traveling at the time of press and could not be reached for comment.
