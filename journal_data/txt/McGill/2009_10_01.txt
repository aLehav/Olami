Former death row inmate and Canadian lifer on parole speak at McGill
Juan Melendez, a man who spent 18 years wrongfully convicted of murder on Florida’s death row, and Michel Dunn, a Canadian lifer on parole, spoke to the McGill community Monday night at the Moot Court.
The event was co-coordinated by Innocence McGill, a student-led centre at McGill’s faculty of law that investigates “claims of wrongful conviction in the province of Quebec,” along with Amnesty International Quebec and the Association des services de réhabilitation sociale du Québec.
Melendez was born in Brooklyn, New York, raised in Puerto Rico, and returned to the U.S. as a migrant worker.  When he was arrested for homicide, he said he was “naive to the [English] language, naive to the law.” Like 95 per cent of death row inmates in the U.S., Melendez could not afford his own lawyer.
Melendez recalled that for many on death row, the only way to freedom was suicide. “I never saw my friends kill themselves because I can’t see through the walls…but I did see them bring bodies out,” he said. He also highlighted the lack of medical attention that the penal system offers its death row inmates.
“Why give the best medication to a person who’s condemned to death?” he asked.
In 2002, 17 years, eight months, and one day after his imprisonment, Melendez was released. The State of Florida gave him $100, a pair of pants, a shirt, and no public apology.
“I was saved in spite of the system,” Melendez said.
The Juan Melendez Voices United For Justice Project now works to prevent cases like Melendez’s from recurring – their ultimate goal being abolition of the death penalty.
During his speech, Dunn was also candid about his crime, and the life sentence he received.
“If the death penalty had existed in Canada I would not be here today…. I would not have had time to grieve and to see the suffering I caused,” Dunn said.
Since being released, Dunn has worked for Option-vie, a program run by ex-prisoners who work with inmates currently serving life sentences, which also helps integrate them back into their communities if they are paroled.
A representative of Amnesty  International noted that while the death penalty does not exist in Canada, the Conservative government still fails its citizens in the realm of criminal justice. He felt the government’s “case by case basis for defending citizens overseas, and failing to seek clemency” suggests that the government does not adequately protect its citizens.
The representative also cited the cases of Canadian citizens Ronald Allen Smith, on death row in the U.S., and Muhamed Kohail, awaiting a death sentence in Saudi Arabia.
Judi Caruso, the director of the Melendez Project, also explained what she sees as the racist underpinnings of the death penalty in the U.S.  In order to sit on the jury of a death penalty case, one must sign a statement that they are willing to sentence someone to death.
“Most Latinos and African Americans oppose the death penalty,” Caruso said. “Therefore they can’t even sit on the death-qualified jury.”

Superior Court Justice rules that Bil’in land dispute should be heard in Israel
On September 18, the Superior Court of Quebec dismissed a lawsuit brought against two Quebec-registered companies by the West Bank village of Bil’in. This lawsuit claimed that the two companies were complicit in Israeli war crimes.
In this first ever application of Canada’s War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Act to a civil case, Justice Louis-Paul Cullen’s judgment stated that it “would clearly be more practical to try the action in Israel rather than in Quebec.”
He also stated that the plaintiffs, the Bil’in Village Council, had not presented sufficient evidence to suggest that the case could not be heard in Israel in a fair and impartial manner.
The two Montreal-based companies, Green Park International Inc. and Green Mount International Inc., are both based in Montreal, and have been contracted to construct high-rise apartment buildings and houses in the Israeli settlement of Modi’in Illit, which is adjacent to the village of Bil’in.
The Bil’in Village Council disputes the companies’ claim to the land and insists that the construction of the settlement, as well as the surrounding security barrier, have cut them off from the bulk of their farmlands and olive groves.
Mark Arnold, the attorney who represented the Bil’in Village Council at the proceedings in mid-June, stated that Cullen’s ruling – a forum non conveniens in legal jargon – was “an error of law.”
“The Quebec Superior Court has jurisdiction over Quebec companies and directors who are residing in Quebec. To suggest that it goes to the Israeli High Court of Justice is simply an error,” said Arnold.
The plaintiffs moreover claimed that the two companies are complicit in Israel’s violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a signatory, and which states that in cases of military occupation, “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.”
“What that means in the Israel-Palestine context,” Arnold said, “is that Israel, the occupier of the West Bank, cannot be removing West Bank population and replacing it with Israeli population. To do so is a war crime.”
He added that Israeli courts have never heard a case based on the Fourth Geneva Convention, and that Cullen’s decision indicated a skewed perception of the Israeli legal system.
“The problem is that [Cullen] is fundamentally wrong. The Israeli High Court of Justice will not hear this case, so he has sent this case into oblivion.”
But despite the Judge’s dismissal of the suit, Arnold said that the Superior Court’s decision to hear a civil cause of action for the commission of a war crime has set an important precedent.
“[The Judge] said in theory you could have a civil claim brought in Quebec for the commission of a war crime. But in this case, he said, the Israeli court is better suited to hear the case,” said Arnold.
Ronald Levy, the attorney representing the two corporations, said that his clients had legitimately acquired the rights to develop the land when they purchased it from another company, which in turn, he said, bought it from its Palestinian proprietor.
Levy added that the two corporations had refused to register their title to the land for fear that the proprietor would be subject to violent attacks from other Palestinians.
“They stopped registration to save the lives of Arabs from whom they purchased land,” Levy said.
Levy refused to comment on the judgment due to the possibility of an appeal, but did state that any future land claims cases brought by the Village Council to the High Court of Justice of Israel “would be, as they have in the past, properly and impartially dealt with.”
Arnold, however, was skeptical of the judgment’s faith that the case would ever be fairly litigated in Israeli court, and added that the Quebec Superior Court was the appropriate venue for such a proceeding.
“The Green Park company has no presence in Israel, it’s not incorporated in Israel, it carries on no business in Israel. And the village of Bil’in has no presence in Israel; it’s located in the West Bank. And the director of the Green Park company, who lives in Quebec, has no connection to Israel,” Arnold said.
The Bil’in Village Council remains in discussion with Arnold on whether to pursue further legal action in Quebec’s Court of Appeals.
Bil’in has garnered increasing attention in the international media since its residents began staging weekly protests against the Israeli military occupation over four years ago. The demonstrations are regularly broken up when the Israeli military fires upon them with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Mohammed Khatib, a member of the Bil’in Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements, visited Canada during the summer to participate in a speaking tour with Arnold. Upon returning to his home in the West Bank, he was imprisoned by Israeli authorities for over a week.
“[The speaking tour] was aiming to mobilize support for the struggle of this village and also in general for the Palestinian popular resistance movement,” local activist and Tadamon! member Stefan Christoff said.
Christoff asserted that the Israeli army has stepped up its nighttime raids on the village in response to the Council’s legal actions.
“It was only after they visited Canada and spoke publicly in Canada across the country to major media – during [which] CBC and the Toronto Star published interviews with Mohammed [Khatib] – that Israeli military forces started [increased] nighttime raids on the village,” Christoff said.

40 per cent of ombudsperson complaints come from grads
Three years ago, when McGill set their sights on raising gradate admissions by 25 per cent before 2010, they may have underestimated how this could affect the equilibrium of services provided to graduate students.
In their 2006 White Paper, which laid out priorities and policy guidelines, McGill emphasized that graduate students were “an essential part of [our] research mission” and pledged to step-up their retention, supervision standards, office space, and funding availability for grads student.
But Daniel Simeone, the president of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), said that many graduate students feel short changed when it comes to office or lab space, funding options, and faculty supervision.
A glance at statistics from the McGill ombudsperson’s report, presented at Senate on September 16, clarifies this issue: 40 per cent of claims filed with the ombudsperson last year came from graduate students. Taking into account that grads compose roughly one-fifth of the university population, this figure represents a disproportionate amount of concerns.
Ombudsperson Professor Spencer Boudreau, who’s been in the position for nearly a month, explained the imbalance as an effect of the highly intense nature of graduate students’ worries about supervision.
“If something goes wrong during your graduate degree, the stakes are so high,” Boudreau said. He was unable to comment on the trend of concerned grads.
However, Richard Janda, McGill Law professor and president of the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT), thought more could be done overall to improve the quality of the supervision experience, which he identified as a critical problem.
“We certainly have the capacity [to improve the graduate experience,] and we all believe in its importance,” Janda said. “Whether there’s an adequate commitment is another question.”
There is movement afoot to improve graduate supervision with best-practices workshops and panels geared toward both faculty and students. In a presentation made to Senate last April, Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies Martin Kreiswirth indicated that although most graduate students had a positive experience with their supervisors, McGill was still out-of-step with the current best practices.
“[Supervision] is a priority for PGSS and for McGill University, so we’re very excited by some of these workshops,” Simeone also noted.
The PGSS is also hoping that graduate students will see their space concerns swept away as McGill prepares to invest considerable resources into updating its research facilities.
“We’re asking that graduate student space is a priority in the design and redesign of university space,” Simeone said.
McGill seems committed to their White Paper plans to push ahead with the growth of their graduate program, with an eye to improving services as well.
In an email to the Daily, Dean Kreiswirth emphasized, however, that the University is being responsible about admissions by balancing the staff, support, and space required for graduates.
“High-quality graduate research student enrolment is based not just on increasing admissions, but on evidence-based ‘Strategic Enrolment Management’,” Kriesworth noted.
As McGill is vying for a top slot on the world stage as a leading research centre, there’s no doubt that they will need to build their graduate base. During an interview with Macleans, McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum and the other leaders of the Big Five, an elite academic quintet of schools, requested funding to boost their institutions’ capacity to train graduate students.
The Big Five’s pitch for more money and special status as graduate magnets didn’t quite catch with most provincial governments, who by-and-large control the purse strings for post-secondary funding. Most Canadian universities, including McGill, also witnessed their endowment funds shrink considerably last year, leaving them in a financially strained position to absorb a high influx of new staff and expand their services.
McGill has committed to making the graduate experience a world-class one, and we should expect that the services required for students to excel are part of that mandate.

Canadian says accusations of terror links are baseless
Blacklisted Canadian citizen Abousfian Abdelrazik kicked off a cross-Canada speaking tour in Montreal on September 24 to exonerate himself from allegations that he had ties to al-Qaeda and to demand legal recourse for a six-year ordeal that left him stranded in Sudan.
Abdelrazik has also filed a civil suit for $27 million against the government of Canada and Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon, for violations of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Members of Project Fly Home, a coalition of Montrealers who fought to keep his story in the news throughout his time in Sudan – organized Thursday’s event to help “build opposition to the national security agenda” that labeled Abdelrazik a terrorist.
Speaking at the Centre d’éducation populaire in Little Burgundy, Abdelrazik recounted his experience of living under Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)surveillance in Montreal, his imprisonment and torture in Sudan, and his frustrating predicament of being unable to return to Canada because his name was – and remains – on a United Nations no-fly list.
Abdelrazik fled Sudan as a refugee in 1989, following the coup that brought Omar al-Bashir to power. The coup was followed by a collapse of human rights within the country, which has since seen hundreds of thousands killed in the Darfur region.
Abdelrazik spoke softly when recalling the violent conditions in Sudan that forced him to leave. “Above all, I feared the mukhabarat,” he told the crowd, using the Arabic word for “intelligence,” and describing how government agents would torture or kill dissidents. “For anyone coming from Sudan, mukhabarat is a very scary word.”
Abdelrazik settled in Montreal, married, and had children, becoming a citizen in 1995. In the late nineties, CSIS officers began following him, often waiting outside his apartment. When they first visited his home, he said they identified themselves as “the Canadian mukhabarat.” On September 11, 2001, CSIS agents went to Abdelrazik’s home to ask him if he knew whom the hijackers were.
In 2003, Abdelrazik’s mother fell ill, and he flew to Sudan to visit her. In Khartoum, he was detained by the mukhabarat. He would be imprisoned, tortured, released and rearrested several times, but was unable to flee the country.
Abdelrazik’s lawsuit accuses the Canadian government of complicity in his detention and his desertion, a charge against Ottawa that has also surfaced in the cases of Maher Arar, Suaad Hagi Mohamud, Abdullah al-Malki, Muyyed Nureddin, and a host of others from the Arab and Muslim communities.
“The Canadian government is responsible for the missing six years of his life, and in the torture and detention of yet another Canadian citizen abroad,” Abdelrazik’s attorney Yavar Hameed told the crowd.
Abdelrazik said the first Canadian officials who came to visit him in Sudan were the same CSIS agents that had followed him in Montreal. Instead of offering consular assistance, they told him “You are not Canadian; you are Sudanese and you will stay here forever. Sudan will be your Guantanamo Bay.”
After repeated requests to be put on a plane to Canada, the Canadian consulate informed Abdelrazik that he was ineligible to fly home. He was detained again, and just before his second release in 2006, his name was added to the UN’s no-fly list. It remains unclear as to which government asked that Abdelrazik be added to the list.
Stranded in Khartoum after his release from prison, Abdelrazik camped out in the Canadian Embassy, where staff kept him in the men’s washroom. “My home was a toilet in the embassy for three years,” he said.
It took a Federal Court order to compel the government to finally issue Abdelrazik a new passport and fly him home.  Last June, Federal Judge Russel Zinn said the UN Committee, which added Abdelrazik to the no-fly list, was neither independent nor impartial in its decision.
“It is difficult to see what information any petitioner could provide to prove a negative, i.e. to prove that he or she is not associated with al-Qaeda. One cannot prove that fairies and goblins do not exist any more than Abdelrazik or any other person can prove that they are not an al-Qaeda associate,” Zina wrote in a legal judgment calling for Abdelrazik’s repatriation.

Defamation suit seeks $130,000 for public accusation of extortion
MONTREAL (CUP) – A former Concordia Student Union (CSU) politician is suing Concordia’s health plan provider and the company’s owner for defamation. Steven Rosenshein claims that Lev Bukhman, who owns Alliance pour la santé étudiante au Québec (ASEQ) – the company that provides Concordia’s student health and dental plan – attacked Rosenshein’s reputation.
Last February, Bukhman sent an open letter to the CSU, university officials, and campus media, alleging that the CSU acted in bad faith toward him and his company.
In the letter he also accused Rosenshein of asking him for a $25,000 kickback, which would have allegedly gone to fund the Unity slate during the Spring 2007 CSU elections. Acccording to Bukhman, the CSU cancelled their health plan  contract with ASEQ because he refused to pay the kickback. Instead, the CSU signed a plan with the Canadian Federation of Students-Services, through their National Student Health Network. That decision has since been reversed and the CSU has re-signed with ASEQ.
According to Rosenshein’s statement of claim filed with the Quebec Superior Court, Bukhman “decided to defame Rosenshein as part of a larger plan to discredit the 2008-09 CSU executive and to try and influence” Concordia student politics, in an effort to remain the CSU’s insurance broker. Rosenshein is seeking $130,000 in damages and legal fees, with $75,000 for damage to his reputation, $25,000 for punitive and exemplary damages, and $30,000 to cover his legal fees.
Rosenshein had a long career with the CSU, serving as council chair, vice-president of communications, and as a councillor. During his council term he came under fire for sitting as a representative for independent students despite not being an independent student, which is forbidden under CSU rules.
Bukhman claimed that Rosenshein asked for the bribe on March 6, 2008, after a speech by Al Sharpton at Concordia. While Rosenshein’s claim acknowledges the two talked about money that evening, he claims that he was asking Bukhman about a $12,500 donation he said Bukhman had promised the CSU.
According to the statement of claim, Rosenshein was worried “as the next year would bring in new executives who might not know about the donation.”
While Bukhman’s letter claimed Rosenshein had acted as campaign manager for the Unity during the Spring 2007 CSU elections, according to Rosenshein’s claim, he “barely involved himself with the CSU campaign; in any case the campaign itself was uneventful,” as the slate ran unopposed.
The statement also claims that “Rosenshein never intended or tried to influence the 2008-09 executive to sever its ties with ASEQ.”
While Rosenshein admitted that he questioned the renewal of the contract, other councillors also shared his concerns. He also denied taking action on the issue beyond asking questions at council meetings.
Moreover, Rosenshein claimed  the allegations made against him were more damaging because he was an employee of the Canadian Federation of Students-Quebec at the time Bukhman made them.
None of the allegations have been proven in court.
The case, which was filed in April, is still in the discovery phase, in which the two parties can gather evidence and question witnesses. Rosenshein has until October 14 to finish discovery. If the case does make it to trial, a court date would still be months away.
Requests for comment from Bukhman and to Rosenshein, through his lawyer, were not returned by press time.
