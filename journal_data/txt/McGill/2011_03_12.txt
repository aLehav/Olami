McGill community complains of lack of representation to principal’s taskforce
Last Friday McGill principal Heather Munroe-Blum hosted a  town hall to discuss the recommendations of the Principal’s Task Force on Diversity, Excellence, and Community Engagement, a project launched in Fall 2009 and that released its report in February.
Munroe-Blum explained the report’s three main tenets are diversity, excellence, and community engagement. At the town hall, she stressed that diversity does not reduce academic quality or standards, but that it is “quite the opposite… the report includes a very precise statement that describes how diversity and excellence are linked.”
Munroe-Blum also emphasized that the Task Force’s recommendations would not include any affirmative action measures.
“We really thought that our major goal would be to make sure that those who could be qualified for these positions had a route into our application and enrolment procedures, whether at the staff or the student side, that would make us easy to interact with,” she said.
Kevin Whittaker, president of the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), wanted to know why there were no employee association representatives on the task force.
“One of the main topics addressed in the task force is employment equity. Under the Federal Contractor’s Programme, McGill is required to consult and collaborate with employee representatives and bargaining units in all employment equity implementation,” he said.
SSMU Equity Commissioner Emily Clare told The Daily that in the same vein, groups like the Union for Gender Empowerment, the Black Students’ Network, and Queer McGill should have been consulted.
Munroe-Blum said there was no special group representation to the task force, as it was created by an ad hoc committee wherein specially appointed members tackled diversity issues “writ large” and not “particular interests.”
When staff and students gave recommendations on how to better promote diversity, or exposed any deficits in diversity and acceptance at McGill, they were directed to the Task Force website, or told to  “think carefully about what you could be doing.”
The principal also expressed the need to improve mobility on campus.
“Our campuses need to be more physically accessible as a high priority. That’s been a challenge for us, [and is] certainly something marked for me,” she said.
A student from the Départment du langue et litérature française and the School of Environment asked about the fact that international students can no longer take FRSL at the in-province tuition rate, as she believed this change would prohibit the integration of international students into Montreal.
The principal replied that the main problem was underfunding. “We’re constantly having to make tough decisions,” she said, and suggested that the student who raised this issue should petition the provincial government for these funds.
Laura Risk, a member of the PGSS family care committee, spoke of the lack of recognition, lack of facilities such as changing tables and nursing areas, and lack of academic accommodation – for instance, leeway for students who miss exams because of a sick child – that were facing students with families.
Munroe-Blum was unwilling to make any daycare promises because of “constraints of space and money.” However, Jim Nicell, Associate Vice-Principal (University Services), immediately sent out text message to scout out possible locations for changing tables.
On the subject of equality of access and tuition rates, Munroe-Blum specified that governmental bodies could better address these issues.
Joël Pedneault, next year’s SSMU VP External, asked whether Munroe-Blum had personally consulted with any upper-level administrators at Canadian banks about tuition rates.
“I have spoken right up to the level of CEO,” she said.
After the town hall, Pedneault pointed out that this relationship presented a “conflict of interest, knowing that any increase in tuition fee means that students start to incur debt and start to have to pay interest to banks.”

TV McGill and Midnight Kitchen win renewed funding
Correction appended March 13
Clubs and Services Councillor Maggie Knight won the 2011 SSMU presidential election in a landslide victory over Speaker of Council Cathal Rooney-Céspedes on Friday night. Knight won with 67.2 per cent of the student vote, with Rooney-Céspedes pulling in 25.8 per cent.
Only 21 per cent of undergraduates – or 4,172 students – voted in the elections.
“It’s good to feel that I won by a decent margin. I’m really excited by the team, a lot of the races were really close,” said Knight. “I think a lot of the other candidates will do a good job too, but I’m incredibly excited about this team going forward.”
“Maggie’s going to do an incredible job – I wish her the best of luck. The only downfall of next year’s executive is that they can’t have both Maggie and I working for them,” said Rooney-Céspedes.
Acclaimed candidate Joël Pedneault won VP External with an approval of 80.3 per cent of the student vote. Current VP External Myriam Zaidi was elated with the result.
“I’m really glad that Joël will have a team that supports him on many of them have campaigns against tuition hikes, and I know that he won’t be alone next year. What I really like about the team is that they’re all progressive people – and that’s good because that’s what our generation should be,” she said.
Carol Fraser, Midnight Kitchen volunteer coordinator and the only SSMU outsider to be elected, was shocked by the results in the closest race, in which she won VP Clubs and Services by a margin of 0.7 per cent – or just 29 votes.
“I’m looking forward to working with all the people that got elected, I think we’ll have a really solid team. I’m genuinely pleasantly surprised – it was a really close race, my opponent ran a really good race and was just as good a candidate as I, but I’m really happy to win,” she said. “I’m happy to work for students. SSMU has given so much to me and I’m excited to give back that much more.”
Current VP Clubs and Services Anushay Khan stressed that the transition month between this year’s and next year’s executive was of paramount importance to the position.
“There’s a lot to learn in this position, a lot of institutional memory, with the politics of opt-outs and student space. No matter what candidate won tonight, the most emphasis should be placed on that month,” said Khan.
Current SSMU Equity Committee member and AUS VP External Todd Plummer also won by a tight margin, winning with 25.4 per cent of the vote and edging out Education Councillor and former Daily editor Kady Paterson by 45 votes for the position of VP Internal. SSMU outsider Natalie Talmi pulled a close third at 24 per cent of the vote.
SSMU Funding Coordinator Shyam Patel had a clear-cut victory over last-minute addition to the election, U2 Management student Stefan Zuba Prokopetz.
Equity Commissioner Emily Clare beat Science Councillor Lauren Hudak by an 11.8 per cent margin, and expressed excitement over the incoming Senate caucus. It will comprise Matt Crawford and Jason Leung for Arts, and Max Luke and Annie Ma for Science. Single seats went to Daily editor Tom Acker for Management, Usman bin Shahid for Engineering, and Sameer Apte for Medicine. Emil Briones, Ian Clarke, Haley Dinel, and Ryan Hirsch ran unopposed, and were approved to represent Music, Law, Religious Studies, and Dentistry, respectively.
“I think the group will be good – but honestly, before I make any kind of judgment, I want to meet with them and see how they interact with one another, see how they feel,” said Clare. “What matters more is how Senate caucus interacts with each other than how I feel about them.”
All referenda questions passed, including increases for the ambassador and Midnight Kitchen fees, renewed funding for Nightline, Queer McGill, and the Union for Gender Empowerment, and the creation of a McGill International Student Network fee. TVMcGill will receive an extra $1.00 per year.
TVMcGill president Carter Li explained that the increase was vital to the existence of the service.
“If we didn’t get this referendum again after just a year [of having the opt-outable fee], we would have to go back to our usual SSMU-provided budget of $4 to 5,000 a year, which barely covers anything to repair our equipment, let alone get anything new,” said Li. “We’re a service and we provide a service to the McGill community – that’s why it was so important for us, it essentially dictates our existence.”
Carol Fraser indicated that the creation of an opt-outable Midnight Kitchen fee was similarly essential to the continued existence of the volunteer-run lunch collective.
Chief Electoral Officer Tais McNeill explained that voter turnout was slightly lower than the previous year, when 28 per cent of students voted, but said that he was “pretty happy” overall.
“I was looking back at some of the records of previous elections, it really seems to be the contentiousness of the race that drives turnout,” said McNeill. “Considering we had a very civil campaign period and no referenda campaigns that were tense, I think that it was a really good turnout.”

Case to examine Conflict of Interest Policy
SSMU President Zach Newburgh will face his second Judicial Board case in as many years, as SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi plans to submit a petition for a review of Newburgh’s adherence to the Conflict of Interest Policy during his work for Jobbook.
Despite numerous statements expressing a wish to move forward from the Jobbook controversy, Newburgh said that the prospect of a J-Board case is “great,” and will help provide closure.
The Judicial Board, which consists of up to five upper-year students from the Faculty of Law, is the final authority on the interpretation of the Constitution and Bylaws of SSMU. According to the SSMU Constitution, the J-Board has the power to “declare invalid any act of Council, the Executive Committee or the General Manager” if it determines that an act violates the Constitution or Bylaws.
“Really, what a wonderful opportunity this is, to determine, ultimately, that I did not violate any policies,” Newburgh said. Since the petition has not yet been filed, Newburgh has not received official notification, though Zaidi informed him that she planned to bring the matter to J-Board.
Newburgh maintained “there was not a breach of this particular policy, and that in fact it was used in order to guide my involvement [with Jobbook] in the first place.”
“I wouldn’t have brought it to J-Board if I didn’t believe he breached the policy,” Zaidi said. “[The case is] going to be just the way that the Jobbook contract was handled, and whether or not he breached the policy.”
The possibility of referral to J-Board was discussed at SSMU Legislative Council on March 3, in a conversation surrounding the release of confidential minutes from Council’s in camera session a month earlier.
Speaker of Council Raymond Xing adhered to Robert’s Rules directions on the confidentiality of trials. “It is the prerogative of the Speaker to err on the side of caution on potentially damaging matters,” Xing said during Council. He later added that, “The J-Board exists for a reason.”
Zaidi claims that her petition will focus on interpretation of the policy, and will not involve a request for the release of confidential minutes. She said that her actions are “unrelated to the [March 3] Council.” Though there is still the possibility of a separate J-Board case regarding the confidential minutes, Zaidi said she will not file a petition on the issue.
Due to varying interpretations of the Conflict of Interest Policy, multiple councillors and executives have expressed a need to review and amend the policy. Newburgh has advocated for review, stating that the policy “needs to be a lot less ambiguous.”
“A number of people are very, very interested in reviewing this policy to make it more clear,” Newburgh said. “Not just for individuals who are directly affected by it, but for individuals who are concerned and want to be able to hold their leaders accountable.”
The first J-Board case involving Newburgh occurred in March of 2010 when Newburgh was Speaker of Council. The McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights filed a petition contesting his impartiality during the Winter 2010 General Assembly. The petition was dismissed in June.

Ali Abunimah speaks to the validity of Israeli apartheid
On Wednesday night Ali Abunimah, executive director of the website electronicintifada.net and author of One Country: A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, discussed why he believed Israel to be an apartheid state and how the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel would be an effective tool for changing the status quo for the Palestinian people.
Abunimah spoke in the Bronfman building as the keynote speaker for Montreal’s Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW), co-hosted by nine different organizations from the Montreal and McGill communities.
In making a comparison to the South African apartheid system, which rendered certain individuals second-class citizens, Abunimah outlined what he believed to be inequalities for Palestinians in terms of land rights and access to education.
“Palestinians living in Israel are able to vote and run for office but that’s where their rights end,” he said.
Abunimah described an incident in which state employees denied Arab-Israelis their land rights. “In Jerusalem we continue to see the systematic ethnic cleansing…where there is a house-by-house plan to expel Palestinians from their neighbourhoods and to put them in Jewish settlements.”
Abunimah also spoke to the treatment of people in the Gaza strip as creating an apartheid style inequality between Jews and Palestinians. In particular he focused on the December 2008 to January 2009 Operation Cast Lead attack on Gaza and the current restrictions on the movement of resources to the strip.
“Of the 640 schools in the Gaza Strip during Operation Cast Lead in 2008, 18 schools were completely destroyed  – eight of them being kindergartens – and more than 240 were damaged,” he said. “Not only was Israel content to bomb the schools in Gaza, but since then has not allowed construction materials to flow into Gaza to rebuild these schools.”
Abunimah went on to describe the BDS movement, and why he believes it is an important method of lobbying the Israeli government to change its policies towards Palestinians and Arab-Israelis.
“The three goals of the BDS movement are to end the occupation since 1967, end all forms of discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel, and end the racist exclusion of Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes,” he said.
He went on to state why he believes that other methods of resolving the conflict have been ineffective. He stated that BDS is the only possible option considering the failure of peace initiatives thus far.
“For the past twenty years we’ve had something called the peace process…it has been nothing but an alibi for inaction…when told about the Palestinian condition politicians in Canada and the United States do not do anything because they don’t want to disturb the peace process.”
Opposition to IAW includes the McGill Friends of Israel, who posted articles on their Facebook page criticizing the event, including a statement released by the Prince Arthur Herald’s editorial board entitled “We All Must Condemn Israeli Apartheid Week.”
The Daily spoke with Brendan Steven, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Herald regarding Abunimah’s comments.
“Palestinians living in Israel are given the right to vote and to run for office,” Steven said. “Israel is the only liberal democracy in the Middle East…anyone that claims that Israel is an apartheid state is anti-Semitic.”
An audience member questioned Abunimah about why he did not address the treatment of Jews in Arab countries during his talk.
“I support the full right of restitution to any property that was confiscated from Arab Jews who left the countries and went to live in Israel,” Abunimah responded. “I would like to see Arab-Jewish communities thriving again.”
Aaron Lakoff, an organizer of Montreal’s IAW, spoke after Abunimah’s talk about the goal of the events. Montreal’s IAW ends tomorrow.
“We are trying to open up spaces for dialogue in society and for debate on these issues. We are trying to do so in a pluralistic way,” he said. “I am Jewish and I am an organizer of Israeli Apartheid Week. There’s many Jews who were involved in organizing Israeli Apartheid week, not just in Montreal but across Canada.”

Correction appended

Last Thursday the Aboriginal Law Association of McGill hosted the panel discussion, Stolen Sisters, addressing issues of violence and discrimination that Aboriginal women continue to face within Canadian society.
The discussion was a part of the event: “13 Days to Honour Aboriginal Women,” which aims to celebrate Aboriginal women, as well as raise awareness about missing and murdered Aboriginal women.
Official statistics estimate that since the 1980s, approximately 520 Aboriginal women have been murdered or gone missing.
Walk4Justice, a women’s grass roots activist organization founded by Gladys Radek and Bernie Williams Poitras, estimate that the actual number is almost 4,000.
Both Radek and Poitras spoke candidly at the panel discussion about the prejudice that Aboriginal women face.
“You are a fucking squaw. What have you done for our community? What have you contributed to Canada?” said Poitras, with reference to personal experiences.
“This is how Indian women are treated,” she stated.
Ridek and Poitras also referenced strong societal prejudice against Aboriginal women as extremely damaging, to both individuals and communities.
“When one woman is violated it affects a whole community, when one woman goes missing it affects a whole community,” said Radek.
“These are racist attacks against our women. Society has told [the children of these women] that your mother was a whore, your mother was nothing but a drug addict, your mother was society’s throw-away,” added Poitras. “We [have] to tell their children that this [is] not so. Your mother loved you.”
Speaking about “the Highway of Tears,” a stretch of highway in northern British Columbia closely linked to many missing women’s cases, Poitras explained that many women were victimized when trying to escape violent situations.
“If they are leaving a violent situation in those isolated communities the only way they can come out is highway 16 and, more often than not, they will be caught on that highway,” said Poitras.
“They don’t have to be hitchhiking, they don’t have to be sex trade workers – they could be walking along that highway and they just disappear because there, at that moment, is a moment of opportunity for a predator,” she continued.
Panellist Craig Benjamin, a national campaigner for the human rights of Indigenous peoples for Amnesty International, explained that part of the problem is the lack of national policies regarding the status of Aboriginal victims of crime, for police to use.
“In 2001 [Amnesty International] could not find a single police force that had implemented a single policy or procedure in recognition of this pattern of violence,” said Benjamin, who interpreted the lack of real statistics as an affirmation that police forces have not been active on this issue.
“There is no good reason that the federal government has not directed the RCMP to establish a national standard that says this is why you must record the Aboriginal identity of violent crime. There is simply no good reason why this is not happening except that it is not a priority,” he added.
In his concluding remarks, Benjamin spoke to Canada’s failure to protect Aboriginal women.
“The failure to provide services and support, to show that Aboriginal women are not endangered is the first point; these are basic human rights violations and should be unacceptable to anybody,” he said. “We are talking about the society we all live and participate in, we all have the responsibility for bringing about this change.”

The McGill Daily
Principal Heather Munroe-Blum met with journalists from The Daily, the McGill Tribune, and Le Délit on Friday afternoon to discuss the recently completed Task Force on Diversity, Excellence and Community Engagement. The discussion also addressed other topics, including the deregulation of international student fees, the administration’s work with consulting firm McKinsey and Co., and the 2011 SSMU elections.
Three hours prior to the interview, Munroe-Blum held a Town Hall regarding the Task Force. She responded to a variety of questions focused on the possible impact of tuition increases on student diversity.
Deregulating international student fees
The deregulation of international student fees allows McGill to keep the entirety of fees international students pay to the University. Previously, 92 per cent of the fees were taken by the provincial government, and redistributed among all Quebec universities relative to overall enrolment.
“What I’ve been proposing to government since 2003 – is that we be able to move to a more competitive level of tuition fees,” said Munroe-Blum.
Munroe-Blum identified student financial aid as the primary recipient of the increased revenue. Thirty per cent of net new tuition revenue is being spent on financial aid.
Munroe-Blum also identified student advising as another recipient of increased revenue. Munroe-Blum said McGill has “been spending that and more in those areas.”
“It is being used,” said Munroe-Blum. “My hope is that while I’m principal – and I have a few years left as principal – that we will be able to say that every qualified student will be able to come to McGill independent of their financial needs.”
Le Délit asked Munroe-Blum whether she was planning on deregulating international student fees in more programs than the six that are currently deregulated. Munroe-Blum said that she favoured a “model of tuition that allows those who can pay more [to] pay more, and those who can’t to get a subsidy.”
“We’re not at that place in terms of what we’re asking for,” qualified Munroe-Blum. “We’re asking for an increase to the average of Canada for all students. But could it be reasonable to take some other disciplines and say, ‘Deregulate those’? I think it could.”
Responding to a question from Le Délit about the possibility of increasing the international student population, Munroe-Blum said there were no currently no such plans.
“It’s not a plan,” said Munroe-Blum. “We’re trying to actually keep that enrolment balance. It’s been very stable for a long time, and we’d like to keep it that way.”
A January draft of McGill’s Strategic Enrolment Management (SEM) plan described the University’s aim to increase the total international student population from 20 to 22 per cent of the overall student body, or by over 500 students. When The Daily reminded Munroe-Blum of the SEM plan figures, she said, “That’s interesting.”
“We have actually not talked about that at the senior table, so that’s not come yet to us, and [increases] will not be at the expense of the undergraduate proportionality,” she added.
Tuition increases and the MBA
Munroe-Blum clarified her position on hikes to general Quebec tuition, something that could be announced this Thursday with the release of the provincial budget.
“We believe that if…the Quebec government is going to increase tuition, they have to increase student aid – themselves, not just us – and they need to keep investing. And [Education] Minister [Line] Beauchamp made that commitment on December 6 in Quebec City, but I think it’s one of the things that we absolutely depend on,” she said.
Beauchamp announced on March 1 that McGill would face financial penalties for hiking tuition fees for the McGill MBA program from around $2,000 to $29,500. The Daily asked Munroe-Blum what her reaction to the announcement was.
“We’re in discussions with the Minister…and we hope we come to an understanding on it,” she said. “You’ll know in what [Beauchamp] presented that she talked about penalties unless the case can be made that this is a special program.”
When asked if the University was trying to make the case that McGill’s MBA is a special program, Munroe-Blum replied that a lot of changes have been made to the program, and that they were part of their discussions with Beauchamp.
“Our Board [of Governors] is not going to turn back on this program. We have to be able to fund it effectively,” said Munroe-Blum. “We feel like we’re doing the right thing. And we would like to be doing it in concert and in partnership with the Quebec government – not in opposition to them.”
McKinsey & the McGill administration
A question from the Tribune asked Munroe-Blum if she had concerns about working with McKinsey after recent revelations in the Financial Times that several top McKinsey executives were currently being investigated by the American government for insider trading.
“We’re not working with McKinsey,” said Munroe-Blum, stating that two McKinsey executives and McGill alumni – one being Claude Généreux, who was appointed to McGill’s Board of Governors in January – were giving the University pro bono guidance.
“The normal McKinsey model is…that you bring in a big team of McKinsey people, they come in and value it, they come in and do the benchmarking,” said Munroe-Blum.
“That’s not what we’ve done. We have taken the willingness of two distinguished alumni who are senior people in McKinsey to help us develop the ability inside to benchmark our practices – in the areas that we’re looking at – against the best, and do fact-finding about our own strengths and weaknesses in that area.”
Munroe-Blum also stated that the pro bono consultation was only temporary, starting in September and ending a few weeks ago.
“We did it ourselves, and now it’s ours – and it has been from the beginning. That’s why we called it the Strategic Reframing Initiative, not the McKinsey Initiative,” she said.
In regard to McKinsey’s activities reflecting poorly on McGill, Munroe-Blum was not worried, and was interested in how the investigation would continue. She talked of how the case related to the Academy Award-winning, Inside Job, a documentary chronicling the causes of the 2008 American financial crisis.
“I think it’s interesting to see that even a venerable institution like McKinsey, someone who’s dominated in the field, is not impervious to having human error and judgment and integrity problems,” said Munroe-Blum. “It’s interesting, but I don’t worry about it contaminating McGill at all because McKinsey…hasn’t come inside [McGill].”
“I think it’s something to watch and be mindful of,” said Munroe-Blum, “but we have to think about integrity issues within the University and with all of our partners – all the time.”
Student relations and SSMU elections
Munroe-Blum stated that relations between students and the administration were good, in stark contrast to student condemnation of the administration’s lack of consultation and dismissal of their concerns.
“I don’t sense that there is bad feeling with students and the administration,” said Munroe-Blum in French. “I think that we have very good collaboration with students; we have lots of student participation in governance decisions.”
Munroe-Blum did say that the structure of McGill student governance made it more difficult for administrators to interact with students. She described it as a “funnel system” that narrowed the expanse of student leadership down to just a handful of student representatives.
“In other universities normally the administration would interact with many, many more student leaders. The system at McGill is that PGSS executives represent the graduate students, SSMU executives represent the undergraduate students – the same with [Continuing Education] and Macdonald [campus],” said Munroe-Blum. “The good thing is it gets us out and has me invite other students in, but I think it would be great if we could have more participation of the broader student leadership.”
When asked if she had been following the SSMU elections, particularly the presidential candidates, Munroe-Blum responded that she had. Election results were announced in Gert’s minutes after the interview ended.
“It looks like there’s a strong slate, which is terrific,” said Munroe-Blum. “I know them pretty much from the same material that people who don’t know them well know them from. What I really hope is that there will be a good turnout in the election.”

Community leaders rally on Parliament Hill
A delegation of First Nations Chiefs and First Nations Police Chiefs of Quebec traveled to Parliament last Thursday to express outrage over Public Safety Canada’s announcement that funding for the First Nations Policing Program (FNPP) will be reduced by 19 per cent for the upcoming year.
Members of the delegation also challenged what they view as the federal government’s complete double standard: investing heavily in public safety services across Canada, while cutting funding for First Nations’ services.
“The pillars of their political platform – ‘you do the crime you do the time.’ These cuts are totally disrespectful and insulting in terms of policing service for First Nations communities. They are a total contradiction to the direction taken in terms of the rest of the country,” said Lloyd Phillips, chief of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake and spokesperson for the Assembly of the First Nations of Quebec and Labrador (AFNQL) Public Security Portfolio.
Funding for First Nations police services is established through tripartite agreements between the federal and provincial governments and First Nations. For the past two years the federal government has delayed the negotiation of a new tripartite agreement in anticipation of a comprehensive review of First Nations policing in Canada. In its place, the federal government has temporarily implemented successive one year funding agreements.
According to Phillips, First Nations police services are already extremely underfunded, especially in Quebec, which receives “the bare-bone minimum of funding required.”
“A 19 per cent decrease equates to about $2.8 million, and greatly jeopardizes the ability for people to do their job. Especially for smaller forces it means the possibility of laying off people. In terms of larger forces [it] jeopardizes the ability to carry out large scale investigations,” he said.
At a press conference on Parliament Hill, Shawn Atleo, chief of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), spoke of the need to create a more secure funding system.
“Currently, with the end of each fiscal year comes a threat to whether or not a community will be able to maintain its police services. Clearly we need to look at a different approach that would provide stable, multi-year agreements with a proper funding base to avoid jeopardizing the safety and security of First Nation communities,” he said.
At the press conference Steve Launière, the president of the Association of the First Nations Chiefs of Police of Quebec, added, “If this decision materializes within the scope of the next budget, there will be serious repercussions. This decision will jeopardize the policing services in the communities and, as a consequence, it will have an impact on criminality and social peace.”
While in Ottawa, the delegation, had hoped to obtain a meeting with Vic Toews, the Minister of Public Safety.
“Several requests were made by regional chiefs and the community, but unfortunately Minister Toews has been extremely elusive,” said Phillips.
In an email to The Daily, Toews’s office wrote: “Our Government continues to support the First Nations Policing Program, which has made a significant contribution to improving public safety in First Nation and Inuit communities for close to 20 years.”
However the office refused to go into detail about funding cuts, stating, “We cannot speculate [on] the outcome of budgetary decisions.”

Repairs to start in May
At around 9:45 a.m. last Tuesday, over 700 students were evacuated from New Residence Hall after a fire broke out in a 14th floor room.
According to Michael Porritt, executive director of Residences and Student Housing, the fire was isolated to the one room.
“A student had lit a candle, and went to sleep,” he said. “The candle was under a curtain, and it lit the curtain.”
Porritt explained that the student’s roommate walked in minutes after the fire began, and alerted the student. Moments later, sprinklers in the room went off and quickly extinguished the fire, but by this point the evacuation process had already started.
“Without the sprinkler system the whole room would have been engulfed in flame in four minutes,” he said.
The fire damaged some furniture in the room including the curtain and a mattress, but sprinklers caused the majority of the damage. A dozen rooms – four rooms on the 14th, 12th and 11th floors (there is no 13th floor) – are currently “not inhabitable” as a result.
Of the 18 students living in the 12 rooms, all but one are now staying in the Delta Hotel at 475 President Kennedy. The other student is staying in another New Rez room.
The 12 damaged rooms have been filled with dehumidifiers and should be dry in about a week.
Porritt noted that the students in the Delta Hotel had been “very patient.”
“[The rooms have] been stripped down to the studs. The dry wall has been removed up to four feet,” he said. “Beyond the 12 rooms, there’s at least a dozen [more damaged], and there’s damage in the hallways.”
Porritt said that, in a best-case scenario, it would take six weeks to fully repair the rooms, including the week spent drying them out. As a result repairs won’t start until May.
Open flames are banned from McGill residences, a rule reiterated in an email sent out to all residence students that Tuesday afternoon.
Porritt also stressed that he was extremely impressed with the handling of the situation.
“The students in New Rez were actually quite amazing,” he said. “It was one of the fastest evacuations we’ve ever had.”

Journalist and Venezuelan expat Francisco Toro shares his perspective
What makes a government more likely to be overthrown than others? According to Venezuelan journalist, Francisco Toro, the answer resides in its political vulnerability.
“The brittleness of a government is a pre-condition to its collapse. When a regime gets to the point of forcing an entire country to fake loyalty, the chances for overthrow are very high,”  said Toro.
Currently completing a PhD at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, Toro also writes a blog about Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, and its social and political situation since the mass protests and general strikes against Hugo Chávez’ government between 2002 to 2003.
“What is going on today in the Arab countries is similar to the situation in Venezuela nine years ago. Yet, in some ways, it is different, and this difference is the reason why they succeeded in the attempt and we didn’t,” he said.
According to Toro, the situation of the Arab states protesting today differs from Venezuela’s at the time of the anti-Chávez movement primarily in the structure of their autocratic regimes. The difference is that Venezuela operated through selective intimidation rather than the general hardship and human rights violation of the Arab states. He attributes this to political division within the country, and the influence of pro-Chávez supporters.
“Overthrowing a government is not always the best solution. In the case of Venezuela, the government was much stronger. It has taken us ten years to realize that the best strategy to improve the politics was to exploit the small space for liberty that we were given,” he said.
In hindsight, Toro sees the 2002 demonstrations in Caracas as a mirage. Having lived through the demonstrations, he remembers being incapable of visiting his sister on the other side of the city due to protests on every corner. He recalls how demonstrations were announced along with traffic updates on the radio.
“The feeling was insane. Watching the events occurring at Cairo a little more than a month ago stirred up all those memories and dreams of social change and liberty,” he said.
Toro, however, was quick to draw a distinction between that and the current situation in Cairo.
“What has been occurring in Egypt is not a mirage. Severe autocracies are brittle, because they crack down on human rights. We would not have been able to have this conversation two weeks ago in such societies, and people are aware of that,” he stated.
Toro also pointed to stronger ties with the outside world due to the staggering expansion of media and various other methods of communication.
“When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, I was a 12-year-old boy in Venezuela. Europe seemed to me like another planet. I didn’t feel the slightest repercussion of it. And that was only about twenty years ago,” he said. “What is going on in Egypt and in Libya is exhilarating.”
Toro explained that in recent years journalists, politicians, lawyers and activists alike have developed the international consensus that the influence and power of ideas shaped by the public cannot be denied.
He spoke to the establishment of internationally recognized norms of justice and how the protests in the Arab world have prompted many people with similar political climates to consider their own governments.
“It brings about the question of what government can be legitimate in this world,” he said. “It is, after all, the 21st century.”
