Thousands mobilize in downtown Montreal
On Sunday November 12, thousands of people gathered in solidarity to protest racism and hatred. The demonstration was organized by several groups who published an online call to action, denouncing Islamophobia, colonialism, sexism and transphobia. This call was subsequently signed by over 168 students, community members, and activist organizations.
The McGill contingent convened at the Roddick gates and walked down Avenue McGill College to Rue Sainte Catherine where they joined the Concordia contingent. The two groups then marched east on Sainte Catherine, about fifty individuals taking up the street and chanting phrases such as “A qui la rue? A nous la rue!” and “Refugees in, racists out!”
The Daily talked with an anonymous demonstrator from McGill BDS who spoke about how important demonstrating solidarity is for groups that advocate for marginalized peoples everyday.
“I think it’s really good that everyone can unite in one time and place and see that solidarity because it’s what keeps us going at the end of the day,” they continued. “It’s also [important] to remind people that Palestine is an ongoing issue and that we can’t forget [about] it in our struggles.
“Right now, the global political climate more than ever needs us to stand against all kinds of fascisms and racisms” they said. “We see or we think of Canada as this liberal paradise and that’s kind of it’s issue. In its liberalism it’s racist, it’s sexist, it funds war regimes […] so more than ever we need to not fall for that.”
“We see or we think of Canada as this liberal paradise and that’s kind of it’s issue. In its liberalism it’s racist, it’s sexist, it funds war regimes.”
Most of the bystanders were supportive of the protest, with some people honking their horns in solidarity. However, on Sainte Catherine and rue Aylmer, a disgruntled driver had an aggressive exchange with a protester and drove into the back of their bike, nearly hitting the individual.
“She sped up to try and pass them but really misjudged how much space there was and hit his bike” said SSMU VP External Connor Spencer. “Then [she] got out of her car and yelled at him for not taking up just one part of the street, which is not a thing.”
Protesters and bystanders gathered around the car and confronted the woman for the dangerous situation she had created, some people threatening her with calling the police. No one was harmed.
On Jeanne Mance the group met up with the Milton Parc community contingent. Sascha Astles, a representative from the community, spoke to the Daily about why she was out marching. “My family has been victimized […] I’m in an interracial relationship, I have five kids, they’ve all felt and been targeted at certain times and just bullied, really nonsensical stuff that saddens me more than angers me because I would hope at this point in our evolution that we would be beyond that.”
These contingents joined with the larger demonstration at Place Émilie Gamelin at 2 PM, where thousands of individuals had already gathered and were preparing to begin the march. There were many different factions, all joining together to protest racism and hatred. For a Montreal protest there was a relatively low police presence, and little to no violence over the course of the three hour long demonstration.
In an interview with the Daily, Mariana Sosa, a social work student at McGill, talked about her reasons for protesting, and the issue of complacency.
“Honestly, if not me then who? It’s my job as a future social worker and a human being on this planet to go out and make noise for the people [who] can’t be here for any reason” she said. “I think this is the perfect place to make as much noise as possible for an intersection of problems that are happening in the world and in this city particularly.”
“There’s a lot of people out here, more than I was expecting, to be honest, because I feel like, when it comes to protests, a lot of people are complacent and they let other people take the brunt of it, but I’m really happy to see such an amazing turnout.”
One of the organizations that signed onto the broad call of action for the march was the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ). There were a number of representatives from the Association marching, and the Daily spoke with one individual who wished to remain anonymous.
“The association […] strongly condemns racism, Islamophobia, and any forms of oppression towards visible minorities, whether it is due to their race, ethnicity, their sexual orientation. We strongly stand against it and we believe that through the grassroots we are able to [make] changes in our community and our society. So we’re here, we mobilized, we’re here to show support with marginalized people, with all these groups that have endorsed this march, and to just stand against oppression, stand against racism, stand against hatred.”
They went on to discuss the issue of oppression and marginalization in Palestine, clarifying that these were his personal views and that AVEQ has no formal stance.
“I’m a Palestinian, and I identify a lot with the cause of Palestinian people. […] I believe that what’s going on in Palestine is one of the greatest tragedies. We’re looking at oppression at different […] levels whether it is [of] the Palestinians living in 1948 Palestine […] or whether it is in the West Bank and Gaza, […] whether it is that universities are underfunded, or whether it is racist policies when it comes to what some people would call, groups such as Amnesty call, the ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem. […] We’re looking also at the disproportionate use of force in Gaza which is based out of racism and out of supremacy.
“We believe there’s a global structure of racism built out of white supremacy, built out of dominance of a certain class over another, […] whether it is oppression of Palestinians, or whether it is here in Canada where discriminated groups are oppressed by the privileged class, by privileged people.”
“We believe there’s a global structure of racism built out of white supremacy, built out of dominance of a certain class over another.”
The march continued north on Berri, then turned west on Cherrier, then south on Saint Denis. The protestors marched west again on Sherbrooke. They continued west past McGill University, where some protesters shouted chants addressing the university’s administration.
The march continued south on Peel and ended just before 5 PM at Dorchester Square.

The Daily sits down with Khan to discuss reasons for resignation
Arisha Khan, VP Finance of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), resigned from her position on November 16. Shortly after this, she sat down with The Daily to discuss her experience at SSMU and explain the circumstances surrounding her resignation.
McGill Daily (MD): “So why did you decide to step down from the VP Finance position?”
Arisha Khan (AK): “Primarily for my mental and physical health, but also I felt like the current conditions at SSMU weren’t conducive to productivity and completing the projects that I wanted to do. […] SSMU at the moment is very polarized and volatile – it’s not exactly a healthy work environment, and in terms of achieving things for students, I feel like we’ve been very stagnant in that recently. I would also like the opportunity to continue doing the other work that I do in relation to child welfare, which has been put on hold while I was in SSMU, and so [I’ll still be] contributing to campus life and improving things for students, just not in my capacity as VP Finance.”
MD: “You mentioned polarization and volatility within SSMU. What did that look like, in your experience?”
AK: “I feel like there was this pattern of certain people being targeted, especially when they’re not willing to utilize their time to launch attacks against others, or fight back in a malicious way. I felt that if I were to continue in my position at SSMU it would have been an uphill battle, and it would have compromised my own ethics, and I honestly feel that I can utilize my time in other places on campus and use it to help people.”
MD: “Was there a specific incident that made you decide to resign?”
AK: “I just felt like […] some of our governance structures had been eschewing democracy and evading the rights of students to participate in certain decisions. […] And it just seemed like no matter what other executives tried, the current climate at SSMU just hasn’t allowed for any positive changes. And while I am hopeful that maybe things will be able to take a turn for the better, I just felt like for me at this point in time I could better utilize my time in another way.”
“I just felt like […] some of our governance structures had been eschewing democracy and evading the rights of students to participate in certain decisions.”
MD: “How do you think these problems can be fixed?”
AK: “After seeing some of the events of this year, particularly with the Board of Directors and what I feel are abuses of power, I think it would be a good idea to do a complete governance review, hopefully through an external party. I think it would be a good idea to be in line with other student associations, to see what’s working within our structure and what’s not, and what we can do to be more accountable and productive for students.”
MD: “You mentioned that the VP Finance job had been taking a toll on your health. Would it be accurate to say that you were doing work beyond your portfolio?”
AK: “Yeah, I have a really hard time saying no, and […] I often felt that maintaining certain administrative responsibilities, even when they weren’t mine, was important to my role to keep things functioning. Unfortunately I started to extend myself way too much when others weren’t doing their jobs.”
MD: “So now that you’ve resigned, who will take on all this work?”
AK: “I’ve spent quite a bit of time transitioning my staff and the other executives in order to have them working autonomously, and also to hold them over. I know that they are running a by-election and I have offered to train whoever my successor would be when the time comes.”
“I’ve spent quite a bit of time transitioning my staff and the other executives in order to have them working autonomously, and also to hold them over.”
MD: “Can you elaborate on the work you do beyond SSMU?”
AK: “I do quite a bit of work in relation to child welfare and foster care on this campus. I helped to institute a bursary for former foster youth coming to McGill, and this is a population – and I come from this background – that usually only graduates at a 2 per cent rate from post-secondary [education]. […] So for me, increasing access to institutions – whether it be McGill or SSMU – for populations that normally aren’t there is very important.”
MD: “Tell me more about accessibility – or the lack thereof – within SSMU.”
AK: “I’m not the typical SSMU candidate, and that largely has to do with my background as well. In order to qualify for government aid still, because I’m a student, I had to take more courses than most executives. I feel that accessibility to student politics and to executive positions is something that we don’t often talk about, but obviously inherently when there are these financial barriers in place, a certain type of person will be able to continuously be represented in positions of leadership. And so I think in order to change that, we need to have a serious discussion about what our student leaders represent and how we can make spaces more accessible because I feel like currently they aren’t.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

International Day of Interns strike advocates for remuneration for all interns 
On November 16, the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ) released a statement condemning the political co-optation of struggles for the remuneration of all internships. Following the successful mobilization of the November 10 International Day of Interns, attended by 15 000 students, organizers are seeking to ensure that demands for equitable pay are not watered down.
Four days after the strike on November 10, policy demands were brought to Quebec’s national assembly by Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois from Québec solidaire, Coalition Avenir Québec, and the Parti Québécois. The motion essentially asked the government to consider a financial compensation policy for student internships in education studies. While the motion was passed unanimously, the demands concerned financial compensation for education courses in their final year, as opposed to the demands concerning the remuneration for all workers announced at the mobilization on November 10, backed by over 60 organizations in North America.
Sandrine Belley, the spokesperson for Campagne sur le travail étudiant (CUTE), an organization which coordinated the strike, told The Daily, “we want to be recognized as workers,” which would require a change in Quebec’s labour code, which currently does not recognize interns as workers.
Kristen Perry, AVEQ’s Coordinator of Mobilization and Associative Development, mentioned that change in Quebec’s labour code is a long term goal for AVEQ.
“All interns should make a living wage, and all working people should be paid for the work they are doing and a fair wage, protected under the labour code,” she said. “Right now, […] interns are specifically excluded from the labour code, which means that they don’t have to be paid, but they are not considered workers. […] What we’re looking to do is to more specifically to change […] the labour code.”
“Interns are specifically excluded from the labour code, which means that they don’t have to be paid, but they are not considered workers. […] What we’re looking to do is to more specifically to change […] the labour code.”
Following the November 14 motion, many organizations expressed support for financial compensation for education students. However, this also resulted in concerns over demands being misconstrued, diluting the conversation of unpaid internships to strictly financial compensation.
“We wish to highlight the difference between financial compensation and remuneration as they relate to unpaid internships: whilst compensation seeks to simply add to student financial aid, the fight for remuneration demands a living wage for hours worked, in addition to attaining better working conditions,” read AVEQ’s statement. It also emphasized that the motion “excludes the multiple other fields where mandatory internships are unpaid, as well as any internships that fall outside of the scope of mandatory in-program training, and has no mention of ensuring protections of interns as workers.”
“Whilst compensation seeks to simply add to student financial aid, the fight for remuneration demands a living wage for hours worked, in addition to attaining better working conditions.”
The statement also expressed concerns of organizations and campaigns that may detract from students organizing on the ground in favor for a living wage, as opposed to a stipend.
For example, Campagne de revendication et d’actions interuniversitaires des étudiants et étudiantes d’éducation en stage (CRAIES), as opposed to the CUTE campaign, advocates for financial compensation for education students in their final internships. CRAIE, with the Quebec Student Union (QSU), put out a press release with the Minister of Higher Education on November 14, requesting $330 per week for education students’ fourth field experience internship. According to AVEQ’s statement, the field of experience internship currently under study at the National Assembly is around $8.25 per hour, with a minimum of 40 hours of work a week. This falls short of Quebec’s minimum wage of $11.25, which is considered to be an insufficient living wage by numerous studies such as Institut de recherche et d’informations socio-économiques (IRIS).
In response to the motion, the Minister of Higher Education Hélène David publicly opened the possibility for further discussion for the remuneration of internships in general, rather than focusing on one area of study. The increased profile of the issue is largely due to the mobilization on November 10, which increased pressure on the provincial government to address the issue of unpaid internships.
Connor Spencer, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP External told the Daily that unpaid internships are an accepted practice at McGill,
“It’s something that’s seen as a normal practice. […] We need to [..] challenge the mentality of [unpaid internships] as gaining experience, and that is the reward the comes out of it, and understand that it is actually exploited labour. […] That kind of mentality feeds off of those who are already in precarious positions […] but most often students that need to work in order to be able to go to school, and students who are in certain faculties over others. […] Where we see a lot of unpaid internships are in education, which we know is disproportionately has a higher representation of women and people of colour working in that faculty.”
“The mentality that we should be challenging the fact that folks are still doing unpaid internships is very new on campus. […] It’s important that we join that fight as McGill students because I think often, a lot of the exploitation that happens on this campus goes unnoticed and uncalled out.”
“The mentality that we should be challenging the fact that folks are still doing unpaid internships is very new on campus.”
Spencer mentioned that because unpaid internships are perceived to be common practice, more work needs to be done on campus. SSMU adopted a motion to develop a policy against unpaid internships on March 2015 at the Winter General Assembly.
“The policy on unpaid internships […] upholds the rights that students have and condemns unpaid internships, and it mandates the VP external to raise awareness, […] [through] conversations, and campaigns. […] However, there’s not much else in that policy,” said Spencer. In order to create actionable items from the SSMU policy, SSMU would require additional tools and resources from the university.
“Unpaid internships are illegal in Quebec. Most people don’t know that,” said Spencer. The Act respecting Labour Standards states that a minimum wage requirement does not apply for “trainees” and “students” interning outside of the school context.
“Our university needs to take a stance on as well, [by] not letting unpaid internships be advertised to students,” said Spencer. While McGill’s Career Planning Service (CaPS) does not approve advertisements for unpaid internships, this does not apply for non-profits of NGOs.
“I think we need to be lobbying the university, [put] checks and balances in place, and have awareness campaigns,” said Spencer. “We don’t necessarily have w resources dedicated to that beyond the words of this policy. […] So I think we need to have a much larger conversation. […] but the resources aren’t there to actually make that happen. […] If we truly want to, as a union, commit to this, we need to have a larger conversation of how we’re going to achieve this among our membership.”

On November 15, the results of a nation wide survey showed that Australians are in favour of same sex marriage. Since September the 16 million Australians registered to vote were invited to participate in the “Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.” 12.7 million, or 79.5% of the voting population, responded with roughly 61% in favour of and 38% against the legalization of same-sex marriage. Unlike typical electoral endeavours in Australia, voting was not compulsory. This was because the survey was not a formal election administered by the Australian government, but rather conducted and administered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Therefore, the results are not binding. However, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has promised to legalize same-sex marriage by the end of the year. In response to the results, Turnbull said, “They voted ‘yes’ for fairness, they voted ‘yes’ for commitment, they voted ‘yes’ for love. And now it is up to us here in the Parliament of Australia to get on with it.” Despite the results, the two month long survey period heightened political tensions. There has long been a favorable public consensus on the topic of same-sex marriage in Australia. Many members of the LGBTQ community felt that the survey was unnecessary and might cause the community more harm than good. “No” campaign mailers contained warnings about “radical sex-education” for children that would follow a “yes” victory. These mailers also included concerns about the supression of free speech and religious freedom. At one point during the survey period, swastikas were found spray painted on rainbow flags.
On Wednesday November 15, Zimbabwe experienced what is being called a “mild” coup. This was in response to last week’s sacking of Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice president of Zimbabwe. Mnangagwa, the presupposed successor of president Robert Mugabe, fled to South Africa and has not returned to Zimbabwe since. Mnangagwa’s sacking was an action taken by Mugabe to further secure his wife’s position as his successor. This came as a surprise to most who thought that Mnangagwa would assume the presidency. At 93, Mugabe is the oldest world leader, and is currently confined to his house in Harare, the nation’s capital, with his wife Grace. Dislike of Mugabe has been spreading in Zimbabwe as he continues his 37 year long tenure. Zimbabwe is currently facing economic issues, which Mugabe has been blatantly negligent in addressing. Grooming his wife for the presidency further exacerbated discontent among the public. Grace Mugabe has been known to make lavish purchases, in addition to having a history of outbursts, including assaulting a woman she found in a hotel room with her sons. Citizens were frustrated with Mugabe’s’ rule and now find relief in the abrupt overthrowing of the regime. Military officials took to national TV on Wednesday morning to inform citizens of the actions taken against president Robert Mugabe, assuring citizens that everything would remain peaceful in the coming days. Neighbouring South Africa is said to be aiding the Zimbabwean government in “peacefully” setting up a new government, one that will likely see Mnangagwa as president.

Council debates bylaw amendments, votes to endorse DPS
On November 8, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) met for their bi-weekly Legislative Council, during which a number of motions were debated, including the creation of a Quebec Studies Student’s Association (QSSA), the amendment of the Fine Arts Council by-laws, and the motion to endorse a “yes” vote in the Daily Publications Society’s (DPS) existence referendum.
New business began with the proposal to form a Quebec Studies Student’s Association, moved by VP Internal Rebecca Scarra and President Eric Partridge. The Quebec Studies program is a small department in the Arts faculty, which is currently struggling due to low enrollment that threatens to shut down the program. This point was raised by VP Academic Madeleine Wilson. “The Quebec Studies program is […] being terminated […] because of low enrollment, the faculty is trying to cut the program. I realise that the association being established is trying to prevent that, but realistically, the only thing that will prevent that is getting enrollment numbers up. […] Does the proposed QSSA have any concrete plans as to how this association is actually going to increase enrollment?”
Scarra replied that her conversation with the person who proposed this motion hadn’t included a concrete plan of action. “However,” she added, “I do know that they’re hoping that by having this association, it’ll increase visibility in the AUS and get more people to enroll. They would also like to do collaborative events with other departments in order to raise awareness about this minor and this program, in order to hopefully increase enrollment.”
“The Quebec Studies program is […] being terminated […] because of low enrollment, the faculty is trying to cut the program. I realise that the association being established is trying to prevent that, but realistically, the only thing that will prevent that is getting enrollment numbers up.”
Given that, as the AUS constitution and the motion itself state, “Each Department and Interdisciplinary Program in the Faculty of arts shall be entitled to a Departmental Association,” there was no debate and the motion passed unanimously.
The subsequent motions, regarding the ratification of committee roles and minor amendments to the wording of the fee increase questions for the Fall 2017 referendum, both passed without debate. These were followed by a motion to amend the FAC bylaws, which was the most extensively debated motion of the evening. The Fine Arts Council, as described by Classics Students’ Association (CSA) VP External David Epstein, is “a wide-ranging funding source, […] funding theatre, literature, visual arts, and dance, for groups as well as individual artists.”
The FAC is mandated to consider and review all applicants who seek funding, and this year has seen a record number of new applicants. To accommodate these new demands, the FAC’s motion proposed that the “affiliate” clause of their by-laws be eliminated, in order to widen the scope of applicants the FAC is able to consider for funding. The “affiliate” clause of the by-laws mandates that the FAC give a designated amount of their funding to specific Arts faculty groups every year – Epstein argued that some of these groups are now defunct, and in order to avoid the unnecessary designation of funds to groups that no longer require them, the “affiliate” clause must be terminated altogether.
Debate on this motion saw many parties voice concerns over the unilateral termination of the “affiliate” clause, given that many of the affiliate groups still require funding. Some councillors raised the question of why the entire clause would be terminated when defunct groups could simply be struck from the by-laws. Epstein clarified that the amendment was not intended to target or marginalise specific organisations, and that the by-laws would be rewritten to create clearer funding guidelines which make up for the current, “hastily” and “poorly written” bylaws, as he described them.
As the night of the council meeting was also the deadline to send out funding to these groups, Epstein encouraged the motion to be passed that night itself. However, debate did carry on for a period of time during which department representatives brought up issues of transparency in the amendment process, the lack of clarity regarding the requirements for each affiliate group in the funding process, and the discrepancy between the small number of defunct groups and the large-scale impact of the amendment.
Partridge proposed two amendments to this motion. The first, would, among other things require all FAC funding to be ratified by AUS legislative council. The second proposes that the striking of affiliate clauses be delayed until February 1, 2018, so that only the second semester allocation would be impacted. This, Partridge argued, would allow for affiliate groups forewarning regarding cuts to their funding. Both of Partridge’s amendments passed.
Given the second amendment regarding a delayed striking of the affiliate class, Department of English Students’ Association (DESA) VP External Thomas Macdonald motioned to table the motion til the next AUS Legislative Council meeting in two weeks. This motion failed. After further debate, the original motion passed with Partridge’s amendments.
Macdonald then brought forward a motion for AUS to endorse a “yes” vote in the DPS existence referendum. The DPS is the publication service which publishes both the McGill Daily and Le Delit, and is undergoing an existence referendum from November 13-16. This referendum takes place every 5 years, as part of the process of renegotiation of a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with SSMU. This year, for the first time in decades, SSMU chose not to endorse a “yes” vote. Macdonald argued that an endorsement by AUS could fill the gap that SSMU left in not endorsing the DPS. “The DPS, McGill Daily and Le Délit privilege marginalised voices and stories, and freedom of press is […] the cornerstone of a robust and egalitarian politic, so I think we should all vote yes.”
A representative from the German Students’ Association requested a brief point of information regarding what a loss of the existence referendum would actually mean for the DPS, to which Macdonald clarified that the DPS would no longer be able to negotiate an MoA with SSMU and would thus completely cease to exist.
During debate, Partridge clarified for the record that the reason for his no vote is that endorsements by the AUS are unprecedented during referendum periods. The question of making the fee opt-outable was also mentioned. Some departmental representatives encouraged a yes vote to this motion, for reasons including the fact that Le Delit is the only Francophone publication on campus, and that the press has a right to continue regardless of political stance. A representative of the PSSA said, “I think that it’s very clear that if the DPS is not renewed, it will end the Daily and Le Délit, we shouldn’t kid ourselves about that […] they will not have the funds to continue to operate. […] I personally don’t agree with the political stance of the Daily, but I firmly believe in their right to exist. I don’t necessarily see this as a referendum on the political stance of the Daily, it’s about voices on campus.”
“I think that it’s very clear that if the DPS is not renewed, it will end the Daily and Le Délit, we shouldn’t kid ourselves about that.”
Partridge requested that the vote be recorded; the motion to endorse the “yes” vote in the DPS existence referendum passed with 33 in favour.

Panel of activists gather to discuss racialized policing practices
On November 8, the Black Students Network of McGill (BSN) and Media@McGill hosted a panel titled “Opposing racial profiling and police violence.” The event featured three speakers: Robyn Maynard, a Montreal-based community organizer, journalist Desmond Cole, and Andrea Ritchie, a U.S. based activist and lawyer. The panel, moderated by Dr. Rachel Zellars, discussed police brutality, racial profiling in Montreal, and its implications on education and immigration.
Maynard spoke to the audience about racial profiling in Montreal, and the legacy of racialized violence in Canada.
“While it’s important to talk about anti-Blackness as a national crisis and a global crisis, […] it’s also important to think of [anti-Blackness] as a local crisis, as one that impacts our day to day lives here,” said Maynard.
“Montreal very recently celebrated its 375th anniversary, and this […] is an opportunity for us to reflect on the long standing racial violence […] that brings injustice of profiling Black communities. […] Disproportionate punishment to Black communities that have really been a part of this city’s fabric since then.” 
“Disproportionate punishment to Black communities that have really been a part of this city’s fabric since then.” 
Maynard noted that James McGill, the founder of McGill University, had enslaved Black and Indigenous people, contributing to a “longstanding legacy of racialized violence, domination and dehumanization.”
Maynard highlighted the ways in which racial profiling is perpetuated in Montreal: “If we think about the neighbourhoods that we’re living in, the populations with the highest percentage of Black communities in St. Michel and Montreal North today still are not only subject to extreme levels in terms of policing, but drastically underserved in transit, jobs, and housing.” According to a report by Centraide, around 30 per cent of the Montreal North residents live below the poverty line. Activist groups in the region have voiced concern on a “systemic anti-Black racism” in Quebec following the death of Bony Jean-Pierre, who died after being shot by police in Montreal North.
In addition to the harms of anti-Black racism in Black communities, Maynard noted that communities such as Burgundy and Cote des Neiges have been gentrified, disproportionately affecting Black and other racialized residents. She noted such “geographies of injustice” perpetuate racial profiling.
“This is a long-standing pattern of Black people [who] are being killed in the hands of the police, [who] are not being represented as a local crisis that [they] absolutely must. […] When we’re talking about celebrating 375 years of this city, we also need to be talking about what it means to be living in a city with 375 years of […] racial subjugation and over-policing of Black communities,” said Maynard.
“When we’re talking about celebrating 375 years of this city, we also need to be talking about what it means to be living in a city with 375 years of […] racial subjugation and over-policing of Black communities.”
Maynard referred to an internal report by criminologist Mathieu Charest, which states that the chances of a Black youth being stopped by the police in the north part of Montreal is at 40 per cent.
The percentage is drastically lower for white youth, at merely 5 per cent. While the report was commissioned by the police after the shooting of Fredy Villanueva by a Montreal police officer in 2008, it was rejected by the Montreal police when leaked by La Presse.
Maynard stressed the importance of looking beyond statistics and visible forms of police violence despite the “massive” discrepancy highlighted by the report.
“We only focus on spectacularized kinds of events, for example, police killings, police violence. We miss all of the kinds of daily rituals of violence that occur […] without death, including racial profiling. […] There are so many other kinds of policing and profiling that don’t necessarily [..] get put into this framework because it doesn’t […] result in a body. […] We need to look at racial profiling in a broader sense, not just law enforcement.”
“We only focus on spectacularized kinds of events, for example, police killings, police violence. We miss all of the kinds of daily rituals of violence that occur […] without death, including racial profiling.”
She continued, “what the statistics don’t convey is the […] humiliation and shame that comes with being stopped by the police. […] The inability to actually be in public space without fear of harassment or actual lived harassment is […] ultimately […] a form of violence.”
“We need to look at racial profiling in a broader sense, not just law enforcement.”
Maynard noted that racial profiling is also a “gateway” for other forms of violence. “We need to expand this definition of what is actually happening in schools,” said Maynard, noting the importance of thinking beyond carding as an indication of anti-Black racism.
“What anti-Black racism means is that, […] for us, policing is everywhere. So it’s absolutely necessary for us to realize this when we talk about what it means to strategize against the onset of racial profiling. […] If we focus our energy only on the issue of carding while ignoring the broad, sweeping things that exist beyond that, I think we will be doing a disservice to ourselves.”
According to a report by the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse, Caribbean background students were three times more likely to be labelled as student with special needs. “This is the kind of profiling, […] pushing youth out of access to decent education […] as a certain kind of harm,” said Maynard.
Cole spoke about the boundaries of law enforcement, and the ways in which policing is perceived by the public.
“What I want to talk about today is this idea of the definition of policing. […] What is it in real life? What is it in the public consciousness?” asked Cole.
“Teachers, nurses, bus drivers, social workers, universities. […] You can find any walk of life that you’re going to have a conflict with one another. But only the police are told that it’s part of their job, you can kill. […] What if we stop arguing about whether they have the training (which they don’t)? Whether they should carry a rubber bullet gun or a taser, weapons? None of which they should have.”
“Teachers, nurses, bus drivers, social workers, universities. […] You can find any walk of life that you’re going to have a conflict with one another. But only the police are told that it’s part of their job, you can kill. 
Cole referred to the the Toronto Board’s recent decision to temporarily suspend a program that allowed armed police to surveil in high schools. “What’s been happening in Toronto recently [is] […] we are pushing back against a ten year police in schools program [that] finally got suspended in the Toronto district school board,” said Cole.
The School Resource Officer (SRO) program was implemented in 2007 to improve student and police relations, but was put up for review after community members published a report detailing the negative impact of the SRO. Subsequently, the SRO has been been criticized for alienating racialized students and criminalizing undocumented students.
In June, groups such as Black Lives Matter and Not Incarceration called for the abolition of the SRO at a board meeting, halting the program. The Toronto District School Board will be conducting a written survey for participating schools to evaluate the SRO.
“But what we’re seeing is that it’s principals and teachers, not just the police who are driving this conversation to have police in schools,” said Cole. He emphasized the importance of re-defining policing to prevent racialized violence perpetrated by police institutions.
“As a description of policing; don’t kill, don’t maim, don’t arrest children who are in school, don’t report children who are in school to the border agency. […] This is where we have to go. […] If we take away the option to kill, all the anti-Blackness starts flooding in as an excuse to why we can’t do it. […] ‘What is the police’s job?’ […] We seem to want to pretend that […] we agree that police should be not reporting undocumented children who are going to school [..] but when we say ‘let’s make that part of the job’, they [respond], ‘no […] what if’. […] That’s the way I see anti-blackness manifest itself.”
Cole referred to Toronto activist Sandy Hudson, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Toronto, in a conversation on “what it means for Black people to receive care, rather than policing.”
“ I start to think about what is the definition of a police officer, and what happens when we start to challenge that definition,” said Cole. He noted that the suspension of the program is not only a push against anti-Black racism, but also re-examines the definition of policing. “The definition of their jobs are up for discussion right now,” he noted. “When we try to turn policing from the abusive institution that it is now to an institution that could actually care for people […] the white colonial settler state […] gets scared.”
