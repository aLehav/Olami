Professors express frustration with administration
As McGill prepared to return to campus earlier this year, it became increasingly clear that guidelines given by the administration did not particularly favour the wishes of students and faculties. Several weeks into the semester, these concerns have gone largely unaddressed, and continue to develop. The Daily is starting a column in which we will dissect the disconnect between the McGill administration and the university community, and respond to new developments related to in-person learning. 
In the weeks leading up to the Fall 2021 semester, faculty members began to express concerns regarding the University’s preparedness for in-person teaching. Students and faculty were particularly frustrated with the university’s lack of accommodations and vaccine mandates, and how they would endanger the safety of those in the classroom. 
In an interview with the Daily, Richard Gold, professor in the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine, explained the lack of warning and time for preparation given to faculty before the start of in-person teaching. According to him, faculty were under the impression that most classes would be taught online up until right before the start of the semester. They were then told that classes “might not be online,” and if this was the case, there would be social distancing. Eventually, social distancing measures were completely lifted in the classroom, weeks before the start of the semester. “It made it very hard for professors to adjust [and] to take into account the circumstances to keep their students safe,” said Gold. 
McGill administration’s approach to addressing these concerns and requests for accommodations has been lacking, according to Gold. He expressed frustration at his months-long attempt to contact the administration regarding their policies. “The scientific experts at McGill, medical experts, epidemiologists, everybody who knows this have been talking to them, trying to get in touch with them, trying to get them to listen for months and they won’t listen and they won’t explain,” he says. 
On August 29, a memo was sent to faculty members from Provost Manfredi on the subject of faculty concerns and the return to campus. In the first paragraph, Manfredi acknowledged that “a small number of academic staff are reticent and have intimated their intention not to teach on campus,” and that this “threatens to compromise the learning experiences for students.” The memo further states that “academic staff are not permitted to determine, unilaterally, that they will teach remotely rather than in-person,” and that “fear about campus safety, residing in another jurisdiction, or concern about relatives who might be at heightened risk or exposure to COVID-19, including those living under the same roof” are not valid reasons for teaching remotely. 
This memo is problematic, according to Gold, as it is not a proper interpretation of McGill’s policy. Article 7.5 of the McGill statutes, the highest law in McGill, gives control to the faculty council to make decisions about teaching subject to the rules of the Senate. As there are no rules of the Senate that discuss modes of teaching, the decision-making is left to the faculty’s discretion. Gold explains that there has been a decades-long norm where faculties do this. “The proper interpretation of the power is that it lies in faculty council,” he explains, “and by the Provost trying to say he gets to decide what is good or not is […] ultra vires,” that is, an act done without appropriate legal authority. 
Andrew Kirk, President of the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT), reiterated the importance of academic freedom in an interview with the Daily. He explained that an important aspect of academic freedom is the freedom to choose the modality of teaching that professors feel would make most sense for pedagogical reasons. “If that includes some aspects of online teaching then they should be able to do that,” he said, “And we felt that the Provost was overstepping his bounds in terms of saying no.”  
In Gold’s opinion, Manfredi’s memo also violates provincial law, specifically the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms which outlines health and safety standards and prevents discrimination. “The University’s policies discriminate against pregnant women, immunocompromised students, [and] students with very severe illnesses,” he says. Gold also explains that the policies discriminate against people on the basis of family status; “If I live in a multigenerational home or I’m taking care of a parent or small child who is more susceptible, again it discriminates.” 
Kirk outlined the many obstacles professors face in requesting accommodations to teach remotely apropos Manfredi’s memo. He described how many faculty members who seek accommodations have been told that to receive accommodations you must have a medical note from a doctor “essentially saying that it would be unsafe for you to be on campus.” Not all faculty members filing requests have conditions that would warrant a doctor’s note, according to Kirk, and seeking a medical professional in Quebec who can generate such a note is a great challenge for many. He further stated that there are faculty members “who have family members who are immunocompromised or dependents who are immunocompromised, who they’re concerned about passing COVID onto and have a genuine concern about increasing the risk in their family;” faculty members in situations like this would not be granted accommodations for remote teaching, as they themselves do not have a medical reason. 
Community and faculty members have vocalized concerns through several outlets, such as social media, op-eds, and open letters. Overall, Gold says that the administration has so far respected the private right of faculty to express themselves. He stated that administrative responses have been polite, but have misstated the law and have been “insulting in […] content.” Gold further acknowledged, however, that he is a full professor and therefore “less worried than […] junior colleagues who, even though they do have protections, are still worried.” 
Kirk also stated that there has been the underlying implication in some of the administration’s communication that professors are “lazy” or “unwilling” to go into the classroom. He says that this is not the case at all, and the majority of faculty hesitations to teach in-person stem from safety concerns and the wish to reduce potential case increases on campus that would result in an absolute return to remote learning. “We want in-person teaching,” Kirk explained, “but we want safe in-person teaching, and we want those who do have genuine concerns to be able to teach remotely without having to jump through a lot of hoops.”

Passes motion for establishment of Ad Hoc Advisory Committee
On September 22, the McGill University Senate passed a motion that they say looks to further student protection against COVID-19 and increase student involvement in administrative decision-making regarding the pandemic. Part of SSMU’s prolonged battle with the University’s administration over COVID-19 regulations, the motion advances two initiatives: a first resolution that “urges the University to adopt measures beyond those currently in place to help prevent the spread of COVID infection,” and a second resolution that “proposes the creation of an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee of Senate on COVID Academic Planning and Policies (“Ad Hoc Advisory Committee”).”
Efforts by McGill’s student body to ramp up protective measures against the raging pandemic have been ongoing for sometime now: an earlier motion was presented to the Senate Steering Committee at its September 2021 meeting which, if passed, would have required the Senate to “urge the implementation of a proof of vaccination against COVID-19 requirement for all students, faculty and staff seeking access to the McGill classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and indoor research or study spaces.” Despite these  appeals, McGill has not updated their policies; the University’s website affirms their commitment to no vaccine mandates of any kind, referencing worries about their ability to “legally require [mandates] in the Québec context” without government intervention. 
The Senate’s first resolution, which advocates for a proof of vaccine requirement, serves as the accumulation of months of student and faculty pleas for more protection against a virus that has claimed the lives of more than 28,000 Canadians to date. The passed resolution looks to an August 16 letter addressed to Principal Suzanne Fortier, Provost Christopher Manfredi, and Chair of McGill’s Board of Governors Ram Panda, where members of the Faculty of Law evaluate the legality of a vaccine mandate. In their August 23 letter, faculty members explain that “experts in law […] have long noted that requiring proof of vaccination is not the same as imposing an obligation to get a vaccine.” They conclude that a proof of vaccine requirement should simply be considered an “internal regulation – like requiring protective clothing when working in a university lab,” that aims to advance the safety of students and staff on McGill’s campus. The group also found that McGill’s anti-mandate commitment renders the institution susceptible to legal claims that “the present policy discriminates against disabled students, staff and faculty,” as they argue a lack of mandate discriminates against those with a disability contrary to Article 10 of the Québec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.
The first resolution also broadly advances the Senate’s earlier attempt to urge further public health measures – the Senate Steering Committee did not include the prior motion on its agenda since some elements of the proposed resolution “did not fall within Senate’s jurisdiction,” according to writing in the second motion. Notably, the first motion’s appendix included recommendations to implement the following provisions:
While the passed resolution did not name specific requests, it still advocates for measures beyond those currently in place to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.  The newly created committee will meet weekly throughout the 2021-2022 academic year, aiming to work with “the University’s senior administration on COVID related decisions” like “academic planning,” advising members on “how such decisions can be most effectively communicated and implemented.” The committee will consist of: The Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs) (who will serve as Co-chair); The Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies) (who will serve as Co-chair); The Director of McGill’s Teaching and Learning services (TLS); and six student Senators. The Advisory Committee encourages “feedback on matters from members of the McGill community” and will “respond to [any feedback] through the University Senate.”
The passage of this motion is part of SSMU’s advocacy for COVID-19 safety which dates from before the beginning of this semester. The Daily will continue to cover SSMU’s dealings with administration as the story unfolds.

Dr. Fauci receives honorary degree, McGill still without vaccine mandate
“Countdown to a Safe Campus,” a Facebook page started by McGill Law Professors Richard Gold and Richard Janda, set a goal for McGill University to adopt a COVID-19 vaccine mandate before Friday, October 1. That day marked McGill’s 67th Annual Beatty Lecture with Dr. Anthony Fauci as the featured lecturer. The virtual event honoured McGill’s bicentennial and awarded Dr. Fauci with an honorary doctorate, recognizing his accomplishments and leadership to the community. Dr. Fauci, director of the U.S National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, has served as a leading expert throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the beginning of August, Dr. Fauci said, “I would encourage private enterprises to seriously consider the idea of mandating vaccination in the enterprise for which they are responsible, whether that’s a university or a place of business.” Though the university has decided to honor Dr. Fauci with its greatest distinction, it has not implemented Fauci’s recommendation to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine on university campuses.
The main points of Dr. Fauci’s lecture were the likelihood of the pandemic worsening this winter, COVID-19 being airborne, and how the overall health of all should be prioritized over the individual liberty of a few. Fauci emphasized the importance of a vaccination mandate as well as other protections against the spread of the virus i.e social distancing in classes, but McGill has not followed these recommendations.
Nearly all Canadian universities outside Quebec require proof of vaccination. In mid-August, the university released a statement explaining its decision to not mandate the vaccine. It cited a Quebec law that allows people to refuse to forgo a recommended medical procedure. The university additionally cited its confidence in its health and safety measures, writing that “education and incentives will be effective […] to get as many people as possible vaccinated.” 
Part of this confidence stems from the university adoption of Quebec’s vaccine passport. Starting in September, the vaccine passport became mandatory for non-essential activities on campus. These non-essential activities vary from sports and student organizations to dining halls and libraries, as of mid-October. Essential activities, including attending class and accessing residences, do not require the vaccine passport. The university will now be providing students and faculty with the option to use a vaccine passport “fast-pass” sticker, which will expedite the checking of vaccine passports in dining halls and other areas that require the passport.
In addition to the requirement of the vaccine passport, McGill has added other incentives for students and faculty to get vaccinated. This has included providing the community with information targeted to those who are unsure about receiving the vaccine, as well as social media outreach such as the “Ask an Expert” video series which explains why it is important to get vaccinated. Though the vaccine passport and McGill’s outreach may be useful in prompting students and faculty to get vaccinated, mandated vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of COVID-19, according to Dr. Fauci.
The “Countdown to a Safe Campus” Facebook page has been advocating for this on its posts. Articles about vaccination and Dr. Fauci’s recommended COVID-19 precautions are found on the page as well as opinions related to how the university should implement the mandate. When referring to Dr. Fauci being awarded an honorary McGill degree, the page wrote, “So how come McGill isn’t following the advice of the person the Principal says ‘expresses its highest ideals’?” 
The university claims to have a readied response for the current Quebec alert level of COVID-19 and increased alert levels of the virus. There are four alert levels in total: Vigilance, Early Warning, Alert, and Maximum Alert. These levels are determined by the epidemiological situation, transmission control, and healthcare system capacity. Currently, McGill’s campus is in the “Vigilance” alert level. 
As part of the protective measures against the spread of COVID-19, the university began testing wastewater for the presence of COVID-19 at La Citadelle, Carrefour Sherbrooke, Royal Victoria College, and Solin Hall starting in October and will begin testing at other residences “in the near future.” Wastewater testing allows the university to estimate the level of the virus spread and increase COVID-19 measures accordingly. Another precaution set in place by McGill are buildings with ventilation. The university claims campus buildings are well-ventilated, which protects against the virus and reduces the risk of spread.
In September, the university claimed that 85 per cent of its community was fully vaccinated, according to numbers from the Ministère de la Santé et des Services Sociaux. However, only 74 per cent of Quebec’s population is fully vaccinated. This high percentage of Quebec citizens unvaccinated likely led to the fourth wave of COVID-19 seen in September. McGill tracks its own cases which are updated every Tuesday and indicates if there was any community transmission of the virus. The university also claims to notify individuals who have been in moderate or high-risk contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19, and has the contacts self-isolate and get tested. Students and faculty, however, have expressed concern over the adequacy and transparency of the university’s contact-tracing methods. 
Though the vaccine is heavily encouraged, there are currently no vaccination clinics on McGill’s campus. There was a vaccination clinic available to students and faculty at the beginning of the semester, but those looking to get vaccinated now would have to get vaccinated at an off-campus location. As for students on the Macdonald campus, there are also no on-campus clinics, leaving few convenient options for students looking to get vaccinated. In addition to the lack of vaccination clinics, the university also does not provide on-campus COVID-19 testing – students must book their own testing appointments. This is due to Quebec’s decision to not include universities as part of their designated testing centers.  
McGill provides self-assessment symptom forms and has laid out a written plan with steps for someone who thinks they may have been exposed to COVID-19. With approximately 85 per cent of classes being held in-person and many of these classes with no online option, there is an added risk of COVID spreading in classrooms. Professors are not required to wear masks in the room which again adds an additional risk. 
“Countdown to a Safe Campus” expressed its disappointment at the university’s continued refusal to implement a vaccine mandate and wrote a message in its most recent post directed towards McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier. The message pushed the precedence of the collective good over individual liberty and to avoid taking actions that divide the community. It also noted that, “If McGill is the great university it claims to be, it can listen and learn from its own distinguished honorary degree recipient [Dr. Fauci].”
