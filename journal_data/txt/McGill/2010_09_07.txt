Principal Heather Munroe-Blum gave a presentation earlier today to the National Assembly’s Commission de la culture et de l’education, presenting the case for increased provincial funding to the university and explaining McGill’s increasing focus on graduate research. In a document leaked to the Daily that provided the basis for Munroe-Blum’s presentation, the principal outlines the university’s changing priorities. Attached is the Administration’s submission to the Commission.
Priorities
