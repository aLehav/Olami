Montreal organization looks to follow similar model 
On September 30, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) would be allowed to continue running InSite for Community Safety, North America’s only supervised injection site.
InSite receives an average of 855 visits and administers about 587 injections per day. There have been 221 overdose interventions and no fatalities, along with over 5,268 referrals to detox or addictions services in 2010.
The Supreme Court ruling comes after attempts by the federal government to shut down InSite based on its presumed violation of the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
The court ruled that the “federal government’s decision was an infringement of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is the right to life, liberty, and security of the person.”
At InSite, people can inject pre-obtained substances under the supervision of a medical professional, receive free clean injectable supplies (syringes, cookers, filters, water, and tourniquets), and see an addiction counsellor.
British Columbia’s Ministry of Health funds InSite through VCH, which provides the healthcare component while their contracted partner, PHS Community Services Society, provides counselling services.
Out of Vancouver’s $44 million addiction services budget, InSite’s operational budget required only $3 million last fiscal year.
McGill law professor Richard Janda spoke to how InSite operated prior to the court ruling.
“InSite was initially allowed to run under an exemption…but the Minister of Health withdrew it, and the federal government said InSite couldn’t run anymore,” Janda explained.
According to him, the case sets a legal precedent not only as the first supervised injection site, but also because of the “interaction between the Charter of Rights and who has jurisdiction over health matters.”
Janda also noted that, prior to the court ruling, there was confusion over which branch of government had jurisdiction over safe injection sites: provincial governments are in charge of health care, while the federal government in Ottawa controls criminal law. However, in the case of safe injections, the Charter trumped both levels of government.
Janda explained that “the court is saying that, if the federal government fails to protect the Charter, then provincial authorities can come in and do that.”
“If there’s a framework set up by the city or province, the Supreme Court has said that it’s possible [to have such a site],” Janda continued.
This has led to talks of supervised injection sites following the InSite model being opened in the province of Quebec.
Quebec’s Health and Social Services Minister Yves Bolduc told the Globe and Mail that Quebec clinics would not function as “one big single clinic like InSite” but rather “a model that will be socially acceptable, softer” and will meet the needs of the local population.
It is yet to be determined whether a supervised injection site will be opened in Montreal. However, the legal framework to establish one now exists.
The Montreal organization Cactus, which was the first needle exchange program in North America, would like to see a supervised injection site established to supplement its other services, which include counselling, distribution of free birth control and safe sex products, and syringe recuperation.
When asked about a similar clinic opening in Montreal, Anna Marie D’Angelo, senior media relations officer at VCH, explained that “Montreal health officials need to decide for themselves” on the right course of action.
Since InSite opened in 2003, there have been several peer-reviewed studies of its positive effects on the community, including reduced crime and HIV/AIDS rates.
D’Angelo added that InSite also reduces the demand for first responders, such as ambulances and police.
Cailin Rodgers, spokesperson for Health Canada, said that, though disappointed, Health Canada would comply with the court’s decision.
“We believe that the system should be focused on preventing people from becoming drug addicts. Our government believes that spending money on treatment and support to help get people off drugs is the best investment we can make,” said Rogers.
“A key pillar of our National Anti-Drug Strategy is prevention and treatment for those with drug dependencies,” she continued. “As part of the strategy, we have made significant investments to strengthen existing treatment efforts through the Treatment Action Plan.”
D’Angelo spoke about whether InSite condones drug use.
“The doctors and healthcare providers discourage [drug use],” she said, adding that “calling [InSite] safe is incorrect…it is never safe, but in a supervised manner.”

MoA negotiations continue
SSMU has yet to receive its student fees for this academic year, as negotiations surrounding the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with McGill continue almost five months after the former MoA’s expiry.
According to the previous MoA, McGill would advance SSMU its portion of student fees – calculated based on projected income from student fees to the University – on September 15. Any extra fees given to SSMU would be refunded to the University later in the year.
Since there is currently no active MoA, the University has no obligation to grant SSMU its fees by September 15, and is therefore withholding the funds until a new MoA is signed.
SSMU President Maggie Knight explained that McGill is open to giving SSMU its student fees in increments if MoA negotiations continue through November.
“Fortunately, SSMU is in a robust financial position, so, even though we don’t have our fees and we won’t be getting the interest we normally would, SSMU is doing fine,” she said.
The only outstanding item on the negotiating table is Appendix G of the MoA – a list of all of the clubs and services under the purveyance of SSMU.
The use of the McGill name by student groups has been a contentious issue, and it  appears that the majority of student groups will be facing name changes.
“We’re happy with the current state of negotiations, in which students will be able to use the McGill name within certain parameters, but, obviously, it presents a problem for existing groups, especially McGill Outdoors Club and McGill Nightline,” said Knight, highlighting the difficulty caused to McGill student groups with long histories.
“We understand the concerns of the University,” said Knight about matters regarding liability, fundraising issues, and blurred lines surrounding the ownership of these names.
“However, as we have seen recently from the principal, ‘We are all McGill.’ It’s unfortunate we haven’t been able to get the University to agree to grandfather the names of these longstanding clubs,” she added, referencing Principal Heather Munroe-Blum’s recent email to McGill staff and students regarding the University’s ongoing labour dispute with striking non-academic workers.
Knight said that SSMU has been working extensively to understand the rationale behind the requested name changes, but that the University’s stance on particular names has shifted throughout the negotiations. According to Knight, the word “club” seems sufficient in most cases to denote a student-run group that is unaffiliated with McGill, but “collective” is often problematic.
Julian Cooper, an executive member of the McGill Outdoors Club (MOC), said the group had known about the McGill name issue since the summer. “We were just wondering when they were going to come for us,” he said of McGill’s request to change the group’s name to McGill Student Outdoors Club (MSOC).
“We’re also involved with a lot of outside groups, so changing our name is a lot more than adding an ‘s’ to our acronym,” said Cooper.
The MOC, founded in 1936, is one of groups with whom SSMU consulted for new name proposals.
“Maggie [Knight] tried to explain the situation, but it still left us feeling dissatisfied because all of our proposals had been rejected [by the administration],” explained Cooper.
Inan-Ul Haq, another MOC executive, expressed concern about the degree of leverage that SSMU holds in negotiations with the University.  “I think their hands are tied in a lot of ways,” he added.
VP Clubs and Services Carol Fraser will be speaking with all of the affected clubs and services in the next several weeks.
After nearly two and a half years of negotiation on the issue, “finally, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. I’m just looking forward to getting to support clubs and services in the work they’re supposed to be doing,” she said.

Faced with an apparent gridlock at the bargaining table, the union representing teaching assistants (TAs) at McGill voted last Wednesday to initiate pressure tactics in hopes of moving negotiations forward.
The General Assembly of the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) was attended by over 100 TAs, who voted overwhelmingly in favor of the use of pressure tactics, according to Jonathan Mooney, an AGSEM negotiator.
The vote comes after five months of negotiations that have seen McGill reject most of the union’s core demands.
Union officials were quick to stress that the authorized pressure tactics did not include any kind of strike or work stoppage, which would need to be authorized by a separate vote.
The authorization of pressure tactics explains the appearance of a number of AGSEM posters that have appeared around campus detailing the union’s talking points.
Union officials called off an action last Friday, based on “progress” made at the evening bargaining session on October 20 on the issue of TA training.
According to Mooney, the union and McGill signed off on two “non-core” clauses. Only a handful of clauses have been signed over the past five months, he said.
The administration declined to comment about the negotiations,  but Mooney said there has been no progress on any of the union’s other primary demands. The union is asking for a three per cent pay raise, caps on the sizes of conferences and labs, the hiring of more TAs, and mandatory meetings with course supervisors.
McGill is offering the province-mandated 1.2 per cent pay increase, which union officials say pales in comparison to a 3.1 per cent rate of Canadian inflation.
While declining to say what other pressure tactics AGSEM had in store, Mooney said that any pressure tactic would “respect the McGill community.”
“Students can expect that there will be no work stoppage whatsoever. Our TAs will continue to perform their duties with the same skill and diligence that they always do,” he said.
“We consider professors and students to be allies and stakeholders in these negotiations.”
AGSEM went on strike in the spring of 2008, and the work stoppage delayed the release of course grades well into the summer.

Students argue for right to conscientiously object
McGill Senate voted on Wednesday against a motion for academic amnesty for students in times of strikes and lockouts. The student-authored motion was subject to amendments and extensive debate before being defeated 44 to 26, with three abstentions.
The motion was introduced after a period of discussion about the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strike, now entering its eighth week, and discussion about the right of faculty members to hold classes off-campus to avoid crossing picket lines.
Several members of the gallery wore MUNACA pins while Senators questioned the administration on its handling of the situation.
Senators raised concerns about the dissemination of information regarding the strike. Principal Heather Munroe-Blum refuted their claims, saying that campus media coverage and demonstrations in support of MUNACA mean that the issue “has certainly gone beyond having a one-sided view on anything.”
Email updates from the administration were also discussed. Munroe-Blum, who sent a University-wide email on October 18 denouncing MUNACA’s actions during Homecoming events, said that the message was “the only time I’ve spoken out in the context of the strike.” She called the actions of MUNACA members at Homecoming “beyond the pale.”
“I spoke from the heart, and I believe that the Thursday [strike] reports [from Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa] have been factually based,” Munroe-Blum added.
SSMU VP University Affairs Emily Clare introduced the motion for academic amnesty for students. The motion requested that the “Senate grant the right to Academic Amnesty, as outlined in the provisions below, for all students in the case of a strike or lock-out involving a McGill affiliated organization.” It would allow students to “abstain from participating in academic commitments” for up to three working days, as a means of expressing conscientious objection to a strike or lockout.
The document outlined a number of provisions, including notifying faculty members 72 hours before the date that amnesty would apply. Amnesty would not be applied to assignments worth 35 per cent or more, pre-scheduled mid-terms, final examinations, or mandatory clinicals, field placements, and rehearsals.
Clare explained that the idea was brought up at the first Senate meeting of the year.
“There was a discussion of the implications of a strike on students and different members of the community,” she said. “One of the professors had raised the idea of what would happen if academic amnesty was brought forward by a member of the community.”
Student senators conducted research into the history of academic amnesty motions at McGill and other universities.
“We went and got extensive consultation, we talked to almost all the faculties, at least some representatives of students within the faculties to see how they felt about it,” Clare explained. “Additionally, we went into the history at McGill, how many times the motion has been brought up and the like, how it did, what were the major arguments against it. Carleton also had a motion that they put forward at senate last year… That, too, was shut down.”
The motion faced argument from administrative figures, even after two amendments. Many of the arguments focused on pragmatic aspects of the motion. Dean of Law Daniel Jutras called the proposal “simply unmanageable,” while Dean of Science Martin Grant felt that the policy would lead to “chaos.”
Management Senator, and former Daily Web Editor, Tom Acker rebutted the claim by stressing that the policy would “not add significant strain” to administrative work, and that it had been framed to “make sure that students do not abuse this situation,” while SSMU President Maggie Knight pointed out that reasonable accommodation is already made for religious holidays.
The question of allowing for students’ moral positions was also brought up, with several senators voicing the opinion that students should accept penalties for missing class and academic commitments. Provost Anthony Masi pointed out that similar motions had been voted down in Senate  three times before, and said that students should “live with the consequences” of their actions.
“I should not have to choose between my academic future and moral obligation,” said Arts Senator Matthew Crawford. Knight also pointed out that students on scholarship or other constraints would not have the ability to accept the consequences of missing classes.
A motion to vote by secret ballot was defeated 36 to 34, with two abstentions, before the vote on the motion itself.
Despite defeat, student senators have not abandoned the proposal. “I think some of the senators may be interested on pursuing this on a faculty level,” Clare said.
“This might be something that needs to be brought to the faculty level, and maybe people will be more open to it… if it’s tailored to the needs of a specific community,” she added.

New owner raises rent while shelter experiences financial setbacks
The Animal Rescue Network (ARN), a non-profit shelter for displaced and abused cats, is being forced to vacate their current location due to a rent increase and failure to meet building standards.
The ARN was founded in 1994 by Barbara Lisbona, describing itself as “Montreal’s largest no-kill shelter dedicated to the welfare of abused and abandoned animals.”
Currently, the shelter is operated by approximately 150 volunteers and is home to more than 300 cats. If the shelter is unable to relocate to a financially feasible and physically acceptable location, the cats will have to be euthanized.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) will take the animals and euthanize them if the shelter cannot find a new site.
Suzy Slavin, a McGill librarian and longtime volunteer at  the ARN, spoke to The Daily about the shelter’s future.
“We have no Plan B,” she said.
Lisbona’s public relations liaison, Cynthia Marajda, explained that, after the change in ownership of the shelter’s building in December 2010, renting conditions changed, and the ARN was presented with a substantial rent increase.
There are no legal restrictions on rent increases for commercial properties. Marajda explained that, though the ARN pays the monthly rent in their Rosemont location, the shelter is not protected by a lease.
“It was evident that we would need to move rather than sign the lease as it was presented,” she said.
Marajda added that ARN will be “under strict pressure to leave” once the building finds a new tenant.
“The first and largest obstacle is the city’s zoning restrictions,” she said. “Each municipal district is operated under its own regulations and each municipality must be contacted to determine legal zones for animal shelters.”
Since the shelter is entirely run on volunteer support, accessibility and safety for volunteers are important criteria for the shelter’s new location. In addition to finding a new location, budgetary setbacks are presenting a large challenge for the shelter.
“The money doesn’t come from any larger funder,” explained Slavin. “All of our donations come from people we’ve made contact with…you know, people who read about us and have given some thought to the shelter.”
Slavin said donations ranged from $10 to $100.
“And I can tell you, I open all the envelopes. There are not a lot of $100 donations, and we are nowhere near the amount that we need,” said Slavin.
ARN is a no-kill shelter, which means that all cats taken in by the ARN are tested for Feline Leukemia Virus and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, vaccinated, and cared for.
“For us, they all stay – the ones that come in,” she said. “This means sometimes we have to say no at the door, sometimes when we don’t have rooms. And, right now, we don’t have enough space for all the cats that need our help.”
City policies have not responded to the circumstances facing the ARN and other non-profit animal shelters such as the Rosie Animal Adoption (RAA).
Anne Dube from the RAA, a non-profit adoption program for homeless dogs, said that, “In Quebec, there is still the farmer’s mentality… I spoke with a member of Parliament [about the issue] – they did not seem interested.”
Dube added that, “High volume, low-cost spay and neuter clinics must open…if we want to see changes in Quebec. Laws must be changed and make fines a lot heftier.”
Currently, there is no government funding reserved for animal shelters, with the exception of the SPCA,  and the city has not revised their zoning regulations.
“This has to change,” said Marajda. “Education and effective legislation are needed now.”
