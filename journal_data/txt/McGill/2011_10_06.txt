The McGill administration has claimed that MUNACA is demanding a 28.9% pay increase over three years of the collective agreement. Here’s where this number comes from. 

Note: The original version of this info-graphic stated that a 1.2 per cent increase is the minimum mandated by the government. This is not the case, and this version has been corrected to reflect that.

Union “mulling over” possible conflict of interest from first ruling
The emergency injunction against the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) was extended on Monday for another ten days. It now expires on October 13, the date of the next conciliation meeting between MUNACA and McGill.
The extension upholds the orders of the initial injunction granted on September 23 by the Quebec Superior Court. The injunction requires restrictions on picketers’ proximity to campus, group size, and noise level.
Vice Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael DiGrappa spoke to The Daily about Monday’s extension.
“My understanding is that both parties appeared – the union didn’t object to the injunction being renewed, so it was extended for a period of ten days,” he said.
Kevin Whittaker, president of MUNACA, explained why the union did not object to the injunction’s extension.
“If we object then we have to go to court and it becomes this long drawn-out thing, and it wasn’t worthwhile,” he explained. “We’re waiting until the next decision, which will be on the 13th, and that’s when we’ll be able to act.”
“Right now we know how to deal with the injunction and the limits that it’s imposed, and we’re willing to go through the next ten days with that, but at the closure of the ten days we will be reacting to any further action that McGill may be proposing.”
“It was noted that we did not agree to the extension – that was it,” Whittaker added. For him, Monday’s extension was “fully expected.”
“We had been planning for something like this. As we said last week, we changed our strategy. We were picketing at some of the Board of Governors’ businesses, and we will continue to do different sites throughout this week,” he said.
On Monday, MUNACA workers picketed outside of the workplaces of four members of McGill’s Board of Governors: Stuart Cobbett, Kathy Fazel, Martine Turcotte and Thierry Vandal.
The extension of the injunction was presided over by Superior Court judge Clément Trudell. Brian Riordan, a former McGill Fellow and a graduate of the University, judged the initial granting of the injunction.
Whittaker noted the change in judges; however, he told The Daily that Riordan’s ties to McGill did not affect the outcome of the judgment on September 23.
“The judgment was not unusual, that he [Riordan] gave us, so to say that it was favouritism is not an issue for us. We’re not thinking that at all,” he said.
“But it’s just a matter of, legally, are there any grounds or recourses that we can take because of that information, and we haven’t got a clear answer yet.”
Whittaker said that he is waiting on a report from MUNACA’s legal team, which is currently “mulling over” the viability of a conflict of interest case against Riordan.

On Tuesday, former Bloc Québécois MP Daniel Paillé declared his intention to run for leadership of the party, joining MPs Jean-François Fortin for the Haute-Gaspésie-La-Mitis-Matapédia riding and Maria Mourani for the Ahuntsic riding.
During the May 2 federal election, the Bloc – formerly known as the Federal Sovereigntist Party – lost 43 out of their previous 47 seats. With only four MPs remaining, the Bloc does not hold an official party status in the House of Commons.
On the night of the party’s defeat, former party head Gilles Duceppe announced his retirement from the Bloc’s leadership, a position he held for 14 years.
Regarding the Bloc’s current status in Quebec, Mourani said in French that support for the party was still “very much alive within Quebec.”
“The Bloc Québécois will continue to promote Quebec’s interest…it’s important that the party represents the voice of Quebec.”
But Quebec sovereignty no longer appears a central issue for many Quebeckers, especially the province’s younger generations.
Marc Olivier Brouillette, a McGill science student and Montrealer said that while there is a Quebec culture that needs to be preserved and promoted, “trying to become a separate country won’t accomplish anything.”
He also added, “It’s important to not have two separate governments, but to have one unified government under Canada.”
Another U1 McGill student and Quebecker, Nick Wathier from St. Henri, spoke to the Bloc’s prominent advocacy for Quebec sovereignty.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea. It’s in the middle of the country; [why] split it in half?”
David Dubois, the Head of Communications for Québec Solidaire, a provincial sovereigntist party, spoke to the need for a reforming Quebec sovereigntism.
“The idea of sovereignty has always been present. [But] the historical sovereigntist movement is experiencing a crisis, it’s undeniable. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink the strategy…we believe that a winning strategy [should]…represent Quebec in all its components: regions, minorities, gender et cetera,” he said in French.
In regards to the future of Quebec’s sovereigntist parties, Dubois continued that “Quebec’s march of independence cannot be used for resentment. It is therefore important to imagine a strategy where the actions for Quebec are…innovative socially and economically.”

Increases set to begin in 11 months
At around 3 p.m. Tuesday afternoon, the remnants of a 400-person demonstration against impending tuition hikes were milling around in front of Roddick Gates, wondering what to do next.
“Alright, we’re going into McGill!” shouted one protester in English.
With that, the crowd poured loudly onto campus, walking up to the Arts building as McGill Security reached for walkie talkies, breaking the seal on tuition protests this year at McGill.
The issue
The march started almost two kilometres away in Square St. Louis, where students – predominantly from the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) and local CEGEPs – gathered and began marching south down St. Denis.
“It’s kind of a spontaneous movement which takes its root in the anger that students in Quebec felt about the high increase in [tuition] fees,” said Mathieu, a UQAM student who asked to be identified only by his first name.
“We think that as a project of society, we should push towards free education so everyone, from the poor to rich, have the same right to post-education,” he continued.
Last March, Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand announced that tuition for university students will increase by $325 a year for five years starting in September 2012.
The McGill administration maintains that the increases are necessary to address the underfunding of Quebec universities.
By 2017, when the hikes end, Quebec tuition will still be lower than the Canadian average. The University has budgeted a $6 million deficit this year, with the goal of breaking even by the 2014 fiscal year.
However, students are concerned any tuition hikes could threaten accessibility. As the march entered Berri-UQAM metro station, chanting in French through various UQAM buildings, Andrée Bounbeau, another UQAM student, said she had already been hurt by hikes of $100 per year since 2007.
“I think that education must be free, it must be accessible to everyone. So I just hope that a demonstration like this can occur more often so we can put pressure on the government,” she said.
Bounbeau, who graduates at the end of the school year, said she was protesting as much for herself as for future university students who will have to pay the higher fees.
“When I talk to parents they tell me, ‘Oh, I’m so glad that you’re doing this, because you are doing this for our children, and we are very afraid we won’t be able to pay the fees,” she continued.
Ariane Turmel-Chénaud, a student at the CEGEP du Vieux Montréal, said it’s the younger students about to enter university who will be impacted most by increased tuition.
“I am in CEGEP and I want to go to university next year. I have no idea how I will pay my tuition. That’s how it goes. If there’s no way to go, well, poverty will not be a choice,” she said in French.
Not all students oppose the tuition hikes. As the demonstrators poured back outside, heading east on René Lévesque, André, an UQAM Business School student – who asked that only his last name be used – sat on a nearby bench going over class notes with a friend.
“[Demonstrating], that’s mostly for the Humanities and the Social Science [students],” said André. “We are in Business, so we don’t vote for that.”
“I think [tuition increases are] a good idea, seriously, because I think we take the students for clients instead of to be the fixture of the society,” he continued.
Spreading solidarity
It was on René Lévesque that green pins supporting the striking McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) began appearing. Dave Howden, Labour Relations Officer for the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE), attended the demonstration.
“I think it’s important to keep [solidarity] going in multiple directions and remember that students are struggling for cheaper and higher quality education at the same time as MUNACA workers and other workers at McGill are fighting for better working conditions and more access to means of existence,” he said.
“McGill and the government and various structures that we’re up against are always looking for ways to pit those interests against each other, but they’re not contradictory interests. We all share an interest in having a quality workplace, a quality learning environment for the students where we can all do without being crippled by debt,” Howden continued.
Marie Thomas, an administrative coordinator with Midnight Kitchen (MK), attended the demonstration after MK tried to organize a McGill contingent.
“I think tuition should be free for everyone,” she said. “I think the MUNACA issue is just part of a bigger issue of justice, social justice issues, in the education system.”
Reactions to the protest 
In an interview with The Daily the next day, SSMU VP External Joel Pedneault – who was not present at the demonstration – said he saw it as “a really positive thing that they came up to campus,” but noted that it wasn’t the first time Quebec university students had come onto campus, giving examples of instances in 1968 and 1969.
Two engineering students, collecting donations for breast cancer research outside Roddick Gates, explained their reactions to the march turning up McGill College and heading towards them last week.
“That’s a big-ass protest coming our way, and we’re kind of in the middle of it,” said one.
A recent McGill graduate who witnessed the protest, international student Ziyad Shukri, said he doubted the demonstration would be very effective.
“I was a student at McGill, every year my tuition went up by five to eight per cent, and I used to pay, it started off as $514 per credit, and it ended up being $660 by the time I graduated. So tuition hikes are something really normal,” he said.
Once the march crossed into McGill, student reactions were mixed.
Michael Sherman, a U3 Arts student also watching the demonstration, said he wasn’t very familiar with the student’s issues.
“I wish I knew more about what’s going on, because it seems pretty intense,” he said.
As marchers gathered, chanting “McGill avec nous!”, few McGill students joined the protest. Micha Stettin, Arts representative to SSMU, was one of them. He addressed the demonstrators through a megaphone.
“I want to say, first of all, that McGill is with you,” he said. “This isn’t about English versus French, because it’s more important than that.”
Pedneault said McGill students often don’t feel included in the issue because of either a lack of information on the subject, or because of the language barrier in Quebec.
“Hopefully [Tuesday’s demonstration will] draw attention to what’s going to be a big fight in student action this year,” he continued.
Police Presence
As the remaining demonstrators crowded the steps in front of the Arts building, two officers from the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) watched from a few feet away, mounted on bicycles.
“This is a manifestation, so we are just following the manifestation to be sure that they won’t break anything and everything will be all right,” said one officer, who also said the SPVM had been in contact with McGill Security.
Both Howden and Mathieu pointed out the correlation between the large police presence and tuition increases.
“It’s about the choices the government chooses to make, where they choose to cut money and where they chose to invest money,” said Howden. “We see police budgets rising, as an example that money could be going into education or to lower tuition.”
“What do we want as a society, more cops? Or more hospitals, more school?” asked Mathieu.
“[They say] ‘when you open a school you close a prison.’ Actually the government is doing the exact opposite. So we think to show our opposition that we should take out onto the street to inform the government that their position is not the only one in society.”

More protests planned as Keystone XL pipeline undergoes public hearings in the U.S. 
Approximately four hundred demonstrators gathered on Parliament Hill on September 26 in a peaceful protest of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.
In a symbolic act of civil disobedience, protesters crossed the security perimeter set up by the RCMP and sat down, holding hands. Although 117 protesters were arrested, witnesses from both sides said that the demonstration was calm and well-organized.
Maude Barlow, national chairperson of the Council of Canadians, was one of the first to be arrested for trespassing and obstruction of a police officer. However, charges for every person arrested were later changed to a $65 provincial trespassing fine.
“It was very moving, very peaceful, very joyful,” said Barlow, “but very clearly deliberate about why we were there, what we hoped to get from the day and…the determination that this was maybe a new phase in the struggle against the tar sands and against Canada’s terrible energy policy.”
Proposed by TransCanada Corporation in 2005, the Keystone XL pipeline would transport 700,000 barrels of bitumen per day from northern Alberta to refineries in America. Bitumen is a dense form of petroleum found in a mixture of sand an clay known colloquially as tar sands. The tar sands extraction process has been heavily criticized in recent years for damaging the environment and the health of local communities.
The project was approved in Canada on March 11, 2010 by the National Energy Board, and is currently undergoing hearings in the United States regarding whether or not it would be in the best interest of Americans.
According to the CBC, the Canadian portion of the project will extend for 529 kilometres and cost $1.7 billion.
Canadian supporters of the pipeline, which include the Canadian government and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, claim the project would create more jobs in Canada.
It’s opponents have a different view, however. “It’s exactly the opposite… It’s taking jobs away,” said Barlow. “It’s leaving the pollution, but exporting the jobs.”
Daniel Kessler,  communications manager for the Rainforest Action Network, helped plan the protest.
“People have been saying that the tar sands are an absolute blight to the country and that we’re becoming a sort of extraction colony that is only exporting natural resources,” he said.
According to participants, the protesters placed a strong emphasis on the symbolic nature of the demonstration.
Stephen McMurtry, a Sustainable Energy Engineering Masters student at Carleton University, told The Daily that, “When it came time for me to go across, I linked arms with the people beside me…and we just kind of walked towards the fence. It was a really low fence – it was a very symbolic thing. There were even a couple step-ladders over it so that people could cross more easily. It was all very pre-planned and not some sort of antagonistic thing.”
“We hadn’t gone for big numbers,” said Barlow. “We wanted a direct action and a particular kind of action and therefore we wanted people who would cross the line…we were very pleased with the number who came out.”
In a press release the same day, Superintendent Luc Lemire, Officer in Charge of General Duty Protective Policing and Incident Director for the event, said he was pleased with the level of cooperation between the RCMP and protest organizers.
“From the start we were able to work together, which allowed the RCMP to fulfill its mandate and keep everyone safe on Parliament Hill while allowing the protestors an opportunity to express themselves in a safe and secure manner,” he said.
Kessler said another protest is being planned for November 6 in Washington, D.C.,  and that he expects between five and ten thousand people to attend.
“We’re going to be holding hands around the White House to show our solidarity with Americans who are saying one last time to [President Barack] Obama, ‘Take the right position here, do not allow this pipeline,’” said Barlow. “This will just continue and we’ll get more and more people…until people start to ask, ‘Why are these people doing this?’ When we can explain to them, ‘Well, we’re doing it for your health, and for your children’s health, and for the environmental sanity of our planet.’ More and more people will come on board.”

Secret ballot cuts undergraduate voting members by 75 per cent
Concordia’s Board of Governors, the highest decision-making body of the university, is set to cut its membership from 40 to 25. This move, in response to criticisms of Board misgovernance, will see undergraduate student representation cut from four fully voting members to one.
Previously, there was one undergraduate representative for every 8, 805 students on the Board, but, with amended membership, a single undergraduate member will represent all 35,408 Concordia Student Union (CSU) members. The single representative of graduate students will remain on the Board.
After a week of pressure from the CSU before the vote, the Board included a second undergraduate student position on the board as an alternate governor.  While occupying committee positions and exercising speaking rights at all meetings, this alternate governor has no vote unless the undergraduate representative is not present.
The university “felt that this was a good compromise to allow students to have a voice,” said Chris Mota, the head of Concordia’s media relations, on the decision to add an alternate undergraduate governor to the Board.
The CSU is not satisfied with this inclusion of a non-voting student presence.
“We don’t want your sympathy, we want a vote,” said CSU president Lex Gill on the decrease of student representation.  She sees the addition of an alternate governor as a sign that “they have acknowledged there’s a problem and found a completely inadequate solution.”
The university cites two documents as the impetus for changes to the Board’s membership.
Bill 38, a provincial bill that would mandate standardized restrictions on university governance across Quebec, including limited internal university representation.  The bill, proposed in 2009, was quickly tabled after criticism from all levels of university governance, and shows no sign of being immediately brought back to the table for consideration.
The second document is the External Governance Review Committee report released earlier this year.  Former McGill Principal Bernard Shapiro chaired this committee, charged with reviewing Concordia’s governance structures.
The recommendations to downsize the Board came as an attempt to increase governance efficiency.
Mota commended the changes for helping to bring the university’s governance in line with the governance structures of other universities across the province.  There are currently 25 members on the McGill Board, with one voting undergraduate representative – a similar composition to the proposed Concordia Board.
“The university feels that all of these measures are moving toward progress,” said Mota.  Concerning the issue of decreased student representation, Mota told The Daily that “clearly the board felt that this was an appropriate move for the time, recognizing that students would not be happy.”
SSMU VP University Affairs Emily Yee Clare addressed the assumption that a smaller board will necessarily bring increased efficiency.  “You may increase the efficiency in terms of time, but increasingly the overall dynamism of the group and the ability to represent one’s constituency is a different matter.  It shouldn’t be a question of numbers.”
The vote on this motion to cut the Board’s membership numbers did not go unchallenged during the Board’s meeting on September 28.  “We did everything procedurally possible to stop [the vote],” said Gill.
The chair of the board, Peter Kruyt, decided to call a vote by secret ballot, and, when challenged on this decision, Gill said that Kruyt decided it is not permissible to challenge the decision of the chair.
According to Gill, when a student gallery member challenged Kruyt’s actions as undemocratic, Rita de Santis, a Board member and member of the Ad Hoc Governance Review Committee – which authored the motion – responded, “We’ll talk about democracy later.”
This was the prelude to Kruyt’s telling Gill, “We’re done, we’re done, we’re done,” after she challenged the decision to hold the vote by secret ballot.
At this point, student representatives walked out of the meeting in protest.
The new composition of the Board is required to take full effect by September 2012. In the meantime, positions will be gradually phased out throughout the year.

The Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS) Council met for the first time this year on Tuesday.
Objections were raised to a resolution opposing McGill’s recent court injunction limiting the campus picketing activities of the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strikers.  The resolution, proposed by VP Finance Nicolas Chatel-Lamay, was amended to address the injunction while focusing primarily on support for “the right of McGill workers to express themselves through a peaceful picket line.”
Discussion revolved around whether picketing on the downtown campus had been conducted peacefully before McGill had won the injunction.
Chatel-Lamay noted a difference in tone between the MUNACA demonstrations downtown and those held on the Macdonald campus. “What’s happening on this campus is security guards are smiling and taking coffee with the workers. That’s not happening downtown,” he said.
Hesitance to fully condone downtown strikers’ activities led Council to amend the resolution, which passed unanimously.
McGill originally sought the court injunction, which restricts the size, location, and noise level of pickets, on September 23. It has now been extended until October 13.
Two representatives from McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS) won a unanimous MCSS endorsement for their sustainability policies, which include efforts to better incorporate local, organic, sustainable and whole foods into their operations and increase purchasing from the Macdonald farm to supply both McGill campuses. Council agreed to endorse the policies, with a verbal assurance that student-run food operations would not be curtailed as long as they observed MFDS sustainability standards.
Darya Nanova, a representative for the Ukrainian Canadian Students’ Union’s nationwide food drive effort, spoke about the initiative and requested space on the Macdonald campus. The group is organizing the food drive to raise awareness about the Holodomor famine of the 1930’s, which killed several million Ukrainians. Proceeds will be donated to local food banks in early December.
Council also reviewed and approved new club constitutions, club funding requests, and the fall budget.
Preparations were discussed for halloween celebrations and for the Thanksgiving Hoe-Down party, to be held in a barn on Macdonald campus over Thanksgiving weekend.

EUS concerned that supporting MUNACA would alienate constituents 
After an hour-long debate on Monday, a motion calling for the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) to stand in solidarity with striking non-academic workers was withdrawn.
The McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) has been on strike since September 1.
EUS representatives to SSMU Alex Kunev and Tariq Khan moved the motion, which called for a speedy resolution to the strike, as well as for “the EUS [to] organize a rally to pressure the McGill administration to put an end to the negotiations insofar as it favors the main demands of the MUNACA.”
Wade Reda, Civil Engineering representative, was the first to speak against the motion.
“I don’t think it’s in our priorities to take a stand with MUNACA, because I personally see MUNACA right now as a kidnapper…you don’t negotiate with kidnappers,” Reda said.
“I think we should take a stance against MUNACA, keep pressure on them, instead of being against our own university,” he continued.
The debate soon split into two camps – one in favour of the motion, and one favouring no EUS position – with the majority of Council falling into the latter.
Connor Simpson, Mining Engineering representative, said it was in the interest of EUS to put pressure on both sides.
“Seeing as EUS has no allegiance to either McGill or MUNACA it seems kind of silly to side with MUNACA,” Simpson said. “I think all that’s in our interest is to have the strike end as quickly as possible.”
David Bailey, Mechanical Engineering representative, noted that, given the controversial nature of the issue, any position would alienate a large number of Engineering students.
“EUS can support one side or the other. It’s really not going to make a huge difference, and the internal divisions that it creates would be a far worse consequence.”
Kunev went on describe how a similar motion recently failed at Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Council.
“And we don’t want to be AUS Council,” he said.
EUS VP Internal Paul Novel, said that EUS should focus on issues that it has influence over, namely the EUS’ conflict with the administration over its use of the McGill name in its logo, and the administration’s unilateral reappointment of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson.
“I think that these issues affect students a lot more, and we have a lot more power over them, and they’re within our mandate as the EUS,” he said.
EUS President Josh Redel said that he didn’t want EUS to “fall into the same hole” as SSMU, which recently renewed its blanket policy supporting worker’s struggles.
“Furthermore, when I’m sitting in my office and they’re holding strike updates outside of it, and they’re proud that they’re disrupting classes and delaying deliveries, I am never going to support that,” Redel said.
“It’s not just McGill that is not negotiating well. To be frank, if over – however many – 28 meetings over four months, neither group can make any progress at any ways to reform, that’s not just McGill,” he continued.
The motion was withdrawn soon after a five-minute recess, in which many councilors took to debating outside the procedural constraints of Robert’s Rules.
After the motion was withdrawn, Khan noted in his report to Council that he was disappointed by some “very hostile comments” he received from other councilors.
“I think we need to get united on many matters over here,” he said. “We fought for the Arch Café, we rallied, but what happened? Nothing happened, because most of us, in our minds, thought that we students cannot do anything about issues going on on the campus.”
He concluded by saying that EUS should be idealistic and realistic at the same time, and that it was his and Kunev’s fault for not consulting further with councillors while drafting the motion.
“We will be re-drafting it, we will be rewriting together, and I encourage you all to work together towards it,” he said.

Sisters in Spirit march despite funding cuts 
The sixth annual Montreal Sisters in Spirit Memorial March and Vigil went ahead Tuesday, almost a year after the federal government pulled the funding meant to support the nationwide event.
Bridget Tolley, whose mother was struck and killed by a Sûreté du Québec police car in 2001, has helped organize the annual marches since 2005.
“We need to support the families, and we want to do whatever is possible to help the families. So tonight is for them, and we’re going to continue and remember our missing and murdered aboriginal women,” said Tolley to the crowd of almost 300 people.
Sisters in Spirit, a group within the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC), helped organize the marches every year until their funding was cut. The group also compiled data and research on missing and murdered native women in Canada. Until 1980, no such records existed in any form.
Today there are nearly 600 confirmed cases of missing and murdered aboriginal women.
Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, a member of Missing Justice – the aboriginal rights advocacy group that organized Tuesday’s march – said in an interview with The Daily that the government’s justification for pulling the funding was that “no more research was needed.”
The government has since folded the Sisters in Spirit database into a national database called Evidence in Action under the RCMP. Rolbin-Ghanie said the new database was “not in any way specific to native women.”
“And this is after the largest year of Sisters in Spirit vigils ever. Last year there were 86 – and even one down in Nicaragua – and the name Sisters in Spirit was really becoming well known. And this is when the government decides to yank all the funding,” said Rolbin-Ghanie.
One of the government’s stipulations in removing the funding was that NWAC could no longer use the name Sisters in Spirit. In response, members of Sisters in Spirit formed the group Families of Sisters in Spirit, who continue to help organize events to promote awareness around missing and murdered aboriginal women. This year, 51 vigils have taken place.
Ellen Gabriel, former president of the Quebec Native Women’s Association, said the government’s decision to move the funding from NWAC to the RCMP was especially problematic.
“[The RCMP are] the ones, the culprits, who have, through their apathy, done nothing to improve this situation,” said Gabriel.
Harvey Michele, an indigenous rights activist from the Ojibway Nation north of Thunder Bay, Ontario, said that six years of marches and vigils had not had much of a concrete effect on the rate of missing and murdered native women in Canada.
“More financial and human resources need to… look at the policy development, policy review, and empower the aboriginal women’s groups to examine their issues,” he said.
Rolbin-Ghanie noted that media and other institutions are starting to note the systemic nature of the problem, not “just isolated incidents of violence.”
“The pillars of Canadian society, what we consider to be integral, like the court system, the media, the government, and the police forces are definitely still profound contributors to the problem in a number of ways. So there’s still a lot of work to be done,” she added.
