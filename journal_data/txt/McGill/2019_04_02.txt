Just before 2 PM on Wednesday, March 27, a banner was dropped from the roof of Leacock above the corridor connecting to Arts. The banner read “CHANGE THE NAME.” Within five minutes, two McGill security officers appeared and began the process of removing the banner. By 2:05, the banner was taken down and confiscated by security. Security placed the banner into a campus security vehicle and drove away. Approximately 30 students were present to witness the unrolling and quick removal of the banner.
The demonstration, though anonymous, coincided with the voting period on the proposed Athletics Facility Improvement Fee. SSMU Indigenous Affairs, along with several other student groups endorsed a ‘no’ vote on the fee. For those opposed to the fee, voting yes means supporting an institution that remains hostile towards Indigenous students. Action has yet to be taken by the administration regarding the #changethename movement despite repeated voicing of Indigenous students’ concerns and majority student support. Certain students present also argued that the university’s inaction on the R*dmen name change is a testament to their refusal to support and listen to the needs of Indigenous students.
It is unknown who organized or displayed the banner, but the message to witnesses was clear. To them, removing the banner was a continuation of silencing of the voices fighting to change the racist name.

At Senate on March 27, Senator Angela Campbell presented the revised version of McGill’s Sexual Violence Policy, which passed at their meeting. The following day, an email was sent out to students detailing the changes to the policy and expressing the administration’s satisfaction with the policy’s developments.
In presenting the policy, Senator Campbell stated that immediately following its adoption, a standing committee would begin working to fully implement the policy, and that the working group would continue to meet to assess its effectiveness.
SSMU representative Andre Lametti voiced his disappointment with the policy. He expressed his opposition to statements, made in the previous meeting, that the administration had struck the correct balance between respecting students’ individual freedoms and protecting students from sexual violence. Speaking to the policy in general, Lametti stated that the complexity of the document meant that a simple yes or no vote would not fully do it justice. He also spoke to students’ concerns that the consultation process did not allow for their views to be fully reflected in the proposed policy. Senator Campbell responded, stating that though she shares Lametti’s disappointment at student dissatisfaction, she believes McGill’s policy to be a document that is already intrusive into students’ intimate lives.
The morning of the Senate meeting, the Sexual Assault Centre of McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS) released a letter expressing their dissatisfaction with the policy and their reservations about the issues that they felt were left unsolved. The letter recognized the progress made with the new policy, but ultimately expressed frustration with the administration’s refusal to explicitly prohibit all relationships between faculty and students, as well as the policy’s avoidance of recognizing unequal power dynamics in such relationships.
In voicing their discontent with the new policy, SACOMSS presented two demands to the administration: that the McGill administration publicly state their rationale for the decision to not prohibit all faculty-student relationships, and that McGill lobby the provincial government to extend privacy laws in order to enforce broader prohibitions at the University. During the Senate meeting, SSMU representative Madeline Wilson referenced SACOMSS’ letter and demands, asking if the University would entertain them. Senator Campbell responded by saying that both demands had been responded to already: the first demand has been outlined in a legal brief presented to the working committee,and the second has already been presented to the previous provincial government, and is not legally possible under Bill 151. She added that the newly-elected government has expressed that they have no intention of changing current privacy laws.
SSMU President Tre Mansdoefer echoed statements from other SSMU representatives, extending his support for a full prohibition and the council’s motion backing the stance. He stated that all SSMU members would be abstaining from the vote, as they do not feel that they can fully support the policy and cannot vote ‘no’ on a policy that has made marked improvements.
In closing the letter, SACOMSS stated that they cannot endorse McGill’s Sexual Violence Policy or support the administration’s responses to sexual violence. The Provost’s statement spoke to the need for continued work on the University’s policy, but offered no opportunity for students to voice their concerns with the current version. Documents from the Senate meeting state that the policy would be up for review again in March of 2022.

On January 23, 2019, the Science Undergraduate Society’s (SUS) representative to SSMU, Moses Milchberg, resigned for personal reasons. According to the SUS Constitution, by-elections to fill a vacant seat are to be held in the event of a resignation. However, instead of nominating a replacement to serve as interim SUS representative to SSMU for the remainder of the term, executives made the decision to have previously-elected members of their team proxy for Milchberg during Legislative Council meetings. Asa Kohn, student of the Mathematics Department, took issue with this decision.
“The SUS refused to appoint a replacement after Moses Milchberg resigned, and when I pointed out that they were violating their constitution, they sent me a vague email that didn’t even mention the constitution,” explained Kohn. “There seems to be a common belief among student society executives that the provisions of society constitutions can, and sometimes should, be taken as suggestions,” he added.
After unfruitful discussions with SUS executives, Kohn submitted a referendum question to the SUS Chief Returning Officer (CRO) on February 18. The question asked undergraduate students of the Faculty of Science to voice their opinion on whether or not the nomination of an interim SUS representative to SSMU should be undertaken by the SUS Executive Committee. Ultimately, the question was deemed invalid by the current CRO and SUS President Reem Mandil, and was not included as an SUS referendum question. According to Mandil, the course of action taken by the Executive Committee was the appropriate response given the time at which the resignation occurred. She also asserted that Milchberg’s seat was not vacant as proxies were being sent to Legislative Council.
“As an executive team, and also among discussions at our General Council, we decided that the best way to deal with the resignation was to send proxies of elected executives to fill his place in Legislative Council meetings at SSMU. We formally passed a motion at Legislative Council approving this decision and ever since then we’ve been handling it through proxy,” said Mandil.
When asked about the logic behind their decision, Mandil highlighted time constraints. Considering the date of the resignation, the by-election for the SUS representative to SSMU would have been held only a few weeks before the scheduled full election. “This would have been a complicated timeline. In addition, holding a by-election requires approving dates and setting campaign periods. This would’ve delayed that election for a certain period of time where we would’ve had to send proxies anyways. Hosting an election takes a lot of time and resources that we felt were better used when sending a proxy,” added the SUS President.
Dissatisfied with the position upheld by the SUS Executive Committee, Kohn filed a petition to the SSMU Judicial Board in early March. In his 96-page document detailing the situation, he requested that the decisions made by the SUS Executive Committee be judged unconstitutional. Almost three weeks after filing the petition, he is still not aware of its status.
