An Interview on Sexual Health with Sandeep Prasad
Sandeep Prasad is the Executive Director of Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights (Action Canada). After speaking at the October 11-12 Abortion Beyond Bounds Conference, hosted by the McGill Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies (IGSFS) and the Centre for Research on Gender, Health, and Medicine (CRGHM), Prasad sat down with the Daily to talk about the state of abortion care in Canada, and his work in the sexual health and rights field. 
The Daily: Now that 30 years have passed since the decriminalization of abortion in Canada, how easy or difficult is it today to access abortion care in Canada? 
Sandeep Prasad: Practical access to abortion care in Canada, despite thirty years of decriminalization, is still difficult. There are numerous barriers that still […] hamper the abilities of those seeking abortion services to actually access them. Things like uneven distribution of services, the concentration of services in urban centres, creates large distances that people still have to travel to access these services; these are of course compounded by other factors of oppression such as poverty or young age, making it even more difficult to access care. Fortunately, there have been steps in the right direction of expanding abortion access primarily through the role of mifegymiso [the Canadian trade name for the abortion pill mifepristone] within Canada, which is the [World Health Organization] gold standard of medical abortion. But at this point, there is a lot more work to do in terms of achieving an effective rollout of mifegymiso that would transform access to this drug. So there is promise in that, but at the same time, we also have to confront the realities of anti-choice actors who create barriers to access through misleading information, biased counselling practices, and through activities that stigmatize abortion. These make it far more difficult for those seeking abortion care to actually find the information they need to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. 
MD: What is the role of Action Canada in this situation? 
SP: Action Canada is Canada’s national sexual and reproductive health rights organization. As such, we have a number of issues that we focus on in the sexual and reproductive health and rights field, and abortion care is one of the key areas of this focus. Abortion work relates to both helping to ensure that accurate information related to abortion is out there for the public, and that through our access line, members of the public seeking to terminate pregnancy are supported with accurate, unbiased information about abortion procedures as well as referrals to the appropriate care nearest to them. We’re helping to connect people seeking to terminate pregnancy to services that they want. Furthermore, our organization is also engaged in policy work on abortion. We see that advocacy is critical to changing the landscape of abortion and have been prioritizing within that advocacy the universal cost coverage of mifegymiso, [and] ensuring that restrictions relating to mifegymiso are removed. 
MD: Action Canada in its current form has evolved out of prior organizations like the “Canadian Federation of Societies for Federation Planning” or “Planned Parenthood Federation of Canada” that carried a different language in their names. Why should we be talking about sexual health and rights rather than reproductive health and rights? 
SP: When we come down to it, it’s all the same issue. Whether we’re talking about abortion, or sexual orientation, same-sex sexuality, trans rights, issues around contraception, we’re all talking about, on the one level, the right to bodily autonomy; the right of each person to do with their body as they want and to have the information and education services to support their decision making around their body. […] In a very practical way, abortion rights are sexual rights. Abortion stigma is also stigma related to sexuality. So all of these issues are fundamentally connected and we use “sexual rights” as a shorthand to describe all of these issues because we see that, traditionally, when we look at definitions of reproductive health and reproductive rights, the sexual is defined through the reproductive. We intentionally want to change that paradigm. Reproduction is an aspect of sexuality. There are numerous aspects of sexuality, but our broader frame is sexual rights which is inclusive of reproductive rights. 
MD: The Abortion Beyond Bounds conference focused on self-managed abortion. How is self-managed abortion widening access to abortion care and which barriers remain? 
SP: It is important that we work towards expanding options for how individuals interact with their body, how they manage the care of their body, whether that’s about methods of contraception, methods of terminating pregnancy, we want to expand the frontiers of possibilities for them to do that and to support them in doing that, and to have the control over the level of support they want in doing that. The autonomy needs to rest with that individual who is making the decision on their own in relation to their bodies. In terms of self-management of abortion care, we need to be looking into options that remove abortion care from the medical system. There is ample evidence that self-managed abortion is safe and effective. And there are a lot of examples in many other countries that we can point to that have been using medications through community access for abortion, which we need to look at in Canada. 
MD: In health care systems that are not accessible to all, how does self-managed abortion widen access to underserved communities? 
SP: The geographic circumstances of the country are such that it is very difficult for individuals who live in rural or geographically remote areas to access care. […] Expanding the scope of practice for different types of providers is one important step […] but what is also important is more self-managed models of abortion care as well. So we need something that is inclusive of these parts, because we need to get to a place where access to abortion is community-based and is accessible to communities which are remote.

MD: You were instrumental in starting the Sexual Rights Initiative, an intersectional Global South-North coalition of organizations that work towards advancing sexual rights in the United Nations. What is the place of a Global North organization in global sexual health activism? 
SP: That is a great question, thank you for asking that. There are a few places for a Global North organization. First of all, as a merged organization, we also have in our organizational history the work of Action Canada for Population and Development (ACPD), which did a lot of formative work initially within the intergovernmental human rights system on sexual and reproductive rights. Quickly, we saw the need for a Global South-Global North coalition and for that coalition to actually be of national and regional organizations doing work on these issues. Where ACDP was different though, was that it didn’t actually do domestic advocacy. So one of the appeals for ACPD for entering into this merger is that we need to be more like our partners in the Global South that are doing effective national work and that come together with us to do that kind of work as well. We wanted to model that. So our engagement with partners in the Global South fundamentally changed the structure of our organization. As Action Canada, we have lent our ability to act as coordinators. Our job has been to ensure that resources are pooled together for this work, but also to ensure that each partner is bringing its analysis from its national and regional context to that work at the global level, so now we are able to participate on that more fully, doing national work like our other partners within the coalition. 
MD: Where do you see your place in a sexual health organization? 
SP: I’m very fortunate because I went to law school to do human rights work globally with my law degree. And while there were a lot of individuals like me in my law school, there aren’t that many jobs within the human rights field [after graduate school]. I’m one of the lucky ones who actually gets to do human rights work in Canada and globally as a professional. My own interest in wanting to go to law school to do that [comes from when] as a young queer guy I did a lot of organizing on campus at Queen’s University, which is quite conservative and quite white as well, that was particularly focused on LGBTQ issues. When you start looking at some issues, often times you can see the relationship to other issues of social justice. That compelled me to have a broader perspective on how sexuality and gender are fundamentally interrelated, but also to go to law school to work on these broader issues professionally.

Abortion Beyond Bounds on Access to Dignified Abortion Care
Over two hundred students, alumni, and faculty attended the Abortion Beyond Bounds conference on October 11 and 12. Attendees heard both local and international speakers offer diverse perspectives on the impact of Canada’s recent legalization of the “abortion pill” (mifepristone) and the disparities of abortion access worldwide. The speakers spanned many fields from providers, activists, and artists, to emerging and established researchers and scholars. Presentations contextualized the repeal of Ireland’s 35-year abortion ban in May, the wave of protests to decriminalize abortion in Argentina last month, and the anticipated further erosion of reproductive rights in the United States following Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation earlier this month. 
The conference provided a timely assessment of contemporary questions surrounding autonomy, technology, and access related to reproductive care, the evolving role of institutions and law, and activist strategies for moving forward. Organized by McGill’s Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies (IGSF) and Centre for Research on Gender, Health, and Medicine (CRGHM), the conference emerged from research by co-organizers Rebekah Lewis (Faculty of Medicine) and Jennifer Fishman (Social Studies of Medicine, CRGHM), which coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Morgentaler decision that overturned criminal abortion law in Canada. The conference opened with a workshop by artist Laia Abril, who introduced a central theme of the event: how to make the invisible visible. Abril’s work is comprised of stark photography and interactive installations. In her talk she described how her artistic practice not only gives a voice to the largely unheard stories of those affected by abortion restrictions around the world, but also brings viewers less familiar with the dangers of restrictive contexts into the conversation. “The goal for me is to show viewers that everything is connected […] Art can bring people who may not be aware into the discussion,” she said. 
Donna Cherniak, author of The Birth Control Handbook (1968) and opening keynote speaker, described her own efforts to educate herself on the subject decades earlier as a 19-year-old undergraduate student at McGill. Full of vital contraception and abortion information that was illegal to disseminate at the time, the handbook eventually sold millions of copies in Canada and abroad, many of which were printed from Cherniak’s Montreal apartment. With the proceeds, she hired an artist to render vibrant images of real bodies that would accompany the text and illustrate the link between pleasure, sexuality, and abortion. “Not only is it amazing to think of [Cherniak] working here at McGill to make this information accessible to students, but I am also surprised at how relevant many of her insights continue to be today,” said Kelly Gordon, a Political Science assistant professor at McGill and conference co-organizer. As part of the keynote presentation, Anne Lardeux from the University of Montreal read excerpts of the handbook out loud while projecting 16mm archival prints of its illustrations. “Learning about The Birth Control Handbook and its history was an inspiring reminder of how young people have [long] mobilized to educate, empower, and demand greater reproductive rights and access,” said Daniela Spagnuolo, a graduate student presenter from the University of Toronto. 
Student presentations throughout the first day revealed an emerging generation of scholars exploring key impediments to abortion access and care. Srishti Hukku, a doctoral student at the University of Ottawa shared her extensive research on mifepristone, a safe and effective abortion pill that has been legally available in many countries since the 1980s, but only became legal in Canada three years ago. Krina Patel, Daniela Spagnuolo, and Parisa Sharifi, graduate students from the University of Toronto, discussed Health Canada’s regulatory criteria for providing the pill, which not only departs from overwhelming scientific evidence and global standards of practice, but creates barriers to access through strict regulations, like mandatory ultrasounds and invasive check-ups. The co-authors warned against conflating “choice with equitable access,” since legal barriers too often render the right to abortion meaningless, especially for those who are already most vulnerable. Katelyn Mitchell (University of Lethbridge) and Sarah McLeod (Acadia University) asserted that widespread misinformation proves a further barrier to access. The presentations highlighted the need to trust, rather than police, those seeking reproductive care and allow them to interpret the needs of their own bodies. “Unless personal choice is actively and robustly supported by social means—geographical and economic access, education, an expanded sense of what constitutes care—legal ‘access’ is just a paper promise,” said Alanna Thain, a conference co-organizer and Director of the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies at McGill. 
The second day of the conference featured expert panelists focused on ways of circulating abortion knowledge, technologies, and care to those without access. Angel Foster, professor of Health Sciences at the University of Ottawa, described how organizations like Women Help Women use telemedicine to deliver abortion pills to women in need across the world. Law professor Joanna Erdman (Dalhousie University) urged attendees to shift the focus from “unsafe” abortion to unjust laws that so often harm vulnerable individuals and communities. She ended her talk with a powerful call to action: “If a law is unjust, we are not only right to disobey it, but compelled to do so.” Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel for the Self-Induced Abortion (SIA) Legal Team based in California, also pushed attendees to think beyond institutional boundaries. She drew attention to the historical exclusion by the medical establishment of traditional sources of knowledge, like midwives, which resulted in early abortion laws and criminalization. “Abortion has always had racial implications and class implications,” said Zakiya Luna, a professor of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Luna reminded attendees that abortion criminalization is central to global histories of inequality. She suggested that allies, to help undermine these inequities, make donations to support organizations led by people of colour. “Money is not evil. Organizations need money,” she said. 
Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the message, “Everyone Loves Someone Who Had An Abortion,” produced by the US National Network of Abortion Funds, Luna’s talk about the reproductive justice movement went on to establish the compatibility of love and abortion. She encouraged attendees to reframe the discussion around abortion by elevating the role of emotion and imagination in response to anti-choice movements. Words can serve to build more expansive and inclusive movements, she explained, even between groups in seemingly intractable opposition. Language as a political and rhetorical tool for both expanding and restricting abortion access emerged as a common theme across panels. Colleen MacQuarrie, a psychology professor at the University of Prince Edward Island, credits the imaginative power of visual expressions in social movements for reinstating abortion access in PEI after three decades. “We need accessible ways to tell our stories,” she said. “If we try to embrace the ways in which we enjoy being together, or give ourselves permission to laugh, it serves to build our strengths and our energy.”
“I had not expected to learn so much about the impact that language can have within contexts of reproductive health. It alters our understandings and can have the potential to create hostile or welcoming spaces. It reminded me to be conscious of the words that I use and question their effect,” said Alice d’Aboville, a U4 International Development student and intern for the conference. A.J. Lowik, a graduate student at the University of British Columbia and author of the Trans-Inclusive Abortion Services Handbook, explained how the common language of women-centered services excludes and erases the abortion needs of transgender people. They encouraged reconsideration of the history of care dynamics, which are “laden with power.” 
Earlier, recent McGill graduate Rihan Lewis discussed how volunteer drivers in Texas, where 96% of counties have no clinics that provide abortion, address the state’s “care deficit.” She urged attendees to rethink what abortion care looks like, beginning a larger conversation at the conference. Mainstream conceptions of “self-care” often centre on consumerism, such as manicures and spa trips, which are far from the original meaning of the phrase. Black feminist theorist, Audre Lorde, originated the term in the context of “self-preservation” and survival for Black women. Marsha Jones, executive director of The Afiya Center, echoed Lorde when she spoke about the politics of care. The Afiya Center recently erected a billboard in Texas that read, “Black women take care of their families by taking care of themselves. Abortion is self-care.” Jones, holding up a copy of Radical Reproductive Justice to the audience, explained the urgency of the billboard and her social justice work: “Why is abortion self-care? Because it is life-saving. It means that one gets to live to see tomorrow. Because our lives matter.”

Report from the eventful Oct 11 SSMU Legislative Council
On October 11, SSMU held its third Legislative Council meeting of the year. During the meeting, many important topics were debated among councillors. After many guest presentations, the first issue addressed concerns over former VP External Marina Cupido’s, who resigned on Oct. 9 due to mental health concerns, controversial election post. In their October 2 statement on the official SSMU VP External Affairs Facebook page, Cupido wrote that the newly elected CAQ is a “xenophobic, racist, far-right government with ties to white supremacists.” They also highlighted that the CAQ “campaigned on the discrimination against racialized people, immigrants and refugees.” People criticized Cupido for using extreme terms like “far-right” to represent the newly elected provincial government. This post caused controversy because there was trouble differentiating Cupido’s personal position and SSMU’s. 
In the hours preceding the Legislative Council meeting, a new statement was published as a follow-up on the aforementioned Facebook account indicating that Cupido’s post had been recently deleted because “phrased as it was, [it] did not accurately reflect the views of our current team.” SSMU stated that the CAQ’s new policies “will limit the financial accessibility of education, pursue the exploitation of fossil fuels without addressing the impending climate crisis, cut immigration, and discriminate against already marginalized communities based on their religious expression.” According to the mock poll conducted by Elections SSMU, the student body is expressively aware of these issues, with only 6.3% voting in favor of the CAQ, sitting in fourth place behind the Green Party, Quebec Solidaire, and the Liberal Party. This second post, in direct response to the controversy caused by the former, presents SSMU’s first official stance on the negative impacts this new majority government will have on a large portion of the student population of McGill University. 
Discussions on the topic concluded and moved on to the motions up for approval, the most critical of which regarding the adoption of a new Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy (GSVP), which was unanimously supported by everyone present at the meeting. This new policy aims to fill the gap in the original implementation guide that leaves out many essential technicalities. These gaps have resulted in recent failures with regards to dealing with sexual violence cases within the Union. In 2016-2017 two SSMU executives committed acts of sexual violence against twelve undergraduate students. The victims of these actions had no possible recourse for seeking help within SSMU, as the original GSVP didn’t account for cases in which executives are the perpetrators of these violent acts. The new policy considers these shortcomings by providing “an intersectional and survivor centric approach to sexual harassment, gendered violence and sexual violence within the SSMU community and applied to the SSMU context.” 
The motion was drafted in large part by Bee Khaleeli, a U3 Arts student, and advisor of the report. The policy emphasizes the need to implement measures to prevent acts of violence and support victims using an approach that prevents re-traumatization. Even though councillors were on board with these proposed measures, the biggest talking point of the motion revolved around providing the resolution with the appropriate funding. SSMU VP Finance Jun Wang stressed that the operating budget for the 2018- 2019 academic has already been approved, and funds to implement the GSVP would have to be sourced elsewhere. It was agreed upon that a fee levy is the best solution for the short-term until a place can be made for the new policy in the budget. On Oct 18, council voted to reexamine the fee levy. The amended motion was consequently approved unanimously. 
The meeting drew to a close with talks about renaming the McGill men’s varsity team. The proposed motion aims to rename the team since the current “R*dmen” is an offensive and oppressive slur against Indigenous peoples. The opposition to this motion lies in both current and alumni varsity athletes claiming that the “R*dmen” name is an integral part of their identity. After much debate, the motion was eventually passed and the question will be up to McGill students to vote on at the next General Assembly. 
An earlier version of this article claimed that former VP External Marina Cupido’s Facebook post was approved by another person at SSMU before it was published. This is not true. The Daily regrets the error.

Abortion Legalized in Queensland, Australia
The state parliament of Queensland, Australia voted to legalize abortion on October 17. The historic legislation comes as follow-through on promises made by Palaszczuk, leader of the Labor Party. She has been Premier of Queensland since 2015. She is also the first Australian premier to hold a majority female ministry. The new legislation would erase a section of the criminal code which deemed “termination of pregnancy” an “offence against morality.” Under this law, people seeking abortions faced the possibility of criminal prosecution. 
The current premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the code was written before women had the right to vote. Grace Grace, ALP Education and Industrial Relations Minister, added that the criminal code was written before Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had votes in the house. The new legislation took two days in the house to be passed. The emotional debate saw tears from many MPs, and centred around the need for equity in reproductive health rights and full autonomy for people with uteruses over their own bodies. The anti-choice opposition was equally passionate, citing murder and the possibility of eugenics as claims against the legislation. The debate resulted in a final vote of 50 for and 41 against, with one abstaining vote. The majority of those voting against the bill were male. 
Abortion will now be legal until 22 weeks of gestation, and after that point will be legal with approval from two doctors. Clinics will be required to establish safe zones, in order to restrict protesters and people seeking to harass staff and patients from coming within 150 metres of clinics. While doctors will still be allowed to individually refuse to treat an abortion patient on moral grounds, they will be legally required to refer her to another medical practitioner.
Tunisia Criminalizes Racism 
On October 9, Tunisia approved legislation criminalizing racist speech, incitement to hatred, and discrimination. The law passed almost unanimously, with 125 votes for, one against, and five abstaining. “This is a very important turning point in the history of Tunisia, equivalent to the abolition of slavery,” said Messaoud Romdhani, head of the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights. Though activist groups have pressured the government to put anti-racist legislation in place for years, political support for this increased exponentially in 2016. On Christmas Day that year, three Congolese students were stabbed on a train. The crime was likely motivated by racism, and sparked outrage across the country. Afterwards, Prime Minister Youssef Chahed expressed his support for anti-racism legislation. 
The law is being considered a historic step in protecting minority rights for Black Tunisians and sub-saharan Africans, who collectively make up 10-15 per cent of the population. Recent survey data indicated that Black Tunisians are socio-economically disadvantaged compared to other Tunisians as a result of systemic discrimination and racial biases. 
Legislators have indicated that putting the legislation into practice to enact a culture shift is an important step to eliminate this gap. Under the newly passed legislation, use of racist language can result in a 1,000 dinar fine (approximately $462 CAD), or offenders being jailed for up to a month. Incitement to hatred, making racist threats, spreading or advocating racism, and belonging to a group which supports discrimination, are each punishable by one to three years in prison and fines of up to 3,000 dinars. To fulfill its own mandate and educate the public, a National Commission Against Racial Discrimination will be tasked with conducting awareness and training campaigns.
