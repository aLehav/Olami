Participants discuss anti-racist activism in BSN-organized event
On October 3, McGill’s Black Students’ Network (BSN) collaborated with Midnight Kitchen to host a panel discussion on issues of police brutality and race, with a particular focus on recent events in Ferguson, Missouri. The panelists were Rachel Zellars, a PhD candidate at McGill in education working on critical race theory; Kai Thompson, an undergraduate student with volunteer experience in various community and youth organizations; Fo Niemi, the executive director of the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), and Trineka Geer, a political activist who recently spent time in Ferguson.
The Ferguson protests were sparked by the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by the white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. In the intervening weeks, there has been an international outcry, not only against the systemic racism colouring the official investigation of this crime, but also against a larger pattern of racial violence against black Americans. In a Skype interview with the panel, Geer shared her first-hand experience with the ongoing protests in Ferguson.
Geer described the “disregard for black lives [in Ferguson],” and highlighted the discriminatory behaviour of officers who target people of colour with a disproportionate number of fines and arrest warrants.
“We know that there are certain streets in Ferguson that you don’t walk down, that you don’t drive down, because […] you’re going to be assaulted or harassed by the police,” said Geer, quoting a young black resident of the town.
“It creates a way for the police to be able to control the movement […] of young black men and women in this community,” Geer told participants, adding, for example, that “as people are going to vote, they’re being accosted for no reason […] by the police, and arrested.” These forms of discrimination deny adequate representation to Ferguson’s black community within the legislative and judicial bodies that govern the town, she explained.
“So Michael Brown was really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Geer.
Following the interview, the other panelists explored various topics connected to the overarching theme of police brutality and race. These included a summary of the function of police in society and the history of law enforcement in Canada, an analysis of the process of police militarization in both the U.S. and Canada, and a number of case studies of incidents of racial violence perpetrated by North American law enforcement officers.
Several speakers called attention to Canada’s own history of violent discrimination against people of colour, noting that many Canadians are, in fact, unaware of this history. Zellars pointed to the long-established existence of white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).
“The United States, of course, has a glorious history involving the KKK, but Canada has its own history,” said Zellars, going on to discuss collective misconceptions of Canada as a nation that has always been a haven of tolerance for racial minorities.
Thompson elaborated on this issue, explaining that, while many students are aware of the disproportionately high number of people of colour who face imprisonment in the U.S., most don’t realize that the same imbalance exists in Canada’s prisons. “It’s not just about delegating this history […] to the States,” he said. “In Canada […] black people, Aboriginal people, and racialized people in general are disproportionately incarcerated, and we can look at that as a form of state-sanctioned violence.”
Niemi also contributed to the discussion of this issue, sharing insight into the racial profiling routinwely carried out by Canadian police forces and the institutional barriers in Canada’s judicial system that work against racial minorities. “Slavery’s still there, just in a different form,” he said.
When the panelists had finished speaking, the floor was opened up to the audience, many of whom had insights of their own to share. The ensuing debate covered a wide range of topics, from social media campaigns inspired by the Ferguson protests to respectability politics – which promotes conformity to white supremacist standards without questioning them – and how to move beyond it.
Participants discussed the value of social media as a means of participation in human rights movements. Networks like Twitter and Facebook can help to spread awareness, people agreed, but as one participant said, they can also encourage ‘slacktivism’ – the perception that “liking a video, sharing a video, buying a t-shirt […] is enough.”
“How do we stop people from becoming apathetic, and how do we […] retain the potential social media does have as such a powerful tool for social activism?” asked BSN VP External Maya Taylor.
Response to the discussion panel was very positive. “I thought it was definitely a healthy dialogue, definitely constructive,” one participant told The Daily.
“I thought, in particular, that the discussion about social media and just how we can […] keep engaged […] that was something I’d been wondering about before, and it was really awesome to see it talked about in a larger context,” added another.
For the BSN executive team, the event was a success. “I’ve been in BSN for three years and […] this was one of the most substantial discussions we’ve had,” said BSN Co-President Samanthea Samuels.
“I feel really good about how this went,” added Taylor. “I’m confident that these people […] will continue talking about this amongst their friends, will pass on this information, so I think it went really well.”
BSN Political Coordinator Isabelle Oke told The Daily what she hoped people would take away from the discussion. “Yes, this kind of oppression is systemic and institutionalized, and that can definitely be overwhelming at points. I think something people need to concentrate on is how they fight white supremacy […] on an individual level.”

Upcoming 2014-15 budget deficit discussed at Board of Governors
McGill ran an operating surplus of over $15 million in the 2013-14 academic year, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa informed the McGill Board of Governors (BoG) at its first meeting of the year on October 2. The BoG – the highest governing body of the university, whose 25 voting members include two students – also approved a new gift acceptance policy and discussed contract compliance.
Presenting the audited 2013-14 financial statements to the BoG, Di Grappa said that McGill ran an operating surplus of over $15 million last year, instead of a projected operating deficit of about $10 million. Di Grappa explained that the difference of $26.4 million was due to a reduction in pension plan liabilities – due to additional contributions made by employees, as well as favourable market conditions – and to an increase in revenues from the provincial government following a recalculation of enrollment numbers.
“This was not something that was foreseeable to us,” said Di Grappa.
Di Grappa also noted that the University saw a $19.5 million increase in accounts payable due to pay equity payouts. The University also retains an accumulated financial deficit of $96 million, as well as $835 million in deferred maintenance costs, according to a 2007 estimate.
According to BoG Chair Stuart “Kip” Cobbett, the surplus is not an indication that McGill is in a healthy financial situation. “We’re as deep in the woods as we ever were,” he said.
In her opening remarks, Principal Suzanne Fortier informed the BoG that the University has received details about provincial funding for the 2014-15 academic year. Fortier said that the funding will amount to around $340 million, a substantial decrease from last year’s $359 million.
Fortier said that even though the administration had foreseen lower funding than was announced by the previous provincial government in March, the final numbers were even lower than anticipated. There is currently a projected deficit of $20 million in this year’s budget.
“We had prepared our budget in a careful way […] we know at this point we don’t have the money,” said Fortier.
Further complicating the University’s financial situation is the Liberal government’s requirement that Quebec universities balance their budgets by 2015 as a condition for a part of their provincial funding.
“If this year is tough, next year will be tougher,” Fortier said.
Provost Anthony Masi noted that the deregulation of tuition for international students in the Management, Science, Engineering, and Law faculties starting in 2014-15 will allow McGill to retain the entirety of the tuition fees paid by students and will result in a $2.5 million net increase in revenue.
In a similar vein, Fortier expressed hope that the government would allow universities to increase tuition for international students who pay Quebec tuition – by virtue of an agreement between Quebec and their country – to the same amount as out-of-province Canadian tuition; McGill would keep the difference.
Di Grappa presented for the BoG’s approval a declaration to the Quebec Treasury Board attesting that McGill complies with reporting obligations related to public contracts. Although the Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) has the power to authorize the contracts granted by McGill, the BoG is required by law to produce a declaration of compliance.
Cobbett noted that the memo circulated among BoG members stated that six contracts were exempted from the bidding process, and asked for a justification.
Procurement Services Director François Pouliot explained that a contract may be exempt from the public bidding process if it is of a confidential nature, or if “it would not serve the public interest” for economic reasons to go into such a process.
Alumni Association Representative Tina Hobday expressed discomfort with the low level of detail provided about the contracts. “We have to make a decision as a board, and [all] we got [was] a 13-page memo – I felt a bit uncomfortable,” said Hobday. “I did want to voice my concern.”
The declaration was approved without opposition.
The BoG also approved a policy regarding the acceptance of philanthropic gifts in money and in kind by the University, presented by Vice-Principal (University Advancement) Marc Weinstein. Weinstein argued that the policy, which had not been reviewed in 35 years, will now provide a framework for accepting and rejecting philanthropic gifts and reduce “[legal] compliance and reputational risk” for the University.
BoG Vice-Chair Claude Généreux suggested that a mandatory process to investigate the source of the gift would be beneficial. Weinstein responded that he “wouldn’t want a bureaucracy impeding [the acceptance of] gifts,” noting that the policy provides for the Approval Committee for Gifts (ACOG) to conduct reviews on a case-by-case basis.
“With ACOG, we have a much better process than we ever had,” said Weinstein.

Students, local organizers express positive feedback
Last Thursday was the third annual Community Engagement Day (CED), organized by the Social Equity and Diversity Education office (SEDE). From September 29 to October 9, workshops and volunteering opportunities were hosted by forty different organizations based throughout the Montreal community, with the majority of events happening on October 2.
CED was founded with the intention of giving McGill students the opportunity to form stronger ties with the local community. On top of SEDE funding, CED receives funding from the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Provost’s office, the McGill bookstore, and Student Housing and Hospitality Services, according to CED Program Coordinator Adam Finley.
Finley and CED Communications Coordinator Lina Martin-Chan said that the goals of CED this year lay more in creating a meaningful experience for volunteers more than in getting a large number of participants.
“We didn’t go for numbers this year, we went for small, intentionally good, meaningful activities,” Finley told The Daily.
“We had a general anxiety about the existence of this project as a ‘day,’” said Martin-Chan. “We were really nervous that these relationships that we [facilitated] wouldn’t be long-term or sustainable, and that took up a large part of our energy thinking about that, and what that would mean, and how we can kind of prevent those one-off [voluntourist-y things].”
Finley and Martin-Chan said that this year CED saw much more staff participation than in previous years, due to help from the administration. Finley said that VP (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa sent out a mass email encouraging employers to let their staff take the day off and go to CED, and that one employer at the Comparative Medicine and Animal Resources Centre made a point of taking most of his employees to attend some events.
Lucie Lastinger, a U1 Anthropology and Women’s Studies student, attended a workshop hosted by the Monster Academy, a working group of the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill. The workshop focussed on a discussion of beauty and the relationship between body image and mental health.
“We talked about beauty being a value in our culture and how that relates to capitalism, and how if you are a beautiful person then you are deemed more valuable and therefore ‘better’ in our capitalist society,” Lastinger told The Daily. She added that she really enjoyed the workshop, and that her fellow participants were engaged and thoughtful about the issues discussed.
Aimee Lowe, an organizer from Accessibilize Montreal, explained how she designed her workshop. “When Adam, the organizer of Community Engagement Day, approached us, he asked us to think of an activity that would help educate new volunteers but that would also be productive and helpful for our movement,” she told The Daily.
Participants in the Accessibilize workshop were instructed to venture out into the community and collect information on local venues for a new app that Accessibilize Montreal is currently promoting, called “AXS Map.” Volunteers were instructed to visit the venues that McGill students usually frequent, such as bars and cafes near campus, and to see whether or not they had any accessibility issues.
“Some people were really surprised that the staff where they went were not interested in helping at all, or were not interested in talking about accessibility,” said Lowe.
The Benedict Labre House, a centre that provides free food, clothing, and showers to people who are homeless, hosted two events. The first allowed volunteers to come work on repairs and paint murals around the House, and the second was a cooking workshop organized by Midnight Kitchen.
“We were hoping to attract students to the House for them to discover a new volunteering experience, as well as to invite our guests (that’s how we call our clients) to participate in the activities,” wrote Karine Projean, Communication and Liaison Agent at the House, in an email to The Daily. “While the student involvement was great, unfortunately our guests didn’t participate as much as we would have wished, especially in the Midnight Kitchen workshop.”
“I think CED is really awesome because it provides a really […] accessible way for students at McGill to get out of McGill and to learn about programs that are happening […] outside of the McGill bubble,” said Lastinger.
Lastinger noted however that she was surprised the event was in a workshop format, instead of a more hands-on volunteering experience.
Lowe had no criticisms of CED, saying that she really appreciated having access to such a wide variety of volunteers without having to spend energy recruiting, and that she never ran into any problems communicating with the organizers. Projean also said that she was very happy with the organization from SEDE and had a very good experience.

Students and community members rally in support of Hong Kong student protests
In support of the Occupy Central campaign, over 100 attendees gathered outside the McConnell Engineering building in solidarity with student protesters in Hong Kong. The event was hosted by QPIRG McGill and students Michael Law, Elliot Tan, Ailisha Macharia, and Cathy Wong.
The rally kicked off around 2 p.m., as demonstrators began to assemble, many sporting a yellow ribbon – the symbol of global solidarity with the protesters in Hong Kong. All of the speakers were unanimous in their support for Hong Kong’s fight for democracy and against police violence.
“A few days ago in Hong Kong, students went down the streets […] they’re protesting against the Chinese government’s recent decision to undermine Hong Kong’s democracy by stating that the candidates that they would vote on in 2017 must be approved by Beijing prior to the election,” said Law. “That’s not how democracy works.”
In 2013, the Occupy Central movement was founded by Benny Tai Yiu-ting, an associate law professor at the University of Hong Kong.
Dubbed the “umbrella revolution,” referring to protesters’ use of umbrellas to guard against the police’s use of pepper spray, the protests in Hong Kong can trace their roots to the years of anger Hong Kongers hold against their Chinese-appointed government, undemocratically elected by partial suffrage. The city’s wealth disparity and ever-rising living costs have been another source of discontent.
However, the spark that catalyzed this built-up tension came from Beijing. In June, the Chinese central government released a white paper asserting “comprehensive jurisdiction” over the city and making alarming statements such as the requirement that judges be “patriotic.”
The last nail on the coffin was hammered in on August 31, when Beijing declared its decision on electoral reform for the election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2017, effectively blocking all candidates except those pre-approved by the central government.
In response, university and secondary school student associations started a city-wide boycott of class on September 22, triggering a series of sit-ins and protests that steadily escalated into physical confrontations with the police. This culminated in clashes between protesters and the police on the grounds of the government headquarters.
Riding on the popularity of the student protests, Tai announced the start of the Occupy Central protests on September 28. In the ensuing conflicts, the use of force by the Hong Kong police peaked when tear gas was fired into protesting crowds and gave rise to photos such as that of the “Umbrella Man,” which circulated widely on social media.
Vincent Tao, a member of No One is Illegal Toronto, spoke to the deep emotional impact of seeing fellow Hong Kongers protest in the streets.
“I am the son of Hong Kongers […] so I cannot begin to describe the complicated feelings of longing and belonging I felt when I first saw the images of Victoria Square filled with people my age marching for what they believe in,” he told the crowd.
“We recognize that an empowered people will empower others. And a freed people will free others. And democracy is contagious,” said Law.
Following the speeches made by the organizers of the protest, a petition was made available for attendees to sign in support of Occupy Central. It will eventually be delivered to the Consulate of China in Montreal.
Hui Peng, who came to Canada a year and a half ago from mainland China, compared the Occupy Central movement to past political protests. “This is really similar to what happened in China 25 years ago, which is the Tiananmen Square massacre. There are some things similar, and some things different, which is this time, the people there, they are more disciplined. They know that they are not going to fight, they are [going to] peacefully argue for their rights. I think there is hope.”
“The cause of Hong Kong is the cause of all of us; it is the cause of people in Indonesia, Taiwan […] because they want real democracy […] and everyone stands in solidarity with Hong Kong,” said Nicholas Pullen, a Masters student in History.
Despite public support for the Occupy Central movement, Tao reminded attendees to contextualize it in past political struggles in Hong Kong, as well as current labour struggles that span beyond the achievement of democracy.
“So contrary to the notion that this is the first time in Hong Kong’s history that the people are coordinating themselves with little direction from the government or institutions, and with an exceptional air of middle-class decorum at that, we must be reminded that in May of 1967, the youth of my father’s generation set off bombs in the fight for decent working conditions and social planning initiatives from Hong Kong’s negligent colonial administration,” said Tao.
“What must not be erased here is the long history of labour organizing, grassroots mobilization, and protest in Hong Kong. But more importantly, I fear what else may be erased in our hasty celebration of the pro-democracy movement is the actual content of democracy,” Tao continued. “Why is there no mention of the appalling income gap in Hong Kong, of how one in five of the island’s population are below the poverty line, of how suicide rates in the city’s poorer neighbourhoods are three and a half times higher than they are in the adjacent financial districts?”
Tao also highlighted the issues faced by foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong. “Will universal suffrage be extended to the foreign domestic workers from Indonesia, the Philippines, Nepal, Thailand, and Bangladesh that make up 10 per cent of the island’s workforce?”
Tao referenced the case of Erwania Sulistyaningsih, an Indoensian woman who was severely abused during her time as a migrant worker in Hong Kong. “When migrant workers must keep silence in the face of overwhelming rates of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse from the employers they must live with for fear of near-immediate deportation, how can we begin to talk about democracy?”

Executive compensation also discussed at AUS Council meeting
Correction appended October 7, 2014. 
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) convened on October 1 for its biweekly Legislative Council meeting. Council passed four motions, including motions to hold an election for VP Internal, to approve Financial Management Committee (FMC) members, to amend AUS electoral bylaws, and to hold a fall referendum period. A motion to amend financial bylaws was tabled until the next meeting. This year’s AUS Frosh Report, delivered by the Equity Commission, was also discussed at Council.
AUS Equity Commissioners Isabel Lee and Vareesha Khan presented a joint report on this year’s Frosh. As both commissioners worked with former VP Internal Leila Alfaro throughout the summer to ensure that Frosh would be a safe space for all participants, both Lee and Khan reported a significant change within Frosh culture this past August.
Khan cited the transition of Frosh’s inaugural event from “Pub Crawl” to “Montreal Crawl” as an example of “the shift from drinking to enjoying Montreal, and having a much more social atmosphere.”
While this and other innovations, such as the banning of stripping games, contributed to a much needed improvement in the relationship between campus and residents of the Milton Parc neighbourhood, Lee and Khan noted that obstacles still remain toward realizing the full potential of the Equity Commission.
The Frosh Report indicated that during the second boat cruise, Arts Frosh coordinators kicked Lee, Khan, and AUS President Ava Liu off the boat once it had reached full capacity to make room for Orientation Staff (O-Staff).
“This was also very problematic because there were O-Staff who were too intoxicated to be of any help, and the O-Staff who were eventually put on the boat instead of us voiced that they didn’t mind staying off the boat for us,” stated the Report.
The Report also revealed that, in the bus on their way to Beach Club on Beach Day, Arts Frosh leaders sitting near Lee and Khan “pressured everyone to drink,” “joked about safe space and saying no to drinking,” and “[performed…] very loud and inappropriate chants that included obscene sexual and racist content.”
While Council as a whole had differing views on the most effective ways to change Frosh in the coming years, there was a general sense that this year’s Frosh was a step in the right direction.
“Holistically,” Lee concluded, “we want people to think that fun and safety are not mutually exclusive.”
In a motion presented to Council, VP Finance Li Xue petitioned to amend existing financial bylaws regarding the compensation of executives working under McGill’s Work Study Program.
AUS executives are currently compensated $10.35 per hour worked, $10.00 of which comes from the Work Study program and $0.35 of which comes from the AUS operating budget, for up to ten hours of work each week.
The proposed amendment, seconded by Liu, would double the hours of possible reimbursement to twenty hours a week, a number which is already allowed by the Work Study program. The motion noted that “members of the AUS Executive consistently dedicate a significantly larger amount of time to their portfolios.”
“The fact is, every time I fill out my timesheet, I get to like Monday and Tuesday, and I’m done my ten hours. So I don’t even fill out […] the weekend, or not even the work I do in the evening. It’s a lot of responsibility,” Xue said.
The prospect of increasing the accessibility of Council to students of all economic backgrounds was met with widespread approval. However, several councillors voiced concerns regarding the effect the motion would have on the AUS operating budget, which currently contributes a nominal percentage toward executive salaries, and on the increased accountability required of executives should their weekly salary be doubled.
While lauding the spirit behind the proposal, Arts Senator Jacob Greenspon noted that, seeing as a successful adoption of the motion would naturally result in “increasing the transfer of funds from Arts students to student execs, I am uncomfortable with it being voted on solely by this Council.”
In light of these concerns, the motion was tabled until the next Council meeting on October 14.
In response to Alfaro’s recent resignation as VP Internal due to her upcoming absence during the Winter 2015 semester, Alfaro and Liu motioned to hold an election for VP Internal.
The motion was passed with two abstentions. The polling period for the election will begin on October 28 and end on October 30.
Xue and Liu moved to approve FMC members, who were “selected on the basis of their qualifications and drive.” Council approved the motion.
Council also approved a motion to amend the AUS electoral bylaws. The motion was brought forward by Liu, VP Academic Eric Sobat, and Elections AUS Chief Returning Officer Guillaume Bauchu, because “a number of sections in the electoral bylaws lack consistency and transparency.”
A final motion to hold a fall referendum period over the course of November was also passed. Students must gather the signatures of 150 AUS members by October 31 if they wish to file a petition for a referendum question.
A previous version of this article stated that AUS executives are compensated $10.00 per hour. In fact, they are compensated $10.35 per hour, $10.00 of which is contributed by the Work Study program.

Greenpeace-organized Ice Ride aims to protect the Arctic
Correction appended October 6, 2014.
Greenpeace’s second annual Ice Ride took place yesterday at Parc Laurier, rallying 85 people together for a collective bike ride to fight for the protection of the Arctic and against the drilling for oil currently taking place there.
The Ice Ride takes place in 150 cities and 33 countries around the world, and involves thousands of cyclists each year. In Canada, activists from nine cities – Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Medicine Hat, Ottawa, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saint-Lambert, and Trois-Rivières – are demanding that governments put protection of the Arctic at the top of their agendas.
Marco and Manuel, two attendees of the event, came to advocate for environmental rights and take a stand against Arctic drilling. “We’re at the crossroads, it’s do-or-die […] to choose whether we want to support the oil companies or more renewable forms of energy. They want to extract our oil and get it out quickly to the world.”
Greenpeace is demanding the creation of an Arctic sanctuary to protect the international waters around the North Pole, since companies are taking advantage of the ice melting in the Arctic to extract oil and practice industrial fishing. Demonstrators sought the creation of a zone in which these practices are banned.
Speakers noted Canada’s particular role in the exploitation of the Arctic, highlighting the case of Clyde River, an Inuit community in Nunavut; the Ice Ride’s banner read, “In solidarity with Clyde River” in French.
Earlier this year, the National Energy Board (NEB) – which evaluates energy projects for environmental protection and economic efficiency – accepted a five-year proposal for seismic testing in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait off eastern Nunavut. Seismic testing involves air cannons, which create ocean noise pollution and disturb marine life.
Charles Latimer, campaigner for Greenpeace’s Oceans campaign, explained that “the Clyde River community depends on this ecosystem.”
“Air cannons, which are extremely loud, will be shot to simulate explosions and map out gas and oil deposits on the seafloor. The problem is, marine life uses sound to communicate and is very sensitive to sound, so this project results in […] changes in migration [for marine life], and substantially reduces the diversity of this ecosystem,” Latimer said.
This Clyde River community has decided to go to the federal government in an effort to put a stop to seismic testing in Baffin Bay. Consequently, the organizers of this year’s Ice Ride chose to promote this issue and stand in solidarity with the community to send a unified message to the federal government to protect the Arctic and move toward renewable energy.
In a speech sent to the organizers and read out at the event, Clyde River mayor Jerry Natatine thanked the Ice Ride participants for acting in solidarity with his community and the four million inhabitants of the Arctic.
“Our environment is important to us, but the oil industry, the NEB, and the federal government are ignoring our concerns,” said Natatine. “That’s why we decided to launch our legal challenge to the NEB’s decision to permit seismic testing in our waters. This legal challenge is just the first battle in a larger struggle to protect Canada’s North and the entire Arctic Ocean from irresponsible oil and gas exploitation.”
A previous version of this article stated that Jerry Natatine was present at the Ice Ride. In fact, Natatine was not present at the event.

Program continues despite difficulties
Correction appended October 8, 2014.
After a period of uncertainty about its future, the Off Campus Fellow Program (OCF) was renewed for the 2014-15 school year, having undergone restructuring and cuts to its funding. The program, created in 2010, offers events, information, and support to first-year students living off campus.
For the last four years, OCF has been run under Rez Life by Student Housing and Hospitality Services (SHHS). This spring, however, there was much uncertainty about the future of the program.
“It wasn’t apparent to me that the program was still going to happen until I was offered the job I’m currently in,” said Alice Feldman, who was an off-campus fellow last year and became the program coordinator this year, in an interview with The Daily.
Feldman explained that it was established that OCF fit neither under SHHS nor Rez Life, and other affiliation options were considered. According to Feldman, Campus Life & Engagement would have been willing to integrate OCF into its services, but had already allocated all of its budget.
OCF was finally allowed to remain under Rez Life for one more year, but suffered budget cuts that caused a reduction in staff this year from four off-campus fellows to two.
“[McGill] settled on the lowest budget that this program could possibly feasibly exist on,” said Feldman.
While Feldman was hired for the student program coordinator position, the supervisor position was left vacant over the summer. The vacancy created a difficult situation, as the program coordinator only had limited administrative access.
Feldman identified the loss of simple administrative access as a serious obstacle.
“It’s quite impossible for me to do this job,” Feldman told The Daily in an interview. “They placed me in a very tricky position where I don’t have the administrative access I need in order to do this job effectively. I do not have access to our funding because I’m only a student coordinator, I’m not the supervisor of the program; I don’t have access to any of the institutional memory.”
A supervisor was hired at the end of September, only after what Feldman identified as a crucial period for the program. “It’s really during the first three weeks [that] students have the most difficulty adjusting,” said Feldman.
Prior to the hiring of the supervisor, OCF events were organized and run by only three staffers, including the Off-Campus Fest, which is a day-long event that takes place during Orientation Week and is attended by 1,000 students. The hiring of a supervisor should remedy future administrative issues, but will not alleviate the workload of the off-campus fellows, according to Feldman.
“We have two fellows for a group of thirty students; last year we would always have four,” said Feldman. “It is just unfair to the students; we don’t have the manpower to actively engage with them.”
In an interview with The Daily, off-campus fellow Adam Li also identified inadequate staffing as a source of concern, noting that off-campus fellows are meant to be resources to the student body rather than administrators.
“It hasn’t been too bad – it’s just been a staffing issue,” said Li.
Teo Baranga, a U1 Science student, expressed appreciation for the off-campus fellows’ work in an email to The Daily.
“The Off-Campus Fest was awesome and it was a great way to meet new people,” said Baranga. “I also loved the pub crawl that they organized recently.”
Baranga also noted the importance of the program for building community among off-campus students and as a resource. “I was actually looking for a barbershop, so I went on OCF’s Facebook page and somebody was looking for the same thing, and people were really helpful and suggested a bunch of places,” Baranga said.
Yet, according to Feldman, the administration is reticent to support the program. “The University has not made an effort to actively integrate this program into their structure,” she said.
“I think that McGill is going to try to make an effort in the future to promote commuter student life and engagement in the community. They’re just not sure if this program is the most successful way of doing that,” added Feldman. “I get the impression they’re trying to weed it out in order to let something bigger emerge.”
Whatever McGill’s future plans for the program, it prominently advertised Off-Campus Fest as the off-campus alternative to Rez Fest. “If you click on the Orientation Week website, five things will pop up at you: Discover McGill, Frosh, Rez Fest, Off-Campus Fest, Engage McGill,” noted Feldman. The event quickly reached its capacity of 1,000 attendees – more than double last year’s attendance of 450.
Feldman highlighted the important role that OCF plays in student life.
“We really try to have as many relationships with the students as floor fellows have [in residence]. We are trained: sensitivity training, depression training, the whole shebang,” said Feldman. “[Off-campus students also] need a supporting shoulder, someone to hear them out.”
Executive Director of Student Services Jana Luker and Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens could not be reached for comment by press time.
A previous version of this article stated that the Off Campus Fellows Program was now classified under the general umbrella of Student Services. In fact, the program remains classified under the Rez Life department of Student Housing and Hospitality Services. The Daily regrets the error.

New book aims to create a basis for discussing trans and feminist issues
On October 3, the Centre for Gender Advocacy’s (CGA) annual back-to-school fall event series, “Another Word for Gender,” welcomed famed trans rights activist and author Janet Mock for their keynote address.
Mock, a well-known author, speaker, and activist for trans rights, was in Montreal to speak about gender, race, and her experiences with identity, as well as to discuss her book, “Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much More.”
The event started with a moderated discussion between the CGA’s director, Gabrielle Bouchard, and Mock, who received an enthusiastic cheer from the audience upon entrance; it touched on a variety of topics, from Mock’s personal life to the issues that currently affect the trans community. As Bouchard pointed out, what these issues primarily boil down to is giving people the “freedom to choose, determine, and act so you know you are loved not in spite of your truth, but because of it.”
Born in Honolulu, Mock grew up in a turbulent household where both her parents were, as she put it, “loving and wanting to protect [her], but not knowing how to do so.” At the age of 16, she became a sex worker to pay for college, and by 18 she had “carved out a space for [herself],” to undergo sex reassignment surgery.
Mock said her purpose in writing the book was “to write as if I was communicating with my seventh grade self. I wanted to tell a personal narrative of my life, but also include a ‘manifesto’ of terms and policies and definitions because my seventh grade self didn’t know about ‘transgender-ness’ or feminist issues. By centering on myself, it gave me access and connection to everyone else that will read the work.”
After the moderated discussion, members of the audience were invited to share thoughts and ask questions. A variety of topics were raised, including how people outside the trans community could help tackle discrimination to how racial discrimination that exists in the trans community could be stopped.
Mock also stressed the importance of the other causes she advocates for, namely equality for women and people of colour. As she told the audience proudly, “I call myself a young, transgender woman of colour, and while one of those terms I will soon have to drop, the others form an integral part of my identity […] Even before I identified as transgender, I was at an intersection of race, which is the first thing that makes you realize this world is not yours.”
When asked about the difference between the trans and LGBT movements by an audience member, Mock stated, “For me, the issue was about inclusiveness […] But it is also important to understand that there are transgender people who are and aren’t queer, and who do and don’t identify with the LGBT community.”
Kiana, a McGill student, told The Daily that she was pleased with the event. “It was really inspiring, I still can’t get over how good it was. It’s a really important issue and I’m glad that everyone was so enthusiastic,” she said.
Mock ended the evening’s events with a message to those in the audience: “There’s so much we need to transform, and change, resist, and destroy, build, and reconstruct […] hopefully, we are working toward a world in which, when you decide, you are allowed to change your ID, your name, your gender, whatever the hell you want.”
