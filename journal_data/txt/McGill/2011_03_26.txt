Montreal Auditor General Jacques Bergeron has decided to sue the municipal employees responsible for hacking into his confidential emails
After his confidential emails were hacked, Montreal Auditor General Jacques Bergeron has decided to sue the municipal employees responsible for the espionage.
Bergeron is suing the municipal employees on the grounds that their actions violated the Quebec Cities and Towns Act, which mandates autonomy between municipal employees and the Auditor General.
However, Martine Painchaud, a spokesperson for the Mayor’s office, stated that she thought Bergeron moved too quickly.
“We are very disappointed in that reaction because we would have wished that he would have waited for the Municipal Affairs minister to express himself on this matter before suing,” she said.
Gilles Corriveau, a spokesperson for Jacques Bergeron, disagreed with Painchaud’s assessment. He described the espionage operation by stating, “the whole process is illegal.”
“It doesn’t make any difference. They are mixing apples and oranges,” said Corriveau. “The Municipal minister doesn’t have authority over the Auditor General.”
The recent espionage controversy is one chapter in an ongoing series of corruption incidents, which have plagued Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s tenure. Auditor General Jacques Bergeron uncovered many of these incidents of corruption.
Employees from Comptroller General Pierre Reid’s office – in charge of internal spending – are some of the municipal employees being sued by Bergeron for spying on him.
In a recent article in The Daily, Projet Montréal city councillor Alex Norris said he was not surprised that a city employee who worked to hold municipal workers like Reid publically accountable had been a victim of espionage operations.
Norris stated in an interview to The Daily last week that he believed Tremblay approved the espionage campaign in order to “sideline” the Auditor General by destroying his reputation.
Municipal opposition leader Richard Bergeron (not related to Jacques Bergeron) has issued a formal complaint to the Quebec Municipal Affairs minister regarding the espionage attempt.
Norris applauded the Auditor General’s decision. “It’s not up to the Municipal Affairs minister to settle this issue. The Auditor General does not report to the Quebec Municipal Affairs minister, he reports to the City Council as a whole,” he said. “If Jacques Bergeron establishes that this espionage operation is illegal he will have done a service to Montrealers by having the courts uphold the independence and autonomy of the Auditor General of Montreal.”

Inuit community will vote to end long struggle for self-governance
The region of Nunavik, the northern third of Quebec, officially began a formal referendum period on March 21 in preparation for a region-wide vote scheduled for April 27. The referendum presents the option of creating the Regional Government of Nunavik (RGN).
The completed draft of the Final Agreement for the RGN outlines specific forms of government, such as establishing a parliament-style council and an amalgamation of three of Nunavik’s existing governance structures: the Kativik Regional Government, Kativik School Board (KSB), and the Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services (NRBHSS).
Makivik Corporation, a non-profit Inuit-owned organization, manages the relationship between the Quebec government and Inuit communities who make up 90 per cent of the approximately 12,000 people living in Nunavik.
Makivik’s website identifies the push for self-government as “Quebec’s other quiet revolution” – and something that has been “unfolding slowly but steadily.” Initial advocacy for self-governance originated in the 1960 Federal-Provincial Commission on Arctic Quebec. Feedback from the Commission expressed a desire from Inuit communities to govern themselves.
While the federal and provincial governments are represented in negotiations, Geoffrey Kelley, Quebec minister for Native Affairs, described the Final Agreement and referendum as “more of an Inuit affair.”
“We, in terms of facilitators, negotiate the positions of Quebec, but it’s really above all else them coming to the correct government with the proposal,” said Kelley.
The RGN would not be solely an Inuit authority, instead the proposed structure of the RGN is a public government embracing parliamentary and democratic process, and representing all Nunavik citizens.
Luc Ferland, Bloc Québécois MNA for the Ungava riding – the current Nunavik electoral district – explained the demographics of the region.
“The [Nunavik] territory altogether is 55 per cent of Quebec [with] 14 Inuit villages, nine Cree villages, and five municipalities that are francophone,” said Ferland.
Any Canadian citizen, aged 18 or older, having lived in Nunavik for over a year is eligible to vote in the referendum.
The RGN proposal also has implications for other groups in Ungava and pre-existing governance structures beyond those of Inuit communities.
“A lot of what took some time was developing a dialogue between the Inuit and the Naskapi, who are 800 people and much smaller in the grand scheme of things.  At first, the [KSB] and [NRBHSS] were against the idea [and] started a court case to defend their interests,” said Kelley. “After awhile they abandoned that approach, and again, that took some negotiations to make sure that the interests of education and health care don’t get lost in the model.”
Despite initial resistance to the RGN and the Final Agreement, Kelley said he was optimistic.
“There was a tour done very recently in the 14 villages and there seems to be good enthusiasm so we hope it doesn’t snow on the 27 of April and that people go out and vote in the right direction,” Kelley said.
Parallel to negotiations regarding the RGN and Final Agreement is the ongoing reformulation of Quebec’s electoral districts. Efforts to create a Nunavik riding, giving it its own representative in the National Assembly are been ongoing.
“I have always hoped for [this], even at the beginning, because I have found it to represent an immense territory,” said Ferland.
Due to electoral regulations, the Makivik Corporation is not able to speak publicly on the Agreement during the referendum period.

McGill grad students also taking student federation to court
Upon filing a lawsuit with the Quebec Superior Court on March 17, the Concordia Students Union (CSU) officially became the eighth student union in three years to sue the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS).
The CSU is suing the CFS, the largest student lobby group in Canada, to force the federation to recognize its decision to secede. In March 2010, the CSU held a referendum in which students voted 2,348 to 931 to leave the CFS. The federation has refused to recognize the results of this referendum, and maintains that the CSU is still a member.
“It’s not a choice. CFS forced us to go to court since they are denying us a fundamental right provided by the Charter. We need the court to settle this once and for all,” wrote Heather Lucas, CSU President, in an email to The Daily.
According to Concordia’s newspaper The Link, CSU executives have warned their Council that the court case will likely continue for at least two years, and will cost at least $220,000.
The CFS maintains that the CSU owes the federation $1,033,278.76 in unpaid fees, and refuses to recognize a referendum until the CSU repays its debts. The CSU has refuted these claims.
“We decided to dismiss [the debt] because we have all the paperwork to back our argument [that] we don’t owe them anything,” Amine Dabchy told The Daily last March, while acting as CSU President.
CFS National Chairperson David Molenhuis denied that the federation had violated any bylaws.
“The Federation is defending the bylaws of the organization adopted by members. The Federation maintains that the allegations made are frivolous and without merit,” he wrote in an email to The Daily regarding the suit.
McGill’s Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), one of the other eight unions involved in litigation against the CFS, has been in court for over a year with a similar lawsuit.
PGSS’s case has been ongoing since February 2010, when it asked the courts to require the CFS to set a date for their referendum vote. In March 2010, 86 per cent of PGSS members voted to secede from the federation in a referendum condemned by the CFS. The PGSS is currently in court to force the CFS to recognize the referendum’s results.
“For the moment, the PGSS is still working at making sure that the referendum is being recognized. The case should be inscribed in June 2011, and so the trial in court could go maybe next year in spring 2012,” said Marieve Isabel, who is running acclaimed for PGSS VP External.
Both the PGSS and CSU have accused the CFS of acting undemocratically. Each of the groups is seeking $100,000 in damages.
“We want the courts to condemn the CFS to pay two plaintiffs in the way of punitive damages pursuant to section 349 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the sum of $100,000, because of their violation of the right under article three which provides the freedom to associate,” said Philippe-André Tessier, a lawyer for the CSU, in The Link.
The CSU is currently in the midst of elections. However, if elected, both presidential candidates have promised to continue with litigation against the CFS.

Police investigating possible injuries; FECQ occupy Minister’s premises in Lac-St-Jean
On Thursday, dozens of students occupied the Montreal office of the Quebec Ministry of Finance, while approximately 100 students demonstrated in the building’s entrance to protest impending tuition increases.
Quebec Minister of Finance Raymond Bachand announced on March 17 that tuition will increase $325 per student per year for five years, starting in 2012. Tuition fees are scheduled to reach $3,793 by 2017, almost double the current fees but still below the Canadian average.
The demonstration was organized by the l’Association pour un solidarité syndicale Étudiante (ASSÉ), which has 45,000 members.
Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, ASSÉ director of communications, explained that the objective of the occupation was two-fold.
“We gave a letter of our claims to the minister that explained our discontent to the minister, our most fundamental disagreement regarding the tuition hikes announced last week,” he told The Daily in French.
“It was to give this letter to the minister and let him know that if he doesn’t go back on his decision we would undertake a much greater movement in the months to come,” Nadeau-Dubois continued.
Rue Frontenac reported that dozens penetrated the building through an emergency exit and entered the fifth floor offices. According to Nadeau-Dubois, a bodyguard pushed an activist into the glass door. One student was injured by the shattered glass.
Daniel Lacoursière, a spokesperson for the Service de police de la ville de Montréal (SPVM), said that this claim was still under investigation, explaining that  surveillance cameras were not working, “so we need statements from different witnesses.”
During the demonstration, Nadeau-Dubois left the premises, fearing further action from the building’s security.
“Unfortunately we went to the offices to undertake a pacifist action but the security in the building reacted in a pretty violent way, so violently that we had to go down to the main hall and have a peaceful sit-in because we were worried about our safety,” he said
A red banner was hung in the main atrium of the mall, reading, “Bachand, tes hausses de tariffs fous-toi les dans le cul!” (Bachand, take your fee hikes up the ass!)
Some protestors were hit with pepper spray. Lacoursière did not confirm if it was the police who used the spray, but said that this too was under investigation.
“If it is police that used the pepper spray, not saying that it was not used, so I have no report of that at this point. An investigation will give us more information about that,” he said.
SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi explained that explained that the Quebec Student Roundtable (QSR) would not be calling for occupations of offices any time soon. 	“But it would hypocritical of student representatives to condemn occupations, given that those are what got us seats in the Board of Governors and Senate,” she said.
Arts Senator Tyler Lawson pointed out that in 1997, about 18 students held out for three days, after which ancillary fees were cut in half.
“Tactics substantiate power, and a lot of occupations are pacific, so no one gets harmed,” he said.
Zaidi explained that in the case of a province-wide strike, a special general assembly would be called with 500 students required to make quorum. In such cases, however, she predicted over 1,200 students would show up out of the SSMU membership of around 21,000.
“SSMU is usually the last one to [join a strike] – the movement happens and McGill follows,” she said.
“Surveys commissioned by the administration have shown that McGill students are very privileged, [Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton] Mendelson recently couldn’t grasp why so many students came from upper classes or parents who went to university. Not to put all students in the same bag, but when you are less exposed to students having a hard time, it’s harder for you to feel affected.”
Nadeau-Dubois said ASSÉ is calling for a provincial demonstration March 31 in Montreal.
“This action is really the last straw that we’ll give the Charest government to warn him to back down on the tuition hikes. If he refuses to do so at that time, well then we will embark on a mass mobilization, and we’re ready to go all the way to overcome it,” he said.
FECQ occupies Simard’s office
Around thirty students affiliated with the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ) occupied the premises of Serge Simard, Quebec delegate Minister for Natural Resources, in Saguenay– Lac-St-Jean the same day.
Léo Bureau-Blouin, president of FECQ, explained that the occupation was peaceful and that everyone dispersed when the police arrived.
He described how students in the area had met with Simard a few months ago to present their demands, and engaged in discussions with Minister of Education Line Beauchamp, but feel that there demands did not make it to the Quebec National Assembly.
“There has been no overture on their side, so we must take action,” said Bureau-Blouin. “We are going to protest until the Quebec government stops hiking tuition fees.”
“Almost every student has to [leave] their homes to go to university, not like Montreal or Quebec where students can live at their parents house.  Students have extra costs to afford university…for 70 per cent of students in Lac-St-Jean, it is the first time of their family history that a student is going to university, so post-secondary accessibility is really fragile,” he added.

UQAM Professor describes joining UC Berkeley tuition hike protest
On March 3, nine student demonstrators gathered on the fourth-floor balcony of the University of California, Berkeley’s Wheeler Hall to protest fee increases and budget cuts to higher education. Within hours almost 300 students had gathered under the balcony. UQAM Mathermatics professor Timothy Walsh, who was giving a guest lecture at Berkeley, joined the protest. He sat down with The Daily to share his experiences.
The McGill Daily: Why did you join the protest?
Timothy Walsh:  I was wandering around the campus when I heard the noises, I saw the student protests, I saw the sign. I’m old enough to remember the free speech movement, and I supported it then. I was glad to see that the spirit was still alive, and I support what they stand for. They were planning to raise the fees by some $3,000 at a go and the students were naturally quite upset about it. I can see their point, I didn’t have that much money when I was a student, and I know that some people are saying that when you increase the fees it doesn’t decrease the enrolment. That may very well be true, because there may be other people that have to drop out or not go to university because they can’t afford the fees. But the people who replace them are the people that didn’t make it on marks, and as a professor, I would like to teach stronger students.
MD: Do you consider occupation tactics to be violent?
TW: I wouldn’t consider it violence if nobody got hurt. One the other hand, you have to consider the effect of the image that it gives the public. Generally, these protests are won or lost on public sympathy. It’s very brave of the people to be willing to risk arrest, but it has to be on something that will gain public sympathy, and it’s possible that breaking into an office like that may not. I wouldn’t consider the tactic immoral but I might consider it unwise on that basis.
MD: Several associations at UQAM will be striking to protest impending tuition hikes on March 31. Do you feel that the faculty will support a strike?
TW: I haven’t interviewed the staff but I shared my link to the Cal Daily with others in the Computer Science Department. Quite a few wrote back congratulating me. So just on that small sample space I would imagine that there would be a considerable amount of support among the staff. Certainly the professor’s union, SPUQ (pronounced “spook,”) has supported the students on this and others. It represents the union’s position and quite possibly the majority of the faculty’s position on this.
We ourselves had a strike over financial issues. I entertained the strikers by singing old union songs in English; it would seem quite consistent of us to support the students as well.
MD: Why do you think that students in some faculties are less likely to mobilize around tuition than others?
TW: One reason why a smaller proportion of students in the professional faculties, especially engineering, than arts students join protests is that they are more dependent than arts students upon getting jobs related to their studies upon graduation, and joining protests could harm their job chances.  Some employers may be reluctant to hire graduates who were active protesters, and CSIS [Canadian Security Intelligence Service] would be not at all reluctant to inform them. In my student days at the University of Toronto, I took part in many demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. In 1972, after obtaining my PhD and spending a year in post-doctoral studies, I got a one-year definite term contract as an assistant professor in the University of Waterloo.
After twice telling me that I would have no trouble getting my contract renewed, the head of the department in which I worked invited me into his office and told me that the reason the universities have less money these days is that corporations that profit from the war in Vietnam are discouraged from giving money to universities by the professors and students who protest against that war.  Since my contract was not renewed, and since the demonstrations in which I had participated were in Toronto and not Waterloo, I can only assume that the RCMP had mentioned my participation in those demonstrations to some higher-ups at the University of Waterloo, who in turn indicated to the department head that it would be unwise to renew my contract.
The probability of such a thing happening these days is less than it used to be, but it is understandable that career-oriented students would be reluctant to take even a small risk of reducing their employability.
Another reason is that the protests sometimes directly inconvenience other students.  A case in point is one of the actions in which I was involved at the University of Toronto.  A recruiter from Dow Chemical came onto the campus to interview engineering students.  Dow Chemical made napalm, a sticky gasoline, which the Americans dropped on enemy soldiers in Vietnam, setting them on fire. To protest the use of napalm, we blockaded the building into which the recruiter had entered, preventing prospective employees from entering.  The engineering students were understandably furious with us.  What we should have done is to hand out informational leaflets, explaining our objection to Dow Chemical and asking students to seek employment with companies whose hands were cleaner. …
I think students from all faculties will be willing to support the current protests because increased tuition fees hurt them too – provided that the protesters make common cause with them instead of antagonizing them with ill-considered actions like the blockade I mentioned.

MP campaigning for increased federal involvement
in accessibility and transparency
Niki Ashton, NDP education critic and MP for Churchill, Manitoba, recently introduced a private member’s bill that would increase the federal government’s involvement in the accessibility of post-secondary education. The bill has since been scratched as a result of the upcoming federal election, but Ashton hopes the proposed law will spark debate about the accessibility of university and make college education an election priority.
Ashton’s legislation, Bill C-635, would provide stricter criteria to ensure the equality of academic standards in institutions across Canada. The bill does not call for more federal funding, but instead increases regulations for the distribution of current funding. Currently, the federal government does not play a significant role in financing post-secondary education; the most significant recent federal policy on this issue has been to increase the number of loans granted under the Canada Student Loans Program.
“The idea here is to see that federal government shows leadership in working with the provinces to make post-secondary education more accessible and affordable for students,” said Ashton. “We view this as something that ought to be a priority of our national government, and the federal government can be part of achieving that by establishing a more accountable and transparent framework for giving funds to post-secondary education.”
The bill has been criticized on the grounds that it would complicate the nationwide structure of post-secondary institutions. A recent Winnipeg Free Press article stated that, “There is such a high level of conformity between universities and provincial governments on this file that any federal legislation might only confuse accountability and add another layer of bureaucracy, while conferring little benefit.”
Ashton responded to these criticisms by saying that the federal government needs to be actively involved in helping provinces make post-secondary education more accessible to all students.
“We ought to have a federal government that is assisting in making post-secondary education more affordable, and working with the provinces to do so,” she added.
Joël Pednault, incoming SSMU VP External, does not see the bill as addressing the key obstacle to post-secondary education.
“I don’t see a policy making education more accessible coming from the federal government,” Pednault said. “Their main goal should be to increase funding.”
Although the bill is no longer moving through Parliament, Ashton is still optimistic that it will play an important role in the impending election.
“What we’re saying is that this is also about generating debate,” Ashton said.
“When I’ve visited with students across the country, I’ve shared the message with them that this is an issue that we ought to be raising with our members of Parliament, our candidates from all parties, and challenging them to look at a vision for post-secondary education that includes the federal government and includes real investment that benefits students.”

Complaints against immigration consultant neglected by federal and provincial governments
A Montreal company that provides live-in caregivers is being brought to the Quebec Human Rights Commission on charges of human rights violations and forced labour. The company, Super Nanny, has been trafficking Filipina women from across Asia under the federal government’s Live-in Caregiver (LIC) program.
Evelyn Calugay, president of Filipina worker’s group PINAY, said the women “are being lured by the good life they will have here.”
“They are told they can become permanent residents within 36 months,” Calugay said.
Between 2004 and the time of Aurora’s death in September 2009, more than forty women signed with Super Nanny after he recruited them in Asia. The women would pay over $4,000 to Aurora, in addition to airfare to Montreal.
“They will do anything in desperation to produce this money. If they are in the Philippines, they would sell everything they have, as long as they are able to go somewhere that they will have a better life,” said Calugay.
Steve Richter, of the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), said the case centres on Filipina guest workers, who were brought to Montreal under the pretence that they already have an employer. CRARR is handling the human rights aspect of the case.
“Once [the workers] got here, they were told that the employer was no longer available, and then subjected them to forced labour and coercion into signing a lease in one of his slum houses. He also coerced them into opening bank accounts and life insurance account where Aurora thought was ‘best for them,’” Richter said.
Aprodicio Laquian, professor emeritus in community and regional planning at the University of British Columbia, said that immigration consultants like Aurora have been “a major source of problems” for Filipino migrants.
“Until lately, they were not regulated. At present, there is an Association of Immigration Consultants that tries to regulate the activities of members, but it is only partially effective,” Laquian said. “The Philippine Government has passed laws outlawing unlicensed immigration consultants and making it a crime for them to charge their immigrant clients, but it is extremely difficult to implement the law. Also, many immigrants, especially live-in caregivers, do not come directly from the Philippines – they are recruited in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, the Middle East, et cetera where immigration consultants are not regulated.”
PINAY originally brought the case to the Quebec Human Rights Commission in early 2009, though the commission has been slow to take action. It was notified of Aurora’s death in 2009, yet summoned him for a hearing two months later. The commission also summoned his daughter, Natalie Aurora, but she claimed that she had nothing to do with the cases of human trafficking and exploitation.
CRARR got involved in 2010 in an effort to move the case forward, according to Fo Niemi, the centre’s executive director.
“When we got involved we looked at the evidence again, and we found that that contrary to what the commission believes, his daughter was actively involved in many of these practices,” Neimi said. “We also found that in addition to his daughter there were other people involved, including his secretary who was actively involved, to the point of going to Asia to recruit these women.”
Roland Coloma, an assistant professor of Sociology and Equity Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, voiced the need for regulation of recruitment agencies as well as individuals like Aurora.
“What is distressing is the consistent silence of the municipal, provincial and federal governments to do something about it,” said Coloma. “The LIC program is a federal program. What we need is a strict federal program and policy that can really ensure that women who are being recruited from the global south can have the kinds of right and protection as workers when they come to Canada.”
Niemi expressed that he would like the case to end with a judicial or official declaration that the women have been discriminated against, harassed, and exploited because of their race and social class. Additionally, he would like to see the women compensated as a result of this exploitation.
“Ultimately, it’s the federal and provincial governments that have the powers, but also the responsibility, to ensure these women are protected from the moment they set foot in Canada,” said Niemi.
“We want to raise awareness that the system that we have set up to protect people from discrimination and exploitation has not worked for these women and therefore we need to reform some of these institutions and the protection provided to them,” he continued. “We feel there may be more women working as LICs who are subject to these kinds of conditions but have not come forward.”
According to a Citizenship and Immigration Canada press release, as of the first of April 2011, improvements will be made to the temporary worker program, specifically for LICs. It states that the changes will include “a more rigorous assessment of the genuineness of the offer,” and a “two year probation from hiring for employers who fail to meet commitments to workers.” It remains unclear if these changes will affect the ongoing Aurora case.

New partnership launched last November; concerns focus on human rights program
A group of students in McGill’s Faculty of Law met with administrators Friday to express their opposition and concerns regarding a new program launched in conjunction with Israel’s Hebrew University.
The faculties participating in  joint initiatives are Medicine, Management, Law, and Agriculture. Specific projects revolve around health and epigenetics, international business, human rights law, and food safety and water management.
Sam Bick, U4 History, spoke about the wider implications of McGill’s association with Hebrew University.
“McGill’s partnership with Hebrew University, as well as the Technion [Israel Institute of Technology], is clear support on the part of University for an apartheid government,” he said. “Beyond tangible effect of the research done at these universities, it’s important to acknowledge the apartheid in education, and Palestinians face multiple levels of unequal access to education.”
Fundraising for the partnership is ongoing, but according to Vice President (Research and International Relations) Rosie Goldstein, $1.5 million has already been raised to fund the partnership by “both McGill donors and CFHU[Canadian Friends of Hebrew University], with the proceeds shared by both universities.”
The initiative was announced in November when CFHU presented the 2010 Scopus Award to McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum. The Scopus Award is the “highest award that the Friends of Hebrew University gives out ” said Carolyn Steinman, director of the Montreal branch of CFHU.
Steinman described the previous relationship between McGill and Hebrew University as “friendly,” though this is the first formal relationship established between the two institutions. She added that Munroe-Blum encouraged the partnership after a visit to Hebrew University.
Goldstein pointed to shared research interests as a factor that lead to the collaboration.
“A trip to Israel in 2008 by a number of senior administrators, for example, led to a conversation between our Dean of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Chandra Madramootoo, and experts there. They realized they had similar research interests, especially around the subject of water, and this led to a joint project in Kenya,” wrote Goldstein in an email to The Daily.
Steinman explained that research in epigenetics “will look at disease in a fundamentally new way by providing novel tools for prediction, diagnosis, and prevention.” She added that the project on food security and water management “will initiate a two-university program to improve the lives of the world’s most disadvantaged people,” she added.
Part of the initiative includes a summer law program called The McGill/Hebrew University Summer Program in Human Rights, which is a collaboration between McGill’s Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism (CHRLP) and the Minerva Centre for Human Rights at Hebrew University. The topic for summer 2011 is “Regulating Internal Diversity.”
McGill Dean of Law Daniel Jutras described the objectives of the program’s human rights component.
“The program explores the human rights implications of the regulation of internal diversity given the very different models inspiring Canada, said to be a ‘multicultural mosaic,’ and Israel, said to be a ‘Jewish and Democratic State,’” wrote Jutras in an email to The Daily.
“This brings up issues of law and identities, discrimination and equality, the integration of immigrants and refugees, and the rights to autonomy and self-determination,” he added.
Jutras said that the concerned students and the CHRLP were engaged in a “fruitful dialogue,” and noted that the groups will continue to communicate over the next several weeks.
Safia Lakhani, a third-year law student, expressed reservations about the program. “I don’t know that the institution we’re partnering with shares the same ideals that McGill does, like democratic dissent, equality and a commitment to human rights,” she said.
Lakhani added that she felt it is “particularly perverse that this program would be called ‘Regulating Internal Diversity,’ when there’s been international criticism of the appropriation of Palestinian land and the demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem by the Israeli government.”
“This [program] is particularly worrying about what it says about our standards,” said Lakhani. She stressed the need to consider “what the implications are for the faculty of law, especially our centre for human rights, to endorse this program.”
Goldstein responded to the students’ concerns by stating, “It is likely students have divergent views about all sorts of research that is conducted at McGill and the research partnerships in which the University becomes engaged. McGill, as a leading research-intensive institution, engages with other top-level institutions all over the world.”
“I know that many, many of our students enjoy the incredible experiences international collaborations provide for them,” she added.
Douglas Smith, a member of the Montreal-based Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! called upon McGill to respect the movement for boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
“We support BDS, so we’re calling for academic boycott in the frame of the Palestinian call for BDS,” said Smith, a graduate student at Concordia and member of Tadamon! “The Hebrew Universtiy partnership obviously signals a complete ignorance as far as the role of Israeli institutions of higher learning in human rights abuses.”

Panellist concerned Sudan troubles overshadowed by Arab revolutions
In the wake of Southern Sudan’s January decision to secede from Sudan, government and non-governmental representatives, academics, and students met to discuss coming events at a conference hosted by the McGill Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) last Thursday in the McGill Faculty Club.
The East African country of Sudan has been ravaged by civil war for four decades. Sudan’s conflict finally came to an end in 2005 when the United States brokered the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).
In accordance with the conditions set out in the CPA, a referendum for the self-determination of southern Sudan was held this year. With a 99 per cent majority, the predominantly Christian southerners voted for secession from the historically authoritative Islamic regime in the north. As a result, Sudan will separate into two separate countries effective July 9.
McGill associate professor and Founding Director of the ISID, Philip Oxhorn said that Sudan is a “priority country” for Canada and emphasized the need keep attention on Sudan post-referendum.
“Things are by no means over in Sudan, but the media’s attention has drifted because the referendum was so overwhelmingly in favour of partition and things seemed to be going relatively smoothly.”
Khalid Medani, an associate professor of Political Science and Islamic Studies at McGill and panellist at Thursday’s conference, called attention to post-referendum events in Sudan. He noted that there has been violence – “southerners against southerners” – in the past few weeks. He also pointed to the breakdown of the talks between the governments of the north and south scheduled for March 13. Medani felt that, although there is currently “a huge crisis” in the Sudan, it had been downplayed given recent events in the Middle East.
“It’s by no means a foregone conclusion that the partition will result in peaceful, positive outcomes, particularly in the short term. There are still things that are very worrisome that need to be addressed and can’t be ignored,” said Oxhorn.
Keynote speaker Aggrey Abate, Vice Chancellor of the University of Juba, appealed to Canadian universities for help in fostering higher learning in Southern Sudan. In 1989, the University of Juba was forced to move to Khartoum, the capital city in the north of Sudan. All five colleges of the university were re-located to Juba, the capital of southern Sudan, at the end of last year, but Abate indicated that this required a number of already limited resources.
Elsadig Abunafeesa, a former Sudanese MP who also worked as advisor to the UN on conflict prevention and resolution, voiced his view on the role of the UN being marginalised by the US. He expressed particular concern that the US was “not neutral”  as an arbiter of the CPA.
“If you read the CPA, you’ll see it was not fair. I wish to see now the US go back, and leave the driver’s seat…and the UN take care of the pending issues,” said Abunafeesa. According to Abunafeesa, the UN’s presence will allow that “at least the two sides – the north and the south – can be satisfied with the mediator.”
Whether secession will foster peace in Sudan was not explicitly addressed at the conference. When he spoke with The Daily, Medani said that secession, although a difficult process, would conclude the “many years of sheer brutality by the northern governments.”
“What [secession] resolves is a larger conflict that killed millions of people and devastated the southern part of the country,” Medani explained. “What it has not helped resolve is the issues of development and permanent peace.”
Oxhorn stated how ISID’s conference provided “useful policy suggestions” regarding Sudan.
“We’re having something else on the Sudan war – a closed door chat workshop all day, involving a variety of people from the international community… from Canada, from Sudan, both regions, to talk about these challenges and we’re going to issue a report on that,” he said.
“Some people couldn’t come because of other obligations, some people were unable to get visas quickly enough to be able to come. The people that are speaking on the panel are sort of a cross section of who’s going to be in the private workshop on Friday and they were chosen because they represent different perspectives, different backgrounds,” Oxhorn said.
The closed session was not open to media.
Asked about the role of external actors, panellists agreed that the international community has a crucial role to play both now and after July 9. Douglas Scott Proudfoot, the Director of the Sudan Task Force at the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, said that Canada is already “deeply involved in Sudan,” and will remain so after secession.
“I don’t think this [violence] is going to go away, but that’s precisely why we need to build up capacity in southern Sudan, to govern itself and its citizens, and to keep a UN presence in southern Sudan, including Canada,” said Proudfoot.
“What [the referendum’s] done automatically is it’s created a whole new country and so, whether or not it’s going to allow both Sudans to deal with their variety of conflicts or not, that’s the real challenge,” Oxhorn said.

Smuggling minerals like tin, tungsten, and coltan out of countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps to finance conflict in the region.
Last Tuesday the Concordia Initiative for a Conflict-free Campus (CICC) and Leander Schneider, associate professor in Concordia’s department of Political Science co-hosted a forum to highlight this issue.
These minerals – often referred to as conflict minerals – are used in the production of cell phones and various other electronic products. The money earned from their sales finances the warring groups who control the mines, and enables them to buy weapons and ammunition, proliferating the conflict.
Students Melissa Kabasele and Aidan Pine started the CICC six months ago after approaching Sustainable Concordia about the issue of conflict minerals.
Speaking after the forum, Pine talked about the global importance of the issue.
“The diversity of the crowd at the forum was a testament to how this isn’t a French issue or an English issue or even just a Congolese issue. It’s a human issue,” he said.
According to UN estimates, 5.4 million people have died and 300,000 women have been systematically raped since 1998, making the civil war in the DRC the deadliest armed conflict since World War II.
“It’s something that, whether you’re an activist or not, whether you buy electronics or not, simply being human beings makes us responsible,” said Pine.
Frank Poulsen, Danish filmmaker of Blood in the Mobile and one of the forum’s guest speakers, talked at length about the experience of filming in the DRC and confronting his own cell phone company about conflict minerals.
“They don’t even know their own supply chain,” said Poulsen. “The solution on this is definitely not to leave it for the big corporations, but to make legislation.”
Paul Dewar, MP for the Ottawa Centre riding, spoke at the event about Canada’s role in the the proliferation of these minerals.
“Canada is not just some bystander in this issue. The Toronto Stock Exchange has the highest concentration of mining investment in the entire planet,” said Dewar. “We’re taking resources out,” he said.
Dewar sponsored the private member’s bill C-571, the Trade in Conflict Minerals Act. If passed, this act would create a due diligence mechanism for Canadian companies to ensure they are not purchasing minerals that finance conflicts.
However, due to the fall of the Canadian government last Friday, the bill will be scratched from the parliamentary agenda. It will have to be reintroduced after the election.
Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold is currently suing controversial Canadian author Alain Denault and his publishing house Les Éditions Écosociété for $11 million for defamation stemming from his book.

Conservatives found in contempt of Parliament, early May election predicted
The Conservative government fell last Friday afternoon, setting the stage for an early May election.
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff introduced the motion of non-confidence in Parliament early Friday, which also charged the government with being in contempt of Parliament. The citation for contempt of Parliament was the first of a Commonwealth country’s government.
“I have to inform the House that the official opposition has lost confidence in the government. Today with this motion, we ask the House to do the same, to find the government in contempt and to withdraw the confidence of the House,” said Ignatieff, addressing the House.
The vote passed 156 to 145, ending Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s five-year minority government. Pressure has mounted on the Conservatives in recent months, as opposition parties have condemned the federal government for its management of the economy, its secrecy, and misuse of cabinet confidence.
Earlier last week, a committee of MPs handed the Conservative government Canada’s first-ever contempt ruling as a result of the government’s refusal to publicize the full cost of legislation regarding corporate tax cuts, proposed crime legislation and F-35 fighter jets. This helped pave the way for the motion introduced by Ignatieff on Friday.
After the motion, Harper moved to adjourn Parliament. In a press release shortly after the vote, Harper expressed his disappointment.
“There was nothing in the Budget that the Opposition could not or should not have supported,” he said. “Unfortunately, Mr. Ignatieff and his coalition partners in the NDP and Bloc Quebecois made abundantly clear that they had already decided they wanted an election instead, Canada’s fourth election in seven years, an election Canadians had told them clearly that they did not want.”
In his speech to the House, Ignatieff stated that the Harper government had forced the Liberals’ hand on the matter.
“To those who say an election is unnecessary, we reply we did not seek an election. But if we need one to replace a government that doesn’t respect democracy with one that does, I can’t think of a more necessary election.”
