Most decisions passed with little dissent
SSMU Legislative Council met for the first time this academic year in the Lev Bukhman room of the Shatner building on Thursday, providing new councillors with an opportunity to propose and discuss their new initiatives for the year. SSMU executives presented the formative work they completed over the summer, and sketched out general plans for their portfolios.
Leading Questions
  Senate Caucus Representative Sarah Woolf questioned President Neilson’s nomination of SSMU Speakers of Council. Woolf asked the Co-Speakers Zach Newburgh and Lauren Hudak to state their current club affiliations, questioning whether the speakers could be trusted to act as impartial facilitators. Newburgh revealed that he is president of Hillel Montreal, which oversees anglophone Hillel organizations across Montreal, but insisted that if any “matters of interest” come up, he will defer to his co-speaker.
  Hudak revealed that she had been a member of the McGill club Choose Life, but had stepped down, as she “took this job very seriously, and the impartial nature of it,” and also promised to defer to the other co-speaker in cases where a conflict of interest might arise.
  Last year SSMU dealt with the controversial approval of Choose Life as a full-status club, paired with the raucous Gaza motion at last year’s General Assembly.
  VP Finance Jose Diaz addressed concerns over clubs getting their funding late by promising speedy election of a finance committee.
Tightening Up
  The SSMU exec’s summer reports revealed concerted efforts to tighten up and improve SSMU services and facilities, in addition to making them easier to access. VP Clubs and Services Sarah Olle pledged that her initiative to bring room bookings online will be up and running this Monday.
Ask us first
  VP University Affairs Rebecca Dooley made a short report from the first Senate meeting, expressing dismay that Principal Heather Munroe-Blum had dismissed the possibility for student consultation in the selection process for a Secretary-General.
  She said that the larger issue here was the administration not consulting the governing bodies.
Greener Syllabi
  Guest speakers from the SSMU Environment Commissioners presented their work on coordinating different sustainability-oriented groups, and their plan to create a five-year sustainability blueprint.
  One of their new initiatives is to encourage each faculty to integrate topics on sustainability into their course curricula, and to set up a faculty roundtable toward that goal.
The Student Movement
  VP External Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan presented SSMU’s role in the new student consortium Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ). The group will oppose Provincial Bills 38 and 44 that would impose a quota of external representatives on post-secondary institutions’ boards of directors.
  Science Representative Joshua Abaki asked Ronderos-Morgan why SSMU is slated to pay for 40 per cent of TaCEQ’s expenses. Ronderos-Morgan replied that the number was a rough estimation that had been hashed out in consultation with other TaCEQ members, and stated that SSMU only spent $345 to support the student federation during the summer – a figure that he said will not increase in the future.
  Ronderos-Morgan also said that he wishes to be a dynamic part of Quebec’s student movement, pushing for accessibility and trying to mend the education funding crisis in Quebec, which he pointed out, “came from Quebec [City] and Ottawa.”
A 10-year plan
  SSMU’s five-year lease of the Shatner building will expire in 2011. SSMU President Neilson said that he wants to start negotiating with McGill a year early, in hopes of securing a longer lease this time around.
  If this can be done, President Neilson said that SSMU could form long-term plans with building tenants, student-run food establishments, and looking into sustainable infrastructure changes.
Community Relations
  Ronderos-Morgan and VP Internal Alex Brown said that they have worked to foster better relations with the Milton-Parc community, specifically the Milton-Parc Citizens Committee. Brown expressed dismay, however, over the recent behavior of Froshies and Frosh leaders, which had further alienated the local community.

Members disenchanted with student fedederation’s transparency and legal methods
Members of  13 student societies across Canada – including McGill’s Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) – have started petitions asking their peers if they wish to leave the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), Canada’s largest student lobby group.
The development comes almost two years after student unions at the University of Cape Breton, Simon Fraser University, and Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia tried unsuccessfully to leave the federation because either the student unions failed to meet CFS’s referendum by-laws, or students ultimately chose to stay with CFS following litigation.
Students circulating the petitions expressed strong disenchantment with CFS, and some felt that the fees their union paid – ranging from $40,000 to $300,000 a year – could be better spent elsewhere.
“Our problem with CFS is two-fold: on the one hand, we feel they are incompetent lobbyists. On the other, there is a sentiment among many students that CFS staff, offices, lawyers, and budgets are used to sway political consensus among students,” said James Murphy, a petition organizer at Trent University.
Litigation
 Many student petition organizers expressed frustration with what they feel is a track record of aggressive litigation by CFS. In recent years, many of the student unions that have tried to de-federate from CFS have found themselves in hot legal water when they failed to follow CFS by-laws.
Simon Fraser University’s independent student paper The Peak reported that a case between CFS and their student union, on whether it had the right to leave the federation, went all the way to the Supreme Court of B.C.
The Kwantlen Student Association’s VP External Derek Robertson confirmed that his society was taken to court for similar reasons. Similarly, the Student Union of Acadia University in Nova Scotia spent almost 10 years in litigation after they tried to leave CFS in 1996.
Former Canadian University Press (CUP) president and  Maclean’s OnCampus writer Erin Millar said that legal threats from CFS have extended beyond student unions to student journalists in the past.
“In my experience, working as a student journalist, and my work at CUP and Maclean’s, CFS has consistently been the most aggressive organization I’ve ever covered just in their trying to prevent journalists from doing their job in reporting on them,” she said. “They’ve done that by employing legal means. They spend a lot of money using lawyers to intimidate journalists, which I think is a completely inappropriate way to spend students’ money.”
Revolving doors
Other student organizers were concerned with what they saw as a revolving door policy between pro-CFS student politicians and the CFS national or regional headquarters
Robertson pointed to the example of Hamid Osman, the pro-CFS president of York University who became the CFS National Executive Representative for Ontario after his time at York, during which students tried to impeach him.
“Instead of him facing the students for reelection he became the National Executive Representative for Ontario,” said Robertson.
Another student noted that the former Concordia Student Union VP External Colin Goldfinch became a member of the board of CFS’s Quebec chapter last year.
In Quebec, eyebrows were raised when Concordia’s independent student paper The Link reported that Noah Stewart-Ornstein, CFS National Deputy Chairperson,  kept his job after being caught on security tapes tearing down posters of the anti-CFS slate during the Concordia Student Union’s elections last year.
Transparency and reform
 Many student leaders stated that they felt CFS was not adequately transparent and accountable to its member organizations. Both Derek Robertson and Veronique Dorais, the presidents, respectively, of Kwantlen Student Association and the Graduate Students’ Association of the University of Calgary – where petitions to leave CFS are currently being held – said past executives had become frustrated with CFS for these reasons.
“One of our executives last year went to a meeting and everything he asked for was dismissed. Every motion he proposed, asking for financial audited statements or minutes from the meeting were defeated,” Dorais said.
Former SSMU VP External Devin Alfaro said that during SSMU’s time as a prospective member at CFS – from fall 2006 until fall 2007 – its executives found it very difficult to pass motions they hoped would improve CFS’s accountability.
“SSMU presented a series of motions at one [annual general meeting], that were not well received. One was accepted – that executive reports list resolutions [from previous years] and what [the executive] had done to follow up on them. One motion wasn’t well received, that gave student media full access to the [meeting] – most of it happens behind closed doors. The final motion [would have] posted meeting minutes online,” Alfaro said.
CFS responds
 Though the CFS National Treasurer Dave Mulenhuis said that he could not comment on some of the litigation between the CFS and its members, because it predated his tenure at the CFS, he said that as a democratic organization, any problems members had with the CFS could still be fixed internally.
“The CFS is the common democratic framework under which the student movements in Canada make decisions on campaign lobbying and services decisions. The by-laws of the federation are voted on by delegates at general meetings. Student unions vote on their common democratic framework; it’s up to them,” he said.
Mulenhuis also said that CFS is a transparent organization, and ready to provide its members with any documents they require.
“With [regard to] financial records, the audited financial statements are presented in budget committee. They are handed to absolutely every delegate who attends a federation general meeting. They’re sent to every member locale of the federation who does not send delegates to a national general meeting,” he said.
“All the financial records are available to students who wish to access them, because they are housed in the student unions of schools who are members. [It’s] the same with copies, by-laws, and constitution of the federation for every student to see and review.”
Mulenhuis added that a member of CUP is invited to CFS annual general meetings to represent the press.
The road to referendum
If the petitions at the 13 student societies achieve a 10 per cent quorum, their supporters will have to wait up to five months before CFS recognizes their petition, and the date for their referendum is set.
During that time, CFS will first have to acknowledge their receipt of the petition, then within three months decide on whether to acknowledge its legitimacy. If the CFS chooses to approve it, they have 60-90 days to set the date themselves.
A student organizer at Guelph University highlighted some of the obstacles the system posed to student societies attempting to de-federate.
“You can’t campaign from April 15 to September 15, and can’t campaign over winter holidays,” he said. “In six and a half months you only have a window of half a month to initiate a referendum campaign.”
Dorais said student organizers at her society were nervous their petitions could lead to legal action by the CFS.
“We’re going to try to work with the CFS to follow the referendum and guidelines point by point, if this is what the student body wants,” she said.
Societies can expect CFS supporters to arrive on campus during their referendum. When the Graduate Students’ Society of the University of Victoria successfully left the CFS in March 2008, the university’s student paper The Martlet reported that pro-CFS supporters flew in from across the country to support the pro-CFS campaign.
Students at PGSS, the Concordia Student Union, the Graduate Student Association of Concordia, the Dawson Student Union, the Society of Graduate Students at Western Ontario University, University of Windsor Students’ Alliance, Carleton University Students’ Association, the Central Student Association at Guelph University, the Trent Central Student Association, the Kwantlen Student Association, the University of Victoria’s Student Society, the Graduate Students’ Association of the University of Calgary, and the University of Regina Students’ Union are all circulating petitions to leave the CFS.

With the cafeteria at Royal Victoria College (RVC) closed, and the kitchen at the new Carrefour residence still undergoing renovations, McGill’s new food service system has faced significant obstacles. But Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson said that McGill’s decision to merge the previous system, which was run by Food Services and Ancillary Services, into a consolidated system under the purview of his office will ultimately be an improvement.
“Students are the most important group of clients, and food locations are social spaces, integral to residences. That was the reason why the two areas were merged,” said Mendelson.
McGill residences have also moved to a declining balance system, in which funds allocated to meals are deducted with each item purchased. The system was implemented in order to reduce food waste and provide students with greater options.
Mathieu Laperle, Director of McGill Food and Hospitality Services, backed the new system, saying that previously, students paid a fixed price for their meal plan, and were not reimbursed for meals they missed. He added that less food will be wasted under the new system, and that students will be given more options.
In response to complaints that the cost of food at McGill residences is too high, the average price of a meal at Upper Rez cafeterias was dropped by $2 last week.
“Price is always a challenge and [we try] to have a balance between good food and an affordable price,” said Laperle. “If you go to the grocery store by yourself, you see that food is more expensive than it was before.”
Mendelson commented that because the University is underfunded, food operations at McGill have to be financially self-sufficient.
“A lot of direct and indirect costs have to be supported,” Mendelson said.
Laperle said that the University has taken measures to redress the current problems by altering RVC meal plans so that residents can eat at all McGill and Martlet locations on campus.
According to Mendelson, Carrefour residents are to be refunded $250 of their rent per month, and given a $100 gift card to purchase food at Martlet locations.
Laperle said that he would work to address student concerns and to make more options available.
Students can submit comments and suggestions to the McGill Food and Hospitality Services web site, and student-led food committees will be established in the coming weeks.

Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) and leaders of its student-workers union, Syndicat des étudiant-e-s employé-e-s (SÉTUE) have drawn up a new contract. SÉTUE workers at the school have been working without a contract since May 31, 2008, when the former contract expired.
The settlement came after almost 15 months of negotiations, and both union and administration leadership are pleased with the outcome.
Eric Dremers, president of SÉTUE, said that the negotiations were tense at times, but ultimately satisfactory.
“We are very happy with the work that the negotiating committee did. It was a very difficult negotiation. [UQAM] was, at the beginning, completely closed to any suggestions [from us]”, Dremers said in an email to The Daily.
Starting June 9, 2009, unionized student workers will begin earning wage parity with their counterparts at Université de Montréal, representing an average increase of 20 per cent. The union also gained an extension in their time frame for filing grievances, from 30 to 45 days, and job descriptions are now included in the collective agreement.
The contract has yet to be ratified by SÉTUE, whose 3,000 members will convene on October 7 and 8 to decide whether or not to adopt the new contract. This new contract will expire December 31, 2013 if adopted. The administration said in a press release, in French, that it is “especially happy with the agreement, in that it meets the top priorities adopted by the university in the Strategic Planning Framework of 2009-2014, and would balance the budget.”

City Hall is pushing for more stringent regulation of Montreal’s underground structures, and has demanded that the proprietors of Square Victoria, Place Bonaventure, and the Sun Life building facilitate inspections by Quebec’s Régie du bâtiment.
In 2007, two fractures in a tunnel beneath Maisonneuve caused the City to close both the road and the Metro. Mayor Gerald Tremblay subsequently requested safety reports on 63 of the city’s buildings, but to date only 16 have complied.
The death of Léa Guilbeault, who was killed by a slab of falling concrete at the Marriott Hotel on Peel last July, has given a sense of urgency to the City’s commitment to safeguard the downtown’s infrastructure.
“Structures deteriorate,” said McGill Professor Saeed Mirza, who formally served as president of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering. “But the inspections normally don’t get carried out. It’s ‘design, build and forget.’”
He added that buildings not properly maintained pose a serious risk to society.
“There are large costs, not only economic, but social and environmental costs associated with neglect,” Mirza said.
When contacted by The Daily, management at the Sun Life building denied ever receiving an inspection request from the City.

Community concerned that case will not address racial profiling by police
The coroner’s inquest into the shooting death of Fredy Villanueva by Montreal police officer Jean-Loup Lapointe is slated to begin this October, now that the Villanueva family has been able to procure legal representation.
  The 18-year-old was killed in Montreal North when an argument broke out between a group of youth and Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) officers in August of 2008.
  The inquest was delayed last May after the Villanuevas and affiliated parties could not pay their legal fees. The government of Quebec has now paid for the Villanuevas’ lawyers, after having provided legal representation only for the police officers involved.
  A recent victory for the family’s lawyers involved a switch in the order of testimony, with the police tentatively slated to testify first, and the youth witnesses to testify second.
  “It’s a good thing [the police officers] are testifying first because they’ve never given their version of the story before,” said John Philpop, a lawyer for the Villanuevas. “[The police officers] won’t have a chance to adjust their story based on the testimony [of the youth witnesses].”
  Philpop said that while it is still not guaranteed that the police officers will testify first at the hearing in October, if the new order of testimonies is accepted, it would go a long way in determining “whether [the shooting] was self-defense or criminal.”
  In spite of this victory for the Villanueva camp, many people, particularly the Montreal North community, are worried that the inquest will not confront the overarching problems behind the Villanueva shooting – namely, the issue of racial profiling.
  “The restricted mandate of this type of investigation allows neither a true study of the socio-economic conditions of the population nor an equitable representation of the victims of the police force,” said the Montreal North newspaper Republik in a statement released in May.
  “The investigation…aims to wash the police officers of any suspicion, and is unaware of the fundamental causes of the social strain in Montreal North.”
  Republik called for an investigation into larger causes of police repression in the Montreal North community, and the sentiment has continued to grow in the year since Villanueva’s death.
  SPVM policy prohibits the police force from making public comments before the inquiry.
  Philpop emphasized that the investigation will not be held as a criminal trial.
  “People are concerned about not having a court that deals with profiling…. The problem with the relationship between police and minorities is important,” said Philpop.
  “Police treat blacks differently. I never get pulled over…. They don’t touch me because I’m white.”
  The government of Quebec intends to address some of the community’s grievances by holding a separate inquiry into racial profiling. Quebec’s Human Rights Commission announced last week that it would hold public hearings within the year, which will offer young Quebeckers from minority groups an opportunity to share their experiences of discrimination.
  “The issue of discrimination seems to be present in many aspects of public life…beyond the police,” Francois Larsen, the commission’s director of research and education, told the CBC on Thursday.
  But regardless of whether the Villanueva inquest will address the racial tensions of the Montreal North community, Philpop said that the case will highlight the consequences of racial profiling within the police force.
  “Hopefully it will set a political precedent…. [This case] is going to be an example, ” he said.
