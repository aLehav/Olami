Student seeks invalidation of Fall referendum, First Year Council election results
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Judicial Board (J-Board) has recently accepted a petition filed by U3 Arts student Alexei Simakov against the SSMU executive, the SSMU Board of Directors, and Elections SSMU.
Simakov’s petition claims that the decision to rehire Ben Fung, who was Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) last year and was rehired this year for the same position, was made without the participation of the Nominating Committee and without a ratification by SSMU Council, as is required by article 2.4 of SSMU’s bylaws. It extends this reasoning to the hiring of all members of the Elections SSMU staff for the 2014-15 year who were also not selected by the Nominating Committee.
The petition therefore requests that all elections carried out under the supervision of Fung, such as the First Year Council (FYC) elections and the Fall 2014 referendum on the University Centre Building Fee question, be declared invalid.
According to Simakov, he filed the petition on September 22, the first day of the Fall 2014 referendum campaign period, and requested an interim order for the Fall 2014 referendum to be postponed. Simakov said that he received no response from the J-Board until after the referendum period had passed.
Simakov noted that himself and U3 Arts student McKenzie Kibler, to whom Simakov referred as his “advisor,” were not seeking personal gain from the petition.
“The petition is not for us. We have nothing to gain, we have no stakes in this,” Simakov told The Daily. “We’re doing this on behalf of the entire student body who have been frustrated, and because of SSMU have become apathetic.”
The petition relies on “all the record of Council documents uploaded on SSMU website [sic]” to determine that “there is an absence of [a] Nominating Committee.”
According to the petition, “the contract of Mr. Ben Fung in the capacity of CEO expired on 30th May 2014, and [he] was automatically rehired by President of SSMU, against article 2.4 of SSMU by-laws.”
SSMU President Courtney Ayukawa, however, stated in an email to The Daily that Fung was, in fact, rehired as CEO for the 2014-15 academic year through the previous SSMU executive’s decision to renew his contract.
“The decision was made before the current, 2014-15 SSMU executives’ terms had even started,” Ayukawa stated. “Based upon a plain reading of the bylaws, the 2013-14 Executive Committee’s decision to renew Ben Fung’s contract did not require a meeting of a Nominating Committee, given that the contract was a renewal, not a new hire.”
“I have searched through old documents relating to SSMU hiring process and cannot find evidence of the selection process outlined in By-Law Book I (which is Nominating Committee selecting the CEO and bringing that recommendation to Legislative Council) being followed for at least the past five years,” she added.
2013-14 VP External Samuel Harris seconded Ayukawa’s statement in an email to The Daily.
“The approval or disapproval of the hiring of an employee (or rehiring) is made at the Executive Committee,” Harris said.
“Student staff positions are under the responsibility of different executive portfolios. Responsibilities can include evaluating candidates (either incumbents or interviewees) to recommend for approval at the Executive Committee,” he added.
In an email to The Daily, 2013-14 VP University Affairs Joey Shea said that “SSMU employees are hired by the execs responsible for their portfolio. The CEO is under the president’s portfolio,” and was unable to comment further.
2013-14 SSMU President Katie Larson did not respond to an email from The Daily asking to confirm this statement.
Fung emphasized in an email to The Daily that he and the Elections SSMU staff had taken no part in their rehiring.
“We weren’t involved in the renewal of our contract in any way other than sending a re-application to SSMU HR [Human Relations] just like any student applying to the job would have,” he stated.
In an interview with The Daily, Simakov highlighted that the petition is not a personal attack directed toward Fung.
“There are people who are responsible for where he is now and this has nothing to do with him necessarily. I won’t comment on his performance in the position. What I will comment [on] though is that it’s particularly egregious that the [hiring for the] position of CEO was done illegally, given how contentious and how controversial his position was in the last election,” he said.
Kibler expressed what he hopes he and Simakov will achieve, in the event that Simakov wins his case at a J-Board hearing.
“What we hope this shows is that when the next elections to SSMU Council happen next spring, that those undertaking positions for SSMU and who are elected to SSMU positions understand clearly these positions and responsibilities associated with them and will not take them lightly and will understand that students at McGill are willing and able and have been successful in [holding them] accountable,” he stated.
J-Board’s Chief Justice Muna Tojiboeva stated that she will only be able to confirm the date of the hearing once the J-Board receives the respondents’ positions on October 29, as both parties could agree to mediation instead of a hearing. However, Simakov stated that a hearing was scheduled for November 3.

Post-grads to push for integration with Quebec’s public healthcare system
As of this September, the premium for McGill’s health insurance plan for international students has dropped by $101 per year for individuals, $312 per year for individuals with dependents, and $594 per year for individuals with families, to $849, $2604, and $4953 respectively.
This decrease follows almost three years of lobbying from past executives of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) via the Advisory Committee on International Students (ACIS). This lobbying was done in order to push the University to engage in a competitive bidding process (called a request for proposals (RFP)) for the international students’ health insurance plan.
However, the premium rates for private insurance plans for international students are still high, mostly due to the fact that international students are charged three times the rate of the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ), the Quebec government health insurance board, for the medical services they receive in a hospital.
Following the RFP process this spring, the University successfully negotiated a deal with the current insurance provider, Blue Cross, which had already been providing a health plan for international students for the past twenty years.
Director of International Student Services Pauline L’Ecuyer told The Daily, “It’s a two-year contract [with Blue Cross], and we’ll have to decide if we want to do another RFP in two years.”
The lobbying process for a more affordable healthcare plan for international students began in 2011. According to former PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney, the process required a great deal of effort on the part of the students to persuade the administration to take action.
“We brought up the issue in 2011. And then when we came back in 2012, we had even more arguments, because we listened to what [the University’s] concerns were, and why they thought maybe [doing an RFP] is not a good idea. We planned ahead, we talked to each other, and went in with strong arguments,” Mooney told The Daily.
Mooney admitted, however, that the lobbying process was long-winded. According to PGSS Health Commissioner Elizabeth Cawley, this is because ACIS meets only three or four times a year.
“At the first meeting you are told what international students pay versus Canadian residents. You go back, you think about it. Then, another meeting, you ask some questions about it. By the time you go, ‘Oh maybe we should do something about this,’ it’s the last meeting of the year,” Cawley explained.
“It requires students staying on these positions, asking the right questions, doing their research, talking to people. It does take time. I certainly wouldn’t say that the three years is a reflection of [the University’s] bad will. Not at all. When it came to the point when we had really decided this had to happen, they actually acted on their own,” she added.
According to PGSS External Affairs Officer Julien Ouellet, PGSS will now try to push further in order to have the provincial government allow international students to be covered under the RAMQ.
“We’ve been taking a few steps at the FEUQ [Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec] to have a research project on the administrative obstacles faced by international students. […] And what we want [the provincial government] to do is basically provide a public option that [international students] would have to pay into, but, at the same time, since it’s the government […] it would be revenue-neutral,” said Ouellet in an interview with The Daily.
Mooney later emphasized the importance of students’ perseverance in pushing the administration to finally ensure accessible health insurance at McGill for international students.
“If student [representatives] didn’t bring this up over three years, it wouldn’t have happened. It required the consistent message from student representatives on the ACIS for this to happen. That being said, once the University got the message, they ran with it, and they delivered a great result to students,” Mooney said.

Administrator scorned project findings, internal document shows
The McGill Cycling Working Group has released a report recommending that a “shared space” policy between cyclists and pedestrians on campus be implemented, beginning with a “carefully monitored” pilot project. However, the McGill administration believes that more research needs to be done before the implementation can begin.
“This is a complex subject that has generated strong feelings on campus,” Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Robert Couvrette, told The Daily in an email. “We have accepted the group’s recommendation for more study before the pilot project is implemented.”
However, Harald Kliems, a member of the working group and former member of the Flat Bike Collective, told The Daily that more research was not the conclusion the group came to.
“The administration claims to say that further research with no implementation is what the working group recommended, [but] if you bother to look at the recommendations of the group, you see that that’s not exactly what we recommended.” In fact, the report recommends the implementation of the shared space policy in the “short term.”
“I disagree with the opinion that more research needs to be done instead of […] actually implementing shared space and researching that,” Kliems told the Daily.
“Changing the policy would legitimize the perspective of scofflaws.”
Couvrette created the working group following negative reactions to the installation of the Milton bicycle gates in the Fall 2013 semester with the goal of discussing and researching whether McGill should allow cycling on the lower campus. Members of the group were selected among students, staff, and faculty; experts and representatives of groups likely to be affected by a shared space policy were consulted during deliberations.
The group’s 43-page report finds that the “dismount policy,” in place since 2010, is an ineffective means of ensuring the safety of pedestrians and cyclists – since it is poorly enforced – and that a change of policy is required.
“I do get the impression that the administration, or parts of it, are pretty strongly opposed to having any cycling on campus, [and] that the call for further research is meant to be a stalling tactic,” Kliems said.
In fact, according to an internal document from the working group obtained by The Daily, Provost Anthony Masi criticized the project during a review period, calling the group’s report “biased” and stating that “the quality of the data is low [and] the risk to pedestrians is underestimated.” He also called cyclists “scofflaws,” according to the document, adding that “changing the policy would legitimize the perspective of scofflaws.”
Couvrette stated that “[a] decision on a shared space model will only be made once this next level of research has been completed. It’s [too] early to say whether it will be a yes or a no.”
“Hopefully something will come out of that, but I suspect it will take a serious amount of time,” said Kliems. “I’m somewhat pessimistic – I mean, eventually it will probably happen, but who knows when?”

Off-Campus Fellow Program to be extended, Senate composition reviewed
On October 22, Senate met for the second time this year and approved changes to regulations on graduate student supervision and to the composition of Senate. Questions from senators addressed McGill’s policy toward athletes with a criminal record, the promotion of a safer campus, and support for the Off-Campus Fellow Program.
A set of changes to the regulations on graduate student advising and supervision, presented by Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies and Associate Provost (Graduate Education) Martin Kreiswirth, sought to create mandatory supervisory committees and orientations for supervising professors, as well as to clarify existing guidelines. The changes have been in the works for the past few years, following ongoing complaints about supervision from graduate students that began in at least 2012.
Both Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Medicine Senator David Benrimoh and Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) President Juan Camilo Pinto were pleased with the proposed clarification of the student-supervisor relationship.
“From a student’s point of view, it gives me a clear idea of what I can expect and how the [supervisor-student] relation is going to be,” said Pinto. “This is critical for graduate students.”
Arts Faculty Senator Catherine Lu expressed concern that the document was unclear, arguing that it was poorly structured and that it did not make the distinction between supervision and advising evident. “I found it confusing,” said Lu. “There’s no rational ordering to the whole document.”
Kreiswirth urged Senate to approve the document, given that the changes had been in the works for a long time, and that it had already been approved in principle by Senate in May. “It’s time to vote on this as it stands,” said Kreiswirth, adding that he didn’t want to feed into the common sentiment that “it’s very difficult to make changes at McGill, we just stall and stall.”
After some debate, Kreiswirth accepted an amendment to bring the policy to Senate for review after three years, having monitored its implementation. The changes to the regulations were approved, with five senators voting against.
Addressing a question from SSMU Law Senator Dan Snyder and VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan on cultivating a culture of consent and gender equity in Athletics, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens reiterated his position that McGill would make no special provisions in that regard. “I will not target one group of students and divert resources,” Dyens stated in his written response.
Medicine Faculty Senator Gordon Crelinsten disagreed, arguing that student athletes could in fact benefit from a “concentrated, targeted program,” because they are “at risk [and] more vulnerable than other ambassadors of the university.”
Addressing a separate question from Science Faculty Senator Tim Moore, Dyens also clarified McGill’s position on inviting someone with a criminal record to join an athletics team, explaining that the decision would be taken on a case-by-case basis, with himself and Provost Anthony Masi having the final say.
In response to Lu who noted that disciplinary action is usually not entirely discretionary, but rather is a ruling that requires a formal procedure, Dyens said that the University was “looking into that process” to see if improvements could be made.
Responding to a third question from SSMU Arts Senator Jacob Greenspon, Dyens noted that he has asked residences and Campus Life & Engagement to submit a joint plan by the end of the year to extend the Off-Campus Fellow Program, a service aimed at integrating students living off campus into the McGill and Montreal communities. The program’s funding has recently been cut, and its future was uncertain.
Senate also approved revisions to the University Statutes modifying the composition of Senate itself, bringing the size of the body from 107 to 113 members. Masi explained that the changes sought better proportionality in representation of the faculties.
Pointing out that students represent 29 per cent of Concordia’s senate, Stewart-Kanigan expressed concern that the review did not increase the proportion of student representation, keeping it at around 18 per cent.
Robert Couvrette, Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) presented the report of the Senate Committee on Physical Development for 2013-14, which details the construction work undertaken during the year. Couvrette explained that the Wong building’s masonry is being completely replaced, even though the building was built only in 1996, because “the stone was installed with bad design. We have a lawsuit for the contractor and the architect on that.”

Failure to include Indigenous voices a concern
At a press conference on October 15, the minister responsible for Plan Nord, Pierre Arcand, announced that Quebec will soon be creating a research centre called l’Institut nordique du Quebec (INQ), or the Northern Institute of Quebec. Surrounded by representatives from McGill, Université Laval, and the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), Arcand stated that the institute will be performing research on areas in Northern Quebec.
The institute will gather information on these areas in conjunction with the controversial Plan Nord, a proposed project to extract resources from the lands of First Nations and the Inuit, such as the Kuujjuaq Inuit land. The lands contain many natural resources, including gold, iron ore, rare earth metals, and diamonds.
The provincial government of Quebec will provide the project with $3 million from the Fonds du Plan Nord, or the Northern Plan Fund, for the creation of the institute, which will not have a central location between the three universities involved.
“The plan is for INQ to become a hub for research, innovation, and community development related to the North across disciplines, including in areas like the responsible use of natural resources, nutrition and health of Indigenous people, civic security in the Arctic, access to education, and renewable energy,” McGill’s Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations) Rose Goldstein told The Daily in an email.
The areas of Northern Quebec being targeted by this research are sparsely inhabited, and little research is currently available on the area.
Therefore, according to INRS Vice-President of Research and Academic Affairs Yves Bégin, current research methods will have to be revised and replaced with other methods that can more accurately represent the current situation of the areas to be studied.
“The key point is to see the north from the north. Anyone who has experience will say that the north is so particular that everything has to be reinvented,” Bégin told The Daily in an email, though he did not go into specifics of the research methods that will be used.
He said their research will cover a variety of topics, including, “biodiversity, population health, economy, mining, [and] permafrost.”
“This initiative is aligned with the Quebec government’s focus. […] INQ is not, however, part of the Plan Nord,” said Goldstein.
Both Bégin and Goldstein claimed that the research aspect of the INQ would attempt to incorporate the perspectives and insights of Indigenous people already living in those regions. “Consultations with internal and external communities will certainly be part of our work as we create a world-class research program to take place at this future institute,” said Goldstein.
Speaking about the INQ project specifically, Bégin mentioned that one of the goals of the INQ is to include Indigenous perspectives in the research conducted, and that, in his experience, the Northern communities have been involved since the inception of the program.
With regard to McGill’s efforts to include Indigenous peoples, Goldstein stated, “We will collaborate with the partner institutions to develop a governance plan, extend the partnership to encompass Northern communities, establish a budget, and initiate program development.”
Tunu Napartuk, the mayor of the village of Kuujjuaq in Northern Quebec, told The Daily that the consultation process for Plan Nord has been extremely limited, and that no one in the Kuujjuaq community was told specific details of the plan.
“When it first came out a number of years ago, we were informed at the same time as the general public. […] Afterward, we were taken by surprise and we’re now trying to adjust and see how the plan now is going to work for the north,” said Napartuk.
Napartuk explained why the proposed projects are worrying and that he wished that he and his community had been consulted more.
“We live off the land. […] Inuit groups on the land learned how to work with the land and survive off it for many centuries, so the land and the environment are extremely important to us,” he explained.
“So when there’s another group of people that show interest in our land – we call it our land because we’ve been on this land for many thousands of years – when there’s other groups of people who show interest in our land, we’re always concerned, and we always want to take part in the process, to be informed, to have the right to ask questions on what the plans are,” he added.
Napartuk explained that regional leaders, elected from within the people in Kuujjuaq, are the ones who voice their concerns about projects happening within their territory to the government.
“We do have leaders, regional leaders, elected leaders, that we elect within our people, and they’re the ones who have been spending a lot of energy, and pass on their concerns about any projects that may happen within our territory.”
“[Regional leaders] regularly meet and inform the provincial leaders, and the [provincial] government – I hope by this time – clearly understands what our concerns are,” said Napartuk.
Napartuk said that although the government listens to the concerns voiced by regional leaders, they are not necessarily prioritized over the general goals of the province.
“In the north, especially North[ern] Quebec, we have the tendency of finding out things after projects or programs have started, and the whole process of consultation has always been challenged. So, to be consulted, and to be made aware of how things are going to work, especially if the projects are very important, that needs to happen here,” explained Napartuk.
The Plan Nord project was first proposed in 2011 by the Liberal party, but was put on hold for 19 months after the Parti Québécois came into power in 2012. After the Liberals won the elections in April under Philippe Couillard, the project was revived with a few changes.
Major changes from the 2011 version include a new revenue-sharing scheme between regions, whereby tax revenue used to fund the project will be used for both extracting natural resources and youth development programs. Additionally, a stronger focus will be placed on the development of the mining industry with a $1 billion investment by the Quebec government in Quebec contractors building mining equipment.
Plan Nord’s overall focus on the exploitation of the natural resources on lands belonging to Indigenous peoples has already earned criticism from many environmental and social justice groups, including Divest McGill. When the plan was first introduced in 2011, Divest McGill issued a statement saying, “Quebec’s Plan Nord involves some of the largest, dirtiest companies on the planet and provides for extraordinary environmental destruction across huge swaths of Northern Quebec. Much of this will occur on Native land, as the voices of Indigenous peoples fall on the deaf ears of politicians.” Activists have also demonstrated against the project for similar reasons.
Both the original and current plan involve heavy investments in research on the resource-rich lands of Northern Quebec and infrastructure development, the latter of which aims to increase the accessibility of natural resources in Northern Quebec.

Panelists discuss consent education, sexual assault policy
On Thursday, four panelists participated in a discussion hosted by the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)’s Equity Committee to address how best to foster a culture of consent on and off the McGill campus. The event was a part of the #ConsentMcGill campaign, held from October 20 to 24, which aimed to educate students, faculty, and staff about consent in sexual situations and daily life.
The panel was composed of three students: Alice Gauntley, a Healthy McGill Peer Educator specializing in sexuality education; Roma Nadeem, a member of the SSMU Equity Committee and former Rez Life coordinator; and Jean Murray, External Coordinator at the Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS). The panel also included Carrie Rentschler, an associate professor in the Department of Art History & Communications who focuses on feminism and media. Panelists discussed what a culture of consent would look like on the McGill campus, as well as the obstacles facing its establishment.

Gauntley said that a community that fosters consent is one “where the principles of asking for consent and listening to and respecting that answer [are] woven into all areas of our lives, not just in terms of sexual activity.” The panelists agreed that ideally, consent should be normalized among all peers to eradicate the idea that asking for consent is redundant or inconvenient. Murray added that “it’s teaching people to be prepared to have ‘no’ as an answer and be okay with that.”
“A culture of consent looks and sounds very different than what we have on campus right now,” said Rentschler. She called into question whether a true culture of consent was possible within a university setting where the hierarchy between students, faculty, and the administration can undermine students’ efforts to eradicate non-consensual power dynamics between individuals.
“It’s really hard, because this is a deeply hierarchical place […] and a lot of us are invested in those hierarchies,” she said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen consent being performed at a university,” she continued.
Murray spoke about how another obstacle facing consent education on campus involves addressing the preconceptions of a diverse student body. “Everybody who comes here was almost certainly raised in a culture of normalized gender- and sexual-based violence,” she said. “[Consent education] involves complete paradigm shifts,” she said.
A topic that pervaded the discussion of eradicating sexual violence through consent was the current student-driven drafting of the university’s new sexual assault policy. “Often we talk about consent on an individual level, but it’s also really important at an institutional level,” said Murray.
“That means proactive policies to make students feel safe and supported on campus,” Gauntley agreed.
“We have the possibility right now to make potentially a pretty radical sexual assault policy that doesn’t really have a precedent,” added Murray. “The only way to deal with assault on campus is to go to the police, is to go to the criminal justice system.” Panelists and audience members alike were optimistic about the potential for the new sexual assault policy to transform how universities across the country approach situations of non-consent, with some audience members expressing interest in methods of “alternative accountability.”
The response to the panel was largely positive, with many participants offering opinions and suggestions on fostering a culture of consent. “This conversation is something really palpable on campus,” said Lily Schwarzbaum, Student Engagement Facilitator at the McGill Office of Sustainability.
The panelists were pleased with the outcome and level of participation during the panel. “When it comes down to it, a culture of consent is one where students are all engaged in continuing to build and grow that culture,” said Murray.
