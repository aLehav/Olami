Three of five motions pass before loss of quorum
SSMU held its first General Assembly (GA) of the year on Monday with five motions on the agenda. Three motions – regarding an annual update to SSMU’s Sustainability Assessment, structural reforms for SSMU’s Board of Directors, and SSMU’s commitment to accessible education – were successfully passed before the meeting lost quorum. The remainder of the meeting was held as a consultative forum.
Though the GA quickly surpassed its 100-student quorum with a total of 130 attendees, so many people left the room after voting on the motion regarding accessible education that the attendance count was lost.
“It started off really promising and we went swiftly through the Board of Directors and the sustainability motions,” said SSMU Speaker Michael Tong.
Debate increased exponentially during the motion regarding accessible education, with speakers both against and in support of tuition hikes.  SSMU Speaker and chair of the meeting Nida Nizam felt the discussion strayed from the substantive issue of the motion.
“There was definitely a lot of philosophical debate going on,” she said. “I think a lot of the motions were boiling down to principles and I think the students just had very different viewpoints based on personal context, especially regarding the Quebec tuition hikes motion and taking a stance on that.”
Whether education should be defined as a fundamental right or a privilege was reoccurring theme throughout the debate. Niko Block, a former Daily News and Features editor, made the final comment on the matter.
“You can make the argument that education is a privilege and not a right – you can still want that privilege to be bestowed upon every member of society for the sake of making it a more democratic society,” Block said.
The motion passed with a vote of 91 students in support, 6 against, and 7 abstentions.  It was immediately following this result that quorum was lost.
“There was a movement at one point of many people walking out of the room,” said Arts Representative Micha Stettin.  “And I am very curious to know from those individuals whether that walkout was intentional or whether they just had something else to do that was more important. And if it was intentional, why they walked out – what about the GA was not to their liking.”
Nizam highlighted that “people are well within their right to walk out on something if they disagree with how it works, but that may delegitimize what they were saying in the first place.”
SSMU President Maggie Knight echoed similar concerns surrounding the mass walkout, but acknowledged that maintaining quorum is something the GA has historically struggled with for a variety of reasons.
“I think when people have frustrations with the outcome of particular motions it isn’t ideal, but I understand that that motion took a long time to debate.  McGill students are busy people and I understand they have places to be,” Knight said.
Knight reiterated her appreciation that the motion to reform SSMU’s Board of Directors had passed, which instituted by-laws clarifying its membership, powers, and procedures.  “For me, it was very important that that structure was reformed.  It was important that we address the issue of the [SSMU] exec ultimately being accountable to the exec,” she said.
Although motions were only symbolically passed after the loss of quorum, those who submitted motions were pleased to see constructive debate continue. Stettin authored the motion regarding support for workers’ struggles, which encourages SSMU to take immediate action in support of striking campus unions.
“I think it was an enriching debate,” Stettin said. “I’m glad there were a lot of diverse opinions and I’m glad people got to spend more than 20 minutes talking about the motion before it was even voted on. I’m also very glad that it passed. I’m sad that it didn’t pass with quorum, but, as a consultative body, that will give us a lot of incentive to pass it in Council.”
Clubs and Services Representative Adam Winer submitted the Motion on Student Consultation in Re-Appointments of the DPSLL (Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning)), which would mandate the executive to lobby for a stronger consultative voice from students in the reappointment of senior administrators.
With the belief that students should be treated as equal partners in the campus community, he was happy to see the motion passed in consultative forum.
“It’s very troubling that students don’t have a say in the appointment of someone who’s supposed to be the voice of the students,” said Winer of the motion, which was drafted with input from former councillor Eli Freedman.
All motions voted on by the consultative body will be submitted to the Legislative Council for consideration at its next meeting today.
The ad-hoc SSMU by-law review committee is currently looking into GA reforms. The Executive hopes to implement changes before the winter GA, which is set to be held on February 1.

School of Architecture and Faculty of Engineering debate over School’s future
On June 23, associate professor at the School of Architecture Michael Jemtrud, resigned from his post as the director of the school. Jemtrud served as director from 2007 until June 2011, and his resignation came after a series of disagreements over the School’s financial expenditures with the Dean of Engineering, Christophe Pierre. Jemtrud is now on leave.
The School of Architecture at McGill is a faculty school within the McGill Faculty of Engineering. Four of Canada’s other eleven architecture schools operate with a structure like McGill.
During his tenure, Jemtrud made major changes to the architecture program, including developing a 60-credit professional Masters program and reformatting the School’s year-and-a-half Master of Architecture program.
Alberto Pérez-Gómez, a professor in the School of Architecture, explained criticisms of Jemtrud.
“[Jemtrud] was asked to change this school and move it forward. His new Masters program cost a bit more money and the dean just claimed that he did not administer it properly. That was the reason he gave for getting rid of him,” Pérez-Gómez said.
He added that some professors had also been uncomfortable with how the School was administered under Jemtrud’s direction.
“A few of my colleagues felt disenfranchised because the school was heading in a direction they could not understand,” Pérez-Gómez said. “This school was very conservative. Michael was brought in with the express desire to make this school open up.”
When asked for details of Jemtrud’s resignation, the current director of the School of Architecture, Annmarie Adams, stated that Jemtrud had stepped down in order to continue his research and other professional activities.
Students have also expressed concern over the direction the School will take without Jemtrud.
A current student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, voiced his concerns.
“We’re really worried about what is going to happen,” he said. “Barely six months ago, McGill was the place to be in Architecture. But, now, I’m worried about the people coming in. The studio projects that they are working on now are just not on the same level that they used to be.”
For many students, the problem stems from the School’s lack of autonomy within the Faculty of Engineering, especially as some members of the Faculty have called into question the necessity of studios and expensive travel abroad programs.
“We are fighting for being able to be internationally recognized, rather than to be in the department of engineering and under the thumb of someone who doesn’t understand what we are about,” Pérez-Gómez said.
The Dean of Engineering was on leave until September 27, and unavailable for comment before The Daily went to press.
School Under Review
The 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review of the McGill School of Architecture was obtained in full by The Daily, along with several other documents pertaining to it. The review outlines a proposal for the new McGill University School of Architecture, Landscape, and Urbanism (SALU). The aim of SALU was to “re-imagine” pedagogy and research. “The cornerstones of the proposal are design, environment, and technology,” it states.
The proposal also contains plans for a new building, to be located beside the MacDonald-Harrington building, as well as new degree programs, a revised administrative structure, and an endowment and business case for the School.
The proposal for SALU is written with a letterhead dated February 2011 from the office of the director of the School of Architecture, though no names were otherwise attached to the document.
The 2011 Cyclical Review, which recommended autonomy from the School, has yet to be reviewed by the McGill Senate.
In addition to the internal review, the School underwent a review by external examiners last March. The examiners were Leslie Van Duzer, director of the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of British Columbia, and Bruce Lindsey, dean of the College of Architecture and Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design at Washington University. Van Duzer and Lindsey submitted their recommendations on April 4, 2011.
The review praised both the School and Jemtrud, and recommended additional autonomy for the School from the Faculty of Engineering.
“From our discussions with three directors of the School of Architecture representing a long historical perspective and our discussions with the current Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, it is clear that the placement of the School of Architecture within the Faculty of Engineering is problematic for all,” the review documents state.
In a May 30 memorandum from Pierre to Provost Anthony Masi regarding the 2011 Cyclical Review, the Faculty of Engineering rejected some of the findings of the review and called into question the need for autonomy within the School.
“Based on feedback received directly from the School’s professorate, the Faculty is less convinced than the reviewers that all is well within the School,” the memorandum states. “This feedback indicates that there is a divergence of opinion regarding the current leadership and direction of the School. The Faculty disagrees that it is inflexible or undervalues the School in any way.”
Jemtrud’s response to the 2011 Cyclical Review reveals that he was committed to achieving autonomy for the School. Due to perceived pressure from the dean to cut costs, Jemtrud believed that the position of the School within the Faculty was “no longer desirable.”
Funding is a major issue for the School. Despite the large number of students, the School has run a deficit since 2001 with the exception of 2008, when the Faculty of Engineering absorbed the School’s costs.

Funding for summer internships with profs runs out
The Arts Undergraduate Research Internship Awards (ARIA) is facing downsizing now that the lump sum fund, which had been granted in 2009, has run out.
The Arts Internship Office (AIO), which put on the awards program, is working to fundraise for its continuation, though on a smaller scale.
ARIA was originally designed to run for a two-year period – the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 academic years – providing 70 undergraduate Arts students with the funding to work one-on-one with a McGill professor on a variety of research projects, to be completed over an 11-week period over the summer.
The fund was given to the AIO, which then designed the idea for the ARIA program. Each student was awarded $2,000 to $4,000 from the fund itself, and an additional $2,000 matched by the participating professor.
While ARIA gave recipients opportunities to get hands-on research experience and work directly with professors, the initial funding from the Faculty was only enough to support two years of the awards program.
Anne Turner, the Faculty of Arts internship manager for the AIO, said that finding funding for the program was a “priority” and that they were “trying to get the pool [of funds] as big as they can.” Despite these downsizings, Turner and the internship program administrator for the AIO Matthew Lyle both emphasized the importance of the awards and their continuation.
Prior to the introduction of ARIA, Turner said that “there was all this research going on, but there was no sort of formal process” for arranging undergraduate student-professor research opportunities.
Tyler Call, an honours philosophy student, worked with Professor Dirk Schlimm on a project titled ‘The Works of Moritz Pasch” this summer.
“I learned a lot in terms of content and how to do research – and do it well – and be very organized about my research,” said Call.
“It’s a good opportunity and I got to learn a lot and do what I like to do and get paid for it so,” he continued.
According to Lyle, the AIO aimed for the awards to be “evenly spread out among the [Arts] departments.”
Examples of past projects include “Canada’s Looming Demographic Fiscal Squeeze” in the economics department, “Aesthetics and Politics in Contemporary Iran” in the middle east studies department, and “A Sociological Analysis of the Use of Deadly Force From 1977-2010” in the  sociology department.
“I would do it again,” said Call. “I don’t know if I’m eligible to do it again – as far as I was told once you do it they kind of want new people to do it every year – but I would definitely do it again.”
Lyle added that the popularity of the awards program has shown the AIO “a need for other efforts to promote undergraduate research.”
Some of these other efforts include the Arts Undergraduate Research Event, in which students can showcase any research efforts done throughout the year, and research workshops entitled MyArtsResearch.
The Arts Undergraduate Society confirmed their intention to provide funding for the program in the future, although exact figures have not yet been decided on.

Administration continues dispute over the use of the McGill name by student groups
The Engineering Undergraduate Society of McGill University (EUS) has run into problems with the administration over the use of the McGill name in its logo, which they have been employing without University authorization.
This is not the first time that the use of the McGill logo among student groups has come under scrutiny from the administration. Frosh, SSMU, and MUS, among others, have also been subject to pressure from the University demanding they remove any ambiguity from their title concerning who is providing services.
The EUS has been using the McGill logo for over a year, but this is the first time they have received official attention regarding their allegedly unauthorized actions.
Complaints first manifested in an email from McGill’s Secretariat office, and later in the form of poster tear-downs in the McConnell Engineering building last week. In an interview with The Daily, EUS President Josh Redel described the poster tear-downs, which the Secretariat had sanctioned because they sported the McGill logo, as “immature,” and unlikely to lead to conciliatory talks.
Since these events, discussion between the two parties and Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson, who is also involved in this issue, have stagnated.
In an interview with The Daily, Mendelson explained that he was unaware of the poster tear-downs, and said he is “willing to have a conversation” about the issue. He stated that he is waiting for the EUS to propose other avenues of conciliation besides asserting their right to use the name in the logo.
According to Mendelson, the EUS is violating a rule that has been in place for some twenty years regarding the respective uses of the McGill name and logo. He stressed that there are two disparate issues: the EUS has permission to use the McGill name in their title, but cannot “use a logo that is similar to the McGill logo.”
Mendelson expained that the EUS is demanding to be treated differently from other student organizations that don’t use the McGill name in their logos.
Speaking on behalf of the EUS executive, Redel explained that the logo-name division makes the university appear selective about what they do and do not want to be associated with.
“It’s sad to me that [McGill] doesn’t want to be associated with [the EUS],” Redel said. He explained that, with all the positive work the EUS does for McGill students, being able to use the McGill name in their logo seems like a natural step in having a mutually beneficial relationship with the University.
Mendelson acknowledged that the University hasn’t been negatively impacted by the EUS’ use of the McGill logo, but explained that if guidelines are not respected consistently, it becomes easy to lose oversight of how the logo is being used and with what it can be associated.
He added that societies using the McGill name in their logo results in conflation of who is providing which services and activities, referring to the semantic subtleties that have to be observed.
Mendelson explained that “of McGill University” is acceptable because it implies students from McGill are the ones managing the club, while “McGill Services,” for instance, suggests that the university itself is providing the services.
Going forward, Redel explained that he thinks the “fairly static” situation will persist until the EUS’s Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) is up for review in less than two years. In the meantime, he stated that the EUS doesn’t believe its use of the McGill name violates their MoA.
The EUS is currently investigating the legalities of the issue as well as whether or not investigation into the enterprise will be monetarily worthwhile.

Demonstrators demand Charest’s resignation
Last Saturday, over 2,000 people crowded under Quebec Premier Jean Charest’s office at the junction of McGill College and Sherbrooke, protesting the provincial government’s response to recent allegations of corruption and collusion in the Quebec construction industry.
Similar demonstrations were held simultaneously in Quebec City and Sherbrooke, launching what has been dubbed “le Mouvement du 24 Septembre.”
The movement, organized primarily through Facebook, was formed ten days before Saturday’s demonstration in response to the Quebec anti-corruption squad’s report that was leaked to the media. The report reveals the corrupt state of the construction industry, according to a Mouvement du 24 Septembre press release.
“We emphasize the nausea and fatigue of the population on the inertia of the political elite in Quebec, and their inability to resolve important and urgent issues for many years,” stated the press release.
Patrick Poirier, one of the organizers of the movement, said the demonstration went “above and beyond [his] expectations.”
“Now, the movement is in your hands,” he told the crowd on Saturday in French.
“I am calling out to everyone here, to all the citizens of Quebec, to everyone in all the regions of Quebec,” Poirier continued. “We have to mobilize. We can’t wait for someone else to do something; we have to take initiative. We have to unite. We have to send a strong message, and that’s what we’re doing today.”
The anti-corruption report, headed by former Montreal chief of police Jacques Duchesneau, described – without naming specific people or companies – how Quebec construction firms conspired to rig bidding processes for public contracts and fraudulent cost overruns on construction sites.
The report alleged that companies would use excess funds to contribute to political campaigns, further tainting the provincial contract bidding process. Organized crime is also described to have “settled comfortably” into the construction industry, and launder money through construction projects.
In the wake of the Duchesneau report, Charest inflamed public opinion by declaring he would not hold a public inquiry, instead saying he would leave it to the police and the province’s own anti-corruption squad to investigate the construction industry.
“I have had enough of the corruption, I have had enough of the [theft] of our resources by Charest’s government,” said David Marquis, a Montreal primary school teacher at the September 24 protest, in French.
The Mouvement’s press release concludes by demanding four things of Charest: To begin an inquiry into corruption in the construction industry, to set up a commission to reform the democratic institutions in the province as well as the financing of political parties, to call a general election, and to resign.
Testifying in front of the National Assembly on Tuesday, Duchesneau emphasized the need for a public inquiry – paired with a closed-door enquiry to accommodate those who may fear reprisals for testifying publicly.
Yesterday, Charest informed the National Assembly he will “study” Duchesneau’s proposals.  Charest also said he “would like to repeat that we gave [Duchesneau] his mandate,” according to the Montreal Gazette.
Province-wide polls indicate about 80 per cent of Quebeckers are in favour of a public inquiry.
“We need an investigation into construction,” said Marquis. “I can’t imagine how [Charest] can look at himself in the mirror and not laugh – because we need this to take back our social and democratic institutions.”
Léon de Montigny came from Verchères, about 45 minutes from Montreal, in order to attend the demonstration. He said Quebeckers have known about corruption in the construction industry – and had wanted a public inquiry – for years.
“This is one day in two years where we are asking Mr. Charest for a public inquiry,” he said in French. “We think that this will be the beginning of, what you call, a snowball.”

Consulting firm places Montreal number eight on worldwide index
Montreal has been ranked the most bike-friendly city in North America, placing number eight on The Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2011 Index.
Copenhagenize, a Danish consulting firm that specializes in bicycle culture and traffic, surveyed 80 cities worldwide to create the Index.
According to Copenhagenize Consulting CEO Mikael Colville, Montreal’s extensive bike infrastructure, which has been growing since the mid-1980’s, has been largely responsible for the revival of the bicycle as a mode of transportation.
In an email to The Daily, Colville cited recent developments, such as the redesign  of Laurier by Plateau-Mont-Royal Mayor Luc Ferrandez – introducing two bike lanes to one vehicle lane, more than doubling bicycle traffic in 2011 – and cycling NGO Vélo Québec, as contributing to Montreal’s high ranking.
Cities were ranked in a number of categories, with Montreal placing high in the categories of gender split, bicycle infrastructure, social acceptance, and bike share program.
The bike share program, BIXI Montreal, was implemented in 2009 as a result of the popularity of similar bike systems in Europe. Designed to complement public transportation, the service offers 5,050 bikes at 405 stations around Montreal, and is available from May to November.
“There are many stations close together, giving you the ability to park [the bikes] anywhere,” said Sacha Payette, a Concordia student and frequent BIXI user. “You don’t have to worry about them being stolen; the stations are secure.”
A representative of BIXI Montreal told The Daily in an interview that they are “happy to be part of Montreal’s high ranking on the Index.”
However, the BIXI system has been criticized for a number of issues since its introduction two years ago. Accessibilty and cost-effectiveness are among the issues for casual users.
“The system is cheap if you get a BIXI pass,” said Lucy Young, a McGill student and BIXI user.
According to Young and Payette, the fact that BIXI stations don’t accept cash or debit cards – only credit cards or passes – is a significant inconvenience for casual users.
Young and Payette were also critical that stations are often empty or at full capacity, making it difficult for users to pick up or drop off their bikes.
According to a September 21 article in the Christian Science Monitor, the service is also now relying on government loans to continue operating, given the high cost of transporting bikes out of the downtown core to stations on the outskirts of the city.
Montreal initiatives continue to promote awareness of the benefits of cycling as a mode of transportation. On September 24, 2011, Action Climat de Montreal hosted “Moving Planet Earth” at Jeanne Mance Parc, a global project designed to promote active transport, such as cycling, in Montreal.

Student demonstration leads to confrontation with senior administrators
Last Friday, McGill filed a provisional injunction against the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA). The injunction, which lists seven individuals in addition to MUNACA and their regional union, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), restricts the union’s picketing activity. It is valid through October 3, when McGill and MUNACA will be in court for a hearing as to whether the injunction will be extended.
The injunction lists three affidavits filed by Robert Comeau, director of labour and employee relations, Pierre Barbarie, associate director of security services, and Christopher Carson, operations manager for security services. Michael Di Grappa, Vice Principal (Administration and Finance), said that the injunction was “filed on behalf of McGill University, not the individuals.”
There is also reference to events on September 22. Kevin Whittaker, President of MUNACA, explained that the event cited was a protest that MUNACA held in the Durocher area.
According to Whittaker, the administration “mentioned that some students felt threatened and that one student was hit by a flagpole – which I’m sure he [just] got tapped.”
September 22 was also the date of a student sit-in outside of Senate.
Under the injunction, MUNACA picketers are not allowed to occupy three restricted areas, which cover most of downtown campus. There are also over 42 locations listed where picketing is prohibited, including the Montreal General Hospital, Solin Hall, and the McCord Museum. Picketers must be four metres from the entries and exits of McGill property.
There are also noise limits outlined, including a stipulation that no microphones, speakers, or stereos are allowed within 25 metres of McGill property.
MUNACA called a general meeting for members on Wednesday, “to inform our members that we will have to be readjusting our strategies due to this injunction,” said Whittaker, who estimated that 1,400 members attended.
“Because things are not moving as smoothly or as quickly as we would hope at the conciliation level, we will be putting pressure on McGill and the community to move things along quicker and to actually sit down and properly negotiate with us,” he added.
Student response
In response to McGill’s actions, the student mobilization group, Mob Squad, organized an emergency action on Monday. The group, which grew to more than 40 students, sat at the Y-intersection and read the text of the injunction aloud.
McGill Security arrived shortly after, and multiple staff members surrounded the group, which did not restrict the movement of pedestrians or vehicles on campus.
Derek Tyrrell, a student participating in the demonstration, explained that security guards asked organizers for student IDs and threatened to call the Montreal police.
Students pointed to Part IV, Article 25 of the Student Handbook of Rights and Responsibilities, which states that “Every student enjoys within the University the freedoms of opinion, of expression and of peaceful assembly.”
The group later marched to the James Administration building. Provost Anthony Masi and Di Grappa, attempting to enter the building, turned to address students.
Masi began talking to students about what he called the “pension crisis” at McGill. When students questioned his presentation of MUNACA’s wage demands, he told the crowd that they did not have the facts of the negotiation.
“Keep repeating falsehoods. It makes you feel good,” he told the group.
Di Grappa also addressed some of the students, who explained that they had been sitting in peacefully on campus.
“You don’t have the right to demonstrate on campus,” Di Grappa told them, and questioned whether the use of a megaphone and sit-in at Senate were peaceful, to which students in the crowd answered in the affirmative. Former Daily Design and Production editor Sheehan Moore, a student in the crowd, taped the interaction. The video was also featured on a CTV report yesterday.
In an interview with The Daily the next day, Di Grappa contradicted his previous statement and cited university policy. “As you know, there’s a right to peaceful assembly and demonstrations on campus so long as they don’t disrupt work in the classroom or other work going on at the University,” he said.
SSMU VP External Joël Pedneault, a participant in the demonstration, said that he felt Masi and Di Grappa’s actions showed “a total lack of professionalism.”
“[I] was surprised and shocked by the degree of bravado with which they walked into the action…and proceeded to not just debate but yell at students… I don’t think it’s acceptable,” Pedneault said.
Yesterday, Mob Squad organized a teach-in at the Y-intersection with over 150 students, teaching assistants, and professors in attendance.
“It certainly raises our morale in our membership, knowing that the students and the faculty and other McGill community members are out protesting on our behalf,” Whittaker said.
When asked for a comment on the event, Di Grappa spoke to how he sees the labour dispute being resolved.
“[The strike is] not going to be resolved by rallies and demonstrations, it’s going to be resolved at the negotiation table, and so we encourage the union to be available to continue to negotiate,” he said.
Report on replacement workers
Last Friday also saw the release of a report by the Ministry of Labour on their inspections of McGill. The inspector, Thomas Hayden, alleged that Section 109.1 of the Quebec Labour Code was not respected in at least 15 cases.
Jérôme Turcq, PSAC’s executive vice-president for Quebec, addressed the findings of the report.
“This is really a shame. For an organization that actually prides themselves for being a place where you form the future Prime Ministers, the future judges and the future lawyers, to disregard legislation in that sense… I think this is really shameful,” he said in an interview with The Daily and the McGill Tribune.
“I have no doubt, no doubt, that McGill has used scabs. If there would be an instance of one or two cases, I’d be very careful with what I said, not with what the inspector has found,” he added.
An email sent to staff and students from Di Grappa states that “McGill disputes these findings in each and every case.”
Di Grappa declined to cite specific examples to The Daily, explaining that court hearings on the matter begin Thursday. The email states that McGill has “found errors of fact” in a number of cases in the report.
Whittaker said that neither the report nor the injunction affected conciliation meetings on Monday. McGill and MUNACA will meet next at the negotiation table on Friday.

Negotiations with McGill to begin within ninety days
McGill’s largest union gathered off-campus Wednesday night to celebrate its strength and prepare for a long road ahead.
And no, it wasn’t MUNACA.
On August 30th, the Association for Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) was accredited to represent the approximately 1,300 course lecturers at McGill.
Course lecturers joined teaching assistants (TAs) and invigilators, swelling AGSEM’s ranks to over 3,000 employees.
Marie Blais, vice-president of the Fédération nationale des enseignantes et enseignants du Quebec, said that the unionization of McGill’s contract-teaching staff represents a major victory.
“In our sector, McGill is like Quebecor,” Blais said, referring to the notoriously hard-bargaining media conglomerate.
According to the union, McGill’s course lecturers are the lowest paid in Quebec, despite a raise from $5,000 to $6,000 per three-credit course last fall, in the midst of the union’s organizing campaign.
Wednesday night’s meeting was the first General Assembly of the newly formed bargaining unit, where about fifty members adopted interim by-laws and learned about AGSEM’s structure.
The successful unionization – after four previous tries over the past twenty years – is due in large part to an organizing team led by chief unionizing drive coordinator Lilian Radovac.
“It seemed impossible only a couple of years ago,” Radovac said at the meeting.
Radovac, who has worked on the union drive for nearly a year and a half, explained that with the new unionization, times have changed.
“We are so damn strong,” she said, describing a “historic” time at McGill amidst growing faculty and student support of organized labour.
“When you really have power, you don’t always have to use it,” she said.
Adrienne Hurley, a professor in the department of East Asian Studies and a member of the McGill Faculty Labour Action Group (MFLAG), attended the AGSEM meeting to express support for the  bargaining unit.
MFLAG was created less than a month ago by faculty members in support of MUNACA and other labour unions currently in negotiation with McGill. According to Hurley, the group has since grown to nearly 75 members.
As laid out by Quebec labour law, AGSEM’s new course lecturer bargaining unit has ninety days to come to the table ready to negotiate with McGill. In that time, course lecturers will elect executive and bargaining committees, and begin hammering out a package of demands.
Richard Hink, a member of AGSEM’s organizing team, said that they plan to have a demands package ready by mid-November.
AGSEM’s course lecturers will join the TA bargaining unit, the Association of McGill University Support Employees, and McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association in their ongoing labour negotiations with McGill.

McGill student denied entrance to Management event for refusal to remove pin
At the Desautels Faculty of Management Career Fair at Hotel OMNI on September 23, SSMU VP Finance and Operations Shyam Patel was denied entry because he refused to remove a button from his lapel supporting striking members of the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA).
MUNACA has been on strike since September 1.
The annual Career Fair is open to all McGill students. Companies at the event included Imperial Tobacco, Bombardier Aerospace, L’Oreal, several banks and investment groups, among others.
Lorrie Quigg, MBA relationship manager at Desautels Career Services, spoke to The Daily about the event.
“We are typically at the front to make sure students make the best first impression that they can with employers,” Quigg said, mentioning “big badges,” “not appropriate hats,” and “the wrong kind of shoes” as the sorts of things they look out for.
Quigg stopped Patel, a U3 Management student, from entering the Career Fair.
“She basically said it was not appropriate to wear the pin and I told her that she should not be judging me by the pin that I am wearing,” said Patel.
Quigg said that it was Patel’s own admission that was the reaseon he was denied access to the event.
“[Corporations] pay to meet students who are looking for work,” she said. “He wasn’t looking for a job. That was not his intention to go, and I know because I specifically asked him.”
Patel said he was there “to see what corporations were there, as I am a Management student, and pick up any documents that may relate to my program.”
At this point, said Patel, Quigg conferred with a colleague and they gave him the choice of either taking off the MUNACA pin, or keeping it on and continuing to be denied entrance to the fair.
“Whatever you believe in, your cause is none of my business, and none of the employer’s business either,” Quigg said. “They’re not there for that, they’re there to talk about employment opportunities.”
Patel chose to leave, and said this was the first time he had ever been turned away from an event because of a pin.
“Ribbons, for example, for breast cancer or violence against women, I have worn to events like this and never been told to go away. I wear this MUNACA pin all the time and no one has ever said anything before,” he said.
“I think that it isn’t fair to say you aren’t political and then, to not let someone in because of a pin, is very political,” Patel said.
“I’m very disappointed and not content with the way that I was treated,” he continued.
