The Daily hears endorsements from the “McGill Five”
The NDP leadership convention convened today in Toronto, and tomorrow the party will elect a successor to former party leader Jack Layton. Eight candidates remain after almost five months of campaigning. Thomas Mulcair, MP for Outremont and Layton’s top Quebec lieutenant, is believed to be the front-runner. Last week, however, Mulcair came under attack from former NDP leader Ed Broadbent over fears that he would move the party closer to the centre.
Last Tuesday, The Daily sat down with the “McGill Five” – the five former McGill students elected to Parliament in the general election last May – to discuss their endorsements and how they think a suddenly rancorous campaign could affect the party.

The McGill Daily
The 2012 NDP leadership race
Endorsement: Peggy Nash.
The McGill Daily: Why are you endorsing Peggy Nash? 
Laurin Liu: I think Nash is a great candidate because she is from the labour movement, and as Deputy Critic for the Environment I think that it is really important to have a leader that understands what it means to have a just transition, a just energy transition. So basically ensuring that moving towards the green economy won’t disadvantage workers who are currently working in energy sectors such as the oil sands, and so when we talk about energy policy in Canada we have to talk about partnerships between the environmental community and labour unions. I think [Nash] is someone who is really able to bring people together and someone who is really able to play a role as a negotiator and as a leader in that style.
MD: What are your thoughts on the language that has been traded amongst the candidates?
LL: Leaders have had to show their teeth in order to show that they can take on [Prime Minister Stephen] Harper in the House of Commons.
MD: Do you think that the better-known candidates have overshadowed the smaller ones in this large race? 
LL: I think it has allowed for new ideas to be aired and I think that Nathan Cullen – most people didn’t know who Nathan Cullen was before the leadership race – but now he is known among members across the country.
MD: What does the next leader need to do in order to get the NDP in power? 
LL: We have come a long way since the previous election May 2. I think it is really important to continue down the road [former leader] Jack Layton started in terms of modernizing the party, modernizing our communications material, and obviously the new leader has to do a lot of ground work. People appreciate seeing leaders and politicians in their own community, so that’s very important. Canadians, Quebecers especially, really bought into the vision of Canada that we proposed in the last elections, and I think that in the next elections the fight will really be between the New Democrat candidates and Conservative candidates, so the fight will be to take on Harper. So, that is what we will be doing in the House of Commons for the next few years.

The McGill Daily
The McGill Daily
The 2012 NDP leadership race
Endorsement: Thomas Mulcair
The McGill Daily: Why are you endorsing Thomas Mulcair?
Jamie Nicholls: He is a Quebecer, lived here for most of his life, and he understands what Quebec has gone through in the past thirty, forty years, he has that firsthand knowledge of the province and I don’t see that from the other candidates. I think [Mulcair] is the best case to convince Quebecers that we are ready to do business. I’ve been endorsing Mulcair since September, since even before he started his leadership race; I was one of the people who were pushing him to run.
MD: What do you think of claims that Mulcair will be moving the party more to the political centre if elected? 
JN: I’ve talked a lot with [Mulcair] about this and the idea is not moving the party more to the centre, but its more that he is going to bring centre voters to us. Not by changing the way the NDP does things, but [by] changing the way we deliver the message.
MD: What are your thoughts on the race so far?
JN: Up until about last week the race has been very collegial, with not much rancor or conflict that you see in other leadership races. The Liberals are known for having very rancorous leadership races where parts of the party split off to have open battles with each other, and up until now we haven’t seen that with our party. But after [the comments from] Ed Broadbent came out things took a turn for the worse in that sense and that’s unfortunate that that happened, but we are going to move towards this weekend with a positive attitude
MD: How do you think that rancor has affected the party? 
JN: I don’t think it has affected the party, but I can surely say that people supported us in the last election that didn’t normally support us before. They’re looking for a more positive type of politics and I think that Ed Broadbent really exemplifies the old guard of the party, the old way of thinking. I think we need a new spirit in there and a new way of doing things, the way that Jack Layton showed how politics can be positive and hopeful. I think we need that more than divisive strategies.

The McGill Daily
The 2012 NDP leadership race
Endorsement: Neutral
The McGill Daily: Why are you staying neutral?
Mylène Freeman: I think that we’ve got really strong candidates and I just haven’t been able to choose. So, we will see, I think we will be in good hands no matter what.
MD: What are your thoughts on the possibility of the party moving more to the political centre under Mulcair? 
MF: I think that, as a member of caucus, that the party has always been heading in the right direction. It will be a natural process. Whatever direction we go in, it’s going to involve all members of the caucus who have been around and working and have been really trying to do things differently than the other parties have.
MD: What does the next NDP leader need to do to bring the party to power?
MF: We need to reach out to areas and branches of support that traditionally have not necessarily voted for us because they weren’t necessarily aware that we were there. Like in Quebec, a lot of the people when reached with our message sort of felt that it came to get them, and [they] voted on that and feel very comfortable having done that. And there are a lot of places in Canada that we haven’t made that breakthrough, shown that we are credible…the West, for example: we have done well with voter support but we don’t really have seats.

The McGill Daily
The 2012 NDP leadership convention
Endorsement: Thomas Mulcair.
The McGill Daily: Why are you endorsing Thomas Mulcair? 
Matthew Dubé: Back in the fall, I endorsed Thomas Mulcair and I’m still extremely comfortable with that position. I have always had a good working relationship with him and I have a lot of appreciation for the work he has done and can do for the party… I’m definitely supporting Thomas Mulcair.
MD: What are your thoughts on claims that Mulcair will be moving the party closer to the political centre? 
Dubé: I think that it isn’t a huge issue, a mountain being made out of molehills. He has said quite clearly that the approach maybe needs to be adjusted a little bit in terms of how we interact and communicate with folks, and I don’t think that’s a huge difference from what Jack Layton did and wanted to continue doing as leader of the NDP. We don’t need to get away from the core of our policies but I think what he wants to do if find better or different ways of explaining what our ideas are to the electorate. So, I think that’s the approach he has taken and I think it has been misconstrued as a huge move to the centre in a “Blairesque” way… I don’t think it’s quite as extreme as some people make it out to be.
MD: What are your general thoughts on the leadership race? 
Dubé: We have heard a lot about how tepid its been, how boring it’s been, but I think that’s a testament to the fact that despite, in some cases, obvious differences, I think that [on] the big issues we all tend to be on the same page and it’s more the refined details that tend to be points of divergence. I think that throughout the whole process as a caucus, despite the fact that obviously most MPs are supporting different candidates – obviously some more than others – I think we have been able to maintain unity, which apparently is something we were supposed to lose. It’s been a difficult process – none of us wanted this, obviously – but we had no choice and I think we will be stronger for it at the end.
MD: What effects have Ed Broadbent’s comments had on the race?
Dubé: In the spirit of honesty, I think it was a little disappointing because we were so close to have gotten through without any big arguments. Nonetheless, I can’t fault Mr. Broadbent for giving his two cents. I think he has earned his right to make his comments as a former leader… I obviously personally disagree with the comments. I don’t think it is necessary to get into name-calling or finger pointing.

The McGill Daily
The 2012 NDP leadership convention
Endorsement: Brian Topp.
The McGill Daily: Why are you endorsing Brian Topp?
Charmaine Borg: I support Brian Topp for the very fact that he is a Quebecer who has worked across the country, so, to me, he is the perfect balance of both of those worlds. I think it’s important to elect a bilingual leader. So, for me, someone who can’t speak French will be a disadvantage to our party.
He has worked for a majority government – the NDP majority government in Saskatchewan – so he knows how to be in that situation, we want to get there in 2015. He wants to go on and directly attack inequality and I think there has been a lot of discussion over the [Occupy movement’s] 99 per cent, and he is willing to help the 99 per cent and bring forward a more equal society. For me, that is the main reason I support him.
MD: What is Quebec’s role in the leadership race? 
CB: I do think that there is a need to maintain Quebec because our ultimate goal is to win government in 2015. So, if we can’t hold on to Quebec, our options – or our chances – are very limited. So, I think it is important, and that is a challenge of someone who does want to become government is how to respect Quebec’s values and continue and to build on our gains and maintain what we have here… I think that is one of the main challenges in Canadian politics and it has been for a long time. And at the base, the Quebecois are very socially democratic and they always will be and if we can prove to them that the rest of the country is willing to get on this social democratic mission, I guess I can say, then, that’s important and I do think that it does merit a lot of space in the leadership race.
