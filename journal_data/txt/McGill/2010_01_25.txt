Donation linked to a small Quebec town’s displacement
Last month, McGill announced the largest contribution to date made to Campaign McGill, after Osisko mining company, and  donated $4.1-million worth of Osisko shares to McGill’s endowment. The donation will be funneled into the department of earth and planetary sciences where it will support two new tenure-track positions, fellowships for graduate students, scholarships for propitious undergraduates in the department, and the Dawson Filed Study Support Fund.
Robert Wares, Osisko’s chief operating officer, himself a McGill graduate from 1979, told the McGill Reporter last month that he wishes to give back to his industry by investing in earth sciences, where, he said, training is chronically underfunded. The announcement comes as the mining company proceeds with its plans to establish Quebec’s largest open-pit gold mine in the western Quebec community of Malartic. The billion-dollar gold mine, likely to commence next year, is one of four mining operations currently in the planning stages for the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region.
Many mining critics, including Randy Hart of Mining Watch Canada, believe the Malartic case signals a shift in the Quebec mining industry. “There is a growing trend toward open-pit mines with longer-term environmental liabilities,” he said.
 Malartic’s economy was largely built on local mining operations throughout the past century, but its population peaked at 6,000 in the fifties when three nearby mines closed. Today the town’s residents, now less than 4,000, largely support the billion-dollar Osisko project, which will generate 800 new jobs for the region in its first four years of operation.
According to Ugo Lapoionte, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Better Mining in Quebec, the creation of new jobs could still come with strings attached. “A big company operating a big project in a small town with little economic or social ability to mobilize looks like a third world relationship in this way.”
There has also been local opposition to the project, according to Hart. “A lot of people have had to do some rethinking about their position based on the behaviour of the company,” he said.
Lapointe explained that resistance to the mine generally falls into one of two categories: criticism of the type of operation from an environmental perspective, or criticism of the company and its process of development in the region.
Upon proposal, the dimesions of the mine were 800 metres by 2 kilometres with a depth of 400 metres, according to Action Boreale Abitbi Temiscamingue. Lapointe said the mine would be roughly equivalent to Mont-Royal, while only producing enough gold to fill the volume of one or one and a half Smart cars.  Action Boreale Abitbi Temiscamingue has estimated that the mine, operating 24 hours a day and seven days a week, will use 25 million litres of water, 11 tonnes of cyanide, and extract 120,000 tonnes of rock daily.
 However, a meeting in Montreal last Monday saw the expansion of the original plan, with the length of the pit increasing from 2 kilometres to 2.5 kilometres. The expansion would create the need to relocate the highway Route 117, which travels through Malartic – costing an estimated $50 million of taxpayer dollars. Some in the Malartic community have expressed concern that the diversion of the highway would adversely affect business in the town.
While speculating on the land in Malartic, Osisko relocated 200 homes and five public institutions – a process that began before the province’s environmental impact assessment had been completed. Even after the relocation, the nearest Malartic home is only 100 metres from the mine site.  Now that mine expansion plans are in the works, the impacts of the mine are likely to change.  “As far as I know, they’re not planning to do any more assessments or public consultations,” stated Lapointe.
Osisko has also received criticism for its use of up to a dozen independent lobbyists to get the green light from the Quebec government, including paid members of the Parti Québecois and Parti Libéral Québec. Some members of the community and the Coalition for Better Mining in Quebec have speculated that this political engagement allowed for the company to ignore the necessary environmental assessments.
Although the company plans to begin digging in 2011, it has still not committed to either filling the pit after the 10-year operation is completed nor providing royalties to the town of Malartic to diversify the town’s economy after the company withdraws from the operation in 10 years.  During initial public consultations, the company proposed donating up to $4 million dollars to a public fund over the 10-year operation.  Their pure profit margin, however, will be in the ballpark of $850 million, and this was estimated when the price of gold was far lower than today’s rate.

Minister of Education reopens MBA tuition hike debate
The McGill administration and the Quebec Ministry of Education, Leisure, and Sport (MELS) are feuding again over the drastic tuition hike announced this past fall for the university’s MBA program.
Tuition for MBA students is set to increase by 1,663 per cent to $29,500 in September. In a letter obtained by Le Devoir and reported on January 21, Minister of Education Michelle Courchesne chastised McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum, writing that the University’s planned tuition increase “contravenes the very principle of accessibility.”
Since the letter was made public this past Thursday, McGill administrators have been coordinating a media blitz to counter the minister’s now-public remarks.
In an interview with The Daily, Dean of Desautels Faculty of Management Peter Todd denied the minister’s accusations of a lack of accessibility.
“We committed to the idea that we want to make the program more accessible, and the way to do that, we think, is to have people who truly can afford to pay for the program pay for it,” he said. Todd added that most MBA students have five or more years of employment in the private sector  when they enter the MBA program, and that their salaries tend to increase dramatically after graduation. He further noted that $4,000 per student of the new tuition would be set aside for student aid.
Post-Graduate Students’ Society president Daniel Simeone pointed out the $4,000 earmark is consistent with an existing University-wide policy mandating that 30 per cent of net tuition increases be allocated to student aid.
While acknowledging that the MBA students’ association supported the tuition hike, Simeone said that he “did have significant discussions with MBA students who…expressed concern that the change would negatively impact Montreal and Quebec students, for whom the program [provides] high managerial skills that get applied in the non-profit sector in Montreal.” He added that many Montreal non-profits have a high level of managerial skill thanks in part to the current accessibility of McGill’s MBA program.
On Friday, the Montreal Gazette editorialized in favour of McGill, in which it accused Quebec of being “cowardly” and not having the courage to increase tuition in the face of student protests. The editorial mirrored comments articulated in an internal Board of Governors email obtained by The Daily, as well as those made by Todd during his interview.
Responding to criticism that the  tuition increase for Quebec students would decrease the number of in-province students in the program, Todd noted that applications from Quebeckers are up 40 per cent this admission season as compared to last, from 15 to 21. The number of Quebec applicants cannot be independently verified until enrolment data is released later in the year.
The Board of Governors internal memo indicated that Munroe-Blum met with the minister Friday, and that the principal’s office had been in communication with the office of Quebec premier Jean Charest. When asked about the outcome of Munroe-Blum’s meeting wih the Minister, the administration provided no comment.

Stock portfolio tied to natural resource exploration and military
SSMU VP Finance and Operations (FOPS) Jose Diaz announced Thursday evening in his report to SSMU Council that the Society has sold its shares in a company because of its ties to the Alberta tar sands. But according to a recent report of the Finance Committee, SSMU retains bonds worth $32,200 in Connacher Oil and Gas, which owns and refines 98,000 acres of tar sands in Fort McMurray.
When questioned about the investment, Diaz said he was unaware of Connacher’s mining projects and indicated he would address the investment.
“That is definitely going to be fixed on Monday,” he said, adding that he is currently investigating SSMU’s shares and bonds in Uranium One – a uranium holding company with investments in uranium mining and exploration in Kazakhstan, South Africa, China, and Canada.
However, SSMU still owns shares and bonds worth $172,666 in eight companies that undertake the exploration or production of natural resources – including crude oil, natural, gas, and coal – in addition to $226,394 in bonds of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is heavily invested in the tar sands projects. Its stock portfolio also includes an additional $31,910 of shares in two companies with links to the Department of National Defence (DND).
Diaz stated that SSMU has no policy on investment in mining exploration, or any policy on oil, natural minerals, and base metals.
“We’ve gotten rid of [investment in] the actual mining companies – companies whose activity is extracting the material to process. What you see in the portfolio is exploration, like looking for deposits,” Diaz explained.
He added that there is an additional grey area in SSMU’s tar sands policy.
“We have a policy in companies that are involved in tar sands development, but what about all the other companies that are related to tar sands?” Diaz said, pointing to SSMU’s investment of $21,258 in the Trans Canada Corporation, which owns a 59,000 pipeline through North America.
“All kinds of oil goes through the pipeline. They don’t discriminate based on deep-sea oil, or tar sands oil. There are many ways companies can be involved in tar sands without being directly related to them, and we have to decide at what level we are going to have the restriction,” he said.
Military connections
According to the same Finance Committee report, SSMU currently owns $14,410 in shares of Discovery Air, whose subsidiaries provide assistance in arctic mining exploration as well as airborne training for the Canadian military – which includes air controllers in Afghanistan, CF18 Hornet pilots on air sovereignty patrol missions, and warship airborne defense personnel.
SSMU also owns $17,500 in shares of Calian Technologies, a telecommunications company that specializes in satellites and outsourcing. In 2009, Calian signed two contracts worth $195 million and $70 million to provide simulation training and research for the DND and the Royal Military College, as well as a $65-million contract more recently to provide “instructional training, support, and administrative services” for the DND, according to its web site.
Diaz said that while SSMU does not invest in companies with apparent ties to the military, its policy toward military investment suffers from a similar lack of clarity as its tar sands and mining policies. There is currently no policy on what degree of separation SSMU’s investments must have from the military.
“Calian Technologies [for instance] provides technology services for the government, and for a bunch of ministries: for labour, financial industries, aerospace,” Diaz said. “What they’re doing is not really focused on the military or the defence sector. They provide this tech service that happens to be used by the several industrials, and one of them happens to be the military sector.”
Down to that dolla’ bill
SSMU’s nearly $2-million investment portfolio originates from a settlement made with McGill several years ago, when SSMU sold its shares in the McGill bookstore. The portfolio is managed by Penson Financial Services, and overseen by Diaz, the SSMU Comptroller, the Investment Advisory Committee, and the Investment Advisor Committee Coordinator.
SSMU does have a Financial Ethics Research Committee (FERC), but according to Diaz, it primarily reviews spending over $15,000. While it can set guidelines and ethical policies for SSMU, the committee only meets on an ad hoc basis.
“FERC has not met this year. Nobody’s called a meeting yet [because it is] contingent on someone introducing a motion to actively refer something to [the committee],” said FERC member, Daily columnist, and SSMU councillor Joël Pedneault.
Diaz said that if students wanted to engage more actively in the management of SSMU’s portfolio, he would be open to suggestions. “[Ideally,] we’d set up very restrictive guidelines in terms of what is allowed, what is not, and specified limits, [like] when other companies might provide a tertiary service to those industries, where do they fall,” he said. “The investment manager needs to have very specific restrictions.”
Pedneault and Diaz both said it was a possibility that SSMU could invest more heavily in “green” funds – though Diaz said it could be more financially beneficial for SSMU to explore additional green stocks that had not yet been included in an environmental stock index because they might have more potential for growth.
Pedneault, though, questioned whether the entirety of SSMU’s settlement should be placed in investments. “A question [to be] raised is what do we do with this money? It’s been sitting here in stocks. It’s money SSMU could be putting to better use for student needs.”
