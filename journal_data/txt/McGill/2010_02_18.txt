The McGill Daily
October 1958  The Daily prints a feature from the magazine Justice criticizing southern U.S. states for failing to uphold a Supreme Court decision to integrate schools. Author Henry Golden discusses the harm segregation has caused to both black and white Southerners, and argues that segregation has degraded Southern culture.
October 1961 After a McGill fraternity is accused of discrimination against a Jamaican student, The Daily publishes a feature titled “Segregation at McGill – Yes or No?” that  “is not presented with the intention of taking sides, which our readers will do for themselves.” A few weeks later, an opinion piece in the paper claims that fraternities have the right to refuse a student membership on the basis of race, religion, and nationality. The author equates such a right to the NAACP’s right to bar a white supremacist from joining the organization.
October 1962 Daily news coverage of demonstrations against the desegregation of the University of Mississippi is accompanied by a text encouraging support for American civil rights: “It is essential that students across the continent clearly express their stand. It is a responsibility which attaches to us as students.”
October 1962 Daily writer Jerald M. Cohen visits the southern U.S., and unpacks the mindset and hypocrisy of segregation. He writes: “The older man spoke highly of the abilities of Negro students to enter the best universities. He seemed a reasonable, moderate man. But one of the last things he said to us was: ‘If the federal government tried to integrate the schools in this town, I’d be the first to go out and burn down a church.’”
October 1965 Coverage of a talk on Rhodesia questions the possibility of human rights while the right to vote is limited to whites, despite the election of a more moderate government. “Where, from the new Labour administration is the long awaited ‘firm stand’ against the continuation of racism and robbery in this oppressed land?”
February 1969 Concordia students claim a professor is failing black students without just cause. Police intervene and things turn violent when protesters occupy the university’s computer centre. Student records are destroyed and computers are thrown from the building’s windows.
October 1969 The Daily reports on disruptions of an African Studies program conference by 10 students calling themselves the Black Caucus, claiming that the conference should discuss racism in Montreal. After various letters in The Daily, two writers publish a page-long response entitled “Disruption as a means of self-determination for black people.”
September 1970 McGill students organized a Black Students’ Association for the University, in response to lack of accessibility and administrative indifference. The organization’s chair, Sally Cools, summed up the feelings shared by many black students: “We’re being fucked around left, right, and centre at McGill.”
December 1971 A noted supporter of trade with South Africa is slated to appear on the TV program Under Attack. One hundred students disrupt the taping and stop the program from going forward. William Kunstler, a U.S. lawyer who has defended Angela Davis, comes out in favour of the students. “Everyone has the right to speak, but others have the right to prevent him if they find his views intolerable,” he says.
January 1972 Len Bently, president of the Sir George Williams University Students’ Association, accuses the administration of racism after the board of governors dissolves the union. “Today, the principal views a black student as a potential threat to the welfare and good name of this university,” he says.
November 1978 Dawson College’s board of governors votes to withdraw their accounts from the Bank of Montreal (BMO) because of its involvement with the South African apartheid government, while McGill and SSMU continue to deal bank with BMO. McGill does not divest from South African investments until 1985.
January 1984 SSMU president Bruce Hicks emerges as a leader for divestment, delivering a 95-point motion to the Board of Governors on South African human rights violations. He is later criticized for not consulting the South Africa Committee, a student group pushing for divestment. Hicks forms his own organization, the South Africa Advisory Group, but admits that some members do not know who Nelson Mandela is.
September 1986 Ten months after voting to divest, McGill is discovered to have acquired stocks in companies tied to the South African regime. The Daily reports that the University’s South African investments have only decreased by 20 per cent.
January 1987 In a comment piece, social worker Alix Jean tells the Daily about racial profiling by Montreal police officers. “You meet any black person you see on the street and three out of five would be able to tell you of at least one incident where they had been harassed by the police.”
February 1987 The Daily polls black students’ attitudes towards apartheid, revealing that while 84 per cent believe “divestment should be a dominant issue in the West,” only 22.5 per cent describe their participation in anti-apartheid activities as “significant.” The poll comes a week following prime minister Brian Mulroney’s visit to white-ruled South Africa.
November 1999 Stickers appear on campus claiming that blacks and bisexuals are more likely than other groups to be infected with AIDS. The stickers are produced by a white supremacy organization and refer to white people as an “endangered species.”  The BSN calls for a comprehensive, campus-wide response, but McGill’s director of security claims, “The fact is we can’t really do anything.”
February 2000  To solicit Valentine’s classifieds, the McGill Tribune runs a cartoon of  white male birds trying to impress nearby females, who are distracted by an attractive black crow. The white males remark, “[Females are] easily impressed by spades,” a derogatory term for black people.  The BSN’s political coordinator says “Clearly there is nobody with any racial sensitivity working at the Tribune.”
November 2000  SSMU rejects the Black Student Network’s (BSN) proposed constitution, calling it “inflammatory” and “exclusionary.” The preamble to the constitution refers to James McGill as a slave-owner and describes the socioeconomic disadvantages facing blacks today. The BSN calls for SSMU to receive racial sensitivity training, though the Society maintains that the rejection was based on policy, and not politics.

Event continues at Cinéma du Parc after 2,500 letters sent in protest
The company that owns the Galleries du Parc threatened to shut down a photo exhibit held at Cinéma du Parc this week called “Human Drama in Gaza,” before retracting its request.
On Monday, Cinéma du Parc received an email from its landlord, Gestion Redbourne PDP Inc., instructing the theatre to immediately remove all photos, documents, and bulletins related to the exhibit.
Lieba Shell, the legal representative for Redbourne, claimed in the email that the exhibition was in violation of the terms in their lease and threatened to take legal action against Cinéma du Parc if it did not comply with the request. She added that Redbourne would send security to the cinema in the evening to ensure the orders were obeyed.
Shell sent out another email Wednesday morning retracting their requests, stating that the exhibit is allowed to continue until February 28, as scheduled.
According to Jean-François Lamarche, program coordinator at Cinéma du Parc, between Tuesday morning and Wednesday afternoon, over 2,500 letters were sent out from community members asking Redbourne to let the exhibition continue.
“Human Drama in Gaza” is an exhibition featuring 44 photos that document the events in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead, the three-week assault launched by the Israeli military last winter. The assault resulted in approximately 1,400 Palestinian deaths, most of which were civilians.
The exhibition is organized by Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME) and will be travelling to various cities across Canada.
According to Lamarche, this was the first instance in which the mall’s owner has tried to interfere with Cinéma du Parc’s exhibitions and programs.  
“In the past, we’ve had other expositions of this kind. The Gaza Strip has not been the subject of these other expositions, but human rights was. So we’ve had other pictures of war like this one and we think that everybody has the right to express their point of view,” said Lamarche.  
Grace Batchoun, VP (public relations) at CJPME, felt that Redbourne’s legal threat was inappropriate and offensive.  
“This exhibition is costing us over $25,000…. People love it and we have had excellent feedback. [Redbourne’s action] is illegal. The move on their part is clearly political. The owner at Cinéma du Parc has held over 40 exhibitions in the past few years and has had no complaints or issues,” said Batchoun.
Batchoun stated that Redbourne wanted to shut down the exhibit to stifle discussion of Israeli-Palestinian politics.
“They’re just trying to intimidate Cinéma du Parc and CJPME,” said Batchoun. “They don’t want the truth of Gaza to be exposed, and they don’t want any discussion of Gaza. There are about 1.5 million people suffering in [the Gaza Strip], and it’s an important issue.”
CPJME’s lawyer, Mark Arnold, agreed.
“Everything is political in this society. There was a war in Gaza, but in this country – Quebec included – we certainly have the right to freedom and free speech,” said Arnold.
CPJME and Cinéma du Parc are content that Redbourne has retracted its request but remain wary of Redbourne’s threats.  
“We’re very happy, but at the same time….the intimidation hurts. We wasted so much time and effort,” said Batchoun. “We’re a sizeable well-structured NGO, and we were able to reach out to the lawyer, we were able to react….but what about smaller NGOs? This injustice should not go unnoticed – many other people are living through it, but they don’t often get to be heard.”
Shell declined The Daily’s request to comment on the incident.

A handful of students respond at TaCEQ protest
Fledgling student organization Table de concentration étudiante du Quebec (TaCEQ) has responded angrily to intimations from minister of education Michelle Courchesne last week that the province may raise tuition costs again.
The Roddick Gates were flanked by 10 or 12 protesters yesterday handing out flyers and carrying signs, warning passersby, “Tuition hikes are coming.” The demonstration was organized in part by SSMU VP (External) Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, who has been instrumental in creating TaCEQ.
Ronderos-Morgan expressed concern about the intentions of the education ministry, which has set 2012 as the final year in which provincial tuition costs would go up. “They could fast-track something,” he said, adding later that he would be “shocked if anything was done before 2012.”
SSMU Arts representative Joël Pedneault said he feared the tuition increases could come “as early as March,” when the Charest government releases its annual budget.
Tamara Davis, the press attaché for Minister Courchesne, denied that substantive plans for a tuition hike were in the works. Referring to the current regime of tuition increases, which has yearly hikes pegged at $100, Davis said, “We have an electoral agreement to increase [tuition fees] up until 2012…and we are maintaining our promise.”
TaCEQ was not the only organization to respond in opposition to the announcement. Similar demonstrations were held the same day at other Montreal schools, including Concordia and the Université du Québec à Montréal.
At a TaCEQ conference last Friday, however, the student group decried Courchesne, saying they were “scandalized” by some of her suggestions. This included one assertion that there was a “consensus” among all Quebeckers, except students, that tuition increases were important.
TaCEQ, which counts SSMU and the student associations of the universities of Laval and Sherbrooke as members, sees a significant role for itself in the debate over tuition.
It represents 65,000 students and “two out of the three biggest schools in Quebec,” McGill and Laval, according to Ronderos-Morgan. He indicated that simply by its sheer size, TaCEQ was bound to have some influence.
At its general assembly last December in Quebec City, TaCEQ laid out many of its policies, including those regarding tuition. Ronderos-Morgan says the organization is opposed to any further increase in fees.
Ronderos-Morgan thought TaCEQ will be able to wield significant influence in the student movement though it is a young organization. He pointed to a conference last August, when TaCEQ was only four months old, concerning Quebec’s governance laws – the regulations that dictate how CEGEPs and universities are run. “TaCEQ wrote a briefing on the governance laws,” said Ronderos-Morgan. “[The minister of education] appreciated our contribution,” he added.
SSMU’s VP (External) also indicated that protests were an effective way for student groups to exercise clout. Addressing the relatively small size of yesterday’s demonstration at the Roddick Gates, and the scarcity of information available to students beforehand, Ronderos-Morgan maintained that it had been a success. “I wasn’t looking to have a big turnout,” he said. “We got rid of 300 flyers. We did what we wanted to do.”
Ronderos-Morgan  did concede that students could have been given more notice, but said that a SSMU listserv email had been sent out before the event was planned. A QPIRG email circulated to its members concerning the protests was sent out Tuesday evening, less than 24 hours before the demonstration was held.

Advertising restrictions lead to rising deficits, store due for closure
SSMU announced that it will close Haven Books this spring, due to the $196, 000 deficit the bookstore racked up in its first two years under the society’s ownership.
Since SSMU acquired the bookstore in 2007, it has suffered from low visibility, restrictions on campus advertising, and general indifference from students.
SSMU VP (Finance and Operations) Jose Diaz and Haven manager Ben Paris have scrambled to bring the struggling store out of the red since last summer.The two have had little success. While the final numbers are not in yet, Haven is on track to run a deficit once again this year, adding to the $196,000 figure.
McGill’s memorandum of agreement with SSMU prevents Haven from advertising on university property. Paris believes this ban prevented the store from being successful.
“If I can’t advertise to my general student population, then it’s sort of like Tim Horton’s not being able to advertise in Canada,” Paris said.
Diaz agreed, pointing to the successful Haven franchise in Ottawa, which advertises on the Carleton campus.“They are sanctioned by the university and it’s well-known among the student population…. It’s not a big place, but they go through a lot of books basically because they have the visibility that we do not have,” Diaz said.
But Paris is not convinced any amount of advertising would have helped the store to transcend its less-than-ideal location on Aylmer, just south of Sherbrooke.
“People know about the McGill Bookstore. People see it all the time; it’s the one that the tours show,” Paris said. “This location sucks. The only way you know about it is if you are told about it.”
Diaz searched for solutions to Haven’s financial woes, including advertising during Frosh and researching ways for the store to make money after the peak buying periods of September and January. In the end, Diaz explained, the efforts did little to improve the store’s financial status.
But Paris believes SSMU made the decision to close the store in order to placate the administration during negotiations concerning the Society’s lease of the Shatner building.
“SSMU is negotiating for the building [and] McGill has never liked the existence of Haven…. Rather than continue an operation that is potentially detrimental to operations with McGill…they decided just to close it,” Paris said.
Diaz acknowledged that before taking office, he read a number of memos from the administration to his successors, which explained that classroom announcements and advertising were prohibited.
But while Diaz said the administration has always been stringent in its enforcement of the memorandum of agreement, Haven has not been a major subject of their concern this year.
“Our discussions with the University have centred around different things this year…. Haven hasn’t gotten much attention” Diaz said.
Diaz plans to implement a book swap this coming fall as a way to provide students with affordable used textbooks. He hopes that if a student is unable to swap their books, they will allow SSMU to donate them to charity. He believes the University will appreciate a focus on something other than profit.

Residents argue that the development promotes Israeli policies
The Quebec Court of Appeal announced Wednesday that on June 3 they will hear the appeal submitted by the West Bank village of Bil’in against a Superior court decision from last September.
The Bil’in Village Council brought the lawsuit in 2008 against two Quebec-registered companies based in Montreal: Green Park International Inc. and Green Mount International Inc. The plaintiffs claimed that the companies and their sole director, Annette Laroche, are involved in constructing settlements for Israelis on occupied land within the territory of Bil’in.
“Bil’in brought the lawsuit against [the Montreal-based companies]…under international humanitarian law. Specifically, under the fourth Geneva convention, which says that an occupying power cannot replace the indigenous population with its own population,” said Mark Arnold, the Canadian lawyer representing Bil’in. “The lawsuit alleges that Green Park is, by doing this, in a way aiding, abetting, and assisting the state of Israel in carrying out its settlement policies.”
Superior Court judge Louis-Paul Cullen dismissed the case on the grounds that the Quebec court is not the correct forum to have the case heard, and ruled that the case should go to the Israeli High Court of Justice. The plaintiffs filed an appeal after the decision was made in September.
“The Quebec Superior Court has jurisdiction over Quebec companies and directors who are residing in Quebec,” said Arnold. “The problem is that [Cullen] is fundamentally wrong. The Israeli High Court of Justice will not hear this case, so he has sent this case into oblivion.”
In Bil’in, Abdallah Abu Rahmah, a school teacher and the coordinator of the Bil’in Popular Committee Against the Wall and the Settlements, was arrested in his home by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank on December 10, 2009. Amnesty International criticized his arrest, claiming on its web site that Abu Rahmah is “being detained solely on account of legitimately exercising his right to freedom of expression in opposing the Israeli fence/wall.”
Abu Rahmah was in Montreal last summer for the court proceedings and spoke at Concordia University.
According to Stefan Christoff, local activist and Tadamon! member, those from Bil’in who came to Montreal for the proceedings last year were severely harassed upon returning to Bil’in.
“They only faced that after they spoke in Canada. Their case was highly covered in the media,” said Christoff.
Since June 2009, over 30 non-violent protesters from Bil’in have been arrested by the Israeli military. Amnesty International declared in January that Abu Rahmah can be considered as a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate and unconditional release.
Abu Rahmah displayed hope in a letter written behind bars at the Ofer Military Detention Camp in January. “The occupation is threatened by our growing movement and is therefore trying to shut us down. What Israel’s leaders do not understand is that popular struggle cannot be stopped by our imprisonment,” he wrote.

Quebec Human Rights Commission tribunals blocked by SPVM
The City of Montreal and the Montreal police force (SPVM) continue to block a provincial inquiry into racial profiling conducted by the Quebec Human Rights and Youth Commission. Of over 100 cases brought before the Human Rights Tribunal since it began in 2005, none have been resolved.
François Larsen, the commision’s director for research, education and communications, said the investigations have been mired in bureaucratic and jurisdictional disputes. Lawyers representing the police have challenged the Human Rights Commission by defending the right of police to refuse to testify, and by accusing the commission of bias.
“Right now, there are 10 cases before the tribunal, and no definitive rulings. The legalese must stop if we are going to get to the important issue, racial profiling,” said Larsen.
Lawyers have resisted subpoenas, invoking the Police Act and arguing that interrogations cannot take place if the case is also before the police ethics commission. But the Human Rights Commission maintains that the Police Act should not interfere with outside inquiries.
Dan Philip, president of the Black Coalition of Quebec, has been actively working with the commission’s project and spoke frankly on the City’s position as “systematic.”
“In every case brought before the tribunal, the City is always in cahoots with the police brotherhood and department and protected them against the inquiry. They have not done anything to recognize and minimize the question of racial profiling,” he said.
On January 25, Vision Montreal submitted a motion demanding that the City of Montreal ask the SPVM to collaborate with the Human Rights Commission at all levels, particularly at the tribunal level. The motion failed.
Brenda Paris, senior advisor to the cabinet of the head of the official opposition, noted that Vision Montreal will continue to pressure the City to let the Commission do its work.
“The commission has a mandate to evaluate cases relating to racial profiling, and this must proceed without hindrance. This is not a 2010 issue. It’s been going on for five years,” she said. The opposition will present a new motion this Monday, [February 22], in concert with Projet Montreal.
Racial profiling by police in Montreal has attracted attention beyond the provincial level. Last October, a delegation of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights investigated in Montreal in response to the police shooting death of Fredy Villanueva in 2008.
Villanueva, then 18 years old, was fatally shot in a Montreal Nord Park during a confrontation when police were arresting his older brother, Dany Villanueva.
Although Dany Villanueva was to testify in the coroner’s ongoing inquest into his brother’s death, Villanueva is being threatened with deportation following a request initiated by Canada’s Border Services Agency.
The request is based on an incident in 2005, in which Dany pled guilty to gun possession and robbery, subsequently serving an 11-month jail term for his crimes. The question of his deportation will be adjudicated at a March 11 hearing before the Immigration and Refugee board.
In addition to the Fredy Villanueva case, Philip cited Mohammed Bennis, who was shot by police in 2005 in front of a mosque, and Quillem Registre, who died after police tasered him six times in less than a minute. Both of the cases were investigated by non-SPVM police forces and resulted in no charges.
Philip expressed cynicism in regards to the results. “There cannot be proper investigations when police are investigating police,” he said.
Larsen stated that court rulings will not change systematic prejudice, and that the commission recommendations go beyond policy or police training, emphasizing the importance of dialogue.
“People in authority are knowingly or not knowingly using prejudices to assume somebody is guilty. It is not a matter of policy, and it not always conscious. The first step in overcoming prejudice is to acknowledge it, and this step is always the most difficult. In a way, we are stuck at this first step. People do not want to be perceived as racist,” he said.
The Human Rights Commission is also spearheading a non-judicial inquiry which collected testimonials from youths aged 14-25 for a report that will be published in March. Larsen hopes that it will be used by communities in advocacy-building to combat “the spiral of profiling.”
He added that profiling has influenced youth’s perception of the justice system and societal institutions as a whole, mentioning the correlation between profiling and drop-out rates.
In an email to The Daily, City spokesperson Gonzalo Nunez affirmed that “the police department is training its members in order to adjust to the changing reality of the population of Montreal, which is increasingly more diversified,” but declined comment on the investigations.
