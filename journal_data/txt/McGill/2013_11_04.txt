Second installment of Labour Week kicks off on November 4
This Monday marks the beginning of the second annual installment of McGill’s Labour Week, a week-long event aimed at exploring the labour movement at McGill and in Quebec. McGill’s Inter Union Council (IUC), a group of labour unions at McGill, has worked to create a variety of workshops, panels, and talks, in hopes of promoting awareness about the function and purpose of the many different McGill unions.
Labour Week was started last spring after some members of the IUC began to see that general knowledge of unions at McGill, even among students who are union members, was low.
“We’ve noticed a lot of our members don’t really talk about or don’t really understand what the purpose is of having a union,” said AGSEM: McGill’s Teaching Union Vice-President for Invigilators and TAs Sunci Avlijas, one of the organizers of Labour Week. “[We] wanted to have some kind of event where the members of the McGill community [could] have a discussion about labour.”
According to Avlijas, last year’s Labour Week received a positive response, though it had a low turn-out because it wasn’t publicized extensively. There has been much more publicity for this year’s event.
A number of changes in the organization of the week have the IUC hoping that this year’s Labour Week will be even ‘bigger and better’ than last year. Workshop proposals came from members of the McGill community, creating more content diversity and leaving the IUC with more time for planning the event itself.
One of the sessions included this year is a panel on current issues in labour, led by Caroline Jacquet and Thomas Lafontaine, representatives of UQAM’s student employees’ association, Syndicat des étudiant-e-s employé-e-s de l’UQAM (SÉTUE), and Jamie Burnett, AGSEM’s Invigilator Grievance Officer. Burnett will be speaking about the different agreements that exist between unions and employers in the United States and Canada, such as the Rand Formula, and the existence of right-to-work policy in the southern U.S., as well as problems that can arise from the various forms of agreements.
Jacquet and Lafontaine will focus on how the legal right to strike has been compromised in many parts of Quebec and Canada. They will speak about the barriers that exist within strike-related legislation that can make union worker strikes difficult to organize. As well, they will compare the situation of the labour movement to that of the student-led strikes of 2012, where strike mobilization was considerably easier, despite a lack of clear policy protecting strikers.
McGill’s treatment of labour issues has left much to be desired in the past, according to Burnett. “The MUNACA [McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association] strike in 2011 was a very clear example of the erosion of the legal right to strike,” he said.
At the time, the University filed injunctions that prevented strikers from holding symbolic picket lines, and was also accused of using casual workers to replace striking MUNACA members. However, McGill was cleared of the charges of using scab workers by the Commission des relations du travail.
“On the one hand, MUNACA is prevented from holding a minimal symbolic picket, which at no point ever prevented anyone from getting onto campus; on the other hand, the Quebec government is not keeping its side of the bargain, effectively giving McGill carte blanche to use its most vulnerable casual workers to undermine others,” Burnett claimed.
McGill’s unions continue to be dissatisfied with the University’s treatment of current labour issues. Sean Cory, President of the Association of McGill University Research Employees (AMURE), listed two potential changes affecting unionized workers: the modification in pay frequency, and the 2.2 per cent raise in employee contributions to the pension plan.
These changes represent a combined loss of $120 to $200 in monthly income for workers, according to an email from Cory sent to AMURE members. “It is an unbelievable cut in pay. We have employees who do not know where this money is going to come from,” he told The Daily.
Cory finds that the proposed changes unfairly target unionized workers. “The pay frequency change is only going to affect unionized employees – they decided not to do it to the non-unionized employees,” he said. “A lot of people are wondering why only the unions are affected by this.”
The unions have already taken action. “MUNACA has filed a complaint to the labour board about being targeted because we’re unionized. We’re going to have a hearing next month about this. So it’s not looking good for being unionized labour at McGill,” Cory added.
According to Burnett, the recent budget cuts do not justify McGill’s attacks on workers. “Almost all of the attacks on workers and unions right now at McGill are said by McGill to be necessary because of the budget cuts. One question is whether or not those budget cuts themselves are necessary: for example, McGill did not accept additional support from the Quebec government which would have mediated the effects of provincial funding cuts, instead electing to take the cuts right away with the hopes of passing the cost onto its employees, especially its unionized employees.”
Burnett is convinced that strong unions are vital to protecting workers’ rights at McGill.
“What is clear is that unions at McGill need to be strong and united to stand up to those attacks. Labour Week has been a great platform for McGill’s unions to work together and to discuss important issues – something we would very much like to see continue.”
Labour Week runs from November 4 to 8. For more information about events, visit interunionvoicemcgill.com.

Referendum question also discussed 
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) held its bi-weekly Council meeting last Wednesday and adopted all six of the proposed questions to be asked in the upcoming referendum period, as well as a motion regarding AUS’s support for the creation of an Indigenous Studies Program.
Indigenous Studies Program
In Council on October 2, Arts Senator Claire Stewart-Kanigan presented a notice to motion regarding support for an Indigenous Studies Program at McGill.
The motion to support the program was then presented at the meeting last week, and passed unanimously. The motion mandates the AUS to adopt a stance of support for the proposed Indigenous Studies minor, the eventual development of an Indigenous Studies major, and the prioritization of the creation of a Chair in Indigenous Studies.
According to Stewart-Kanigan, the proposal for an Indigenous Studies program has been finalized and submitted to the Arts Curriculum Committee.
Stewart-Kanigan said that there has been a push by students in the past to have such a program, but as students graduate and move on every year, it becomes easy for such projects to get lost.
“The students were met with active faculty cooperation in this [proposal]. […] Now that there’s an actual proposal, there is an actual vote [where] we can say that we support a certain side,” said Stewart-Kanigan in an interview with The Daily.
“When it does come up for consideration at the curriculum committee, and at the Faculty of Arts committee, and each subsequent level that the proposal has to go through, there will be strong student support that can be called upon that will perhaps influence the considerations,” she continued.
Referendum Questions
Two of the proposed referendum questions deal with increasing the number of representatives on Council – including the addition of an Equity Committee Representative and a Financial Management Committee Representative.
In an interview with The Daily, Stewart-Kanigan said that she strongly supported the addition of an Equity Committee Representative to Council.
“Having someone who is highly sensitized to oppressive behaviours […] can add a useful dimension to not only the discourse itself, but the way the discourse happens in AUS Council,” Stewart-Kanigan explained.
“Given that the Equity Committee has been firmly established, the VP Internal [Enbal Singer] thought it would be a good idea to have a representative from the Equity Committee on AUS Council to institutionalize equity, to make sure that equity is involved with the AUS and they have a mechanism to report to the Council,” said AUS President Justin Fletcher in an interview with The Daily.
Other questions included amendments to the AUS Constitution and by-laws, such as a redistribution of responsibilities among executive members.
One of the constitutional changes being brought forward at referendum focuses on the fact that the AUS has hired a full-time executive assistant, whose salary is paid by student fees, to make a distinction between administrative tasks and governance. This change was imposed during the Winter 2013 referendum and now the AUS is seeking to update the constitution to reflect these changes.
“Now that we have more time to focus on governance, it was a good time for us to clean up the constitution […] So we found this to be a good opportunity not just to look at that position but all of our positions, and how […] the descriptions [could] be written better, have clearer mandates, and actually reflect a lot of the work we do,” Fletcher explained.
The polling period for the referendum will take place from November 21 to 26.

Panel discusses issues of gender representation 
On October 28, the Women In House program, in collaboration with McGill’s Political Science Students’ Association (PSSA), held a panel called “Yes SHE Can” to discuss gendered political participation and promote a more equitable representation of women in politics.
The panel featured Elisabeth Gidengil, a Political Science professor at McGill; Janine Krieber, a member of the Projet Montréal Board of Directors; Martine Desjardins, former Chair of the Quebec Federation of University Students (FEUQ); and Patrik Öhberg, a post-doctoral student working with the Canada Research Chair in Electoral Studies at Université de Montréal’s Department of Political Science.
Carly Walter, one of the organizers of the panel and PSSA Vice-President External Affairs, told The Daily that the panel was an important recognition of the inequality of political representation in Canada. “I have a lot of male friends, and they think it’s ridiculous when I talk about inequality. They don’t think it really exists anymore, or that it’s a problem, but it is. [24.7 per cent] of our federal parliament is female, which is drastic – it’s way too low.”
The panelists addressed what they believe are the reasons behind this low share of seats, and proposed possible solutions to promote women’s interest in politics.
Krieber located the problem within Canadian society. “The problem is that […] this Canadian society is not organized to accept women in politics,” she suggested, drawing on her own experience in political arenas.
Gidengil agreed, pointing to the expectation on women to take care of children and other family members. “The way Parliament operates is just not family-friendly, sitting late into the night and so on.”
On the other hand, Öhberg alleged that women’s reluctance to enter politics is due to their “natural hesitation and over-thinking” when being asked to participate in political matters – a point that Desjardins agreed with.
Finola Hackett, one of the panel organizers and a coordinator of the Women in House program, claimed instead that the reason behind this alleged reluctance lay in the unwelcoming environment in politics.
“Is it harder to convince a woman to run if she lacks the economic security, family support, or social networks to make it easier to adjust to the demanding lifestyle of politics, and if she knows she’ll face discrimination from colleagues or the media? Of course it is,” Hackett said.
NDP Member of Parliament Laurin Liu echoed this point in an interview with The Daily on the topic. “Women’s hesitation stems from other difficulties that they have in accessing roles of power that are traditionally held by men,” Liu said. “There is still a lot of work to do on that front.”
Öhberg believed that the key to promoting women’s interests would be to have more women in Parliament, a view that Shaina Agbayani, one of the panel organizers, a coordinator of the Women in House program, disagreed with.
“I don’t think that having more women in politics will change the game in itself,” Agbayani told The Daily, adding, “I think [the Women in House Program and I] recognize that there are many ‘fronts’ in this battle against the barriers for women’s equitable participation in society, and that the government is only one of them.”
The discussion also turned to women who presently hold political positions, and more particularly, to their representation in the media, which the panelists believed to be gender-biased.
“Just read a news article about a woman [in politics] and it will talk about what she is wearing. It doesn’t talk about what the guy is wearing,” Gidengil said.
Gidengil also addressed the double standard of behaviour. If women behave in an assertive manner, she said they will be portrayed as too aggressive. However, if women try to focus on consensus within politics, “[they] will get marginalized.”
Both Hackett and Agbayani acknowledged that the focus on the gender binary also left many people out of the discussion, whether they identified with a fluid concept of gender or felt that there were intersectional barriers preventing their entrance into politics.
“Though the Women in House program is specifically focused on the concern of female representation, it’s important to acknowledge that gender issues don’t exist in a vacuum, and are tied to broader injustices surrounding who gets to have a say in political discussions,” Hackett said, adding that the focus of the particular panel did not lend itself to a broader perspective, but that it would be noted for the future.

Discussion of student media, writing centre, post-doc student services
Starting October 22, McGill’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held a series of hustings, or debates, to create an opportunity for dialogue between post-grads and proponents of “Yes” votes on three referendum questions. The third and final installment took place on the evening of October 30 in Thomson House, where all three representatives were present to give their cases and answer questions from the floor.
The first referendum question on which post-graduates will vote will be whether or not they support paying a $1.50 fee per term in support of the McGill Writing Centre.
The Writing Centre’s representative, Julien Ouellet, said that the Centre’s survival is on the line, adding that McGill ended up not providing this service to students that every university “from Harvard to U [University of] Sherbrooke” has.
The sum would be enough to ensure its survival – a “no-brainer,” he concluded – and would also ensure the continuation of one-on-one tutorial services for grad students. Without the fee, those services would be terminated. In October’s meeting, Council voted against a motion amending the PGSS budget for a one-time transfer of $3,000 to the Centre for tutor wages.
Post-graduates will also resolve whether or not to pay $0.75 per student per semester to the McGill Tribune. The money will go toward “bolstering our publication by enhancing the services that we already have,” according to the Tribune’s representative and former editor-in-chief Elisa Muyl.
The extra funds would go toward financing a smartphone and tablet application and a graduate student focus within the paper’s pages, as well as training initiatives such as writers’ workshops.
The third question facing post-graduates in the referendum concerns McGill’s body of close to 600 post-doctoral fellows (or post-docs). With the fee question, post-docs will be voting whether or not to pay a mandatory fee to be included under the purview of student services. For full-time post-docs, this entails a monthly fee of $22.74 – or $136.46 per semester – that would enable them to access all services that fall under McGill’s Student Services umbrella.
At the moment, post-docs can access these services on an individual basis if they opt to pay the current Student Services Fee ($156.89 per semester). This makes it more expensive, and also means that service staff are not trained to cater to the post-doctoral student body’s specific needs.
In the event of a “Yes” vote, post-docs would be able to take full advantage of services such as Career and Planning Services, Health Services, and Financial and International Services.
“All these are things that other graduate students would take for granted but that we can’t access at the moment,” said Emma Vincent, president of the Association of Postdoctoral Fellows (APF), pointing out that the Quebec government designates post-docs as students, but since they have PhDs and teach classes, they are in “limbo” between the statuses of student and professor.
She also added that in the event of a “Yes” vote, PGSS and the APF would work together with the administration to transfer some or all of the cost of this monthly fee to post-docs’ supervisors.

AUS Equity Commissioners release critical report
In the recently released Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Frosh Report, AUS Equity Commissioner Josh Falek details an incident where a froshie yelled at a passerby, “Fuck you! I don’t know if you’re from the UQAM [or Concordia] or what but you’re not [from] McGill! How does it feel to be second best!”
In the report, Falek wrote, “The idea that this student actually had no idea where he was but was still assured he was better than everyone else was a perfect reflection of broader McGill entitlement.”
These kind of on-the-ground failings were detailed in the Frosh Report within a context of change. This year saw Frosh coordinators attempt to introduce equitable concepts into the design of Frosh, which has long been lamented as inequitable. Such changes include less of a focus on drinking, less sexually explicit, classist, and/or sexist chants, and more inclusive programming.
However, the Frosh Report details that the attempted implementation of these equitable concepts often didn’t extend into practice.
In one case at Gerts – although the game was not supposed to be played under the new equitable rules at Frosh – groups played “Strip Waterfall,” where participants had to take off their clothes while drinking.
“It’s a really weird introduction to McGill campus – ‘this is where you’re going to be for the next four years, get used to taking off your clothes in academic buildings,’” Falek said.
“The whole rape culture that is associated with [drinking games] is what really needs to go,” AUS Equity Commissioner Hannah Sinclair added. “It’s the compulsory [sexual] aspect of it. There’s a huge pressure.”
A redesigned pub crawl – renamed the “Montreal crawl” – was touted earlier by Frosh coordinators to The Daily. According to Falek, however, visits to city parks and other activities aimed to make the crawl less alcohol-heavy didn’t work. “From what I saw, the pub crawl was a pub crawl. I did not see anything different from that.”
“I think there’s something to be said that we’re still sending kids to the hospital every year,” said Falek, noting what he called an “unsafe drinking culture” at Frosh.
According to AUS VP Events Paul Laughlin, the AUS executive was unaware of these problems during Frosh, and were only informed afterward by Dean of Students André Costopoulos and Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens. “One of the biggest things we want to work on is we want to develop a better, across-the-board communication system throughout Frosh,” Laughlin told The Daily.
There were consequences for both leaders and froshies who broke the rules – at least in theory. Bracelets could be cut, disallowing the individual from attending any more Frosh events. However, cutting a bracelet took two coordinators to validate the claim and to administer the punishment – something that was hard to come by in the confusion of Frosh, according to both Laughlin and Falek.
The needed revision of the selection process for leaders was emphasized by both the AUS executive and Equity Commissioners. “The biggest problem is there [are] still Frosh leaders and coordinators not really taking into consideration that equity is needed, [or] wanting it to be there,” Falek said.
“You can’t expect equity to be maintained in Frosh by people who may not necessarily be trained in equitable purposes,” added Falek, referring to the need for Equity Commissioners to supervise the hiring process.
According to the AUS Equity Commissioners, one of the main problems with the attempted integration of equity was the expectation that Frosh would transform itself overnight. “You can’t just say things are going to be equitable now. It’s not an instantaneous thing, it’s a process, it needs to continue,” Sinclair said.
“The equity policy is there in theory but not really in practice,” she continued. “And so the consequences are also there in theory but they’re not necessarily being put into practice.”
The Frosh Report echoed a similar sentiment, stating, “Equity is not something that can be achieved in a single year. Oppression does not cease to exist because of some minor modifications. The entire system must be adjusted to include and promote those who could not access it previously.”
