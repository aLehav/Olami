Seven student unions claim CFS is tyrannical and litigious, CFS calls accusations malicious
Seven student unions across the country have collaborated to submit an extensive reform proposal to the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), which will be tabled at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) in late November.
The document – written by executives from McGill’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), the Concordia Student Union (CSU), the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association, the University of Regina Student’s Union, the Graduate Students’ Association of the University of Calgary, and the Alberta College of Art and Design Students’ Association – consists of 43 separate motions. The Kwantlen Student Association helped write and endorsed 26 of the motions.
A list of grievances is also included on the first page of the omnibus motion, moved by PGSS, which explains the logic of the motion: the authors accuse the CFS of being tyrannical, anti-democratic, litigious, overly corporate and bureaucratic, and run by “out-of-touch ex-student politicos.”
Though PGSS has submitted a petition to defederate from CFS, PGSS VP External Ladan Mahabadi still felt taking part in the reform package was necessary.
“Defederation is an open dialogue about the issues and our continued membership. This package is to serve as a memo to CFS executive and members to explain why we’re doing what we’re doing, regardless of defederation,” said Mahabadi. “The idea behind it is to be as constructive as possible – just to let [CFS] know the reasons we are not satisfied. The reform package does a fantastic job.”
The reform proposal itself is divided into four sections: motions addressing accountability and transparency, structural reform, the membership of specific student unions, and the impeachment of two CFS and CFS-Services executives. Specific motions include calls for CFS executive salary disclosure, a conflict of interest policy, individual fee opt-out, and opening all CFS meetings to the press, which are currently restricted.
CFS-Quebec (CFS-Q) branch also provided assistance drafting the proposal after it was mandated by members to help with the process.
“Officially the CFS-Q did endorse the proposal in its entirety…because of the current state of affairs. It isn’t a positive one, and it could be better,” said CFS-Q President Greg Johannson.  “I think generally our relations [with the CFS] are perceived as an ‘us versus them’ dynamic, whereas the reality is that we’re all just trying to work together to make the organization better for its members.”
CSU VP External Auob Muntasar said Concordia undergraduates have had problems with the CFS in the past, notably the interference of CFS executives in CSU elections. Muntasar also mentioned a perception that CFS lobbying campaigns were too weak and felt some of the reforms could rectify these problems.
“The fact that it’s an omnibus is a lot to handle, but a lot of motions are dependent on each other. One small thing is not going to push the CFS in the right direction,” Muntasar said.
Some of the motions call for CFS to cease its litigations with certain student unions like the Simon Fraser Student Society. Others demand that CFS recognize the right of student unions – like the Dalhousie Graduate Student Association and the University of Prince Edward Island Students’ Association – to defederate from CFS in accordance with student referendums.
In response to the reform proposal, CFS National Chairperson Katherine Giroux-Bougard has issued a letter to CFS members, criticizing aspects of the reform proposal that was distributed en masse by email.
“Contained within these motions is a series of false and malicious claims about our Federation….While the National Executive of the Canadian Federation of Students welcomes debate, I felt it necessary to respond to this attempt to undermine the ability of the Federation,” Giroux-Bougard wrote, later referring to the reform proposal as an “internal matter.”
Her letter singled out the the PGSS  for having led the initiative to bring the proposal to the CFS AGM.
“The package is a thinly veiled attempt, by a member, to undermine the progressive work that the Federation undertakes, through a campaign aimed at discrediting the elected national leadership, humiliating the unionized staff, and undermining the organisation and its work.”
The proposal elicited a similar reaction from the Vancouver Island University Student Union (VIUSU). In a mass email to the recipients of an intitial email written by the PGSS to distribute the proposal, VIUSU’s executive criticized Mahabadi and the PGSS for emailing “a very select group of member local unions, non-member students’ unions, and other organisations.”
“It is…disingenuous to claim that you wish the best for this organisation while presenting a series of untruths as fact, attacking our elected leadership and unionised staff, and generally undermining the organisation as a whole by sending this ‘package’ to various administrators – the very people we lobby and work with every day in an effort to improve the lives of our members,” the VIUSU executive wrote. “Our idea of ‘reform’ includes a process that is based on respectful, honest dialogue and debate. Perhaps the ‘reform’ needed in the student movement is a mechanism to prevent ideologically motivated ad hominem attacks wasting students’ time and resources,” the email stated.

Human rights lawyer Pearl Eliadis on the legal challenges women still face in Canada
Pearl Eliadis is a Montreal-based lawyer who specializes in human rights and development. She has previously sat on the Ontario Human Rights Commission and served as president of the Equitas International Centre for Human Rights Education. Eliadis is currently the president of Shield of Athena, a local non-profit organization that provides legal assistance and social services to survivors of domestic violence.
McGill Daily: What do you see as the biggest challenges or frustrations in human rights work?
Pearl Eliadis: Something that has been an obstacle is that, although Canada is an actor in the international sphere, we have not [always complied with international norms]; and this has been an area of frustration for many human rights lawyers who are receptive to human rights arguments about issues here. That has happened over religious schooling in Ontario, where the UN issued recommendations around religious schooling, suggesting that it was discriminatory, [but] was completely ignored by the Harris government at the time. It’s also happened with the Bill-101 decisions here; issues around aboriginal women, particularly the disappearance of aboriginal women in western Canada; the difficulty outside of Quebec to see human rights and poverty as being related issues; and the conservative backlash against human rights.
MD: What do you think are the main women’s rights issues in Montreal and Canada?
PE: [At] the federal level, I think the Tories and Liberals are not doing a good job at bringing women into politics. Meaningful access of women into policy and politics is a big problem in this country, particularly at the two major federal parties. Access of women to politics is an issue in Canada and an issue internationally…. One of the case studies I’m going to talk about on Friday is actually a Kenyan woman, who went into politics and was very badly beaten and attacked when it looked like she was doing well in her constituency.
Access to day care is something that we had on the agenda for a little while, but with the Conservatives it has fallen off the table…. When the Conservatives start talking about giving money to women instead of day care, the problem is that [they are] not giving women the money that allows them to pay for a year of day care. [They are] giving them enough money to pay for one month of day care. I think that’s a major issue for women, and we have not been good in this country about moving forward on that agenda, I think this is fundamental to women’s equality.
The third issue in Canada is the abandonment of the court challenges program, again unfortunately by the Tories. Most of the developments in terms of substantive equality in the women’s movement, many of them happen because the federal government had a program where law clinics and equality seeking groups could seek funding to challenge or to bring forward different progressive ideas of the law. That program has been abandoned, and that has affected our capacity to move forward on equality issues, including women’s issues.
The fourth issue is the current attack on the Human Rights Commission. Many of the developments that we have had in terms of making workplaces safer for women, free of sexual harassments, and free of discrimination have happened as a result of the Human Rights Commission. The right wing has launched a successful campaign through bloggers to shut down the Human Rights Commission, because they fundamentally oppose equality rights. And the progressive left has been almost completely silent on this issue. I think that’s a direct danger to women’s rights.
MD: How do gender-neutral laws perpetuate inequality?
PE: When we talk about equality, we’re not talking about formal equality; we’re talking about substantive equality. What I mean by formal equality is a rule that goes something like this, ‘Everybody who is going to work in this workplace has to work for three consecutive years, and if they take off more than two months at a time, then they’re going to be fired.’ Everybody’s the same, right? But what does this do to women of child-bearing age? So in fact, none of these rules are really neutral…. Gender neutrality is actually not the objective. The objective is making sure that from a qualitative perspective, you have social structures and laws in place that allow people – women, men, people with disabilities, and so on – to live fulfilling lives. I challenge the notion of gender neutrality, because I actually don’t think there is such a thing. I think that a lot of the laws and traditions we’ve developed have been developed because we have a particular work ethic that came from the Victorian period and the early industrial age, and that has been changed by the reality of women entering the workforce.

Eliadis lecture “Women’s Rights as Human Rights: How Are We Doing Today?” will take place at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow in room 202 of Chancellor Day Hall.

World Wildlife Fund report card recommends politicians evaluate hydro-electric policies.
A report released last Thursday by World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF) has raised alarm about the state of Canada’s rivers. The report, entitled “Canada’s Rivers at Risk: Environmental Flows and Canada’s Freshwater Future,” assessed the water flow of 10 major rivers across the country in order to determine the extent of damage caused by increasing agricultural production, electrical generation, and global warming.
WWF has assigned a report card grade to several rivers based on how severely water flows have been affected by overuse, as well as the expected impact on their future water flows. The Mackenzie River and the Skeena Rriver were rated as healthy since the water flows of these rivers have not been noticeably altered, and the ecosystems that depend on them are stable. The South Saskatchewan River, the Saint John River, and the St. Lawrence River have been severely altered and are said to face a declining future.   The report attributed many of these changes to the side effects of climate change, like melting glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns, and frequent droughts and floods.
 By 2050, WWF predicted that water flows from Lake Ontario to the St. Lawrence river could decrease by between four to 24 per cent annually, lowering water levels at Montreal by 0.2 to 1.2 metres thanks to the effects of climate change.
 The major recommendation of the report called attention to the use of hydro-electricity. As it becomes an increasingly appealing energy alternative, WWF recommended that policymakers focus on improving the efficiency of existing electrical infrastructure rather than building new dams. It noted that new construction could cause significant alteration to water flows, and thus damage ecosystems.
“We want government to ask what is driving the demand [for energy]; is it the level of consumption that is calling for a higher electrical demand, which could be monitored and controlled, or is it a response to the transition away from coal-fired electrical generation, as in the case of Ontario? Our perspective is to design and locate dam placement that mimics or respects water flow,” said Tony Maas, the WWF-Canada’s national advisor on freshwater policy and planning.
Adriana Mugnatto-Hamu, climate change critic for Canada’s Green Party, did not expect the Canadian government to heed the WWF report’s warnings.
“I am very hopeful but to tell the truth, I kind of doubt it, particularly with the current government. This government has been almost in denial about climate change, and they are very tied to the energy operations of the tar sands…and that directly affects the Athabasca River,” said Mugnatto-Hamu.
Save the River, an organization formed of both Canadian and American activists working to protect the St. Lawrence, have endorsed the report’s findings, and hoped that the WWF’s report will serve as a wake-up call to policymakers.
Jennifer Caddick, executive director of Save the River, highlighted the impact the report may have on their initiatives.  “We’ve been working for years now to develop a new water levels plan.  We are inches away from getting there…and we’re working with WWF to get this issue done,” Caddick said.
The current treaty regulating water levels is over 50 years old and has allowed for excessive damming in the region, resulting in damage to 50 per cent of the St. Lawrence basin’s wetlands and watershed vegetation, according to Caddick. At least 20 per cent of all plant and animal species inhabiting the St. Lawrence watershed are listed as vulnerable, threatened, or endangered.
Caddick hoped that the report will influence the policies of the International Joint Commission – a bilateral body that facilitates cooperation between Canada and the United States that works to prevent river degradation –  to establish a new water level plan that would restore water flows to a more natural level.

Students approve motions on employment, energy, pornography before assembly falls apart
A t the General Assembly (GA) Wednesday afternoon, attendees voted to encourage student employment in the Shatner building, reduce its energy usage by 40 per cent by 2015, and relax the SSMU Constitution’s attitudes toward non-oppressive pornographic material distributed by SSMU clubs and services.
The first motion, pertaining to student employment, was drafted by SSMU VP External Affairs Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, During the question period, Ronderos-Morgan stated that the motion was intended to institutionalize an existing – though not formal – policy of encouraging businesses in the Shatner building to employ students. Nobody opposed the motion during the debating period, and when voted upon, it was passed unanimously.
More contentious was the motion proposed by VP Clubs and Services Sarah Olle which called for a professional energy audit and a 40 per cent reduction in the building’s energy consumption by 2015. Olle said that it provided a “reasonable goal which can be achieved” by the deadline, and noted that the target is based on the national average for energy consumption in student-run buildings.
Arts student David Lipsitz expressed concern that there was no mention in the motion or in Olle’s discussion of it of the financial implications of such an undertaking.
“Even though the GA body may not be qualified to pass financial motions, I think it’s absurd that [VP Olle] is withholding information from us simply because she feels we won’t know how to make use of it, or that we are not able to make use of it,” Lipsitz said.
This motion also passed, but with a clear opposition present.
Olle was also the author of the following motion which proposed amending an article in the SSMU by-laws that bans the “marketing or distribution of sexist publications.”
VP University Affairs Rebecca Dooley attempted to explain what was meant by non-oppressive pornographic material, citing “non-normative queer porn, anti-racist porn…not the kind of porn that pops up in your email box by accident.”
After a member of the audience spoke out against the motion, saying that “all porn is inherently degrading,” VP Internal Affairs Alex Brown responded that anti-racist and queer-friendly porn can offer an opportunity for young people to explore their sexuality.
“It’s alienating to some of our members to say what they do or what they like is wrong,” said Brown. Despite a more vocal opposition, this motion passed.
The final motion debated before quorum was lost demanded that SSMU install reading tables in Shatner’s washroom stalls.
This motion failed, and subsequently many supporters of the motion chose to leave the GA, which led the already-dwindling audience to lose quorum, just before several other motions were slated for discussion.
The remaining motions – regarding Styrofoam in the Shatner, the SSMU lease in Shatner, seafood on campus, and McGill’s use of the self-funded tuition model – were tabled until the next GA.
During SSMU President Ivan Neilson’s executive report, those still present learned that in the coming weeks, McGill will be presenting its Revised Research Policy, which will include the information on military research addressed in the Winter 2009 GA, and which will be released and made public before the next Senate meeting on November 4.

Poor sports facilities and funding push disease to twice national average
Underfunded athletics facilities in Kahnawake are contributing to the community’s diabetes problem, according to Mackenzie Whyte, operations coordinator of Kahnawake’s Sports and Recreation Unit.
“People have developed a more sedentary lifestyle,” Whyte said. “If there were more facilities, people would have access to a greater range of activities and more possible times to do them.”
Kahnawake is a First Nations reserve of about 7,000 located on Montreal’s south shore. Over 800 people, nearly 12 per cent of the population, have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes – more than twice the national average of 5 per cent.
“It’s a lot of people,” Whyte said.
A survey conducted for Health Canada’s First Nations and Inuit Branch in July revealed that while increasing numbers of First Nations people are aware of the programs promoting physical activity in their communities, few of them connect exercise with the prevention of diabetes.
First Nations populations with diabetes are more likely to point to genetics or diet as the disease’s cause, according to the survey.
The same survey reported that under half of the First Nations people surveyed rated their communities’ sports facilities as “good” or “excellent.” Whyte pointed out that even Kahnawake’s minimal facilities are better than most.
“We’re unusual compared to other First Nations,” she said. “In other places, like up north, they don’t even have an arena at all.”
Jun-Li Liu of Montreal’s Fraser Laboratories for Diabetes Research said that exercise is one of the most important factors in preventing or treating Type 2 diabetes, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to properly process insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood.
“Exercise builds muscle and muscle is better at responding to insulin,” Liu said. “The bottom line is, if you’re afraid of becoming diabetic, you need exercise.”
While Whyte admitted that healthy habits are the responsibility of the individual, she said the community’s athletics facilities would be hard-pressed to aid widespread health initiatives.
Kahnawake’s Sport and Recreation Unit received about $12,000 of funding last year from the federal and provincial governments combined, an amount Whyte called “peanuts.” She said the recreation centre would have to expand its facilities if it wants to add more programs.
“Sometimes people will come at night because they want to walk around the arena, but it will be crowded with kids,” she said. “They ask, ‘When will it be less crowded?’ and we have to tell them to come back during the day. We just need more room.”
Whyte added that Kahnawake’s hospital has been proactive in organizing activities like walking groups.
