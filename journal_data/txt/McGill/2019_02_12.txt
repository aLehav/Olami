The Black Students’ Network and the Black Law Students’ Association of McGill organized a panel discussion with the Faculty of Law as part of Black History Month on February 4. The panel focused on systemic discrimination and racism in the Canadian context. Panelists Philip Howard, Julius Haag, Fabrice Vil, and Shanice Nicole Yarde began by demystifying overused terminology such as “prejudice,” “bias,” “anti-Black,” and “racist” while also clarifying the key differences between institutional, systemic, and social racism. They also debated the usefulness of the term “multiculturalism,” with most panellists asserting that the term is an illusory, all-inclusive word that is used to compensate for the more specific racial problems prevalent in society.
The panel highlighted Canada’s history as a settler-colonial state, unpacking its previous actions supporting anti-Blackness and extracting labour. They focused on “relearning ” these histories to challenge current dominant stories. Panellists explored the idea of anti-racist policies, pointing out how they are mainly governed by white ideologies. They emphasized the need to be more critical of the news, media, and so-called anti-discriminatory policies set by the government. The audience clearly supported the speakers in their claim that acknowledging discrimination in Canada is not enough; reparations must be made in order to effect change. Furthermore, the question of increased representation of Black people in the police forces and the government was brought up, which led to an interesting conflict of opinion among the panellists and the audience. The majority of the attendees believed that increased representation would result in large scale reformations. However, most panellists explained that “getting representation in a prejudiced system is a trap.”
Panellist Phillip Howard went on to dissect our current education systems, and how “McGill [….] could be seen as a product of colonialism.” Fabrice Vil explained how McGill has a “diversity deficit” and argued that the University should engage in more efforts to improve the student body’s diversity. They further stated that contrary to the US, most Canadian universities don’t even have departments for African Studies, and the majority of the ones that do offer a few classes per semester often taught by white/ non-African professors.
It was reiterated that the only way to prevent systemic racism and discrimination is to change the ideology of the system. Terminating hyper-surveillance, carding, and random frisking will only be possible if society recognizes our “honest history” and un-learns the prejudice against Black people in order to re-humanize them on social and institutional levels.

Students at McGill have been helping with campaign efforts throughout the imminent Outremont by-election; members of both NDP and Liberal McGill are manning phones and knocking on doors. In an interview with the Daily, Co-Presidents of NDP McGill and Concordia, as well as VP Communications of Liberal McGill, shared their thoughts on the upcoming race.
Daniel Minden, VP Communications of Liberal McGill is optimistic about Rachel Bendayan’s campaign, because of her past run in 2015. Outremont has belonged to the NDP since Thomas Mulcair’s 2007 victory. Minden says the Liberals are keen to regain the riding. Before Mulcair’s election, Outremont was historically held by the Liberals. Co-Presidents Annie Yeo, Ryan Simonyik, and Celeste Cassidy of NDP Concordia and McGill believe it is going to be a tight race between the two candidates. Drawing on her phone canvassing experience leading up the election, Yeo noted that responses from Outremont residents were largely 50/50 in support for each party.
Yeo, Simonyik, and Cassidy are pleased with Sánchez’s campaign. They appreciate her commitment to environmental issues, including her past work for the Climate Action Network, and other environmental organizations. Yeo also noted Sánchez’s interest in local issues, speaking to her dedication to community centred matters like the state of sidewalks, or improving social services for seniors.
Minden also spoke about his appreciation of Bendayan’s familiarity with the neighbourhood and local issues. Noting her work as Chief of Staff to the Federal Minister of Small Business and Tourism, he spoke to Bendayan’s professional and political experience.
Cassidy shared some criticism of Sánchez, pointing out the candidate’s past reluctance to vocalize support on free post-secondary tuition measures. As of last year, the NDP has added free tuition to their platform, and Cassidy looks forward to seeing more involvement from Sánchez on these issues.
Earlier this week, Julia Sánchez, and NDP MP for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie Alexandre Boulerice, challenged Rachel Bendayan and the Liberal party via Facebook to do more with regards to the environment. In contrast, Sánchez has put forward a “Transition” plan to eliminate oil subsidies, raise Green House Gass reduction targets, and for the project to be developed on a national level.
Cassidy, and the other co-presidents, expressed her approval of the plan, particularly Sánchez’s intentions for a investment in green jobs, emphasizing the importance of addressing concerns over lost jobs with radical action on climate change.
Minden agreed that environmental issues are an important yet controversial topic, but stands by the government’s support in the construction of pipelines. He believes that the projects will bring needed Canadian resources to global markets. Reports by the Overseas Development Institute show Canada to be a top contributor to oil and gas subsidies, and has been called on for more transparency, ranking last in commitment to ending support to oil and gas production of G7 countries last year.
With the federal election approaching this fall, Minden, Yeo, Cassidy, and Simonyik all assert the larger importance of this by-election. Cassidy believes winning Outremont could show Quebec that the NDP is valuable and capable of creating change in the province. Minden is also enthusiastic about the possibility of the Liberals winning, stating that it could strengthen their base in Quebec ahead of the election to come.

“Costs” Outweigh Transparency and Accountability
In May 2016, the SPVM equipped 78 police officers with body cameras for a period of seven months. The pilot project, aimed at evaluating the impact of mandatory body cameras on the use of force, ended in April of last year. An extensively detailed report of the project was presented to the City of Montreal’s Public Security Commission on February 1.
The SPVM cited promoting transparency as a main objective of the project. The SPVM wants to “reinforce the bond of trust between police officers and citizens.”
The SPVM was responsible for the deaths of Pierre Coriolan in 2017 and Nicholas Gibbs in 2018. Both Coriolan and Gibbs’ deaths were filmed on cell phones, which has helped their families fight for justice.
Almost a year later, the SPVM’s final report advises against the widespread implementation of body cameras within the city’s police forces. The report says that “the project did not unequivocally demonstrate that portable cameras promote the transparency of police interventions, strengthen trust between the police and the citizen, and ensure the safety of police.”
According to the report, the majority of officers felt that the program undermined their right to privacy at work. For some, the cameras felt like an intrusion: 90 per cent of the officers who took part in the pilot project felt as though they had been placed under surveillance.
The costs associated with outfitting the city’s 3,000 police officers with body cameras were said to exceed the value of the “estimated benefits” stemming from this initiative. The initial installation costs of the devices, incurred over the span of five years, would amount to $17.4 million, in addition to the annual $24 million in annual running costs. Lionel Perez, leader of Ensemble Montréal, claims these costs are severely exaggerated.
After examining the report, mayor Valérie Plante decided against implementing the project. In a February 6 statement, she said that Montreal’s police service could not handle the increase in costs. However, Plante is open to future discussions regarding the project.
Members of City Council are also asking the mayor to reconsider her decision.
“It’s clear that there is an investment, but […] there is a societal cost to doing nothing. There are issues of racial profiling, transparency — and public confidence is priceless,” stated Perez.
Since the decision, many have expressed their disappointment regarding Plante’s hasty decision. Victims of police brutality have voiced their dissent. Many of them believe that officers’ behaviour during arrests would change if they were being recorded and thus held accountable for their actions. Majiza Philip, whose arm was broken by SPVM officers in 2014, told CBC that “if the police knew they were being watched, it would have been different.” She went on to say that “I think one of the reasons [the SPVM doesn’t want body cameras] is because they don’t want to be accountable.”

The Villeray–Saint-Michel– Parc-Extension borough council delayed the vote to grant demolition permits for 891- 893 and 925 Beaumont Ave, last Tuesday, February 5. No date for the next vote has been set.
Preceding the council meeting was a demonstration organized by Comité d’Action de Parc-Extension (CAPE), a community organization committed to defending tenant rights within the Parc-Extension community. CAPE has been hard at work in recent years preparing themselves for the influx of students associated with a new campus of Université de Montreal (UdeM)opening in neighbouring Outremont this fall.
Sasha Dyck, one of the organizers of the demonstration, set out the activists goals for the meeting. First on the agenda was to get all five councillors to vote against the permit for demolition of the two buildings on Beaumont. According to Dyck, the current owner of the building has a conditional offer of sale if the demolition permits are granted. The potential buyer has explicitly said the buildings would be rebuilt into condo style apartments for student housing.
Dyck grew up in the Mile End, witnessing first hand the effects gentrification. After Ubisoft moved into the neighbourhood, the Mile End changed drastically. Dyck predicts that “UdeM is going to have that Ubisoft effect on Beaumont.” The crowd mirrored this sentiment, chanting “No Mile-Ex in Parc-Ex.”
Dyck expressed the necessity for social housing in the area rather than more expensive, individual housing units for students. Park- Extension has historically been a working-class and immigrant neighbourhood. Today, it is home to Montreal’s largest concentration of South Asians, and has one of the highest concentrations of working poor in the country.
Dyck wants the council to commit to creating more social housing, but no such commitment was made by the council. He spoke of a $4.25 million social housing project in 2014 that was never seen to completion.
The protest allowed space for tenants to speak about their situations. Mary, a mother of four, spoke about her landlord’s attempt to evict her multiple times. Another man told the crowd he has been on the social housing waitlist for the past three years. A third tenant expressed his struggles with cockroaches and unresponsive landlords.
Dyck asserted that the aim of this protest was to break the stigma of struggle, build solidarity, and learn about the reality of their neighbours’ realities.
According to Dyck, “Beaumont right now is the epicentre, the ground zero for gentrification in Parc-Extension.”

The Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) held its annual general meeting on Thursday, January 25. AMUSE’s website describes this meeting as the “highest governing forum of the union.”
The meeting began with reports from the executive committee, the board of representatives, and other committees within the union where members summarized their projects and pursuits from the past year and provided objectives for the upcoming year.
After the presentation of annual reports, Alexandra Lelyuk, Internal Affairs Officer, moved to present the Pay Equity Report and summarize the settlement reached in August 2018 between AMUSE and the University. This settlement is the result of a long process of negotiations after AMUSE found the University in violation of the Quebec Pay Equity Act, based on improperly conducted pay equity assessments performed by the University in 2010 and 2015. The settlement includes a $40,000 payment to AMUSE, which the union will use to fund the difficult task of finding the almost 10,000 members who worked for the University within the past eight years and are eligible to receive retroactive payments. The settlement also included a 7.5 per cent raise for current AMUSE employees.
The union voted on a proposed increase in union dues, from 1.6559 per cent to 1.7377 per cent, which passed unanimously. This proposal was largely motivated by the observation that AMUSE’s dues were lower than those of similar unions in Quebec. The increase in dues will provide an additional $7,600 in annual funding, which AMUSE plans to put towards hosting additional events on campus, developing trainings for board members, increasing the President’s weekly hours, and increasing their presence at conferences.
Members were then asked to vote on the proposed budget for the upcoming year, which passed unanimously. Following this, members voted on amendments to the union’s bylaws. Among these amendments was a proposed increase in the reimbursement given to union members from MacDonald campus for attending union meetings from $3.25 to $5, as well as changing the start date of the fiscal year to February 1 to coincide with the date of the annual general meeting. All amendments passed unanimously.
The meeting concluded with elections for executive committees, the board of representatives, and the grievance committee. All members of the executive committee were elected unopposed.
