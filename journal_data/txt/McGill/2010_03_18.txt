Ruling permits commercial logging on land under investigation for title claim
On March 12, judge Caroline E. Brown will hear the Okanagan Indian Band’s (OKIB) application to appeal a February 1 order prohibiting their interference with commercial logging operations by Tolko Industries on contested land. The band alleges that the initial decision by the Supreme Court of B.C.  did not consider the irreparable harm that logging will cause to an ongoing investigation to determine the band’s title claims to the area.
The OKIB has taken all measures to prevent Tolko from initiating the project at Brown’s Creek Watershed near Vernon, B.C. – an area that supplies drinking and irrigation water for the 1,800 residents of the OKIB. Logging will also affect the headwaters of the Bouleau and Nashwito Creeks, disturbing the habitat of Okanagan fisheries.
The band has constructed a checkpoint on Westside Road and a blockade of the Bouleau Creek Forest Service Road. They also intend to file a complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Commission for the failure of government agencies to protect their water supply.
The Ministry of Transportation has challenged the blockade, claiming ownership of the roads,  – but OKIB chief Fabian Alexis has defended his band’s rights.
“We have a specific claim: the road runs through our land on our trails, and we haven’t been compensated. Our community is adamant that no commercial logging will take place in our territory anymore,” said Alexis.
He and other members of OKIB were issued a “cease and desist” letter by Tolko in October of last year.
The watershed has been legally disputed territory since 1999. Under economic pressure, the OKIB began harvesting trees for domestic use under a permit issued by the Okanagan Nation Alliance. When the province issued a stop-work order on these activities, the OKIB challenged its constitutionality in connection with ongoing title claims over the watershed.
According to Louise Mandell, a lawyer representing the OKIB, the litigation “challenges the province’s claim to 100 per cent ownership and jurisdiction in the absence of [a] treaty.”
“Tolko knew that the Brown’s Creek Area was before the court and about the conflict on the ground. Tolko went into it with its eyes wide open,” said Mandell.
Despite the ongoing case, B.C. granted Tolko Industries cutting permits in the disputed area. According to Alexis, the logging threatens the archaeological collection of aboriginal title evidence.
Tolko hired its own third party consultants to carry out archaeological investigation over the winter, which concluded on February 25.
Alexis asserted that the investigation disregarded adequate Okanagan involvement, as ordered by Brown.
“We have to first prove our existence, which is ridiculous. There is no bill of sale; we never sold this land. They are saying that there is no evidence of Indian people in higher mountain elevations, but how can you find trails under feet of snow?” said Alexis.
In a March 5 press release, Mark Tamas, Tolko Industries’ Okanagan Woodlands regional manager, described OKIB’s blockade as “in defiance of B.C. Supreme Court Orders…. Tolko has a court-issued injunction and enforcement order to allow access to our legally approved cutting permits.”
Will Koops, a coordinator for the B.C. Tap Water Alliance, a group that advocates for the protection of community water supply watersheds from resource use exploitation, has voiced support for the OKIB. Skeptical of any B.C. court decisions, he argued that in the ‘60s, the attorney general’s department began systematically acting for corporate interests.
“In whose interest does the provincial government act? On behalf of the companies. There is no legal mechanism that looks at both the companies’ and indigenous and non-indigenous public interest. This means unequal representation to the courts,” he said.
The majority of watersheds in B.C. were protected until 1962, when the Social Credit government moved to protect them from commercial logging.
“The province has been granting tenure to companies for decades without honouring First Nations, and the forestry is not sustainable,” said Koops.
Alexis also commented on the fact that most B.C. First Nations have never formally ceded their territory. “The government presents a facade of trying to recognize rights, but meanwhile nothing is happening. If anything, our rights are being lessened.”

Society members remain in the dark about election
The Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its Annual General Meeting (AGM) Tuesday evening in the Thomson Hall ballroom. With only 42 PGSS members in attendance, the Society failed to meet its quorum of 76, or one per cent of regular members of the Society, and was forced to hold an informal meeting.
The meeting’s main focus was the electoral debate for executive candidates. Although all positions were acclaimed, candidates discussed their platforms for three minutes each and answered questions posed by the audience.
Incoming president Alexandra Bishop addressed three key areas of concern, the first being how to improve the services available to PGSS members. “PGSS services are the first form of contact students have with the Society, making them a key priority of mine,” she said.
Bishop said that while she was satisfied with programs such as family care, she promised to try to gather more student feedback to improve all services.
“When making improvements, we need to look at where the greatest need is and what students want,” said Bishop. “As for other issues, such as increasing office and lab space for students, we’ll have to discuss matters with the University and see what money is available.”
One thing Bishop focused on was a widely discussed issue for the Society: improving communications with students.
Audience members agreed that most PGSS members are not even aware of the election currently taking place and that an endless slew of emails is no help.
“Each time I send out an email, I can feel it being deleted,” said one departmental councillor.
Others felt that it is the responsibility of students to make themselves aware of PGSS proceedings and to take part in the process, though everyone agreed that there was a fundamental flaw in the PGSS’s communications strategy.
Ryan Hughes, the VP (External) candidate, highlighted accountability as one primary part of his platform. “Executive evaluations have not been done and I hope to create a system to evaluate executives properly,” he said.
VP (Internal) candidate Magnus Bein mentioned plans to hold new events for PGSS members in Thomson House and off-campus. One audience member mentioned the lack of initiative in getting students from the Macdonald campus involved – an issue Bein said will be addressed.
There was a brief discussion of PGSS’s upcoming referendum to de-federate from the Canadian Federation of Students. In addition, both CKUT Radio and QPIRG-McGill will be asking for fee increases at the referendum.
“We’re asking for the fee increase because we need to balance our budget,” explained Erin Weisgerber, CKUT’s funding coordinator. “We’ve cut back as much as we can but without a fee increase, we’re looking at more deficit years in the future.”
According to Weisgerber, CKUT has not had a PGSS fee increase since 1987 when the community radio station first established itself. Since then, what the station receives from the PGSS has gone down by 60 per cent, after adjusting for inflation.
QPIRG-McGill has also not had a PGSS fee increase since it joined the Society in 1988.
“We are hopeful that we will be granted the fee increase,” said Andrea Figueroa, QPIRG’s external coordinator. “Students have been receptive and I feel it’s going to happen.”
Weisgerber, however, had some concerns. “Since I am not a member of the PGSS, I cannot campaign for the fee increase. Unfortunately, many people will not be informed about the fee increase when they see it listed on their ballot.”

Police struggle to contain violent fallout of drug trade
In the wake of crackdowns on powerful Mexican drug lords, a ripple effect across North America has sparked new levels of drug-related violence on the streets of Vancouver. Competition over dwindling supplies of cocaine and heroin has law enforcement agencies battling to contain the potential violence between rival distributors competing over what is left of the market.
“Violence has gone in cycles. There are relative lulls in violence followed by periods of extreme violence,” said Sergeant Shinder Kirk, of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit-British Columbia (CFSEU-BC) Gang Task Force.
Kirk said that turf disputes between mid- and street-level traffickers is one of the most common catalysts for violence. According to Kirk, there are around 130 known groups operating in drug trafficking in British Columbia, which can be divided into organized crime, mid-level trafficking, and street-level distributors.
“It’s all to do with the drug trade. There are disputes between groups over market turf, over who controls the drug trade in a particular community,” said Kirk.
The CFSEU-BC web site identifies the most visible and violent organized crime groups in British Columbia as the Bacon/Red Scorpions Group and the United Nations Gang. But while they are the main distributors of drugs throughout the province, Kirk says they are not responsible for the majority of the violence.
Glenn Fisher, of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), said that gang violence has been subdued since an intense period of bloodshed between the Scorpions and the UN Gang in 2009, which was marked by several drive-by shootings.
“[Now] violence here is among individuals, not gangs,” said Fisher. “The drugs are no good. People have been selling garbage…. There have been a lot of stabbings.”
Last year, in response to the escalating feuds between organized crime groups in Vancouver, the CFSEU-BC launched a widespread operation to stem the bloodshed in British Columbia. According to Fisher, it appears they have succeeded in reducing much of the violence.
“[The gangs] were feuding with each other…[but] a lot of the action has quieted down,” he said.
The level of violence in Mexico seems to have had a neutralizing effect on the domestic drug trade. Fisher said that trade relationships that used to exist with Mexico have now ceased to exist because of the intensification of violence there.
“We have a high grade of marijuana here, which we used to trade for cocaine,” said Fisher. “But people are scared to deal with Mexicans. Mexico is a very violent country right now; everyone is getting killed.”
Vancouver’s coastal location and proximity to the drug-centres of California and Mexico has rendered it the focal point of the Canadian drug trade.
Neil Boyd, professor of criminology at Simon Fraser University, said that all Canadian ports are affected by the international drug trade. “A lot of drug traffic goes through Vancouver. That comes with the designation of being a port,” said Boyd. “Even Montreal is affected.”
CFSEU-BC now focuses on prevention, intervention, and enforcement, with uniformed and covert investigators working to prevent violence, according to Kirk. He also highlighted the cooperation between law enforcement agencies across Canada and North America.
“Organized crime has been around [Vancouver] for centuries if you talk about groups like Asian Triads or the Mafia…. But they are not prone to violence,” Kirk said.
With organized crime spreading east, Kirk said the CFSEU-BC has been talking with various agencies in Calgary, Edmonton, California, and across North America.
Vancouver is just one link in a symbiotic international drug trade, and Kirk said that crackdowns on the flourishing drug trade in Mexico have had an effect on British Columbia. According to Kirk, while a high demand for Mexican drugs remains in the province, supplies have dwindled, increasing competition and violence.
“Groups here have ties to suppliers in Mexico. Now there is greater competition over a smaller amount of product…[which leads to] an evolution in violence,” said Kirk.
“Young members [of gangs] go to Mexico as tourists and are murdered,” he said, explaining that he knew of four recent murders of Canadians in Mexico known to be involved in the Canadian drug trade. “[Law enforcement agencies in Mexico] are just overwhelmed with the number of murders right now.”

Union appaers internally divided, university releases final offer
A  group of Université de Montréal (UdeM) lecturers are moving to end the strike that has frozen the university in its tracks for the past three weeks. The strike for better working conditions is being waged by over 2,000 of the lecturers colleagues.
Le Devoir reported Tuesday that a vote to renew the Syndicat des chargées et des chargés de cours de l’Université de Montréal (SCCCUM) mandate to strike will take place at its general assembly tomorrow. The meeting was called in the wake of a 200-signature petition requesting a vote to reconsider the current strike, which began on February 24.
Francis Legacé, president of SCCCUM, was dismissive of reports of a petition. He said he wasn’t sure how many people really supported ending the strike. “We didn’t receive any signatures,” he said in French. “We received a list of names. It has no legal value.”
Legacé said he was confident the general assembly would vote to continue the strike.
The same day that news of the union’s internal friction came to light, the UdeM’s administration publicly released its “final offer” in the negotiations.
The bargaining offer includes a wage increase of 3.8 per cent, less than half of the 7.7 per cent increase the union is demanding. A UdeM press release from Tuesday points out that the salary for teaching a 45-hour, three-credit course will now be $7,789.95, up nearly $300 from the previous wage. The new deal would also put UdeM lecturers’ pay on par with their counterparts at Université du Québec à Montréal, according to the press release – a claim corroborated by statistics published in Le Journal de Montréal on Monday.
SCCCUM denounced the plan officially at their “conseil syndicale” yesterday. The union objected to what they saw as the university’s refusal to address key bargaining issues. In a strongly worded address to its members that was posted online Tuesday, the union wrote in French that, “the university continues, with its ‘offer,’ to ignore lecturers’ priorities and persists in attempting to weaken their professional standing.”
The union memo does not refer to wage issues until its seventh paragraph. The authors focused on the “employer’s” refusal to acknowledge “vocal coaches and accompanists” as full-fledged lecturers, a point on which SCCCUM has insisted in negotiations. The union is also objecting to the university reserving the right to cancel classes up to two weeks before they begin, “without any penalty to the university.” Class size reductions have also been a point of contention since the negotiation’s early stages.
The lecturers’ wage demands centre on pay parity with the professors at their own university, in contrast with the administration’s position of granting the lecturers the same pay as lecturers at other Quebec schools. Legacé told The Daily that although 7.7 per cent was the current demand, he was open to changes during negotiation. “We are not dogmatic,” he said in French. “In a negotiation things can always change if something interesting is offered by the other side.”
Legacé also speculated that the university’s offer would not be as “final” as advertised.  He said that in the past, the university has tabled “final” offers, only to revoke or change them. “I don’t think this is the end for the university,” Legacé said.
The strike has already affected some 30,000 students, with classes cancelled and an extension of the winter semester looming.  Maclean’s reported that about 20 per cent of classes have been completely cancelled. Science and education faculties have been hit especially hard.
UdeM student Christine Thibeault, whose lecturers are on strike, commented that she is not worried about the semester being extended, having already participated in “lots of student strikes at CEGEP and UQAM.” Thibeault thought that students should strike in solidarity with the lecturers.
“The aim of the strike is to diminish the number of students per class, so it’s in the interest of the students,” she said in French, adding, “The more the administration is perturbed the sooner the strike will finish.”
Legacé called on students to write to the administration to demand a solution. He insisted that responsibility for the strike lies with the university. “It’s hard for students. But the university has put us in this position. It’s hard to advance in negotiations with someone who has nothing to say,” he said.

Community raises funds for relief efforts in Concepción
Since last month’s massive earthquake in central Chile, the Associación de Chilenos de Québec (ACHQ) has spearheaded the effort to connect Montrealers with their friends and families in the affected region, and has coordinated a number of relief efforts.
“We had to be creative,” said ACHQ vice president Ledda Urbani in Spanish. “There were people who still had some access to the Internet, so we had to form a chain of communication from which the details could flow little by little.”
Contact with the area has been difficult due to the breakdown of electricity, telephone lines, and road networks since the earthquake rocked Chile in the early morning of February 27.
Measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale, the three-minute earthquake was the seventh strongest ever recorded, and the strongest since 2004’s Indian Ocean earthquake. It has caused widespread devastation in the country’s second largest city, Concepción, and the surrounding area. The number of confirmed deaths currently stands at over 700.
Urbani said the most important problem is currently reconstruction, as “500,000 houses have been destroyed and two million people  [have been] left without a roof.”
ACHQ has planned a series of events ranging from folklore shows to club nights to fund Chile’s National Office for Emergencies and the Chilean Red Cross.
“The volume of the damage has left people without jobs, schools, or health services,” said Urbani.
Nicole Collier, a U1 Sociology student at McGill who has lived in Chile with her family since 2005, was in a suburb of Santiago during and after the earthquake. She described the situation as surreal, stating that although “most of the damage was in [Concepción], there were clues of destruction everywhere: broken light bulbs, cracks in the pavement.”
Collier described a trip to the supermarket the following day as “a typical end-of-the-world movie scene where everyone is running for supplies.”
Chilean president Michelle Bachelet declared a state of emergency in response to the quake, which was followed by a series of aftershocks and a tsunami warning for much of the Pacific coast.
Nelson Odeja, president of ACHQ, said that Bachelet handled the situation responsibly and competently. “Things are much better, though there are still problems at the epicentre” said Odeja in Spanish. “Not of a lack of [basic goods], but problems of sheer destruction, problems of getting things to those who need them.”
He extended deep thanks to the Quebec community for the support it has given the organization, while calling attention to the ongoing aftermath of Haiti’s earthquake earlier this year. “We need to harmonize coordination; this isn’t about absorbing or polarizing attention from Haiti.”
Odeja added that Chile is well-prepared for such natural disasters, partly due to their frequency.
Rex Brynen, a professor in McGill’s political science department, stated in an email that “there will be major long-term reconstruction costs, but Chile’s relatively high gross national product per capita means that it wouldn’t qualify for assistance from many aid agencies.”
Brynen added that “the impact of natural disasters is always shaped not only by the disaster itself but the social, political, and economic context within which it occurs.”
According to NASA, Chile’s earthquake shortened the day by approximately one-millionth of a second, and shifted the earth’s axis by eight centimetres.

Campaign violations rooted in Facebook, alcohol
The most hotly contested SSMU elections in recent memory might also be the most bizarre. With polls scheduled to close today, candidates are juggling campaign violations, accusations of prejudiced Facebook profile photos, and, in one case, physical violence.
Presidential candidates Stefan Link and Sarah Woolf have been slapped with censures from Elections McGill for a variety of violations. Woolf was censured after Elections McGill chief electoral officer Mike Vallo was informed that Woolf’s campaign site and YouTube videos were online at 11 a.m. Tuesday – two hours after the deadline for the removal of campaign materials. Link was also censured for leaving his Facebook group and YouTube videos online after the 9 a.m. deadline.
Vallo sees Link’s recent violation as proof that the presidential candidate did not actually know the election regulations. “I still don’t think…he’s intentionally breaking the bylaws as much as he can. He just doesn’t know the bylaws,” Vallo said.
Link deleted himself as administrator of his Facebook page, rather than taking the page down. Facebook groups without administrators can remain online indefinitely.
VP (Clubs and Services) candidate Anushay Khan has had similar problems. Khan said she logged onto Facebook recently and was surprised to find that she had somehow been deleted as administrator of her own group. She has since removed all content from the group, though it remains online.
In addition to his online violations, a memo from Elections McGill also attributed Link’s censure to his “persistent disregard for the bylaws.” Last week, members of Link’s campaign violated bylaws by writing his name in chalk and handing out campaign flyers outside the McLennan Library.
SSMU electoral bylaws forbid flyering outdoors, as well as the display of campaign materials outdoors.
In response, Link pointed to discrepancies between the online version of Elections McGill’s bylaws and the hard copies given to candidates. Vallo acknowledged that the online version of the bylaws are outdated and limit candidates to 400 posters, while the updated hard copies given to candidates limit them to 200.
Vallo added that Link is not alone in his lack of familiarity with the bylaws. “The overwhelming majority [of candidates] did not read the bylaws at all…and then were surprised when they got in trouble,” he said.
Vallo said that Woolf has adhered to election bylaws throughout the campaign period, with the exception of her recent violations. “She’s run a really clean campaign so far,” Vallo said.
Link has said that he is convinced the bylaws limit voter turnout and awareness of the election among students.
Keeping things under wraps
Campaign violations are not the only thing troubling candidates in the final stretches of the election.
Presidential candidate Zach Newburgh has had to explain a Facebook profile photo that shows him wearing a scarf wrapped around his head and holding a knife. One commenter expressed concern that Newburgh appeared to be “mocking Arabs and/or Muslims.”
Newburgh said that he is wearing “Moroccan dress” in the photo, which he has removed from his profile.
Woolf said the image could undermine Newburgh’s promises to promote dialogue between polarized communities. “I think that it certainly shows a serious lack of good judgment,” Woolf said. “But it is especially disappointing coming from a candidate who has based his campaign on building bridges,” she added.
The photo has been sent to The Daily by both students and a McGill alumna.
Newburgh referred to the photo as “a joke that was taken way too far.” He also emphasized his track record as president of Hillel Montreal, where he says he has stood for diplomacy among disparate groups.
“I have always stood for dialogue and always stood for bridge-building,” Newburgh said, pointing to his work with Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights. “I am absolutely, without question, sorry if I offended anyone in any way as a result of a joke that really went too far.”
Link had not seen the photo. Presidential candidate Trip Yang had seen the photo but declined to comment.
The gloves come off
An unidentified person punched Link in the stomach while he was campaigning in Gerts this past Friday.
He believes it was a response to the strength of his campaign. “We were gaining a lot of support in the bar that night,” he explained, adding that he is convinced he will win the election.
Link dismissed the possibility that the attack was a random act of violence. “There is no way [the attacker] was just drunk and violent. That’s not a possibility,” he said.
Initially, Link denied that other candidates were involved in the attack. When questioned further, he speculated that Woolf may have enlisted someone to attack him. “The person who did it was Asian, so it kind of makes it look like she would be the least likely person,” he said, adding, “If you want to cover something up, that’s a good way to do it.”
According to Link, people would likely attribute the attack to Yang’s campaign team, because Yang has “a lot of Oriental [sic] support.”
Yang called the speculation “ridiculous.”
The next night, Link was spotted at Verdun venue Clap Trap, where he says he was invited on stage by performers. Vallo explained that campaigning off campus would constitute a serious bylaw infraction. However, he has been unable to corroborate the story. “Most of [the people present] said they were too drunk to tell me what happened,” Vallo said.
Link said he cannot clearly remember the evening’s events. “I was actually drinking alcohol and I can’t tell you exactly what it is that I said,” he explained.
Election results will be announced this evening in Gerts.

Community programs cut despite $65.9 million in federal budget for aboriginal health
The 2010 federal budget  has cancelled funding to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF), a national non-profit that finances 134 aboriginal support services across the country. Funding for the community-based programs will come to an end on March 31, when available funds are expected to run out.
On Sunday, the Native Women’s Shelter of Montreal (NWSM) held a policy meeting with Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff to call on the federal government to reinstate its support for the AHF. The shelter depends on the AHF for funding.
“We have been receiving funds from the AHF for the last 10 years, and it goes toward our healing program, and the basics, a roof over the head and food to eat…A lot of people [are] out of work, and we are going to be grasping at straws now to try to meet the needs of the women,” said Nakuset, the shelter’s executive director.
Nakuset also said that the shelter will now have to cut the positions of sexual assault counsellor, program coordinator, and clinical supervisor.
“It is quite devastating; we have an art therapist that comes in on a weekly basis, a psychologist, and psychotherapist who is Mohawk. People over the last decade have come to depend on our services for more than just the basics,” Nakuset added.
Women community leaders from across Montreal, Ignatieff, and Liberal MP Justin Trudeau attended the policy meeting to express their support for the shelter and AHF.
“At the moment when aboriginal women and aboriginal families are under maximum pressure, increased pressure in an economic downturn, it is the worst possible time to cut funding to these healing centres that provide so much good,” said Ignatieff.
He added that working with the Conservative government is extremely different, and that co-operation on its part is the exception, not the rule.
“These groups depend on public money. We don’t think it’s appropriate for them to have to go begging to private sources…. We think these institutions perform public services; they protect women, they shelter women, they help women, and they deserve public support,” added Ignatieff.
According to Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs spokesperson Margot Geduld, the federal government has allocated $65.9 million over two years for aboriginal health programs to be distributed by Health Canada. The federal budget also allocates $199 million for the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.
The federal program provides former residential school students with a lump sum payment of $10,000 for the first school year plus $3,000 for each subsequent year they spent in the residential school system. Students who suffered serious physical and sexual abuses may apply for additional compensation.
Geduld would not comment on why funding to the AHF was not renewed this year, though she thanked the foundation for providing support to aboriginal peoples and said that officials had met with the AHF to discuss moving forward.
Terri Normandin, the shelter’s sexual assault counsellor, said that the federal budget did not specify how the allocated funds would be distributed, and that it remained unclear whether existing programs would receive any support.
She added that she was surprised that the funding was cut considering the magnitude of the trauma caused by the residential school system.
“It may be from the past, but when you look at the social issues we are dealing with, we have a loss of cultural identity, poor self esteem, a lot of health issues, addiction, a lot of domestic violence. The whole thing is inter-generational trauma…years and years of habits that we were starting to help with, issues that are not laid to rest,” said Normandin.
The NWSM sent an open letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper Tuesday to demand the renewal of funds for the AHF.
AHF communications director Wayne Spear said the foundation is prepared to support the transition of 11 healing centres and other programs.
“We will continue to inform the government of the work we are doing and our research and experience. We’ve been clear that there is five years of truth and reconciliation work, mental health counselling, and support for survivors that are needed. We’ve also said that there are a lot of unreached communities, and that communities with service are still early on in this work,” said Spear.

The meeting was called in the wake of a 200-signature petition requesting a vote to reconsider the current strike, which began on February 24.
Francis Legacé, president of SCCCUM, was dismissive of reports of a petition. He said he wasn’t sure how many people really supported ending the strike. “We didn’t receive any signatures,” he said in French. “We received a list of names. It has no legal value.”
Legacé said he was confident the general assembly would vote to continue the strike.
The same day that news of the union’s internal friction came to light, the UdeM’s administration publicly released its “final offer” in the negotiations.
The bargaining offer includes a wage increase of 3.8 per cent, less than half of the 7.7 per cent increase the union is demanding. A UdeM press release from Tuesday points out that the salary for teaching a 45-hour, three-credit course will now be $7,789.95, up nearly $300 from the previous wage. The new deal would also put UdeM lecturers’ pay on par with their counterparts at Université du Québec à Montréal, according to the press release – a claim corroborated by statistics published in Le Journal de Montréal on Monday.
SCCCUM denounced the plan officially at their “conseil syndicale” yesterday. The union objected to what they saw as the university’s refusal to address key bargaining issues. In a strongly worded address to its members that was posted online Tuesday, the union wrote in French that, “the university continues, with its ‘offer,’ to ignore lecturers’ priorities and persists in attempting to weaken their professional standing.”
The union memo does not refer to wage issues until its seventh paragraph. The authors focused on the “employer’s” refusal to acknowledge “vocal coaches and accompanists” as full-fledged lecturers, a point on which SCCCUM has insisted in negotiations. The union is also objecting to the university reserving the right to cancel classes up to two weeks before they begin, “without any penalty to the university.” Class size reductions have also been a point of contention since the negotiation’s early stages.
The lecturers’ wage demands centre on pay parity with the professors at their own university, in contrast with the administration’s position of granting the lecturers the same pay as lecturers at other Quebec schools. Legacé told The Daily that although 7.7 per cent was the current demand, he was open to changes during negotiation. “We are not dogmatic,” he said in French. “In a negotiation things can always change if something interesting is offered by the other side.”
Legacé also speculated that the university’s offer would not be as “final” as advertised.  He said that in the past, the university has tabled “final” offers, only to revoke or change them. “I don’t think this is the end for the university,” Legacé said.
The strike has already affected some 30,000 students, with classes cancelled and an extension of the winter semester looming.  Maclean’s reported that about 20 per cent of classes have been completely cancelled. Science and education faculties have been hit especially hard.
UdeM student Christine Thibeault, whose lecturers are on strike, commented that she is not worried about the semester being extended, having already participated in “lots of student strikes at CEGEP and UQAM.” Thibeault thought that students should strike in solidarity with the lecturers.
“The aim of the strike is to diminish the number of students per class, so it’s in the interest of the students,” she said in French, adding, “The more the administration is perturbed the sooner the strike will finish.”
Legacé called on students to write to the administration to demand a solution. He insisted that responsibility for the strike lies with the university. “It’s hard for students. But the university has put us in this position. It’s hard to advance in negotiations with someone who has nothing to say,” he said.
