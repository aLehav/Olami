Motion to create corporate responsibility committee passes without Palestine reference
The Winter 2010 General Assembly (GA) approved five motions on Wednesday, mandating that SSMU divest from the tar sands, support a cap on ancillary fees at McGill, restore $5 ATMs, create a corporate social responsibility committee (CSR) to oversee McGill investments, and take an active policy against the self-funded tuition model. A motion originally banning pro-life groups from campus failed, in spite of numerous proposed amendments.
While several SSMU councillors said they were happy that all motions were discussed and that the GA maintained quorum, some were less pleased by the actual debate. SSMU VP (Clubs & Services) Sarah Olle said that she was “upset by the lack of constructive dialogue that was had and I think our community, as demonstrated today, is just incredibly divided about issues external to the University, and I wish that people could focus more on the university experience itself and bringing people together.”
Arts Senator Sarah Woolf described the GA’s proceedings as “messy,” and was “disgusted and depressed with how the beginning of the GA went,” but added that the structure is constantly being improved, and was pleased that students stayed to see every motion through. “I don’t think this is the death knell of the GA,” she said.
At its peak, the GA exceeded the capacity of the Shatner cafeteria, with over 600 students present. The CSR motion, which referred to the the occupied Palestinian territories in its preamble, contributed to the sizable turnout, but also prompted Speaker Zach Newburgh to issue warnings to students about adhering to decorum soon after the call to order.
Twenty minutes into procedure, the GA was bombarded with complaints about the inability to hear speakers, repeated calls for decorum, and motions to reconsider almost every decision made, leading to a record five-hour duration.
Before debate could begin, the agenda was amended to move the CSR motion to the top of the docket. After Khaled K, the motion’s author and an executive for Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights – McGill (SPHR), spoke in favour of the motion, an amendment was passed to strike two clauses in the motion’s introduction.
The clauses specified that McGill has ties to “organizations that engage in and profit from unethical practices including but not limited to profiting from the unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”
Debate quickly became heated during discussion of the amendment and the motion; one student was asked to put away their Israeli flag while another accused Newburgh of a conflict of interest as SSMU speaker, because he is president of Hillel Montreal and his roommate is president of Hillel McGill.
An inability to estimate majority decisions during discussions of the amendment led to an hour and a half of inaction as various votes were counted to strike clauses, and then to reconsider the decision to strike. Debate resumed, and after a failed attempt to adjourn the GA altogether, a simple majority vote passed the motion, without reference to occupied Palestine.
Prior to the GA, the Facebook account of a member of SPHR was hacked, and a message was sent to members of SPHR’s GA event claiming that voting had moved online, including a link to Elections McGill. SPHR coordinators and SSMU executives took immediate action to correct the misunderstanding.
The motion against McGill adopting a self-funded tuition model was moved by SSMU VP (External) Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan.
During his motivation speech, Ronderos-Morgan pointed to other Canadian universities’ substantial tuition increases, and saw McGill’s attempt toward a self-funded model as a sign that they were making a “serious statement about what it sees as means necessary to balance the budget.”
The motion passed, quickly followed by a motion to reinstitute $5 ATMs on campus, and a motion demanding SSMU’s refusal to accept mandatory ancillary fees. Both were debated for several minutes.
A motion calling for SSMU to investigate investments with ties to tar sands in Alberta was passed by a simple majority, despite debate about the economic feasibility of the motion and a failed amendment which would have eliminated references to the financial institutions with ties to the tar sands. SSMU currently owns over $230,000 in bonds with the Royal Bank of Canada, which finances tar sands projects. SSMU councillor Joël Pednault recommended SSMU move its investments to banks like Desjardins, which does not finance such projects.
The final motion, on banning discriminatory groups on campus, was led by statements from authors Maddie Ritts and Liam Olson-Mayes explaining their choice to single out pro-life groups, stating that they are necessarily discriminatory and that “by allowing pro-life groups, we condone and accept their position,” and targeting the Silent No More campaign. After extensive debate and votes on multiple amendments, including one to strike direct reference to pro-life groups in the resolution, the entire resolution failed to pass.

New policy is too vague on ethics, according to student representatives
The absence of restrictions on potentially harmful research in the new Regulations on Conduct of Research policy continued to raise concerns in Senate on Wednesday.
The new policy was originally up for approval at Wednesday’s Senate meeting, but due to an administrative oversight, the policy was only briefly discussed. McGill Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations) Denis Thérien explained that the Academic Policy Committee must approve the policy before it is brought to Senate, which had not been done yet.
“I think it’s unfortunate because…the policy is ready to be adopted right now and every month that goes by without having a document like this is dangerous [and] is not good for the University. We need this to come in force as soon as possible,” Thérien said.
There was a general consensus among the administration and senators that the new policy adequately addresses some, but not all, of the problems that arose when the first draft was brought to Senate in November.
“The removal of the clause on anonymity as well as the addition of [the reference to] social responsibility into the preamble is definitely an improvement on the document that was previously brought up,” Rebecca Dooley, SSMU VP (University Affairs), said. “[The new policy does] address some of the concerns that were brought forward by students [at the last Senate].”
During Senate discussions on the policy, Sarah Woolf, SSMU Arts senator, pointed out that the new policy will be replacing the Policy on Research Ethics and the Regulations on Research Policy, and therefore should include more specifications on ethical standards.
“The policy does refer to a research ethics board. However, to the best of my knowledge, the board is generally concerned with the welfare to the immediate human or animal subjects, rather than the potential societal and ethical outcomes of research,” Woolf said. “Despite the extent of the articulation of ethics, the revised version of the policy does not provide guidance to what this ethical standard might be.”
Thérien and others on the team that is drafting the new policy did not address Woolf’s concerns.
Richard Janda, Faculty of Law senator and law professor, also believes the policy still needs to be strengthened in order to prevent potentially harmful applications of research conducted at McGill.
“Just as we have ethical review of research on human subjects…I think that we can ask those kinds of questions [for any research]. Particularly, I believe we should ask those kinds of questions when the sources of money that are being given for research are not peer-reviewed granting councils,” Janda said.
Prior to the Senate meeting, the new policy was reviewed and discussed at the Research Advisory Council (RAC), which was formerly the Research Policy Committee. The RAC is composed of representatives from all faculties, associate deans, representatives from Thérien’s office, and student representatives.
According to a post-doctoral representative in the RAC, who wished to remain anonymous, the RAC attempted to develop a clause to regulate research with potentially harmful applications. “There was an effort made by a number of committee members to come up with a better clause. But in the time we had, we couldn’t come up with better wording,” she said.
The post-doctoral representative was disappointed that they did not have sufficient time to discuss and develop an appropriate clause. She felt that the representatives from Thérien’s office had a strong influence in the discussion and had clearly set objectives.
Cleve Higgins, organizer with Demilitarize McGill, argued that in fact, having these regulations in place are in the interest of McGill and its administration.
“I think it is important for McGill to institutionally deal with this issue, and in that way there doesn’t need to be a campaign against the University or against the researcher every time the research is connected to harmful application,” said Higgins.

Scientists slam province for hazardous exports
Over 100 doctors and scientists from around the world have drafted a letter to Premier Jean Charest urging Quebec to stop the export of asbestos to developing nations. The letter was issued in late January, shortly before the premier left on a trade mission to India, the largest importer of Quebec-made asbestos.
The Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA), which sponsored the letter, cited statistics from Quebec that show that asbestos-related diseases remain a major threat to public health in the province.
“The Quebec Workers’ Compensation Board shows that 60 per cent of occupational deaths were caused by asbestos…. This gives a total of 612 new cases of asbestos-related disease in Quebec in 2004,” wrote CANSA in the letter.
Linda Reinstein, co-founder and executive director of the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization noted that the figures were inaccurately low. “Large numbers of deaths caused by asbestos-related cancers and cardiac arrest are not properly attributed to asbestos,” she said.
The majority of all asbestos produced in Quebec is exported to developing nations, where regulations on their usage are generally absent. “It’s sad to see workers in developing countries dying of preventable disease,” said Reinstein. “People in developing nations need money desperately, corporations take advantage of this, and workers end up working with asbestos in compromising conditions with no protection.”
According to the Canadian Press, Charest was questioned on the issue during a press conference in Delhi. He responded that his government has no control over asbestos exports.
Canada is the second largest producer and exporter of chrysotile asbestos in the world, and the majority of Canadian asbestos mines are located in Quebec. In 2002 Quebec’s Ministry of Natural Resources adopted a policy encouraging “municipalities to increase their use of products containing chrysotile.”
Kathleen Ruff of the Rideau Institute on International Affairs commented that asbestos use has, however, declined in the province.
“There is no legal ban. But except for in towns like Asbestos [Quebec] where asbestos is even used in pavement, there has been a large decrease in asbestos use. Quebec is removing asbestos from schools and workplaces, as once it is in place it is a problem for decades,” said Ruff.
The letter criticized Quebec for having a double standard toward asbestos exposure.
“We find it shocking that the exposure level you endorse for people overseas is 10 times higher than the level permitted by…other Western industrialized countries…. We applaud your government for seeking thus to protect Quebec workers from asbestos harm. We call on you to show equal concern for the lives of workers in the developing world” the letter read.
The industry, however, claims that if used properly, asbestos is not harmful. The Chrysotile Institute, founded in 1985, is a joint initiative by the federal government of Canada and the government of Quebec. According to Clément Godbout, the president of the institute, it “receives 60 per cent of its funding from the provincial and federal governments and the remaining 40 per cent from industry.”
Godbout also stressed that the institute’s mandate “is not to promote chrysotile itself, but merely to promote the safe and responsible usage of it.” The institute has said that chrysotile is safe for use if air contamination levels are kept below one fibre per cubic centimetre.
Godbout commented that a person working in an environment that maintains those standards, even over a long period of time, is subject to “a very low risk, certainly no more than that of the average worker in another industry.” To the anti-asbestos groups he said, “show us research that proves there is significantly high risk for our standard of one fibre per cubic centimetre. To my knowledge I haven’t seen any scientific reports or proof yet.”
In reference to the countries that import Quebec’s asbestos, Godbout said, “The information on safe use is available and we encourage them to use it. The small enterprises that don’t adhere to the safety standards should be shut down.”
In response to these claims, CANSA has stated in a press release, “The [World Health Organization]…and the fifty countries who have banned chrysotile asbestos, state that there is no safe exposure level for chrysotile asbestos.”
CANSA also stressed that the lack of awareness abroad is supported by the province’s attitude toward its use. They also criticized the asbestos industry for attempting to silence anti-asbestos science, citing various lawsuits and attempts at intimidation.
“The asbestos industry has tried to represent asbestos as a political issue of Quebec culture and pride,” said Ruff. She added that at the October 2006 UN Rotterdam Convention, Charest’s government successfully lobbied Canada to block the addition of chrysotile asbestos to the UN’s hazardous substances list.
McGill principal Heather Munroe-Blum accompanied Charest as part of his delegation. On February 6, Munroe-Blum and Charest presented at a high-profile sustainable development summit in Delhi.

Mendelson and first-year francophone advisor say students want to improve English
The Commission on Francophone Affairs (CAF) recently finalized a proposal to be presented to the Principal’s Task Force on Diversity, Excellence, and Community Engagement.
The CAF is the SSMU body responsible for promoting francophone culture and rights at McGill. 
The proposal addresses the “University’s disconnect from its immediate population, namely the province of Quebec.” It suggests that the University offer a majority of 200-level courses in French as well as English. It also proposes that a third of professors hired demonstrate French-language competence.
However, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson felt many francophone students wanted to take courses in English. “Many francophones who come to McGill come here because they want to improve their English,” he said.
Citing his experience as a McGill professor, Mendelson added that “typically, very few students exercise that right [to submit work and exams in French].”
Manon Lemelin, the first-year assistant for francophone students, also questioned the need for French-language 200-level courses.
 She said that the francophone students she meets with tell her they enrol at McGill to “to learn and perfect their English.”
Isabelle Daunais, director of undergraduate studies at the Département de langue et littérature françaises, suggested that departments should make their own  decisions regarding language of instruction.
“[I] rarely hear students complain about the lack of French-language courses in other departments. [For students in our department, attending classes in English] is a special challenge worth taking on.”
Others were thrilled by the CAF’s proposal.
“I think it’s a very good idea,” said Marion Vergues, a French professor at the English and French Language Centre.
But Vergues expressed concerns that the level of language would need to be lowered for non-francophone students taking classes in French.
Vergues suggested solving this problem by integrating a language-learning component into  French-language courses for non-francophones. “The English and French Language Centre would be the best-positioned [unit] to develop this kind of inter-faculty relationship,” she added.
As for hiring French-speaking professors, Mendelson said language is not a priority. Explaining that McGill is a “world class university,” Mendelson said faculties try to recruit the best possible professors – based on their qualifications, the quality of their research, and their teaching abilities.
“We’re trying to serve students as well as our resources permit,” Mendelson added.
Mendelson explained that current priorities are the translation of important information and documents like the Handbook on Student Rights and Responsibilities, and ensuring that everyone can hand in work and exams in French. 
This year, McGill is offering French-language beginning- and intermediate-level courses in the Canadian studies, political science, electrical engineering, and earth and planetary sciences programs, as well as in the Faculty of Education.

Indigenous women’s activist Rachel-Alouki Labbé sheds light on domestic violence in aboriginal communities
Since 1980, it is estimated that as many as 3,000 indigenous women have been murdered or gone missing in Canada. According to the grassroots advocacy group, Missing Justice, these cases remain largely unsolved – of the 520 official cases on record, more than 300 are still open. Additionally, in Canada, indigenous women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence than any other group of people. This Sunday will mark the first time that the Memorial March for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women  –  an event that began in Vancouver in 1991 and now takes place in cities across the country – will take place in Montreal. A panel discussion on the injustices faced by indigenous Canadian women will also be held on Thursday, February 11. Rachel-Alouki Labbé, an Abenaki filmmaker and activist, sat down with The Daily to discuss the complex issues surrounding violence against women in indigenous communities.
The McGill Daily: Why do cases of violence against indigenous women go unsolved?
Rachel-Alouki Labbé: Because the Gendarmerie royale du Canada [GRC or RCMP] just don’t care. They’re so used to seeing us in a violent way, so they think we don’t care, and they don’t care. They don’t follow up. They don’t take it as if it were important, like it were someone from their community.
I have friends in Winnipeg that were involved in a domestic problem – a couple. She told the police, and they didn’t think it was true. They thought she was a liar. She almost died. There are a lot of cases like that, and unfortunately [the authorities] don’t pay attention.
MD: Could you talk about what is being done to empower women in indigenous communities?
RAL: We have maisons d’hébergement [safe houses] outside the communities – close to 11 or 12 here in Quebec. Women know now that they can go out of the community to be safe, with their children. If they stay in the community, the problem is nobody will talk, and also often it’s the uncle or the husband [who is committing the violence]. Now they are going out of the community, and the women who take care of them are indigenous too.
 But also, there are a lot of circles of women that meet now once a week so they can talk. We show films now, and when they see that, they realize that [what is depicted] is the same story [they experienced], so they start to talk.
MD: Could you talk about your work in film, and how you came to see film as a tool for problem solving and change?
RAL: We began with N’a qu’un oeil, a film that aims to educate about domestic violence. It [went] around to the communities, and to conferences. It works. It’s not very fast, and we still have violence. But you have women who didn’t know [something] was violence, and [after seeing the film] they know.
MD: You’ve made a film about the femicide issue in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. What connections did you see between missing and murdered indigenous women in Mexico and in Canada?
RAL: We are sisters. When I talk to people here, they don’t know what’s going on there. They only know that we can go to Mexico and lay on the beach and have a good time. When you start to talk about femicide, the gangs, the drug cartels, what happens to these women, [people] don’t know.
I decided to go there to show [the situation], that these women are almost all aboriginal women from the south – poor women.
The problem [in Mexico] is the same as here – they just don’t care, they don’t want to resolve the problems because [they say], “These are just aboriginal women. Why should we spend money to find out who killed these women?” It began to be very easy to kill women there.
MD: What do you think is needed from the Canadian government in order to stop violence against indigenous women?
RAL: First, they have to listen. They have to be involved in the problem. They don’t listen and they don’t look and they don’t want to know because it’s not good for Canada. In Canada everywhere you go, people think they are taking good care of aboriginal people, and this is not true at all. If we could show everyone around the world about [violence against indigenous women], Canada wouldn’t be the best place in the world to live. I think [the government] wants to keep their rank. They have to listen to us. If we decide to make a film, they have to show it. Sometimes they don’t, because it’s not good for the image. So I think things have to change, of course, but it’s not only aboriginal women who have to change it, it’s [everyone] together.
MD: Have you seen changes to the condition of indigenous women in recent years? In what ways?
RAL: I see improvements. When I was younger, it was worse, because women weren’t talking about [violence]. Now, we have social workers, and [many of them] are aboriginal. Since 20 years ago, we have made a lot of [progress]. But the violence is so extreme. Sometimes you go to a community and it’s more than 87 per cent [who have experienced] violence against women and children, and sexual abuse. We have a lot of work to do. We are still dying of it. We all have someone we know who went to the hospital [because of violence]. This is not normal.
If we could all come back to our traditional thinking, sometimes…Of course we are in 2010, but just think about our soul, how we were before. Because we are forgetting that we are aboriginal, and we are part of the earth. I wish we could think about what and who we were, all the peace we had. [Violence] is not the way of thinking of the aboriginal people.

Student appeals to McGill, PGSS for help
McGill post-doctoral fellow Virginie Dormoy was forced to pay over $5,000 in tax returns when the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rejected her student status and refused to recognize her post-doctoral fellowship as non-taxable. The CRA also revoked the universal childcare benefits that Dormoy should have received for her child had her fellowship not been taxed.
Dormoy’s problems began when she forgot to submit her T2022A – a form issued by McGill that attests to a fellow’s student status, though there is no guarantee the CRA will recognize it. She was contacted by the CRA in December, at which point she sent it in her form only to have it rejected.
“They told me they wouldn’t accept my form. They said I was not a full-time student because I’m not in an academic program that leads to a diploma,” Dormoy said. “Due to this incident, I had to pay $7,000, which includes losing my GST tax rebate and my child tax benefit.”
According to Dormoy, the CRA officer who had contacted her, Michel Detourneau, refused to negotiate her student status and said that the decision was final.
Detourneau declined The Daily’s request to comment on Dormoy’s case.
There are approximately 650 post-doctoral fellows at McGill, whose fellowship stipends are on average worth $38,000 per year.
“Revenue Canada chose to treat me differently from other post-doctoral fellows despite the fact that I submitted the same forms, and I have not received any support from McGill,” she said.
Both Dormoy’s supervisor, Imed Gallouzi, associate professor in biochemistry, and David Thomas, chair of thebiochemistry department, have written letters on her behalf to Martin Kreiswirth, dean of graduate and post-doctoral Studies, to ask for his help and support.
In response, Kreiswirth recently wrote a letter to the CRA on Dormoy’s behalf affirming that she is duly registered with the University and that the post-doctoral fellow is undergoing advanced academic training.
However, the letter is the extent to which Kreiswirth is able to help Dormoy.
“As an individual’s tax status is a personal matter and may be affected by numerous personal factors…McGill has advised that any post-doctoral fellow who has been assessed by Revenue Canada must seek professional assistance…regarding [her] particular tax file,” Kreiswirth wrote in an email to The Daily.
Due to the lack of initiative from McGill, Dormoy sought the help of the Postgraduate Student Society of McGill (PGSS).
According to Ladan Mahabadi, VP (External) of PGSS, the issue is complicated by the lack of agreement among Canadian universities. For example, the University of Toronto and University of Alberta do not consider their post-doctoral fellows as students and do not issue the T2022A tax slips.
Mahabadi explained that it is PGSS’ goal to help Dormoy and to use any resources available to them.
“We’re trying to challenge the [CRA’s] decision and potentially seek legal advice on what the next step should be. We’re also trying to gather support from the [McGill] administration and other post-doctoral fellows on campus and across Montreal,” Mahabadi said.
Matthew Milner, a PGSS post-doctoral representative, argued that this issue goes beyond taxes and income.
“It doesn’t come down to taxes at all. It’s either we get benefits as students and we can exercise them, one of which is the tax exemption; or we’re employees and we get other benefits like retirement pension and medical benefits,” Milner said.
On the other hand, Olivier Beaulieu-Mathurin, president of the National Graduate Council of the Quebec Federation of University Students (CNCS-FEUQ), flatly stated that post-doctoral fellows should be considered as students.
“Post-docs should be considered as students because they are undergoing training. In fact, at some universities, they do receive a document at the end of their fellowship which acknowledges their completion,” Beaulieu-Mathurin said.
There was consensus among the student representatives that CRA should not be interfering with university affairs.
“The CRA is evidently skewing the interpretation of the tax act. In the tax act, the university, which is a chartered institution of a province, has the right to define who its students are…. CRA is a federal agency and it is trying to trample in an area of provincial jurisdiction,” Milner said.
Student representatives are weary of the effects that this case could have on the financial security of current and future post-doctoral fellows.
“By setting this precedent, what’s to stop CRA from getting students to pay them retroactively without warning? Where’s the safeguard? It is likely that prospective post-doctoral fellows might be deterred from coming to McGill because of this,” Mahabadi said.
According to Kreiswirth, McGill is currently advocating this issue at many levels.
“McGill is participating with the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies and the Association des doyens des études supérieures au Québec to reinforce our belief that fellowship stipends for post-doctoral fellows are eligible for the educational deduction,” Kreiswirth wrote.

Café Cleopatra fights City expropriation and eco-friendly office project
Plans for the redevelopment of St. Laurent and Ste. Catherine have paused while local strip club Café Cleopatra challenges a City-ordered expropriation in court.
Café Cleopatra is the last occupied building on the western side of St. Laurent between Ste. Catherine and René Lévesque, where the Societé de developpement Angus (SDA) is slated to build a 12-storey office tower – the Quadrilatère St. Laurent – to house Hydro-Québec offices as well as green, sustainable retail space.
Since Café Cleopatra’s October 2009 notice of expropriation, SDA has acquired the block’s remaining buildings, including Main Importing, the oldest Middle Eastern grocers in Canada, and the Montreal Pool Room, a hot dog restaurant. However, the court case has paused the demolition of the block, which was scheduled to begin on January 1.
While the outcome of Café Cleopatra’s case remains unclear, Viviane Namasté, a professor at Concordia’s Simone de Beauvoir Institute and member of the Save the Main coalition, which works for the preservation of lower St. Laurent, said it could determine the future of SDA’s project.
“[The case] could put some wrenches in the plans and there are some strong legal arguments to be made against the expropriation,” Namasté said.
Éric Paradis, president of Save the Main, runs “Club Sin,” a long running, popular fetish event at Café Cleopatra. He questioned the logic of constructing the Quadrilatère St. Laurent, which has been promoted as an eco-friendly redesign of the street.
“Our city disregards counterculture. They don’t give a damn. They’d rather have a 12-storey office tower…. It’s alternative art being given the boot,” Paradis said.
Café Cleopatra owner Johnny Zoumboulakis has also been an open critic of the way the City handled the redevelopment plan. He pointed out that no open bid was held for the redevelopment. Rather, Montreal Mayor Gerard Tremblay’s administration approached SDA privately before presenting the plans to the public.
“It’s a puzzle why Angus was given so many projects without any public consultations or open bids,” Zoumboulakis said.
Public consultations were held by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) in May 2009, but some activists, local businesses, and urban planning experts felt that its recommendations were not implemented.
Namasté felt that many recommendations made during the OCPM consultations did not go “far enough,” though they did caution the City to take more time with the redevelopment project.
“The City, in my view, didn’t decide to slow down,” Namasté said. “When they decided to send a notice of expropriation to Café Cleopatra, that had to be voted on at municipal council. But they didn’t have at that point a clear mock-up of what the project would be.”

Muslim Students Association calls for apology
An email regarding security at club events has some students accusing administrators of prejudice, SSMU execs calling for a reformed policy on room bookings, and the administration insisting the whole thing was a misunderstanding.
In an email sent on February 2, McGill events administrator Debbie Yacoulis asked SSMU VP (Clubs and Services) Sarah Olle to provide advance warning of any events held by QPIRG, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), and the Muslim Students’ Association (MSA). Yacoulis claimed that advance time was needed to grant these groups security clearance for their events.
Olle forwarded the email to members of the three organizations mentioned. The message came as a surprise to the MSA. The group is currently drafting a request for a formal apology.
“Our events are never controversial and we never have problems. Most of our events are [attended by] Muslims coming for more knowledge,” said Anais Massot, VP (External) for the MSA.
Massot has been with the MSA for three years and could not recall any group events where extra security was needed.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson explained that the email did not reflect University policy, which mandates that security needs are to be determined on an event-by-event basis
“I don’t see it as being an issue; I see it as being a mistake,” Mendelson said.
Yacoulis emailed Olle after learning that the MSA planned to host a lecture entitled “The Essentials of Islamic Knowledge and Practice.”
Olle is familiar with the University’s event-by-event policy and said that the email from Yacoulis was confusing.
“It’s always been on a per event basis, which I think is a good system because you can’t assume that just because a group is a certain group, its events will be a certain way,” Olle said.
Jim Nicell, McGill’s Associate Vice-Principal (University Services), echoed Mendelson’s statement, reaffirming the University’s per event security policy.
“The message that was delivered was incorrect and did not represent in any way the position of this University in the way that we deal with events,” Nicell said.
Khaled Kteily, SPHR VP (Membership and Development) believed the three groups were singled out because of their pro-Palestinian stances on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
“The only commonality that I can see here is that these [three] organizations are supportive of what is happening in Palestine,” Kteily said.
Massot saw a similar trend. “SPHR is pro-Palestinian, QPIRG does a lot of events that are [pro-Palestinian]…and we’re Muslim, so I guess we fall into that category as well,” she said.
Anna Malla, QPIRG’s internal coordinator, was upset but not particularly surprised upon reading the email.
“I know that we do get profiled to a certain degree, but the degree to which this is a situation of actual racial profiling of speakers really shocked me. They specifically have been flagging events that have Palestinian speakers,” Malla said.
Rebecca Dooley, VP (University Affairs) indicated that other groups have been profiled by the administration. Dooley described a “human tunnel” of security guards at the Senate meeting where the university’s research policy was discussed. The issue attracted students opposed to military research on campus. Dooley said the increased security presence was likely brought in to restrain these students.
“They weren’t violent, but it was just assumed that students with that sort of opinion were going to be aggressive, and violent, and disruptive,” Dooley said.
When security is required at events, the club must cover the additional costs.
Kteily said this was an unfair burden to place on clubs.
“If they are going to mandate additional security guards, the very least that could be done is that McGill cover these costs. Realistically, we are dealing with a budget that is in the thousands of dollars at best,” Kteily said.
Nicell stood by the University’s policy.
“At a certain point, if there’s no subsidies available for carrying out those events, it’s going to have to be carried by the group itself,” Nicell said.
For Olle, the initial email points to problems with the University’s policy that extend beyond the cost of security. Olle explained that since policies are developed by high-ranking administrators, the actual regulations are not always communicated effectively to the people who help clubs book events.
For instance, Olle also mentioned an email she received from an administrative assistant who referred to Choose Life as “Abortion McGill.”
Olle said she sees this as indicative of inadequate knowledge of clubs among lower-level administrators.
“The knowledge trickle-down about what’s happening gets very convoluted when it gets to those lower levels,” Olle said. “I hope that this does continue to push the University to come up with a more comprehensive, clear policy about events on campus…because I just think this is just another example to show that what they’re doing right now doesn’t work.”
