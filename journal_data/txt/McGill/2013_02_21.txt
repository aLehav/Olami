Addressing law as a way to challenge power relations 
“Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge that we are on Mohawk territory and to thank them for allowing us to have this event on their lands,” began Allan Vicaire, Aboriginal Sustainability Project Coordinator at the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office, as he introduced Val Napoleon to a crowd of almost forty people in the Arts building on Tuesday.
Napoleon, Law Foundation Professor of Aboriginal Justice and Governance at the University of Victoria, was at McGill as part of SEDE’s Indigenous Education Series. Napoleon’s talk on Indigenous Citizenship and Law touched on issues of using Indigenous systems of law as a way to challenge, rather than perpetuate, damaging power relations and oppressions in communities.
Napoleon connected the idea of citizenship – for which she used political philosopher James Tully’s definition of “complex practices of freedom” – to Indigenous peoples’ status as citizens of both the Canadian state and their respective nations, and the need for citizens to productively challenge their relationship to governing bodies.
A traditional story told by Napoleon entitled “The Origin of the Wolf Crest” was used to explain the role of storytelling in practices of Indigenous law. “Stories are about being tools for thinking, about being spaces for conversations,” she said. The story demonstrated the ways in which gender relations, power relations, and ideas of inclusivity and membership play themselves out in groups.
Napoleon also explored the idea of “law as a process, not law as a thing.” Through this she presented a broad conception of law in which there are processes for solving human problems, discussing outcomes, and setting precedents. She called for the need to have an intellectual community to interpret Indigenous law to create “spaces to have conversations about power.”
During the question period at the end of her talk, Napoleon addressed the importance of the Idle No More movement. “I guess what I’m interested in with [Idle No More] is that there has to be a way for people to move past the criticism of what’s wrong, to constructively be able to engage,” Napoleon said. She applauded the movement for its ability to touch the lives of Indigenous peoples regardless of their previous political engagement.
Vicaire was pleased with the turnout at Napoleon’s event, as there were students from a wide range of faculties. “One of my mandates is to do a pan-university initative,” he said in an interview with The Daily. “With Indigenous issues, most students [normally] come from Anthropology, History, and Law; I want to reach students from Computer Science and Engineering,” a goal that he felt had been met on Tuesday.
Prior to her talk, Napoleon conducted two workshops in the Faculty of Law and participated in a luncheon with students at the First Peoples’ House.
Napoleon was the first of three speakers in SEDE’s Indigenous Education Series. Upcoming guest speakers will address issues of colonialism and state dependence and inequalities faced by First Nations children. Vicaire said that students and partners, such as the First Peoples’ House and Indigenous Access McGill, help him find speakers. These partners, as well as individual faculties, often help SEDE pay for bringing these guest speakers to the University.

Cutting admin salaries would be “symbolic,” Masi says
McGill’s Provost Anthony Masi warned at Tuesday’s Senate meeting that the University’s accumulated deficit could nearly double to around $200.8 million by the 2015 fiscal year as a result of the government’s cuts to university operating grants. McGill would be hit the hardest in 2014: its deficit is set to grow by 33 per cent in a single year, according to a report presented by Masi.
The government told the University that it will withhold $32 million in grant money if the University fails to cut $19 million from its budget by the end of fiscal year 2014.
“This is clearly a devastating picture from the point of view of managing our University,” Masi said. “For anyone to argue that McGill or universities in Quebec aren’t underfunded is just ridiculous.”
The report outlined several strategies that would allow the University to meet their new budgetary constraints. These include targeted cuts, reduced headcounts and salaries, and a reduction in raises coupled with attempts to increase revenue through higher enrolment.
“There’s bound to be some effect on courses, number of courses taught, and the support given,” Masi said. “We can’t make a commitment now that some things are totally a sacred cow. Some of everything will have to be cut, and some will be hurt more than others to protect the core mission.”
“We want to protect the quality of that mission, but the quality of life surrounding it will have to be affected. I don’t mean to be cute on that,” he added.
Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum noted that salaries and benefits constituted 75 per cent of McGill’s core operating expenses. Pension plan liabilities, post-retirement liabilities, and pay equity were also highlighted as “on-going pressures” to the McGill budget in the report.
The idea that students could hold a referendum to decide whether to increase tuition or the amount they pay for services was floated at the meeting. Masi thought this would be a good idea.
“Go for it,” he said.
Senator Graham Bell of the Faculty of Science expressed concern over a decrease in the quality of services and said that his faculty could lose nearly “75 per cent of its TAs.”
“Our mission in research and teaching should be protected, the damage might not be obvious, but it may be real,” he said.
Asked if administrator’s salaries might be affected, Masi said that targeting those expenses would be “symbolic.”
“The last time there was a cut was in 2009, and everyone took a cut,” he said. “If all administrators took a 5 per cent cut, it would barely amount to a quarter of a million dollars.”
A more detailed plan should be available sometime after the government’s summit on higher education, planned for February 25.
“When will we know? We’re working day and night on a bunch of scenarios, we’re looking at all the options but I don’t think it would be fair to come up with a plan without hearing what the town halls, focus groups, have to say,” Masi said.

Conflicting bylaws, timetable source of disputes
The basement of Thomson House erupted in a shouting match last night between several graduate students and their society’s Chief Returning Officer (CRO), Brock Rutter, during what was originally scheduled to be a debate between candidates in PGSS’ upcoming executive elections.
“You people are ridiculous. You aren’t fit for this university, you aren’t fit for society,” Rutter said as he walked out of the meeting amid chants of “Hey, hey, ho, ho. The CRO has got to go!”
Rutter was hired by the Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) to oversee their elections of next year’s executive and a vote to accredit the PGSS as the representative of graduate students to the provincial government in a March referendum.
At the time of the debate, the society’s Appeals Board was convened in an emergency meeting to consider whether or not to postpone the executive elections, and the possibility of Rutter’s termination as CRO.
The Appeals Board released a report late that same night stating that the CRO had “acted correctly and without error,” but that “in the light of conflicting and confusing language” in the bylaws, the election nomination period would be extended to February 28 and the elections postponed accordingly.
The Board meeting was called following a series of emails between Rutter and PGSS Equity Commissioner Gretchen King, in which King requested that Rutter extend the election nomination period.
According to the Society’s Activities Manual, the PGSS electorate will be notified of “an extension of the nomination period for one week for any position attracting one candidate or less.” Because all five candidates – including three incumbents – were running unopposed, King argued that an extended nomination period was required.
However, the report released by the Appeals Board notes that this section “does not purposively refer to actual extension of the nomination period, rather it refers to the communication of such an extension should it take place.”
The manual reads elsewhere that the nomination period will be extended “in the event of no nominees for the candidacy of any elected position.”
Rutter told King that there were “conflicting” bylaws, and while he welcomed any nominations she knew about which were underway, he “could not spend any more time on this right now,” and the election schedule would remain unchanged.
When King insisted that the process be re-opened and advised Rutter that she would be recommending his termination to the Appeals Board, Rutter sent an email to King which read, “Please check your email security settings. I am afraid you might have been hacked as it seems some asshole is sending emails from your accounts.”
The PGSS Board of Directors will meet next week – if not earlier, according to PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney – to decide whether or not Rutter’s email would merit termination.
Rutter told The Daily he had decided not to reschedule the elections both because of the cost and inconvenience, but also because he was under the impression that it was imperative for the society to hold its referendum by March 15 – the final date set by the provincial government for accreditation votes.
The timetable for the elections has been changed once already, and moved forward a week – after a different date was publicized to the electorate – when the Society’s executive realized that the schedule would put them behind the government’s deadline. A new election schedule was then publicized.
According to Mooney, the executive had originally decided not to split the accreditation vote and the executive elections into different referenda to encourage voter turnout, though the Appeals Board decision will mean that they have no choice in the matter.
“You want to minimize the number of times you ask people to vote,” Mooney told The Daily. “With the exec elections, there’s sort of a baseline [turnout] that you already have to build on.”
In order to be recognized by the government, accreditation requires that 25 per cent of the electorate votes “yes” to accreditation. PGSS traditionally gets about half that much – if not less – in terms of turnout.

Accreditation would give PSA more autonomy over activities 
The Philosophy Students’ Association (PSA) incorporated last Tuesday, becoming the first departmental association with its own bank account at McGill to be recognized as a non-profit organization.
Incorporation is the first step toward accreditation which, if achieved, would turn the PSA into an independent organization in the eyes of the University and the provincial government.
The PSA is currently a departmental association under the accredited Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS).
According to PSA President Jonathan Wald, the organization is seeking accreditation to obtain more control over its finances.
“It would give us more freedom to run the activities we would like to on a more speedy basis, without much of the red tape. It would also reduce the workload on the AUS, and as we have seen over the past year the AUS has had trouble with its audits,” Wald told The Daily.
The process began last October after the AUS announced its intention to internalize all of the departmental associations’ bank accounts, on the advice of its financial auditors in order to comply with their Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with McGill.
“The two alternatives were: either the AUS further internalizes us, which we saw as complicating things with more red tape, or complete externalization, if you will, which would be accreditation,” Wald said.
The Accreditation Act requires the PSA to obtain 25 per cent of undergraduate Philosophy students to approve the accreditation.
If the PSA receives accreditation, it will also have to negotiate its own MoA with McGill.
Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson told The Daily that at this stage, “there are other steps that remain in the process and it would be premature for [the administration] to comment right now.”
Philosophy students would continue to pay AUS fees and would remain members and receive the services of the AUS regardless of whether or not accreditation is obtained.
AUS VP Internal Justin Fletcher told The Daily that the society is waiting for the accreditation vote, and the University’s response before commenting.
“When I sat down and talked to Justin Fletcher last [semester] about PSA accreditation, his worry was that if student associations started to [accredit themselves]…if they start to be more autonomous from the AUS, that the AUS could lose some of its relevancy,” Wald said. “I think it’s in the AUS interests’ for the PSA to remain represented in AUS Council meetings.”
The vote on the accreditation is set to begin on March 11.

CKUT launches 11th annual Homelessness Marathon
CKUT kicked off its 11th annual Homelessness Marathon on Wednesday. Members of the campus community radio station set up a live broadcast in the snow outside the Native Friendship Centre as homeless members of the community geared up to speak on air. The marathon was broadcast live on 35 stations across Canada.
The marathon, which ended at 7 a.m. Thursday, aired 14 hours of non-stop content in order to provide an opportunity for homeless people to share their thoughts, stories, and experiences with other members of the Montreal community. Hosting was shared with 12 other stations across the country. This year, about 75 per cent of the content was produced in Montreal.
A vegetarian community dinner was served inside the Native Friendship Center during the broadcast.
The marathon strives to open a dialogue on the realities of homelessness and poverty.
“So often we completely ignore the existence of homeless people. In this mindset of ignoring people, it makes them feel like they don’t belong to our communities. I think that’s quite clear in peoples’ lives and mainstream society,” Candice Cascanette, CKUT’s homelessness marathon coordinator, told The Daily.
“Media is an awareness-raising tool and it’s important that we make space for these voices we don’t interact with on a day-to-day basis,” she added.
One participant, who chose to remain anonymous said: “I’m here because I think it’s a good idea, it’s a good event. I have an opportunity to share my experiences. I don’t often get the chance to do that, to interact with society.”
The marathon began in 2001 after squatters were evicted from the Préfontaine squats, close to the Lucien-L’Allier metro station in St. Henri. Gretchen King, who was CKUT’s community news coordinator at the time, befriended a member of the street community, which led to her spearheading the homelessness marathon, modeling it after a similar project in the U.S.
About 3.5 million Canadians currently live in poverty, with this number growing every year. In Montreal, the homeless advocacy group le Réseau d’aide aux personnes seules et itinérantes de Montréal (RAPSIM) estimates that there are around 30,000 people living on the streets, yet there are only an average of 720 shelter beds available on any given night. Around 13,000 people have no fixed address in the city.
The government’s role in the state of homelessness in Canada was a prevalent topic in the marathon.
“I feel like the government doesn’t think about us, here on the streets. Or at least, I don’t see any changes. More and more of my friends live on the streets here,” a person who lives on the street told The Daily.
However, Cascanette said that the marathon does not have any direct goals to affect government policies.
“As far as demanding political action, we aren’t an advocacy group, we don’t have demands we’re promoting. But we are raising awareness and talking about how homelessness is a multifaceted issue that needs a political response as well as a societal transformation,” she said.

 Protocol criticized as too vague
During the consultation session held on Wednesday in the Faculty Club, a handful of students described the administration’s protest protocol documents as being too ambiguous.
Student associations, professors, and unions on campus have been echoing this sentiment for some time with regard to the language in the “Statement of Values on Freedom of Expression and Freedom of Assembly” and the “Operational Procedures” documents.
“Clarity” was the watchword at the second of two consultation sessions hosted by McGill’s senior administrators about the documents – a revised version of the University’s protocol on campus protests.
Senior administrators, along with members of McGill’s legal team involved in drafting the protocol, heard from the six students who attended the consultation that terms like “inconvenience,” “intentionality,” and “intensity” needed to be more clearly defined in any future versions of the protocol.
Lydia White, McGill’s associate provost in charge of policies and procedures admitted as much, saying that “as a linguistics professor, there are some problems of ambiguity here and we may need to revisit those terms.”
The six students, along with several student journalists, were split into two discussion groups, one moderated by Dean of Students Andre Costopoulos, the other moderated by White, along with Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson and McGill’s chief lawyer, Line Thibault.
The session’s two discussion groups further concluded that a clearer link should be drawn between the administration’s new Statement of Values and its proposed operating procedures.
The two documents stemmed from the re-examination of the original protest protocol, following widespread condemnation from campus unions, as well as the Canadian Civil Liberties Union.
There were no representatives of campus unions present, despite having organized a protest against the protocol in January.
Lilian Radovac, president of AGSEM – the union representing Teaching Assistants and Course Lecturers – said that the union had made a decision not to attend.
“Given that the university intends to bypass Senate and include some aspect of the protocol in the operating procedure, we see no reason to participate in consultation sessions. [Consultation sessions] won’t change that outcome,” Radovac said.
Central to discussions at both tables was whether or not campus protest should be allowed to “obstruct” or “disrupt” the way the university functions. Summarizing the discussion he moderated, Costopoulos said that the central problem was one of thresholds and how low they should be.
According to the students in his group, he said, the current threshold outlined in the operating procedures – of allowing members of the university to attend to their normal activities on university premises, free from disruption – is too low.
The University’s protocol on campus protest was written in response to the several-day-long occupation of the James Administration building just over a year ago.
Asked if building occupation was a legitimate method for voicing student grievance, both Costopoulos and Vice-Principal (Administration & Finance) Michael Di Grappa said that it was, under certain circumstances. Di Grappa specifically referenced the importance of considering the rights of those who work in administration buildings.
White, one of the protocol’s authors, declined to definitively state whether or not the tactic was legitimate, saying that it may not be in places “where you’re preventing business from being done.”
