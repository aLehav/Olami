Publicity campaign seeks public recognition for Quebec atheists
While some Montrealers may find ten new signs on the sides of buses reading, “There probably is no God. So relax, enjoy your life” amusing, Canadian atheist and humanist activists say the ads should be taken seriously as a campaign for the recognition of non-believers in Quebec.
“[The ads] make believers and unbelievers know, ‘Yes, there are such things as atheists,’ and they want to be recognized as citizens, with the same duties and rights as believers,” said Michelle Virard, president of Association Humaniste du Québec (AHQ), the group funding the Montreal campaign. “This year, we have said, ‘Enough is enough.’ We are coming out of the closet.”
Justin Trottier, president of the Free Thought Association of Canada, a group that has sponsored similar ads in other cities following a campaign by the British Humanist Association in London, thought they would serve as a way for non-believers to enter the public and political sphere – something he felt was necessary in contemporary society.
“To marginalize and ignore non-believers, who by certain estimates account for a quarter of Canadians, is nonsensical,” explained Trottier. “We can’t have discussions in public space about science, religion, or public policy without consulting non-believers.”
While similar ads were vetoed recently by the Ottawa and Halifax transport systems, the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) was neutral about the content of the ads. According to Marianne Rouette, a spokesperson for the STM, the company already set a precedent to allow religious content in advertisements.
 “[The AHQ ad] has been accepted on the same level as one last year for the St. Joseph’s Oratory,” said Rouette. “It said, ‘If you feel lost, come see us.’ [The AHQ ad] is on the same level. It does not cause prejudice to anyone, and it doesn’t say, ‘If you don’t believe in God, you’re stupid.’”
Both Virard and Trottier also felt atheists were underrepresented in Quebec’s mandatory Ethics and Religious Culture Program because they are lumped with other philosophies into a single segment, “Existential Questions.”
“Most schools of ethics in the last 200 years have nothing to do with religion: secular systems of utilitarianism, Kant’s maxims, that sort of thing, but that system is very different from non-belief,” Trottier said.
Virard pointed to a “negative” public perception of atheism, references to “God” in the Constitution, and the presence of a blasphemy law in Section 296 of the Canadian Criminal Code as problems atheists have in engaging in the public sphere, a general sentiment that Trottier also held.
“If you’re going to talk about every other faith, there should be an entire unit on disbelievers. Every religion has had [them]. It’s not good enough to just talk about existential or secular philosophy,” Trottier said.
So far, the AHQ has received only two letters of complaint, one which read “God is Love,” and one threatening a lawsuit. The United Church of Canada issued a public response, posting a reply in the Globe and Mail stating, “There probably is a God. So relax, enjoy your life.”
Mary Frances Denis, communications officer for the United Church, said her organization replied to AHQ’s ad so they could initiate a discussion between believers and non-believers – not because they were angered.

ANC minister Ronnie Kasrils examines Israel with South Africa in mind for McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week
The Daily caught up with former African National Congress (ANC) Minister Ronnie Kasrils  on his way to his keynote speech for McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week. to discuss what South African apartheid can teach the world about Gaza.
Of Jewish Lithuanian descent, Kasrils was born in Johannesburg and was a founding member of the ANC’s military wing. He worked as Chief of Military Intelligence for the ANC while exiled to neighbouring African countries and was later involved in South African politics as Deputy Minister of Defence.
McGill Daily: There was a recent petition that was signed by 500 prominent Israelis calling upon the international community to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) for Palestine campaign…. Could you comment on the state of anti-apartheid activism in Israel?
Ronnie Kasrils: I think that the fact that there are 500 courageous enough to come out in support of BDS is fantastic. It’s almost treasonable in Israel… and 500 is a very significant number.
There were times when there were far less than 500 South African whites who were prepared to stand up and side with the liberation movement. [But] it’s not just the number; it’s the symbolism.
It’s the fact that [Israelis who support BDS] are breaking with the orthodoxy of the state and the doctrine which basically says with an exclusivist state, that if you’re white or if you’re Jewish then the only way we can all survive is by standing together. So those whites who broke with that in South Africa really challenged the essence of racism and apartheid. The same thing is happening in Israel.
MD: How do you feel about comparisons between the ANC and Hamas? And in the face of the reality of the gross asymmetries when it comes to armed conflict in Israel-Palestine, do you think that the ramifications of Hamas’s militant policies need to affect the way in which its leaders are engaged in the international stage?
RK: I’ve met with Hamas leaders, and we’ve had very interesting, useful discussions. They’re very interested in our experience, our strategy of winning over whites in South Africa, They are very interested in [winning over Jews in Israel] and they began to see quite frankly that using indiscriminate violence against civilians is counter-productive. We might not endorse some of the methods they use but Hamas has stopped suicide bombings…
These are people who are patriots, who are serious, who are human beings and shouldn’t be demonized. If you want to solve a problem in the end, it’s not your friends that you negotiate with, it’s your enemies.
And Israel has not taken the opportunity of getting together to resolve these problems and why? Because of the Zionist doctrine, they are not interested in negotiation. They want the entire land of the British Mandate to themselves, that’s the reason.
MD: In the case of South Africa, the end of apartheid meant integration and liberation for blacks: living in the same country under the same rights. What tack do you take in the Palestinian solidarity struggle vis-à-vis the one-state versus the two-state solution?
RK: With South Africa, right from an early time of the struggle we made it very clear that we were talking about the liberation of the whole country and the unity state in which all our people would be equal citizens. In 1955, [the ANC] came up with this blueprint for a free South Africa and it starts in the preamble, “We South Africans, together we say that South Africa belongs to all the people who live in it, black and white, as equal citizens.”
But when you look at Palestine, it’s not for us to decide for the Palestinians, or for the Jews living in the former British Mandate Palestine, how to struggle, or what the objective should be. We want to support a whole movement which is for justice, which is for equality of people and so on.
Up until the late eighties the Palestine Liberation Organization talked about one state…. But when [Yasser] Arafat went into Oslo from the Madrid talks and stated that they would settle for a two-state solution along the lines of the pre-1967 borders, it wasn’t for us to argue with that. We supported that.
But of course what’s happened since Oslo in terms of the two states has greatly undermined it. Israel has moved against the idea of real contiguity and sovereignty.
[Palestinian] territory is shrinking because the illegal settlements have been expanding over time no matter which party is in power. So from that point of view, [the two-state solution] needs to be reconsidered.
MD: If we look at the BDS campaign, designed as it is as more or less a blanket boycott of Israeli goods, industry, academics, do you fear that the majority of the Israeli public will be alienated by it?
RK: I think you’ll find [Israeli support for the boycotts] narrow when they are appalled and they will react with anger. [Support] in turn [widen].
In South Africa, initially, [whites] were affronted by this and asked “how dare these people challenge us this way? They’re crazy, they don’t understand.” But in time it opens people’s eyes, as you sustain such pressure.
So in 1959 when the international boycott started, the support was very narrow, but by 1989 huge numbers of whites were actually joining these anti-apartheid protests. They were tired of finding themselves treated like lepers in the world, seeing their sports teams being jeered at internationally, the life lines cut off for their trade, for their cultural exchanges. For the academics it all came home to roost; for the business people, it was biting their pockets.

Administration defends high salaries for executives
A recent ad campaign by the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) has sparked another disagreement between McGill administration and the union.
The ads, published February in The Daily, McGill Tribune, and the Montreal Gazette, accused University administrators of refusing to acknowledge support staffs’ contributions on campus by denying what the union deemed as a fair salary raise while adding five new, high-paying positions to the McGill administration.
Vice-President of MUNACA Raynald Lepage explained that MUNACA would not have a problem with administrators’ high salaries as long as workers received a satisfactory wage increase, something that he saw as entirely possible.
“McGill will always claim that they have no money for political reasons. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have money, it just means they don’t want to use money on this specific demand,” Lepage said.
On February 19, Francois Roy, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance), responded with an online press release criticizing the ads for misleading readers. The document sought to clarify the context behind the creation of several new positions and defended the large salaries of several McGill administrators – especially those attracting medical research.
“Medical research is one of the major drivers of this University, something that brings with it a significant amount of funding and employment opportunities,” Roy explained in the press release.
Lepage defended MUNACA’s campaign, asserting that disagreements over the validity of the union’s claims were merely an issue of presentation. According to the vice-president, ads were intended to motivate the administration to make progress with the union.
“The ads are only a tool to get a response from the University. They have to serve the purpose that they strike a nerve and we get to talking again….The only thing that can move this administration will be their image. Attack their image and they will move.”
The advertisements are yet another event in a longstanding disagreement between the parties about the University’s proposed salary increases.
MUNACA’s ad in the Gazette cites McGill’s proposed salary increase for the union as two per cent, while the administration’s press release noted that the University has previously offered deals wage increases of two and a half and three per cent over three years.
According to Lepage, the discrepancy in cited figures is due to differing interpretations of wage increase proposals.  Such agreements may result in varying wage increases for different employees through the use of both “scale increases,” which apply to all workers, and “automatic progression increases,” which do not apply to the highest earners in the union.
“McGill has made a fair offer, particularly given the economic downturn of the last several months,” Roy wrote.
The 1,700 member union has been vouching for a pay increase since December 2007.

For-sale signs, clearance sales, and two-for-one deals are tell-tale signs that Canada’s in an economic crisis, but outside of Montreal restaurant Taverne Crescent, a sign reading “Pay What You Want” hangs in the window.
There is no fine print. No minimum price. Just a question mark in place of a total. Every Monday to Friday from noon until 3 p.m., clients pay what they want – or better yet, what they can – for a combination of plates picked from a daily menu. It’s lunch that sympathizes both with Montrealers’ thinning wallets and the restaurant industry’s drop in business.
At first glance, the move to lunch donations looks desperate. Taverne Crescent is a classy restaurant-bar that used to draw in a steady clientele of Montreal’s fine white-collar professionals, many of them American tourists. While not luxurious, it never used to attract frugal spenders.
Since having started this luncheon special, however, business for the Taverne has picked up, allowing them to avoid hard decisions that other restaurants face on fiscal spending, said co-owner George Pappas.
In the few weeks that the pay what you want policy has been in effect, the restaurant has had its lunchtime clientele jump from 20 to 90, sometimes reaching 150.
Also sharing in the newfound excitement are the staff. While tips may not be as high on average per table, overall with more clients to serve and more shifts, they’re easily making up the difference. Manager and waiter Garry Mathieu appreciatively noted that customers have generally been fair and honest.
As for the future of the Taverne’s luncheon special, Pappas said he sees no likely endpoint in sight.
“Obama reminds us that the ways of yesterday are finished,” he said. “What we are doing is potentially the ‘new way’ of this industry, and once the ball gets rolling, how could be go back?”

Each year during election season, The Daily barrels through a series of interviews with all the runners for a SSMU executive position, and publishes a condensed version of the Q&As and our endorsements (online in the Commentary section). With an apathetic turnout of eight candidates for six positions, we thought it might be a good idea to force some of the acclaimed candidates to concretely articulate what they intend to do next year, given that there are so few actual contests. We generally found that while a number of candidates had an impressive background, they lacked a fresh, vigorous approach to their upcoming year. But don’t let us decide for you. Read through everything, make up your mind, and cast your votes where possible at electionsmcgill.ca/vote before Thursday at 4 p.m.
…………………………………………….
MARSHALL PETERS Candidate for President
What made you decide to run for president?
When I failed my year in arts and was kicked out of the University, I  hated this place. Three years later, I’ve realized I care about it and that I should go the extra mile to make changes.
What are your big plans for next year?  
I want to change the cost of food. I’d like to see Midnight Kitchen expanded until they serve 1,000 students a day. I would discuss with them to change their menu to incorporate free-range meat and vegetarian food.
I’d like to make SnowAP profitable with a smaller environmental footprint, potentially through insulation.
How do language politics fit into your portfolio?
One student [I talked to] suggested we offer French classes to anglophone professors. The anglo/franco divide is racist, really….We need to include the two communities and take them out of their insular perspectives.
What did the question about Gaza teach you about General Assemblies?
People were turned away [from the GA] due to [limited] room capacity. It’s inappropriate for such a small percentage of the student body to make a statement that affects everyone. We shouldn’t be working to voice global political opinions when we can’t [manage our own affairs].
Does that constitute censorship?
To say no to a question: that is censorship. But maybe the General Assembly isn’t the right forum. [We could] open the ballroom for a discussion and not have it be a motion.
IVAN NEILSON Candidate for President
What made you decide to run for president?
My involvement [in SSMU] this year. I could see what was going on and what I could bring to the position. [I learned] how I could effect change.
What are your big plans for next year?
Foremost, we need to look at our ancillary fee bylaws. Right now there is no clear procedure if students reject a fee increase. The admin can come right back with it with a few modifications. They try a different direction, try to get fees through no matter what. I want to look into different kinds of outreach mentorship between local and international students in first year. We need better publicity for how native Montrealers can get engaged.
How do language politics fit into your portfolio?
Professors are reluctant to [let students submit papers and tests in French] because they are not necessarily supported in terms of translators. Since [grading work in French] is such an added hassle, we have to ask whether submitting work in French is really a right.
What did the question about Gaza teach you about General Assemblies?
[The Gaza question] showed students are in fact interested if the issue is relevant, so we can’t always cry apathy. Hillel suggested more of a debriefing should have been done after the event. It’s only at the next General Assembly that we will report on the previous one.
REBBECCA DOOLEY Acclaimed candidate for VP University Affairs
What are your strengths coming into this portfolio?
I’ve been part of a community of student activists who are really passionate about looking into the structures that we’re learning in, criticizing them, and taking action towards that. I’ve also done a lot of work with Queer McGill as the Political Action Co-ordinator.
How will you be accessible to students interests, considering student apathy?
For my portfolio, students just aren’t informed, and I’ll take a more active role in information campaigns. When big issues come up at the University, I’ll use all media outlets. I’m representing the student body; I need to hear what they have to say.
What issues crop up in your portfolio concerning the administration and how are you going to smooth those out?
Professor Mendelson just put out his Student Life evaluation, and I’m hoping to work closely with him on that. I’m interested in the different Senate sub-committees, especially those related to equity and marginalized students. I know the administration next year is going to be addressing a lot of economic crisis issues, which could result in a lot of funding cuts. I plan on taking a very pro-student stance on those.
What are the dream projects you want to launch and carry through?
I’m interested in working with the Senate sub-committees to clean up the bureaucracy and get more done. On the Queer Equity subcommittee, I want to make sure their safe space program is working effectively. I’m interested in working with VP External on international tuition issues.
SARAH OLLE Acclaimed candidate for VP Clubs and Services
What are your big dreams for next year?
I specifically would not say that I have big dreams. I think I’ve learned a lot from previous SSMU executives who have set their goals really high and haven’t achieved them. [That being said,]  I want to see if we can get more money into the clubs fund from other departments. I was also really disappointed about how long it took to grant club money. Another category is space. We do have spaces on campus, we just need to figure out how to get our clubs permission to use them.
How would you handle another situation like Choose Life?
VP Clubs & Services (C&S) is a specific role that does specific things. For a club that comes for approval, that goes to the C&S committee – the VP does have a seat but they’re one of seven [committee] voices. I really respected the way VP Cook chose to handle the situation by not voicing her personal opinion in council.
What will be your biggest challenge?
I think a huge challenge is student apathy. The fact that we have four acclaimed races for SSMU executive is really discouraging. I thought a lot about how to counter [apathy]. I think it is unclear to a lot of students how SSMU impacts their daily life, and I want to explain that more clearly to students. Another goal I have to decrease apathy is to make it easier to become involved in clubs and services.
ALEXANDRA BROWN Candidate for VP Internal
What strengths do you bring to the portfolio?
In the time I’ve been involved with SSMU, I’ve watched the position grow and change, but not as much as it could. I know what has worked and what needs to be changed.
What are your big dreams?
I want to make the VP Internal portfolio not just about planning events, but also about bringing people together so that events are great in every category. [For instance,] you can have all events both excel at managing their effect on the environment and be accessible to francophone students. I would personally love SSMU to be more out there. I’d love to start a campaign, ‘What can SSMU do for you?’
How are you going to engage students who are apathetic?
I think the reason that events have low attendance is because there is a disconnect between types of events and types of students. I don’t think the events calendar is diverse enough. I’d love to do something with other universities. I thought about doing a fun competition like an academic decathlon. I [also] want to talk to specific faculty associations and ask them what kind of events are popular [with that faculty.]
How do you think you can make Frosh more accessible to non-drinkers?
For a lot of people, SSMU Frosh is overwhelming or exhausting, as most of the activities happen at night. I would like to see better use of daytime for more inclusive activities that are not geared to drinking. SSMU Frosh can make a better introduction to Montreal and francophone culture. We could get people to use French or practice French.
BRENDAN SULLIVAN Candidate for VP Internal
What strengths do you bring to this portfolio?
I think that my work at Queer McGill is about working with other people and other leaders. I’m really good at getting people to see my vision and work within their visions and facilitate that.
What are your big dreams?
My overarching pledges are to make more events that are sustainable, both financially and environmentally, as well as more accessible. I want to review all the events we do now, and edit or get rid of ones that lose so much money. I want to cut [SnowAP] down to four days instead of ten –[and use the money for] lower cost and free events. I want to work with more faculty groups. I want to use things like the Green Fund to make SSMU events more sustainable, and utilize the Students Society Programming Network to help put on events.
How are you going to engage students who are apathetic?
I want to bring speakers that aren’t necessarily for everyone, but reach out to certain groups of students. I also want to work with other groups, like QPIRG and Concordia University. I want to have a Clubs Week, which is more accessible that Activities Nights.
How do you think you can make Frosh more accessible to non-drinkers?
The problem with SSMU Frosh is that it comes after all these days of drinking and everyone’s like ‘I don’t feel like going whitewater rafting at nine in the morning.’ I’d like more daytime events that are less alcohol-related.
SEBASTIAN RONDEROS-MORGAN Acclaimed candidate for VP External
What are your big dreams for next year?
My big dreams are to shepherd the Table de Concertation – a new provincial student society – into an effective institution. I think the External portfolio can also grow beyond the political element that it has largely been over the past few years. The Student Community Affairs Committee, for example, has done work in conjunction with Burst Your Bubble, but it can be improved. There hasn’t been any new energy or ideas brought into the portfolio recently. I’d [also like] to focus on programs that engage McGill students to learn about Montreal neighborhoods outside of McGill, through community and arts events.
Why do you think SSMU should try to create a new student federation?
I think there are two main issues why they should affiliate. SSMU would obviously be part of a greater lobbying voice. SSMU also can’t be an isolated association, given that in the context of Quebec it is a unique as an anglophone university, appealing mostly to Canadians of Quebec. It’s important that we develop ties with Francophone associations.
What will be your greatest challenge?
One of the greater challenges I will have is getting people mobilized on campus. Students will be inspired if they get the proper information on why they should to get involved. If they don’t feel passionate about certain things, then they won’t get off the ground.
JOSE DIAZ Acclaimed candidate for VP Finance & Operations
Why you should you be the VP Finance & Operations (FOPS)?
I think I would do a really good job because I am probably the only candidate in the last two years that comes to the portfolio with some experience. I already sit on most of the committees that the VP FOPS works with: I’ve been really involved with the Society as a councillor with operations and finance, with the comptroller, with the executive; it’s something of a continuity.
The position of FOPS is in flux. Do the requirements of the porfolio need to change?
The previous FOPS resigned partly because in practical terms the VP FOPS doesn’t have an oversight over all of the budgets of the society – many of them remain confidential, even to FOPS. That led to the idea that the position may need to be reevaluated. My personal position is that [reform] is not needed.
How do you plan to make SSMU operations financially viable, like Gerts and Haven Books?
I’m not promising they’re going to break even, because that’s extremely unrealistic, but we need to experiment with them.
For Haven, there’s a new inventory system, and that will allow us to do much better things with it, such as putting things online.
As for Gerts, something that will be important is to try to diversify events there. Council passed just yesterday the elimination of the booking fees for the remainder of the year for McGill University groups.

The McGill Daily
In a confidential session Thursday, SSMU Council voted to publicly reprimand their own electoral body – Elections McGill – for their poor performance during the 2008/2009 academic year.
The complaint, issued in a resolution, based its call for immediate action on Elections McGill’s failure to meet SSMU standards on bilingualism, insufficient promotional activities and campaign oversight, inaccuracies in print materials, and inaccessibility to election candidates and referendum committee members. The censure came the night before advance polls opened for the present SSMU election.
Kay Turner, President of SSMU, believed that a public censure was necessary to avert disaster before the election.
“The best way to rectify these problems is to call them on it publicly so that it is incredibly clear what we want from them. We wanted to actively insert ourselves into the situation rather than do a post-mortem,” she said, explaining that Elections McGill still had time to fix their malpractices before the current election period ended.
But Nicole Gileadi, Chief Executive Officer of Elections McGill and U2 Political Science student, stated in a bilingual press release sent to The McGill Daily and Le Délit that the resolution was completely unprecedented and unprofessional.
“Instead of speaking to us on an individual level – the way that it is normally done between Elections McGill and SSMU Council – they chose to pass this motion in a confidential session, which means that we don’t have access to the minutes, we weren’t invited to be there, we didn’t have an opportunity to respond to their allegations,” said Gileadi later in an interview with The Daily. “We learned about this at 3:30 in the morning, after the fact, after it had been made public.”
She described the charges as baseless and could not understand how SSMU could justify a public shaming.
“The claims they made are unfounded. [The censure] makes an implication that, as an office, Elections McGill refuses to do its job and refuses to improve, which has never been the case. A public censure should be reserved for situations in which all other avenues have been exhausted. We were given no notice before this resolution passed.”
Controversy erupted earlier this year when Elections McGill was accused of not providing proper French editions of emails and other documents. Gileadi said she has been working to be inclusive to francophone McGill students who have been ignored in the past, citing the introduction of bilingual posters, emails, and ads, which Elections McGill did not distribute in the past. Their web site and all other documentation are scheduled to be translated by the end of the academic year.
“Based on our track record, Elections McGill has given no precedent for Council to believe that we would not rectify any concerns brought directly to our attention,” said Gileadi.
Elections McGill an independent and impartial agency of SSMU, meaning that SSMU’s resolution cannot forcibly instruct the service on what action should be taken. Turner acknowledged Gileadi’s endeavours, but said that more could be done to improve upon current conduct.
“Elections McGill has actually already rectified most of the bilingual issues, but the other issues refer to Elections McGill not having a great response time to phone calls and emails from the candidates, and that’s something which can be easily rectified, for example.”
Turner maintained that her primary concern was a formally-run election, and denied that SSMU wholly objected to Elections McGill’s present work.
“Council takes issue with some of the decisions and actions of Elections McGill, but this doesn’t indicate a complete or partial lack of confidence in our electoral body.”
Gileadi was adamant that the censure is unwarranted and is going to remain focused on the election.
“We’re going to table this and focus on our job, because we think that it is an unfortunate distraction from having the election.”

Hotel will be converted to a residence, unbeknownst to striking workers
McGill University will purchase the Four Points Sheraton Hotel on Sherbrooke, just east of Aylmer, for an undisclosed sum. The hotel will close on April 17, likely leaving enough time to house students next fall.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a member of the administration made the following statement to The Daily: “We have an agreement to purchase the property called the Four Points Hotel on Sherbrooke Street, which will become part of our residences’ offering.” 
The administrator refused to comment further, and Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) Morton Mendelson was unavailable for comment before press time.
Confirmation of the purchase followed brief comments by Principal Heather Munroe-Blum at Senate Wednesday stating that the Board of Governors – the University’s highest governing body – had agreed to purchase another residence because it would be more financially responsible than renting spaces to satisfy heightened demand for on-campus housing, as  McGill has done this year, such as at 515 Ste. Catherine.
Built in 1974, the Four Points Sheraton is a 20-storey, four-star hotel with 196 guest rooms and 13 meeting rooms. It was valued for property tax purposes on February 28 at $13-million, and belongs to the Mississauga-based Northampton Group, which owns 17 hotels in the U.S. and Canada.
The hotel has been in the press this year because employee members of Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) and the Syndicat des Travailleur(euses) en Télécommunications (STT) have been on strike since  August 25.
A press release issued Tuesday by the CSN, a union federation associated with Four Points staff’s union, highlighted 150 members of the STT joining the hotel’s striking workers on the street and had Jean Lortie – the president of the Fédération du commerce, a grouping of hotel workers and other unions – calling the hotel one of the worst employers in the hotel industry.
“It is not true that we are going to retreat on all fours,” Fustel Dossous, the president of the SST, said in French in the press release. “We want a good collective agreement, and we will have one.”
When informed of the University’s statement, Sylvio Morin, a spokesperson for the CSN, could not contain his astonishment.
“It’s news to me,” said Morin, who then said he needed 30 minutes to discuss with other union members. Morin later relayed Lortie’s reaction.
“We are treating it as a rumour, so we are not commenting at this time,” Lortie was quoted as saying
The Daily called the hotel Friday asking for a reservation in September, however, and the hotel receptionist immediately said the hotel would be closed. When asked whether this was due to the strike, the receptionist, who would not give her name, concurred.
After being informed the hotel was no longer accepting reservations after April 17 due to the hotel’s closure, Morin refused to comment further.
The Daily visited the hotel later that day, and though a staff member at the reception said that he received a phone message from The Daily, he “knew nothing,” and would “keep working,” asking The Daily to call back later.
Vinnie Patel, the CEO of the Northhampton Group, refused to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement between his company and the University.
