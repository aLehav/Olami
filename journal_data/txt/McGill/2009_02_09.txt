Interdisciplinary approach is “greater than the sum of its parts”
A new interdisciplinary field of disability studies – coined as Biocultures – was presented to the McGill community by professor Leonard Davis of the University of Illinois, as the keynote address of McGill’s “Disability on Location” symposium last Wednesday.
Biocultures is an intersection of science, technology, medicine, and cultures, which Davis hopes can add a breadth of understanding to disability that is currently unavailable in the present model.
“Is the knowledge achieved [through interdisciplinary study] greater than the sum of its parts? I would argue that in [Biocultures] it is,” said Davis.
He stressed that culture was missing from how society views illness and impairment.
“There are a given pool of symptoms [that] change over time and culture,” he said.
Davis’s most recent research is the application of a Biocultures approach to obsession and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He pointed to how conceptions of this condition have changed drastically over time.
Davis cited the 18th century, where the predominantly religious context linked obsession and OCD to possession by the devil. He contrasted this to the present day, where these illnesses are widely accepted.
“Executives are being trained on how to be obsessive. They are studying Obsessive Compulsives and people with mania and trying to come up with methods to go farther and do more work,” said Davis. “We believe in our culture that unless we’re obsessed – with our work, with our boyfriends and girlfriends, with our sports – you’re only doing it by half-measure.”
The addition of culture, history, and politics to the study of psychiatric disability is critical for a complete understanding of these diseases, added Davis.
“If you are in medical school studying psychiatric illness, you’re not studying its history, but what it is right now – everything else that came before was a mistake. But we know [these illnesses] change every 20 or 30 years.”
These changes over time, according to Davis, should make us look at conditions like OCD not simply physical conditions, but partly as social construction. For example, in our culture, advertisements for pharmaceuticals drastically affect our notion of illness and impairment, allowing us to identify symptoms – and thus conceive of diseases – in a way that others in the past would not have been able to do.
Davis also pointed out that in our lifetime cultural transformations have produced conditions like Attention Deficit Disorder that were previously unheard of.
 “You’re going to see [in the near future] a whole lot of new diseases,” said Davis, adding that with these new disorders, the precedent to accommodate them may become more difficult. “How do you accommodate someone with a shopping disorder, or a pedophilic disorder?”
The “Disability on Location” symposium was the first of its kind at McGill, and brought together interdisciplinary academic talks, and entertainment-based events in the hope of gaining support for an integrated Disability Studies program at McGill.

Four Points Sheraton may become home to first years
Numerous sources have indicated that McGill may purchase the Four Points Sheraton hotel in downtown Montreal, adding much-needed space to the University’s capacity-strained residence system.
Both the Residences Department  and Planning & Institutional Analysis – which is in charge of the physical planning of the University – refused to comment on the possible acquisition, consistent with a McGill policy of not confirming or denying any potential real estate purchases.
The Four Points Sheraton, a twenty-storey, four-star hotel located on Sherbrooke just east of Aylmer, includes 196 guest rooms and 13 meeting rooms.
The property belongs to the Mississauga-based Northampton Group, which owns 17 hotels in the US and Canada. Their CEO, Vinod Patel, did not return email and telephone requests for comment.
Hotel workers associated with the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) have been on strike since August 25, 2008 over employee pay and benefits, and more recently, the use of scab workers. On August 29, the Quebec Labour Relations Board ordered the hotel to stop using several replacement workers, some of whom were identified as minors.
According to Lyle Stewart, a CSN spokesperson, the union had no information as to whether or not the property might be sold.
“It’s a rumour that circulated amongst hotel staff even before they went out on strike last summer, but nobody seems to know where it came from,” Stewart said.
Rising first-year demand for residences has led McGill to seek new properties in recent years. The University bought the Renaissance Hotel, now New Residence Hall, in 2003, and the Diocesan College building on University last spring.
According to Michael Porritt, Executive Director of Residences and Student Housing, the University is already leasing 200 spaces for residences due to to high first-year demands – which numbered 2,200 this year spread out across 13 undergraduate residences near the downtown campus. Many of those spaces are at 515 Ste. Catherine, a newly-constructed apartment building that rents exclusively to Montreal university students.
Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) Morton Mendelson has previously stated that it is the University’s goal to expand the spaces available in the Residence system in order to accommodate upper year, graduate, exchange and visiting students.

Strike movement in France supported by students
STRASBOURG, France – Marching in solidarity with 60,000 students across France, as many as 2,000 Strasbourg students were tear-gassed by riot police Thursday, as they tried to enter the Palais Universitaire to protest the government’s move toward a more privatized post-secondary education system.
The students joined professors – some of whom have been on strike for nearly two weeks – as they tried to disrupt Education Minister Valérie Pécresse’s visit to inaugurate the joining of the three facultés into one university.
The lockdown of one of the University of Strasbourg’s main buildings – which was eventually closed even to guests with invitations – was part of a series of measures to counter students’ support of a general strike which is gaining momentum in France.
While the students voted in general assemblies to protest the reforms, they thought the measures used by the police were unreasonable.
“The protesters were calm, but the police decided to react in a slightly violent manner,” said Ornella on French, a languages student at the University.
She was tear-gassed, and didn’t want to give her last name.
“Both sides were resisting and eventually the police threw tear gas, but the second time it was unwarranted.”
Ornella was also disappointed that the Minister seemed to ignore the protesters and their demands.
“It was frustrating; the Minister was inside, and it was as if they didn’t hear us,” she said.
The government intends to increase privatization and corporatization of research and administration of the universities – but the protesters claim this would mean universities would be run with short-term goals, rather than educational institutions with long-term vision.
The new policy would also curb researchers’ independence because projects would be driven more by government bureaucracies than by academic interest.
All of the complaints were combined into “L’appel de Strasbourg,” a petition signed by 32 faculty members. Some of the members at the inauguration ceremony tried, but failed, to present to the education minister.
Students in Strasbourg will vote Monday in a general assembly on what to do next, although a protest has already been scheduled for Tuesday.  But given the divide between the government and the protesters, Ornella thinks protests will only grow.
“This is part of a growing movement in France in about every sector. This is just the beginning,” she said.

New office will coordinate research, projects, and best practices on campus
When McGill’s new Office of Sustainability opens Wednesday, the University’s students, faculty, staff, and administrators will finally have a central location to integrate their efforts toward a greener campus.
“[The office aims] toward incorporating sustainable principles into McGill’s operations,…collecting and communicating information about the school’s sustainability performance to the different groups within the community,” said Jonathan Glencross, the chairperson of the Sustainable McGill Project (SMP), and one of three students who sat on the Office of Sustainability Steering Committee.
The Office of Sustainability will house the offices of McGill’s Director of Sustainability Dennis Fortune and McGill’s Environmental Officer, Kathleen Ng, as well as three tentative work-study positions. Students will also be able to submit academic proposals examining University operations that would fill gaps in knowledge of sustainable practices.
“If we have people at McGill doing research, why not take the next step and ask, ‘Could this research be incorporated into McGill operations, and how would I do it?’” said Fortune. “In the past, it wasn’t really clear what the connection was between having an idea and being able to bring it to being. The office will assist in doing that.”
While the Office aims to unite the University community, members have emphasized that they will work only with student groups who choose to participate.
“As far as the integration of clubs and services goes, those groups are autonomous, so it’s a matter of those groups deciding what makes the most sense for them,” said Maggie Knight, one of SSMU’s Environment Commissioners.
The Office of Sustainability originates with an ecosystems assessment prepared at McGill by SMP during the 2004-2005 year, according to Nadya Wilkinson, SSMU VP University Affairs and Steering Committee member.
The report was intended to be an overarching evaluation of the downtown campus’s progress toward sustainability,  however, it was not taken as seriously because the administration was not involved. She found, though, that SMP learned an important lesson from the incident.
“Student groups needed to bring the walls down and work with the administration rather than just proposing ideas to them,” Wilkinson said.
At first, the SMP’s initiative to create a sustainability centre on campus did not gain momentum. Then, in 2007, McGill decided to create a Director of Sustainability, and allot their campus parking fees – around $200,000 a year – toward a Sustainability Fund.
It was a watershed moment according to Glencross, because after McGill Assistant VP (University Services) Jim Nicell announced his plan to open a Sustainability Office on campus,
Glencross, Wilkinson, and fellow student Alexandre Poisson were then invited to sit on the office’s Steering Committee, along with Nicell and Fortune.
Glencross found, though, that making the University more sustainable is only one piece in a larger puzzle.
“None of us who are involved [with the office] think that the world ends [at McGill],” Glencross said. “We want sustainability to become part of the way we do things, but the larger implication is that it can change the future practices of everyone that leaves here.”

The Canadian Government announced it would allot $225-million over three years in January’s budget to help expand broadband Internet access to rural areas, but critics are saying that Canada’s plans fall behind other countries and that more money is needed.
On the same day the budget was released, University of Ottawa Professor Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law, pointed out that the amount allocated for broadband expansion is lower than the $500-million over five years that the Conservatives promised during the election, and that other countries are far outpacing Canada.
“By comparison, the Australian government has committed AU$4.7-billion [CA$3.9-billion] to a similar initiative,” he wrote on his popular blog.
The U.S. is also outpacing Canada in expanding access. The stimulus bill that is still working its way through the U.S. Congress at different times has suggested between $3-billion and $9-billion for broadband development in under-served areas—the numbers changing as different versions of the bill are amended.
Canada is also languishing in the middle of the pack of developed countries. According to statistics compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canada is behind all the Scandinavian countries, as well as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Korea, in access.
For example, Canada is tenth out of 30 OECD countries for broadband penetration — the number of subscribers per 100 inhabitants — and ranks eighth, with 64 per cent, when the percentage of households with broadband access is considered. On the other hand, Canada is the third-least dense country in the OECD, which makes laying high-speed lines expensive. But, if 90 per cent of the Canadian population lives within a thin band of about 160 kilometres from the U.S. border, and only 64 per cent of the population has access, what is the likelihood that this new funding will actually penetrate into very remote areas?
And the situation is more grim when speed and price are considered. The average advertised broadband speed in Canada is barely half the OECD average, and nine times less than Japan’s. Further, none of Canadian broadband connections are fibre optic cable, which has an advertised maximum of 128 MB/sec in Japan and 13 MB/sec in five other OECD countries – 15 to 150 times faster than the Canadian average.
Canadians also spend the fourth-most for broadband, given comparable purchasing power, with the average monthly price for 128 KB/sec of bandwidth being over US$28.
Nevertheless, the Information Technology Association of Canada, an umbrella organization representing companies that comprised 70 per cent of the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, believe that the budget allocation for broadband, while not everything that is needed, will help the economy in both the short and long term.
“This initiative will engage additional funding from other levels of government and the private sector to continue to expand Canada’s broadband network,” said the organization in a press release.

New perspectives on Culture, Medicine, & Law
Four McGill academics discussed ways in which they integrate disability into their curricula and research at ”Disability on Location,” a panel at McGill’s Disability Symposium, last Tuesday.
The Symposium’s keynote speaker Lennard Davis introduced the speakers by discussing how the field of disability studies integrates the perspectives of culture, medicine, and biotechnology.
“Trying to explain disability studies in five minutes is a bit like summarizing Proust,” joked Davis. “It raises questions about the nature of identity that other fields can but may not.”
Davis pointed out that in cultural disability studies, “Medical’ is sometimes used as a dirty word. But there are important alliances to be made between people with disabilities and the medical community.”
He added that the category of disability is malleable, and the idea of normality depends on “how close you shrink the tip of the bell curve.”
Davis also discussed the  rise of identity studies in the last 34 to 40 years, and the way disability complicates the relationship between identity and the body – as disability exists in the body in very different way from other identity categories, such as race.
The first wave of disability studies aligned itself with other movements such as civil rights struggles and the gay pride movement. The second and third waves focused more on constituting its uniqueness as a category of affiliation.
James McDougall, professor of Psychology at McGill University, discussed legal issues and the hearing impaired. To be declared unfit to stand up in court, one must have a mental disorder; deaf people who do not communicate with sign language would thus pose an issue when on trial.
McDougall cited the example of a Bobby Suwarak, a deaf Nunavat man, to show the faults in our criminal code. He was charged with sexual harassment and was required to plead in court. His form of signing was not considered a language even though it is used commonly by deaf Inuit. Eventually, the court recognized it and found a translator, bringing recognition to the homegrown sign language.
Carolina Pineda discussed Lupus – an auto-immune disease that can attack any tissue or organ, and is most common in women and individuals of non-European descent – as an area of academic inquiry and shared her own personal experience battling the illness.
As an anthropologist, Pineda saw an opportunity to bring visibility to a disease that “holds little social currency, remaining unknown and unimaginable to many.”
Pineda’s talk rendered both the personal and private  spheres significant, as well as the biological and social aspects of illness. Her study of disability perceives the body as readily imbued with meaning and particularity, rather than conceptualized “as a machine to be fixed.”
“I will not forget bodies because when you live with a body like mine, sore and tired, I think that would be hard to do,” she said.
Pineda demonstrated how Anthropology rarely mentions disability, and often privileges the able-bodied male as a model of society. Ethnographic research is perceived as weak if overly influenced by the researcher’s own cultural background, and the American Anthropological Association (AAA) also fails to encourage a rigourous academic inquiry. She referred to it as an “association that problematizes race, [yet] naturalizes disability.
“My silence has not protected me,” proclaimed Pineda, moved almost to tears. “It may have protected me from harsh judgements, given me complicity to the isolation… but with complicity there is no change”
Tara Flanagan of the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology discussed this campaign and the efforts to reduce societal stigmas that are enforced by these types of media representations.
She showed how perceptions of autism centre on victimization of the autistic individual, depicting them as unable to speak for themselves or make fundamental life decisions.
A 2007 ad campaign by the New York Child Study Centre which attempted to raise awareness about psychiatric disabilities by personifying them as violent criminals, and leaving “ransom notes” for the parents of affected children.
One ad read, “We have your son. We will make sure he will not be able to care for himself or interact socially as long as he lives. This is only the beginning. Sincerely, Autism.”
The autistic community fought to end the ransom note campaign in an act of political self-determination, which countered the stereotype of individuals with autism as passive victims.
Carolyn Ells of McGill’s Biomedical Ethics Unit ended the conference with a speech on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.
Ells asked the audience to step away from a stark, individualistic view of self-determination and look to a general respect for the human subject that employs a more nuanced view of autonomy and power.
