Sixth annual march underlines violence against Indigenous women
On Saturday February 14, hundreds of protesters marched in the streets of downtown Montreal as part of the city’s sixth annual Memorial March for Missing and Murdered Women. The march was held to remember and commemorate women of all backgrounds who have been murdered or gone missing, with particular emphasis on murdered and missing Indigenous women.
The march started at 3 p.m. in front of Square Cabot near Atwater Metro and continued peacefully eastward along Ste. Catherine. Those present held signs and chanted slogans, such as, “Bring our sisters home! Bring our daughters home! Bring our mothers home!”
The first memorial march took place in Vancouver in 1991, organized by a group of Indigenous women and frontline workers. It initially started as a response to the failure of police to investigate the murder of a Coast Salish woman. Since 1991, the march has continued as a means of addressing the systematic violence against Indigenous women, pervasive across society and throughout the media landscape.
“If you’re silent, then nothing changes, so I think that the march is to remind the people that it’s not over […]”
Saturday’s demonstration began with performances of various groups as well as chants. Among the performances was a healing song performed by a group of women drummers called Odaya.

Monica Van Schaik, an organizer from Missing Justice, told The Daily that this year’s march was the largest so far. She added that while she believed the march was a good way to show support, it was not enough.
“I think I will only be able to say that enough awareness is being given to the phenomenon of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada when they stop going missing,” Van Schaik said.
The march also aims to highlight the lack of government initiative to investigate these crimes, a criticism that many Indigenous-rights activist groups have been voicing for years.
“As we see, the Harper government ignored this issue and refused to have a public inquiry, refused to put more funding into Indigenous-run and -led organizations [who were trying to raise awareness of the issue] and that makes this march and us being here today so much more important,” Van Schaik said.
“Bring our sisters home! Bring our daughters home! Bring our mothers home!”
One unidentified speaker at the march made references to the Chapel Hill shooting that occurred in North Carolina on February 10, noting that this march was also for other victims of racist violence.
Another unidentified speaker noted the significance of uniting the huge variety of backgrounds and perspectives of those attending the march.
“I don’t know if there is anything that is essentially common to our experiences, to what we mean by violence, to what we mean by women, or to what we mean by memorial,” she said.
She continued, “So my hope is that […] we can walk together today and that we can support one another in a unity that’s composed of unique and complicated realities.”
John Cree, an Kahnawake elder who does presentations at universities on Indigenous awareness, was a speaker at the event, and spoke to The Daily about the importance of the march in cultivating change.
“If you’re silent, then nothing changes, so I think that the march is to remind the people that it’s not over, it’s not a demonstration for one day, it’s a demonstration. […] We’re going to do until change is made.”
Van Schaik spoke to the significance of the event falling on Valentine’s Day, a day catered specifically to cherishing loved ones.
“I think it’s very important and very specific that it’s happening on Valentine’s Day, because on Valentine’s Day, we often show affection and show that women are important within our society and we’re here on the streets to show the same, and to also highlight that women are being devalued within our society,” Van Schaik said.
“They’re going missing, they’re being murdered. Violence is happening toward the women here in Canada and we’re here to say that that needs to stop.”

BRIEF 
In a decision rendered on February 9, Montreal Municipal Court Judge Randall Richmond acquitted three protesters charged under the P-6 bylaw in March 2013, criticizing the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM)’s conduct and providing a potential precedent for similar ongoing court cases involving hundreds of people.
The three defendants, along with 291 other people arrested on March 22, 2013, were fined $637 under article 2.1 of bylaw P-6, which prohibits demonstrating without providing a route to the police. The judge ruled that this provision could only apply to the organizers of the demonstration, and further noted that failure to comply with the article did not create a penal offence, making it legally impossible to convict people on this basis.
“[The decision] is going to have a huge impact on the other P-6 cases that are still moving through the court,” said McGill student and member of the Legal Committee of the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) Kevin Paul in an interview with The Daily.
Although the City of Montreal attempted to argue against the decision, stating that 1,200 people arrested under the bylaw would have to be acquitted, Richmond dismissed this argument, stating that “justice must be served in spite of the consequences.”
In his judgement, Richmond also expressed strong criticism of the SPVM’s handling of the distribution of the statements of offence, which were all signed by the same police officer to expedite the process, even though she had not witnessed the violations.
“Justice must be served in spite of the consequences.”  
“The trivialization of this violation of the law by senior SPVM officers is staggering,” Richmond wrote in the judgement, in French. “It seriously undermines the confidence we can have in the documentary evidence that is used every year in thousands of criminal proceedings.”
“This part of the decision gives further backing to the claim that the SPVM arbitrarily arrested thousands of protesters since the student strike,” ASSÉ stated in a press release sent out on February 10.
For Paul, Richmond’s decision was not a surprise. “Anybody who witnessed the police procedure for mass arrest and ticketing of protesters would not be surprised by the decision to throw out the tickets on the grounds that the accusations were falsified by the police,” he said.
Paul was ambivalent about the effect that the judgement would have on future police behaviour.
“It’s hard to say how the police practices [will] change,” said Paul. “What we learned over the last few years is that the police will always adapt to […] repress demonstrations, and we need to be ready for whatever new laws or measures or police practices arise in response to this decision.”

Replacement for this year’s all-male exec to be selected this week
Last week, the Management Undergraduate Society (MUS) elected a new president and Board of Directors, including U1, U2, and U3 representatives, two representatives to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), and one Senator for the 2015-16 academic year.
Speaking to the Daily, newly elected MUS President Élie Lubendo outlined his priorities for the coming year, and discussed some of the ongoing equity concerns facing the Society.
According to his campaign video, published on the Bull and Bear website, Lubendo ran on a platform that focused on three key issues: fostering a good relationship with the incoming Dean of Management, developing a new five-year strategy for MUS, and bridging the gap between the Society and its constituents.This five-year “Vision 2020” strategy, Lubendo explained, would impact recruitment in human resources (HR) and Dave’s Store, a student-run shop in the Bronfman basement. According to Lubendo, the employees at Dave’s Store are “only paid through [the MUS] payroll.”
This five-year “Vision 2020” strategy, Lubendo explained, would impact recruitment in human resources (HR) and Dave’s Store, a student-run shop in the Bronfman basement. According to Lubendo, the employees at Dave’s Store are “only paid through [the MUS] payroll.”
“They don’t have an employee manual or contracts,” he said, acknowledging the long-term liabilities of the situation. “Right now, it’s [very] under the table.”
“It’s hard to blame the MUS fully for that, when [no women] applied [last year]. Yes, there are eight male executives, but then again, zero women applied. The women who did apply for Board of Directors positions won.”
One issue facing MUS is a lack of gender diversity in leadership positions.
“It’s hard to blame the MUS fully for that, when [no women] applied [last year],” said Lubendo, in response to concerns over the Society’s all-male Executive Council. “Yes, there are eight male executives, but then again, zero women applied. The women who did apply for Board of Directors positions won.”
Lubendo continued, “It’s one of those things that everyone knows [is] definitely an issue, but no one really knows why […] and what exactly the solution is.” Lubendo also divulged that, so far, applicants for the upcoming year’s executive positions have predominantly been women.
Meagan Prins was one of two women elected to the Board of Directors for 2015-16, as the U3 representative. She also served as U2 representative this year.
Commenting on the gender composition of MUS student leadership, Prins said, “As much as I would have loved for there to be a representative proportion of females on the Executive Council last year, I don’t think we can use the events of the past year as sufficient evidence to diagnose a systemic problem.”
“The Board of Directors actively seeks to fill positions with candidates that would best meet the needs of the student population, and these candidates vary in demographic composition from year to year,” she continued.
Another concern for some in MUS is the gap between representatives and their constituents.
According to Lubendo, student involvement is a priority for him. “[The Bachelor of Commerce program gets] over 1,200 applications every year. However, it seems that from year to year it’s always the same students getting involved.”
“Even though we’re a faculty of about 2,200, it really seems like […] it’s being run by 300,” he stated, adding that students may feel intimidated because “they see the MUS as a far-away ivory tower.”
“People want an executive council that they can approach, and that’s something that I think we’ll be able to fix next year,” Lubendo added.
An application package for executive portfolios was released last week. The interview process will take place from February 16 to 18, and the new VPs will be announced on February 19.

Demilitarize McGill denounces lack of transparency
Correction appended February 16, 2015.
McGill mechanical engineering professors David Frost and Andrew Higgins and research associate Samuel Goroshin have signed research contracts with Canada’s Department of National Defence (DND) through companies whose primary shareholders are Frost and Goroshin, documents released on February 11 by campus group Demilitarize McGill have shown.
According to a contract obtained by Demilitarize McGill through an access to information (ATI) request, DND commissioned research titled “Reactivity Study for Gasless Systems” from ZND Inc., a company whose primary shareholder is Frost.
Among other things, ZND Inc. was tasked with “report[ing] on […] experiments on detonation and combustion of heterogenous explosive mixtures to understand and improve the overall performance of heterogenous explosive mixtures.”
Frost, Higgins, and Goroshin collaborated on the research in question, which was valued at over $150,000 and took place in 2009. McGill graduate students also participated in the research, according to Higgins.
“People are free to look at the work we do, and if they think it isn’t appropriate work, they’re free to voice that concern.”
“The documents show that at least three McGill professors […] have been using […] companies in order to sign explosives research contracts with the Canadian military, and do so under reduced scrutiny,” said Kevin Paul, an organizer with Demilitarize McGill, in an interview with The Daily.
Speaking to The Daily, Higgins explained that “most of the work” was done off campus, in the Canadian Explosives Research Laboratory (CERL) in Ottawa. Frost cited reasons of convenience for going through the private company instead of the University.
“It seemed to make sense to do it off campus, and the reason is […] it’s more convenient to rent an off-site facility, rent a technician’s time […] and do these tests intensively over a short period of time,” said Frost.
“We don’t have these facilities [on campus], and so we go to a government testing lab in Ottawa. […] There’s no necessity to go through a McGill research agreement […] and so we go through a private company, which is more convenient,” he continued.
“It’s done completely outside McGill, it’s done by a private company – there’s no reason why it has to go through a review process,” added Higgins.
Goroshin also noted that “the biggest reason [why] sometimes we don’t go through McGill” is that “McGill is too greedy – they take 65 per cent overhead.”
The professors emphasized the “openness” of their research. Frost noted that the professors published some of their findings in journals such as the Journal of Applied Physics after the research was completed.
“People are free to look at the work we do, and if they think it isn’t appropriate work, they’re free to voice that concern,” said Higgins.
For Paul, however, the use of private companies has the effect of hiding the research from public scrutiny.
“Using the companies is also having the effect, today, of making it much harder to find out about this research,” Paul said. “Access to information requests to McGill turned up nothing about these contracts, and McGill denied holding any information on ZND Inc..”
Paul further noted that the research report was not available on the defence research report database maintained by Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), which is DND’s research agency. Frost said that the publication of the report on the database was DRDC’s decision, and that he had no control over it.
Paul also expressed skepticism about the non-involvement of McGill resources in the research. “It simply isn’t credible that this research took place fully outside McGill and without the support of McGill resources,” he said, noting that the contract indicates that the CERL blast chamber was only rented for an estimated four days.
The research also involved electron microscopy and laboratory analysis, and it is unclear where those parts of the research took place. Both Frost and Higgins indicated that they did not remember where the microscopy was conducted, but Frost acknowledged that it could have been done at McGill.
“McGill has general testing facilities,” said Goroshin. “If we need to do electron microscopy and so on, we pay. We pay this on [a] commercial basis.”
According to Frost, Goroshin was the one responsible for subcontracting the microscopy for the research in question.
The Shock Wave Physics Group – which includes Frost, Higgins, and Goroshin – has been a frequent target of Demilitarize McGill’s criticism for the military funding and alleged military applications of its research.
“The Shock Wave Physics Group should be shut down,” said Paul. “It’s research that exists primarily to help the military […] and it shouldn’t exist.”
Although each of the professors emphasized that their research was “fundamental science” and not “weapons development,” Higgins acknowledged its potential military applications.
“We had interest from [DND] to look at [gasless combustion] for different applications,” said Higgins. “One is you can use this gasless combustion to make different materials, you can make very hard ceramics out of this that might be of interest, for example, for making a better armour.”
“Gasless combustion could be used to maybe make better ceramic armour, it’s used in propellants, so they [DND] have also an interest in fundamental understanding of metal combustion,” added Higgins.
In 2009, when the research was conducted, McGill research regulations included a clause requiring applicants for grants whose source is a military agency to disclose the “direct harmful consequences” of their research. Frost and Higgins indicated that the clause never prevented them from undertaking research at McGill before it was struck down in 2010.
“When that clause was in effect […] I would write an additional statement explaining the nature of the work and that then was approved,” said Higgins. “It was never rejected, [but] it did put in some significant delays.”
McGill’s research regulations are currently under review by a committee that includes two student representatives, but Paul was not optimistic about the process.
“There is no policy solution to military research on campus,” said Paul. “Students can and should put pressure on the University through other means.”
A previous version of this article stated that Samuel Goroshin was a McGill professor. In fact, he is a research associate. The Daily regrets the error.

Council votes to oppose international tuition deregulation
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council convened on February 12 to discuss the drafting of standing rules for the upcoming Winter 2015 SSMU General Assembly (GA) and the possibility of a new $2 fee levy in support of the ECOLE project. Council also voted to oppose the deregulation and increase of international tuition fees.
Arts Representative Patrick Dunbar-Lavoie, Science Representative Zacheriah Houston, and Arts and Science Senator Chloe Rourke brought forward a motion to increase accessibility at the upcoming Winter 2015 SSMU GA, to take place in March, by drafting simplified standing rules, engaging volunteers to clarify procedural questions, and holding a motion-writing workshop prior to the GA.
Writing to The Daily, Houston explained that the standing rules will be drafted by the president and the speaker, and ratified by Council in the coming weeks. “Ideally, any standing rules adopted for the GA would be to encourage […] full and free discussion and […] ensure that everyone, including a minority, has an opportunity to be heard,” he explained. “This could include changing the default speaking time […] to ensure that as many members are heard as possible, or rules designed to simply make it easier for members to understand what is going on.”
VP Internal J. Daniel Chaim opposed the motion, arguing that it was unnecessary as SSMU was already committed to accessibility and transparency at GAs. “I do understand the point about some people not liking the rules, but adopting standing rules is a scapegoat,” he said. “It’s not [solving] the issue.”
“We have to bear in mind that this motion was largely […] written with a constituent who felt that the last GA was not accessible, so it was supposed to address some of the issues that came out of last year,” said Rourke, defending the motion. “The GA is a really important forum for SSMU; it’s a really important part of our democracy […] so making it as accessible as possible to students is something I think we should all value.”
Rourke added that these measures would not solve all of the GA’s challenges, but would be “a considerable improvement.”
Despite the continued opposition of Chaim and VP Finance and Operations Kathleen Bradley, the motion passed by a significant margin.
Another motion concerned McGill’s ongoing efforts to deregulate tuition for all academic programs. Brought forward by a number of councillors, including VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette, the motion sought to resolve that SSMU officially oppose the deregulation of international tuition fees and condemn the administration’s lack of transparency and consultation on the issue.
Several councillors advocated tabling the motion until the upcoming GA, arguing that with such an important issue at stake, as many students as possible should be able to contribute directly to the discussion.
“I don’t think we can deny that this motion is something people are a little more divided about,” said Houston, speaking in favour of postponing the vote. “This motion in particular is something that affects different faculties in different ways, and consultation [with councillors’ constituents] is very important.”
VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan disagreed, reminding councillors that this issue formed an important step toward SSMU’s mobilization against austerity. “If we’re talking about building solidarity with other Quebec universities, such as through the anti-austerity mobilization, supporting deregulation is directly affecting them,” she said, going on to argue that deregulation, and the tuition hikes that typically follow, render education increasingly inaccessible to lower-income students.
“While I do think that, under ordinary circumstances, this would be a very appropriate motion for the GA, the issue of timeliness is something that we should be considering,” said Stewart-Kanigan. “Given that the GA is going to be happening quite a lot later this year […] dealing with it now […] may be the more appropriate route.”
After more than an hour of deliberation, Council decided against tabling the motion, and it passed. The vote was taken by roll call at Houston’s request.
Council approved a Winter 2015 referendum question asking students to vote on a new levy of $2 per semester for ECOLE, opt-outable and renewable every three years. ECOLE, which launched its pilot year in September, aims to provide a socially and environmentally sustainable space for research and learning, and bring together sustainability projects from McGill and the wider Montreal community.
ECOLE co-coordinator Brooke Nancekivell explained that while the project has proved highly successful so far, its funding from McGill’s Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) will come to an end in April. Having considered various alternatives, she said, ECOLE’s coordinators determined that a small student fee levy would be the optimal solution.
“In our question, we would be asking for three years of funding,” said Nancekivell. “We’re also saying that during that time we can explore other options […] so that hopefully we can [avoid putting] the burden of [high rent costs] on students.”
President Courtney Ayukawa supported the referendum question, and expressed disappointment that McGill’s administration had been unwilling to negotiate a lower rental fee for ECOLE’s facility, thereby placing the project under increased financial pressure.
Arts Senator Kareem Ibrahim brought forward an amendment increasing the proposed levy to $2.50, but this failed after a lengthy debate.

Allocation of increased government funding left to universities’ discretion
McGill’s internal distribution of government funds allocated to services for students with disabilities remains unclear in the wake of an embezzlement scandal at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM).
On January 31, Le Devoir reported that funds from Quebec’s education ministry – the Ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de la Science (MESRS) – allocated to UQAM for services to students with disabilities were instead going to be used in other programs in the face of budget cuts.
The finding came to light on January 30, during a meeting of UQAM’s Comité de la vie étudiante (CVE). On February 3, it was condemned by UQAM’s Commission des études, or academic policy committee, which passed a resolution calling on the administration to “respect the allocation of dedicated budget, as established by the budget rules,” and demanding that the $900,000 allocated to help students with disabilities be used for that purpose.
UQAM’s administration denied the misuse of funds in a statement published February 3. It declared that the claims made against the university were false, and that the grant of $900,000 was “used according to the conditions provided by the Ministry.”
In an email to The Daily, UQAM management student association spokesperson Mathieu Oligny wrote, “the student associations equally represent all students, and that’s why we continue to hound the leadership on this issue.”
“Effectively, we will be short on our annual budget by 15 per cent starting next May, unless we obtain confirmation of other arrangements in place.”
In the past, disability service providers in Quebec were required to apply for the MESRS subsidy every August, and if approved would receive a direct annual injection of funds. According to Frédéric Fovet, the director of McGill’s Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), this amounted to around $750,000 for all universities combined.
This model is being phased out by the MESRS this academic year, and is being replaced by a $7.5 million funding budget. For this academic year and the following, the funds will be allocated among universities depending on the number of students using disability services, and a new allocation process will be decided by a joint committee featuring MESRS and university representatives by the 2016-17 academic year.
Fovet said that the funding provided to McGill by the MESRS both this year and next year will be in excess of $1 million.
However, “[the OSD has] not yet heard from the central administration the basis on which these funds will be allocated within McGill and the method for determining which actors will play a part in shaping innovative practices these funds will now allow,” Fovet said.
Additionally, in November, the OSD was explicitly informed by the MESRS that it should now look to the wider allotment managed by McGill for its government funding. “Effectively, we will be short on our annual budget by 15 per cent starting next May, unless we obtain confirmation of other arrangements in place,” said Fovet.
This new system was implemented in an attempt to meet the needs of the growing number of students with disabilities who are now enrolling in higher education. According to a statement made by CVE member Gabriel Boileau to Le Devoir, the number of students in Quebec who require these services has risen by 25 per cent in one year, and by 600 per cent in the past five years.
For four years, the OSD has been seeking additional funding in order to create more accessible support programs for students with disabilities. “Faculty and administrators at McGill have often sighed that limited resources restricted the impact of such an initiative,” said Fovet.
With the new grant, Fovet said that he is hopeful that the projects will now be able to move forward with “renewed vigour.”
When asked by The Daily about the publication date of a report detailing McGill’s use of the new MESRS-allocated funds for disability services, Provost Anthony Masi responded, “We have not received from the Ministry specifications or deadlines related to reporting our expenditures for students with disabilities.”
When asked to clarify when a public report will be available, Masi said that the government had not yet asked for a specific report related to disability service spending, but that McGill “make[s] public all [its] financial statements once a year, after they have been audited, usually in late fall.”
Fovet said that he remains hopeful the sum will bring new opportunities for the OSD. “I am confident this injection of dedicated sums by the provincial government will open the door to a new, proactive, and campus-wide process of management of change, that will seek to rapidly and efficiently widen access for all diverse students,” said Fovet.
“With now-adequate funding, there should be few administrative barriers in achieving these goals.”

Saturnin Espoir Ntamba Ndandala and Yony Bresler to face off in PGSS by-election
Correction and update appended January 16, 2015.
On February 10, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its first hustings for the election of the interim secretary-general position following the resignation of Secretary-General Juan Camilo Pinto. The event featured only one of the two candidates, Saturnin Espoir Ntamba Ndandala, who delivered a short speech and answered questions from the audience of approximately thirty people. The other candidate, Yony Bresler, was out of town at a conference, but provided a short written statement read by Chief Returning Officer (CRO) Colby Briggs.
The statements provided by the candidates focused on similar ideas, notably the need for an experienced candidate, and the ability to quickly learn the intricacies of the PGSS governing system and its relationship with the university.
Bresler highlighted how his previous involvement with both PGSS and the McGill Graduate Association of Physics Students (MGAPS) allowed him to learn about “the various aspects of our student governance bodies, including procedures, activities, and ongoing issues.” Ntamba Ndandala, while noting that this was his first semester at McGill, pointed to his previous leadership roles as president of the student societies at the University of Cape Town, Sorbonne University in Paris, and the University of Toronto, as evidence of his “great expertise in leadership.”
On policies, both candidates’ platforms emphasized the need for greater transparency in PGSS. Bresler noted that, if elected, he would introduce “strict timelines for existing practices such as the release of minutes,” thereby giving PGSS members a quick and reliable source of information about the society’s activities and discussions.”
Most strikingly, the event highlighted the substantial contrasts between the candidates’ visions and leadership styles.
“As far as my goals if elected, I would be tempted to make bold and ambitious statements. However, given the short-term nature of the interim position […] my main goal would be to consolidate and assist in the activities of the current executive and Council officers,” wrote Bresler in his statement.
Ntamba Ndandala, on the other hand, enthusiastically outlined his plan to challenge the University on the issue of student funding, to create new fundraising events so that a minimum level of funding for every PhD student at McGill could be established, and to introduce a mandatory sexual harassment awareness plan where “new PhD and [post-graduate] students at McGill would be quizzed on the school’s sexual harassment and bullying policies.”
On PhD student funding, Ntamba Ndandala pointed to the growing problem of “students in some departments not getting sufficient funding.” He noted that other top universities in North America, namely Harvard and Stanford, provided individual funding for each PhD student to pursue independent research; he challenged McGill to provide a reason why it couldn’t do the same.
In response to these ideas, an audience member questioned Ntamba Ndandala’s ability to understand the “extremely complicated bureaucratic machines” of PGSS and McGill. Acknowledging this issue, the candidate clarified that his platform would extend beyond the interim, toward a second full term as secretary-general next year.
The voting period for this by-election runs from February 18 to 24.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Yony Bresler had previous experience with the Physiology Graduate Student Association (PGSA). In fact, he has experience with the McGill Graduate Association of Physics Students (MGAPS). The Daily regrets the error.
The article has also been updated to reflect the reason of Bresler’s absence at the hustings.

Social Justice Days event examines Israeli policies
Updated February 17, 2014.
On February 12, attendees convened at “The Face of State Violence and Police Brutality in Palestine,” the latest workshop in the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill and the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)’s Social Justice Days 2015 series.
Facilitating the workshop were Maggie Gilligan and Zahra Habib, members of McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), a student organization that advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people.
The workshop offered an overview and discussion of the ways in which state violence and police brutality are used by Israel against Palestinians as part of a larger apartheid project.
The event began with a discussion of the ways in which state violence manifests visually in the lives of Palestinians, illustrating how these effects originate from institutions, such as the Israeli government and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), as well as ideologies like racism, Zionism, and settler-colonialism.
“What’s important to understand is that these are not isolated incidents,” said Habib, referencing the Israeli government’s disproportionate use of force. Habib cited the Dahiya doctrine, which calls for the use of asymmetrical warfare as a means of deterrence. Habib said that, although this doctrine violates the principle of proportionality in international law, it manifests itself on a daily basis for Palestinians through large-scale aerial raids (such as in Gaza last summer), home raids and demolitions, and arbitrary arrests, even of children.
Gilligan told The Daily that this kind of workshop is an important counterbalance to the dehumanizing effects of the Israeli and Western media. “The state violence perpetuated by the Israeli government is a very important part of the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is a part that is missed at best and silenced at worst,” she said. “So we think it is important to put forth the voices of civilians and children who have been harmed by state-sanctioned policies, and make sure everyone’s story is being told.”
One topic discussed was how to unpack the way Israeli and Western media tends to dehumanize Palestinians, and portray instances of state violence as responses to Palestinian dissidence.
In the discussion, workshop attendee Nadir Khan asserted that the world knows Israelis are using disproportionate force against Palestinians, but the magnitude of the violence and damage does not seem to resonate enough for the international community to demand change. Khan went on to question what students could do to bring about concrete change.
“The state violence perpetuated by the Israeli government is a very important part of the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is a part that is missed at best and silenced at worst.”
Ralph Haddad, a U2 Middle Eastern Studies and Women’s Studies stdent and former Daily editor, suggested countering the Israeli public relations machine as a method. “We should employ emerging media that exist outside of that sphere to further our own cause […] because Israel is known to employ students and employees in giant operations, using Facebook and Twitter and social media to spread propaganda to gain sympathy for the IDF. There is no way to counter that without stopping [the perpetration of] our own rhetoric.”
Haddad also stressed the need to recognize the connections between Palestinian struggles and other struggles. Intersectionality “makes us stronger,” he said.
During the workshop, Gilligan highlighted increasing awareness of the intersectionality between black struggles in the U.S. and those in Palestine, as both governments respond to dissent with similar repression. “It’s important to make this connection because they stem from the same place and I think a lot of similar strategies can be used to combat them. And again another direct link is that one of the police forces that was used in
Ferguson to calm protesters was trained by the IDF. So we have the policy links, the theoretical links, we also have a lot of direct links that are a lot closer than we think.”

Community members say sexual assault survivors need more support
Both students and community groups seem to be reaching a consensus that the systems that deal with sexual assault need to change. Dissatisfaction with the system has been ongoing for decades, recently fuelled by events such as the reports of sexual assault by former Redmen players and well-publicized assaults by taxi drivers, among others.
McGill Law students and other community members discussed with The Daily how rape culture affects the way sexual assault cases are handled by the judicial system, and spoke to a growing need for alternative, pro-survivor approaches for responding to sexual assault.
“Right now we don’t even have a system designed to catch most sexual assault cases,” Annie O’Dell, a member of the Feminist Collective of McGill Law who has experienced sexual assault, told The Daily. “Most of it is ignored, forgotten about, or dealt with on a personal level.”
Forms of support for sexual assault survivors – namely sexual assault centres – are often inaccessible. According to Nathalie Duhamel, coordinator at the Regroupement Québécois des CALACS, a non-profit that supports a network of sexual assault centres, the Quebec network has gaping holes that make transportation difficult or impossible for some.
“There is not a single sexual assault centre in Northern Quebec,” she said.
Sexual assault survivors face difficult choices before deciding to report the assault – many choose to remain silent. Campaigns such as #BeenRapedNeverReported have created awareness of the overwhelming proportion – roughly 94 per cent according to SexAssault.ca, a resource for survivors – of sexual assault cases that aren’t reported.
Duhamel said that not enough acknowledgement is given to the social implications of a survivor deciding to come forward.
“What’s intimidating, firstly, is the step forward, and acknowledging that you’ve been a victim of a sexual assault,” Duhamel told The Daily. “Women feel that there’s an impact with their family, with their friends, in their jobs.”
O’Dell said that, based on a paper by University of Ottawa criminology professor Holly Johnson, the primary form of dealing with sexual assault in Canada is criminal law, which only addresses 3 per cent or less of all sexual assaults.
According to SexAssault.ca, prosecutors have “the power to force [a survivor’s] testimony and will do so if they feel it is in the public interest.”
“The legal system will break into your life, challenge your credibility to prove that you consented even though you did not,” said O’Dell.
Part of the problem is in how rape culture infiltrates the courtroom, Karen Trane*, member of McGill Women and the Criminal Law, told The Daily in an email.
“People still believe a drunk or scantily dressed woman ‘was asking for it’ [or …] that if a woman consents to sex with a man once, he has free reign over her body forever, [or …] that women actually falsely report sexual assault for revenge or a laugh,” she said.
According to Trane, these normalized ideas can – and do – seep into the courts. Under the “rape shield law,” a defence lawyer is not allowed to infer that the survivor “was asking for it” or to cast doubt on their credibility by asking about their sexual history. They often ask anyway, however, during the survivor’s testimony. If the Crown does not object to the defence’s line of questioning, the survivor could give an answer that might affect the views of the jury, judge, and others present.
According to Trane, another problem is that these distorted understandings of consent make it especially difficult for the survivor to prove their testimony beyond a ‘reasonable’ doubt.
“The legal system will break into your life, challenge your credibility to prove that you consented even though you did not.”
“All the accused has to do is say he ‘thought’ the survivor was consenting and throw in any mildly plausible excuse to justify his ‘mistake,’” said Trane. “Never mind that a person who is incapacitated by drugs or alcohol cannot legally consent to sex [… and is] legally not allowed to claim he ‘thought she was into it’ if he was drunk.”
Duhamel explained that the likelihood of proving a survivor’s case beyond a reasonable doubt is a major factor in whether or not the case is prosecuted at all. “Not all complaints are selected or kept by Crown prosecutors, it depends on the facts and if the Crown prosecutor feels that he has a chance to establish proof without a doubt.”
The decision to prosecute comes at the end of a long string of legal procedures that sexual assault survivors would have to follow, if they decide to report their case.
When the survivor turns to the judicial system, the first thing a survivor must do is account for every detail surrounding the assault, and either sign a written statement or make a statement on film. This is all followed by medical examinations and police investigations. Only after a few weeks or months is the case finally turned over to the provincial Crown prosecutor.
“Other than [the criminal system] there is the civil system – you can technically sue somebody for sexual assault, but that is expensive, and the cost is on the survivor to do this,” said O’Dell.
Although a new sexual assault policy is being revised by a student working group, currently there is no specific policy in place at McGill that deals specifically with sexual assault cases.
O’Dell explained that the current process at McGill is the same as the process for dealing with claims of plagiarism.
“All the accused has to do is say he ‘thought’ the survivor was consenting and throw in any mildly plausible excuse to justify his ‘mistake.’”
“For plagiarism, you have the right to face your accuser. [If] a professor says that you have plagiarized your paper you have the right to interview and question your professor,” said O’Dell. “For sexual assault, the person being accused has the right to question the survivor and be in the same room – so already just the way it works is very problematic.”
Students at McGill are currently leading the drafting of a new sexual assault policy, the main goal of which is to get the University to adopt a pro-survivor approach that offers services and options to survivors.
“In most cases of sexual assault, reactions and policies tend to focus on the perpetrator: whether they’re ‘guilty,’ what sort of action should be taken, whether and how they should be disciplined,” the Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS) wrote in a statement to The Daily. “Instead, we want to put the focus back on the survivors, and on ensuring they feel safe and are supported.”
“There’s really nothing in place for the average person who doesn’t want to have their life torn to pieces at trial, which still often happens in a university administration setting. That’s why this policy needs to happen,” said O’Dell.
“We need to allow people to have that space to be believed and supported, because it doesn’t exist outside.”

BRIEF
On February 9, an open letter with the signatures of over 100 McGill faculty members was submitted to the Board of Governors (BoG) by the McGill Faculty for Divestment campaign. The letter was distributed just one week after Divest McGill submitted a 150-page research brief to the BoG’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), and calls on the administration to divest McGill’s endowment fund from fossil fuel companies.
In an email to The Daily, Divest McGill organizer and U3 Environmental Sciences student Kristen Perry spoke to the significance of this faculty backing.
“I think that faculty support will absolutely play a role in the ultimate decision by the Board. When they are hearing the call for divestment from multiple parts of the McGill community – students, faculty, alumni, staff – that only strengthens the message that we want McGill’s investments to reflect the values we extol, including a commitment to sustainability and leadership.”
According to McGill professor Darin Barney, he and other faculty members were approached about a year ago to start developing formal faculty support for divestment.
“I would say [McGill Faculty for Divestment] was really prompted by the students of Divest McGill,” said Barney.
The letter, which is still open to signatures, has received support from professors in a range of departments from Art History to Physics.
“We were quite pleased with the level of faculty support […] we still think we can do better, but our goal was to get 100 signatures by the time the petition and brief were submitted by Divest McGill [to CAMSR], and we exceeded that goal,” said Barney.

While Divest McGill has been organizing on campus for over two years, signatory McGill professor Shaun Lovejoy was not surprised that McGill has been slow on the uptake.
“McGill – the administration and BoG – are a pretty conservative bunch,” Lovejoy told The Daily. “I don’t think they want to be the first to do something like this, but I doubt they want to be the last.”
According to Barney, McGill Faculty for Divestment has broader plans moving forward.
“We’re now moving into the phase where we’re going to be liaising with some of the faculty groups that are at campuses across the world […and] approach different kinds of faculty bodies at McGill to try to get collective support [for divestment].”
Perry said that Divest McGill also plans to continue working with McGill Faculty for Divestment.
“We are certainly going to be continuing to work with these wonderful faculty members. There is already a dedicated group of them working on promoting divestment, and they seem to have lots of energy and ideas, so we’re excited to move forward.”
