Referendum Question Regarding SACOMSS Fee Renewal.
Categorically yes. As the whereas clauses for this referendum state, SACOMSS provides essential services to the McGill and Montreal communities. The renewal of this $.075 will ensure that victims of sexual assault will have access to essential support when they need it most.
Referendum Question Regarding SSMU Charity Committee and Fund
Yes. The motion proposes to centralize charity organizing on campus into one 13-member SSMU committee, with admirable involvement of community organizations. Our endorsement comes with the understanding that there will be regular reports of its activities to the SSMU council, and that the committee will be entirely transparent. A charity committee should also not be used as an excuse to further the goal of “de-politicizing” SSMU.
Plebiscite Question Regarding Addition of an Interfaculty Arts and Science Representative on the SSMU Legislative Council
Yes. The reasons for this endorsement are obvious, interfaculty students deserve representation on SSMU council as much as any other faculty.

New plans for controversial interchange to be released tomorrow
Following a meeting Thursday evening between Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay and Richard Bergeron, the leader of the Projet Montréal municipal party, Bergeron was forced to resign from his role on the Montreal Executive Committee. Tremblay asked members of his executive committee to unconditionally support the plan for the Turcot interchange developed by the Ministère des transports du Québec (MTQ), which Bergeron refused to do.
Bergeron was head of urban development on the executive committee, and threatened to quit last week if the Mayor went ahead and approved a provincial plan that was not in line with the city’s proposal concerning the interchange.
City hall’s project proposal was produced last April and approved by the heads of the three municipal parties. In the wake of his expulsion, Bergeron voiced his opposition to the Mayor’s demands.
“I think it was unfair,” Bergeron stated in a press conference Friday. He had not had access to the report for the past three months, but the last version he saw did not meet the demands his party outlined, including those for public transit. The plan was being reassessed during the past few months after being rejected by the province’s environmental commission, the Bureau d’audiences publique sure l’environnement (BAPE).
Darren Becker, a spokesperson for Tremblay, explained the Mayor’s choice.
“Mr. Bergeron has been making waves in the recent weeks about certain conditions for him to stay or leave regarding the project,” he said. “[The Mayor] wanted his executive committee to be united on the issue. Mr. Bergeron said that he couldn’t guarantee the Mayor that, so the Mayor said to leave.”
In response to whether opposition and special interest groups have had adequate say in the development of the Turcot plan, Becker said, that “The city of Montreal submitted a counterproposal in April done by Vision [Montréal] and Projet [Montréal], and the Mayor’s office, the Mayor’s team. So I mean they already had influence.”
A replacement for Bergeron’s position on the executive has not yet been announced.
“The Mayor didn’t say that he’s not open to looking at other members of Projet [Montréal] to fill this position,” said Becker.
The  MTQ is set to unveil the new plans for the Turcot interchange on Tuesday. Although details of the plans have not been publicly released, Becker asserts that the new project “responds to important criteria that the city set out” concerning the issues of housing expropriations, and public transit, and embankments–building on lower instead of higher elevations.
Sources have suggested, however, that the new project plans will not serve to reduce traffic and will involve housing expropriations, according to Radio-Canada. The details will be confirmed tomorrow with the release of the official MTQ plan. Louise Harel, leader of Vision Montréal – the Official Opposition of the City of Montreal – has pointed out that constructing an embanked roadway will serve to isolate communities.
One neighbourhood which will be particularly affected by the project is St. Henri, in Montreal’s Southwest borough. Benoît Dorais, the borough’s Mayor, has said that if the plans do not meet the needs of Southwest citizens, there will be significant protests.

Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson released a memo to the press last week originally addressed from his office to the Board of Governors that has shed light on the closure of the Architecture Café. The memo reveals that the Café employed 76 students; had accounting shortcomings resulting in $3,000 of missing cash; and that in 2009-2010, the Café did run a deficit, but that this was primarily the result of a management structure imposed in 2007 by the administration. It has also become clear that there was widespread confusion among students and administrators as to the division of responsibilities during the three years the Café operated under mixed management.
McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS) Director Mathieu Laperle repeatedly used the phrase “grey zone” to describe his department’s duties in managing the Architecture Café. Much of this confusion apparently was the result of a major reorganization of McGill’s food landscape just before the start of the 2008-2009 school year.
In the fall of 2007, when the Café was briefly shut down and then reopened after widespread student protest, it was folded into Ancillary Services, the precursor to MFDS. In the summer of 2009, all food services on campus were “amalgamated” under the newly created MFDS, including the Architecture Café.
Laperle said that his predecessor provided him with some of the Café’s history, but that the situation remained “unclear” when he took over.
Mendelson’s newly-released report details a series of meetings throughout 2009 and the winter of 2010, in which the student managers of the Café and MFDS addressed problems such as payroll, inventory control, and financial accountability. The meetings constituted an attempt to bridge the gap between the two groups and rectify the Café’s mismanagement. “Achievements,” the Provost’s document reads, “were limited, driven in part by the management structure.”
The administration’s February 2010 internal audit, referred to in the document, presented MFDS with an ultimatum: close the Café or implement “proper controls…to ensure that all funds are being collected, properly recorded and deposited.” The administration – not MFDS, Laperle maintains – then opted to close the Café at the end of the fiscal year in May.
Mendelson’s recent document also reveals that “a notice of closure was in effect for approximately six years,” starting in 2000, indicating that closing the Café had been an administration priority for the better part of a decade.
The Café, the document says, was opened in 1993, “without authorization.” Asked why the administration waited 14 years to take action on the Café, Mendelson referenced an “administrative understanding,” in place since the late 1990s, that food services would be “repatriated” – taken over by the administration. Mendelson added that most of the 14 years in question came before his tenure as Deputy Provost. Mendelson was appointed McGill’s first Deputy Provost of Student Life and Learning on July 17, 2006.
Listed as “Outstanding problems as of May, 2010,” the document shows that the Café handled an average of 531 transactions a day, totaling $1,345. Another “outstanding problem,” was the implementation of the Martlet Meal Plan, which MFDS and the administration were pushing for, but students opposed, and which the Café did not honour.
Under the heading of “Alternatives to closing the Café,” the document says that “MFDS has offered to work with [SSMU] to relocate the Architecture Café to the [Shatner Building], but SSMU has not accepted.”
SSMU President Zach Newburgh said that the offer was made at a September 2 meeting between SSMU executives and Mendelson, and that Mendelson’s remark was “taken jokingly.” Newburgh added that, “housing it in our building would be a complete defeat.”

Ala Jaradat discusses the military order in the Occupied Territories and Israel
The McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) hosted Ala Jaradat this past Wednesday in Chancellor Day Hall. Jaradat is involved with ADDAMEER Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a Palestinian NGO.
“The percentage of Palestinian adult males who have been to prison [is] between sixty per cent and eighty per cent,” said Jaradat during his talk. “My father was imprisoned, my uncle was imprisoned, I was imprisoned, and if I ever have children, they will be imprisoned until this occupation ends.” The Daily spoke with Jaradat after the talk.
The McGill Daily: What is ADDAMEER?
Ala Jaradat: I’m part of a human rights organization that works against political repression, for political prisoners, opposing the use of torture, arbitrary detention, or the fair trial using different mechanisms. One of them is providing free legal aid to political prisoners, free legal representation, intervening legally on their behalf against any of the violations, attempting to use the local legal systems, filing complaints and intervention on an international level, and trying to use UN protection mechanisms or universal jurisdiction. Additionally, what we do is advocacy work – in terms of monitoring and documentation and the use of that information to write legal analyses or reports on conditions of detention which are used internationally or trying individual cases and raising awareness on individual cases on local, domestic and international levels. Besides that, we provide training to Palestinian lawyers on international law and the possibility of being able to use international law in their work on the ground and we work with human rights youth activists trying to provide them with skills that they can use in terms of advocating for the rights of the people and protecting local communities rights, lobbying, advocacy, and media work.
MD: How does Palestinian imprisonment compare to imprisonment elsewhere in the world?
AJ:  The Palestinian prison issue cannot be understood in terms and concepts that currently in the world are accepted as talking about prisoners and about prison systems. We are here talking about a colonial project. We are talking about a form of military occupation. Palestinians are being arrested and detained for political reasons and for allegedly taking part in activities related to the conflict, or trying to live or defy the mechanisms and the measures and the policies of the military occupation that is about to appropriate their land, water and all of their natural resources: the defense of these measures is the reason behind the arrest and detention. So, the nature of the Palestinian prisoners’ population by far is not very similar to other prisoner populations. You can compare it only to smaller groups of prisoners in different parts of the world, political prisoners or in areas of conflict where there are people on different sides of conflict being imprisoned. You can compare it to other eras of colonialism and prisoners in those prisons in the past. Palestinians are not being imprisoned because they pose a threat to their own society or according to laws agreed upon by their own society. These are people being imprisoned because of violating laws that are determined by the occupier and the colonizer.
MD: How does the military order function in the Occupied Territories?
AJ: Basically, under international law, an occupying power has the right to establish a military court system and arrest and detain people under [this system of] military courts. But the way Israel has practiced the military court system was totally beyond their rights as an occupying power. Israel, with the military court system, gave itself the jurisdiction over many aspects of the Palestinians’ lives. The military order and military court system totally overrides any preexisting laws and Israel uses them selectively. The military courts chose and the military commander chose to give themselves jurisdiction over civilian lives, over any civil, economical, cultural, political aspect of the lives of Palestinians. And the military commander, who is assigned by the state of Israel, gave himself the sole powers to rule every aspect of the Palestinians’ lives.
MD: What is considered illegal according to the military order? On what grounds can somebody get arrested?
AJ: There are over 1,650 military orders by now, and these military orders govern almost every aspect of the lives of the Palestinians: from what they can read, to what they cannot read; what kind of activities they can do, to what they cannot do. Military orders limit freedom of expression, freedom of association, academic freedom and so on, just to name a few. Any kind of social organization is illegal. Any kind of community organization or mobilization is illegal. Any kind of political activity is illegal. Basically, these military orders almost illegalize your day-to-day life as a Palestinian. You can find yourself easily and simply at any moment, in violation of one or another of the military orders, just by trying to live and provide for life.
MD: What happens once somebody is detained initially? Do they have access to lawyers?
AJ: The military orders include provisions on how the whole process is regulated. Under this process, they can prohibit from the moment of arrest and detaining a person meeting legal counsel or a lawyer, for a period of about ninety days, continuously or uncontinuously. And uncontinuously means that it can be extended to even more than ninety days by giving orders to private meeting with a lawyer for three days at a time or five days at a time, making it stretch to 180 days without meeting a lawyer.
MD: What are the conditions like in the prisons?
AJ: The least we can say about the detention conditions is that they are totally inhumane detention conditions, under which Palestinians are subject to harsh treatments, continuous neglect of providing health care, overcrowded conditions, extremely difficult hygiene situations, lack of health conditions, in terms of ventilation, light and denial of communication with the outside world. No phone calls are allowed, family visits are very controlled and limited, with continuous denial of giving permits to families to visit – basically totally inhumane conditions of detention.
MD: What is “Administrative Detention”?
AJ: Administrative detention is an administrative as opposed to legal procedure, where a military commander can issue an order to detain a person for a period that varies from one month to six months under the pretext that this person forms a threat to the security of the region and the population, based on a secret file and secret information that neither the detainee nor any counsel or lawyer can have access to.  At the end or before the end of the detention order, it can be renewed and there are no limitations on how many times this detention order can be renewed. Palestinians can spend five years to eight years in prison under administrative detention. Their detention order is renewed every couple of months, without ever knowing when they are going to be released, or if they are going to be released, without ever knowing why they are being detained and for what reasons.

Rencontres des partenaires de l’éducation falls during exams; students think timing designed to keep them away
In a press release last Thursday, the Ministry of Education announced that the Rencontres des partenaires de l’éducation – an annual meeting of student groups, administrators, and provincial politicians – will be held on December 6. Student lobby groups are complaining that the proposed date, which falls during exams at many schools, is inconvenient and will prevent them from attending, either as picketers or participants.
The agenda for the Rencontres lays out, in French, three themes for the meeting: what “principles” to pursue in raising tuition; how to direct financial aid to maintain accessibility to education; and what to do with the “additional revenue” gained by raising tuition.
All of the major provincial student lobby groups have been expecting the government to table plans for tuition increases at the meeting, and some students are boycotting the event.
SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi suggested that the Ministry was aware that the date comes at a busy time for students, saying that the “minister of education definitely knew that students were planning on going and demonstrating during the meeting,” and that the timing of the Rencontres “makes it harder for students to go protest during the meeting.”
Joël Pedneault, Vice-Secretary General of the Quebec Students Roundtable (QSR), echoed Zaidi’s sentiment and added that the lack of time students have been given to prepare for the Rencontres is an indication of the Ministry’s disregard for student opinion.
“What we think is deplorable about the timing of the meeting is that it doesn’t give students a lot of time to prepare for it,” he said. “The Ministry hasn’t even announced what will be said at the meeting, and they’re only giving us a day to discuss the issues. To properly discuss these issues in a democratic forum we would need more than a day.”
Louis-Philipe Savoie, president of the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), said he was skeptical that the Rencontres would serve as a venue for student consultation. He noted that the ministry is already committed to raising tuition, as first stated in the March 30 budget. But Savoie reaffirmed FEUQ’s intention to attend the meeting.
“Since 2007, the Fédération has asked the Ministry of Education for a wide-ranging consultation on every issue that concerns university education. However, with today’s announcement, we must say that our demands have not been met,” he said.
The Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) will proceed with plans to boycott the Rencontres and picket outside the meeting in hopes of preventing negotiations from taking place. ASSÉ’s Secretary of Coordination, Élise Carrier-Martin, said that the organization plans to call for a student strike on December 6, in hopes of avoiding scheduling conflicts between exams and the Rencontres.
She told The Daily in French, “It’s clear that the Ministry chose that date, knowing that it was during exams in order to make it harder for students and ASSÉ members to turn up and make sure the meeting isn’t held. We already decided that we would vote for a day of strike on December 6 so as to not prevent people with exams from attending the protest.”
On October 17, ASSÉ reported on their website that a government official had leaked the Ministry’s plans for raising tuition, which were to be revealed publicly at the Rencontres. The alleged plans showed that the government is considering raising tuition to the Canadian average – $5,138 for undergraduates and $5,182 for graduates – over four years. The ministry has denied that ASSÉ’s numbers are accurate.
Despite the Rencontres’s controversial timing, Carrier-Martin believes that many students will turn up to demonstrate against tuition increases.
“A lot of students are so furious about the Ministry’s attempts to increase tuition to the national average that they will be motivated to mobilize and demonstrate. We want to send a clear message to the Quebec government and to the general population that there was absolutely no consensus among students for tuition increases,” she said.

Eric Andrew-Gee explores student opposition to the corporatization of campuses
“Yes, we are for accessible education. But we have to ask: What kind of education?”
Speaking in French, Martin Robert – a leading researcher for the student lobby group Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) – answered his own question in the negative many times over: “Education should not serve economic growth;” “education must not be transformed into profit;” “We cannot deny the fact that universities, more and more, are aimed toward solving the economy’s problems.”
Increasingly, the Quebec student movement is lining up behind Robert’s assessment. They are opposed to their universities’ growing role in “the knowledge economy,” which thrives on marketing new ideas, partly through corporate investment in academic research.
For example, a report McGill submitted to the National Assembly in September shows that in 2008, McGill received $30.3 million in research funding from industry, a spike of 73 per cent from 2003. The phenomenon is nation-wide: between 1997 and 2007, Canadian universities saw their research and development spending grow at the fastest rate among OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.
Robert and those that agree with him are fighting a lonely fight. In their opposition to this trend, students are clashing with the federal and Quebec governments, government-affiliated think tanks, and university administrations.
Corporate funding of research is nothing new, nor is student skepticism about the practice. But this school year, the “knowledge economy” has become something of a buzzword in Quebec student politics. On October 16, Robert gave a presentation to the monthly meeting of the Quebec Student Roundtable (QSR), laying out ASSÉ’s position on the danger facing universities.
“The function of universities is being transformed to doing more research…to be used by the market,” said Robert, in the Break Out room of Shatner, where the meeting was held. Representatives from eleven student unions across Quebec were present.
At a symposium on post-secondary education in Shatner on October 22, the idea came up repeatedly.
“We are in danger of creating a Canadian version of an industrial-educational complex. … The absence of protest is a green light for exploitation,” commented PGSS VP External Ryan Hughes at the event.
ASSÉ’s research committee is at work on a paper expanding their position on the “knowledge economy.” QSR is set to take a position on universities’ role in the knowledge economy at their next meeting, on November 13.
The flurry of activity on a single, fairly abstract issue begs the question, “Why now?” Different student groups have different explanations. SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi, who sits on QSR’s board, pointed to fears about outside influence on universities sparked by Bills 38 and 44 last year. The bills, which died after fierce opposition from students and administrators alike, were the Liberal government’s attempt to mandate a certain number of members for each of Quebec universities’ governance board.
“Ideally, universities should be controlled fully in a collegial manner – so by its own members, whether its administration, staff, students,” she said. “When external groups start getting involved, students and other members of the university will be losing power. I think today, student groups realize more and more how much power they’re losing.”
Robert drew a connection between the student movement’s preoccupation with tuition hikes and opposition to the knowledge economy.
“Increased tuition follows the logic of the knowledge economy,” he said. Corporations involved in research, “impose their manner of organization and functioning on universities.” The result, Robert says, is that universities are run more and more like business, with services (like teaching) and goods (like diplomas) sold for market value. This is anathema to ASSÉ, who advocate for abolishing tuition.
Others have different reasons for opposing university complicity in the knowledge economy. Robert Sonin of Free Education Montreal sees the exact opposite of what universities should strive to be in the relentless commercial drive of businesses.
“[Now] if you say, ‘It’s good to have an ambulance service,’ you have to justify it in dollars and cents. … It’s not just good to have a hospital; you have to make it profitable,” said Sonin.
He said he was alarmed by the knowledge economy, “because it’s a code word for corporatization. It’s not bringing knowledge into the economy, it’s bringing businesses into universities.”
Sonin said that universities used to “leave it to the researchers” to decide what they would research. Now, he argued, “they’re chained to a commercial imperative,” by corporate-funded research.
“If you’re going to invest money in the schools – and they [businesses and the government] always frame it as an investment–they want a return.”
“Researchers who are interested in something really ephemeral have to justify grant proposals by saying it’s going to make a better shampoo,” he said. “You have to monetize your research.”
Sonin said he thought the place for companies to do profitable research is in private labs. He pointed out that Bell Canada’s telecommunications research, which has been “a huge benefit to society,” was not done in universities.
He insisted, however, that marketable applied research does have a place, if a small one, in post-secondary institutions. “There is room for both” research and development and pure science, he said.
Marie Malavoy, Member of the National Assembly for the Taillon riding in Longueuil and Parti Québécois education critic, said corporate investment in university research should be undertaken with caution.
On the phone from Quebec City, she said in French that academic freedom must be guarded against researchers, “finding results that show in one way or another something that will create value for companies.”
“We need to leave place for people who are just interested in advancing science,” she continued.
Louis-Philipe Savoie, president of the Fédération des étudiantes universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), the province’s biggest student lobby group, took a similar position to Malavoy’s in an interview last Thursday.
He conceded that recent federal bursaries that focused heavily on business programs were “an example of the government trying to…restrain academic freedom.”
But while Robert said ASSÉ is “fundamentally opposed to the knowledge economy,” Savoie said that it is a fact of life and “not a problem.”
“The economy has changed, it will continue to change. That’s fine,” he continued.
He went on to say that he would like to see increased corporate funding of research at universities. “If there is more financing that is available to do university-level research that is quality research, and that does not impede academic freedom, I don’t see why not.”
He added that it’s bad if corporate funding “directs the research…or if it falsifies conclusions, but this is a rare phenomenon. … There are policies in universities to make sure there is quality research being done.”
Numerous governmental bodies, think tanks, and university administrations agree that the private sector must be more involved in university research. Three weeks ago, the Canadian University Press (CUP) reported that the federal government was undertaking a review of private-sector research in Canada, including research at universities. The aim of the review is to encourage Canadian companies to spend more on research and development.
CUP also reported that the day before the federal review was announced, a group called Coalition for Action on Innovation in Canada (CAIC) released a report with similar goals. CAIC is headed by former Liberal MP John Manley and Paul Lucas, president and CEO of pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline Canada, whose British parent company recently paid a $750-million settlement in criminal and civil cases charging that the company sold contaminated baby ointment and an ineffective anti-depressant.
CAIC’s October 13 report calls for more government funding to help university researchers “commercialize” their research. The report’s advice could not be more diametrically opposed to Sonin and Martin’s position.
“An important step [for the federal government] would be to raise the level of funding for research programs that entail partnerships between business and academia,” the report reads. “Other countries, notably the United States, provide more extensive support of indirect costs, including the funding of much more robust industry liaison and technology transfer offices.”
The Science, Technology, and Innovation Council of Canada (STIC), an arm’s-length agency that reports to the Ministry of Industry, constitutes another voice calling for more commercial university research. McGill’s Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum is a member of STIC.
In a May 2009 STIC press release, Munroe-Blum wrote, “Business, universities, colleges, non-profit institutions, communities and all levels of government…need to work together to nurture the capacity to create, apply new ideas and finance their translation into commercial successes in the global marketplace.”
Many students have begun despairing of this view. Martin said he thought universities should “fund teaching as much as research…and pure research as much as applied research.”
Sonin complained that the model of economic expedience “was being transferred to the humanities and social sciences, and they don’t produce that kind of knowledge.”
“It’s reasonable [for taxpayers] to ask that there be some benefit [from universities], but it doesn’t have to be a direct economic benefit,” he went on.
“People forget that school is good in itself.”
