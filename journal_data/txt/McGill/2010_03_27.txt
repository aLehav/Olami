Activists fight for 130-year-old institution, saying it provides a good environment and fresh produce for prisoners
Canadian artists, academics, and activists gathered for a concert in Kingston last Saturday to oppose the closure of prison farms across the country.  This action was initiated by the Canadian Musicians Support Prison Farms (CMSPF) campaign.
In 2008, the federal government initiated a strategic review of Corrections Service Canada, concluding that prison farming was outdated and that the program would come to an end by March of next year.
Prison farms have been operating in Canada since the 1880s, providing inmates with experience in the agricultural industry and the opportunity to learn hands-on skills. At present, six farms employ 300 inmates at minimum-security prisons in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and New Brunswick. Produce from these farms is used within the prisons and supplied to nearby correctional facilities.
“I think everyone in Canada needs to be aware of [the situation surrounding the prison farms], so that at least people can have a clear idea of what’s going on as opposed to just finding out after the fact. So hopefully this is one step [in that direction],” said Luther Wright, a musician who joined the campaign on Saturday.
Conservative MP Vic Toews, recently appointed minister of public safety, issued a statement discussing the phasing out of the prison farming program.
“We would better serve prisoners (and society) by having training focus on skills that lead to actual jobs in the community,” said Toews. “Very few inmates ultimately find jobs in the agriculture sector, despite time spent on prison farms and the significant cost invested [$4 million annually] to operate these farms.”
The statement prompted public outcry from local organizations, politicians, and the CMSPF.
Action is being taken by many groups to engage the Conservative government and raise awareness among the Canadian public of the value of prison farms. Plans for similar concerts in Ottawa and Toronto are being considered after Saturday’s concert.
“We know we’re not teaching them to be farmers. We’ve never for 50 years taught these guys to be farmers. It’s the work ethics–that’s what we’ve tried to instill in these fellas,” explained a farm manager, who wished to remain anonymous.
“[The farm system] evaluates these guys, because a lot of them are going to get out soon, so we work with the psychologists and parole officers and case managers, so if a guy is doing a good job then the chances of him getting out on the streets and staying out is a lot better,” he added.
Many others – notably the Union of Solicitor General Employees (USGE) – have welcomed the rehabilitative nature of prison farms. The USGE represents the staff that work with inmates on farms, and while its members will be taken care of after farm closures occur, the group is actively campaigning to prevent these closures.
“You can see [that the inmates] love the work that they’re doing, they love the interaction with each other, with their supervisors, and they have a real pride when they talk about what goes on [at] the farm. Not to put down the other programs, but making a hutch or bookcase doesn’t give you the same warm feeling inside as working with an animal,” said Dominique Vidmar, communication officer for USGE.
Andrew McCann, volunteer coordinator for Urban Agriculture Kingston, commented on the importance of prison farms as a local food source for inmates and the surrounding community.
“This is about communities feeding themselves. If prisoners can feed themselves and have the tools to feed themselves, that’s a good thing.” McCann said. “That we’re still focusing on industrial export-based farming and food is really short-sighted in terms of where the world and our country are going.
“If students put [these] pieces together then they would realize that there’s a lot at stake here in ending these prisoners’ ability to feed themselves.”

Referendums slated at McGill and six more schools regarding federation membership
Concordia students voted to secede from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) on Friday, with 2,312 members of the Concordia Student Union  (CSU) voting for defederation and 855 against.
CFS is Canada’s largest student lobby group. CSU president Amine Dabchy felt the vote was the right decision for Concordia undergrads. “I feel very happy. I feel like students made the right and informed decision. We’ve been working all year to inform them,” Dabchy said. “I feel it’s only normal that [students] vote this way since they’ve seen all the [CFS] assaults on Concordia.”
The CSU is the second student union, after the University of Calgary Graduate Student Association (Calgary GSA), to vote in a referendum to leave CFS. The federation will lose around 39,065 members – 7.8 per cent of its membership – and $340,000 if both votes are ratified.
However, both referendums contravened a new CFS bylaw, known as Motion 6, that mandates only two member unions may hold referendum votes every three months. The bylaw was adopted at the federation’s annual general meeting in November – several weeks after some petitions to hold referendums had already been submitted.
Though 11 student unions submitted petitions for referendums, sanctioned votes were only granted to the McGill Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) and the Alberta College of Art and Design Student Society.
Nine known student unions in four provinces will vote on continued membership with CFS in the upcoming months, which will affect 20 per cent of all CFS members.
PGSS votes this week
PGSS will vote on CFS membership from March 29 until April 1, though CFS mandated the Society to limit voting to two days, according to PGSS VP (External) Ladan Mahabadi.
PGSS decided to extend voting, because executives were concerned they could not reach quorum in two days.  On March 23, they published an open letter to PGSS members warning them that CFS supporters might attempt to interfere in the referendum.
The current PGSS executive have been some of the loudest critics of CFS on a national level this year, accusing the federation of being corrupt, litigious, and anti-democratic.
At the PGSS debates on continued membership, however, the pro-CFS committee leader Ben Akih Kumgeh criticized the reform motions PGSS executives presented at November’s CFS annual general meeting.
“The list of motions all for transparency, accountability…points to the fact that PGSS doesn’t seem to understand the purpose of the organization. We should question the fact our representatives seem not to take a diplomatic approach when they bring issues forward,” he said.
Unions bypass Motion 6
Five student unions holding referendums this spring will bypass the Motion 6 bylaw. In addition to restricting the number of referendums held at the same time, Motion 6 also increased the number of signatures required on referendum petitions from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. It also mandated that membership referendums may only be held once every five years per union, up from once every two years.
The five student unions, however, have moved to ignore Motion 6 because it was ratified after many had already applied for a referendum by petition.
University of Regina Student Union president Kyle Addison said Regina students could expect a referendum in spite of the bylaw.
“Basically what happened is the CFS retro-activated part of their bylaws from November,” Addison said. “What our campus decided to do was to go ahead with a referendum without them, but also to invite them in every opportunity to take part in it.”
Matt Musson, director of campaigns for the Calgary GSA, explained the decision of his union to hold a referendum despite a request by CFS to hold off on a referendum until 2011.   
Musson said CFS also asked that the university verify signatures on the petition to hold a referendum, and that the Society settle an outstanding debt of $30,000 to CFS.
Musson added that although the Calgary GSA fulfilled both requirements, they were only informed afterward by CFS that they would be unable to hold a referendum.
“It got to the point where we received a letter at the end of February [in which] CFS told us we might see a vote in 2011. We sent off a letter in response that said we are voting these days. They flat out refused to do anything about it,” he said.  
“[You could] probably say we broke bylaws with regards to the number of referendums allowable per year – but the exit bylaws were changed halfway through the game.”  
CFS-Quebec in jeopardy?
In addition to PGSS and the CSU, CFS-Quebec’s remaining members will also vote. The Dawson Student Union’s president Carl Perks indicated that students could expect a vote in the fall. The Concordia Graduate Student Association (Concordia GSA) will also vote from April 6 to 8.
Like the CSU’s, the Concordia GSA vote will bypass Motion 6.
Last week, CFS demanded that both of Concordia’s student unions settle outstanding debts before they could hold a referendum.
According to Dabchy, CFS claimed that CSU owed a debt of $1,033,278.76 in back payments, though financial records at the union indicate otherwise.
“We decided to dismiss [the debt] because we have all the paperwork to back our argument [that] we don’t owe them anything,” Dabchy said.
The Concordia GSA was informed this week by CFS that they owed $200,000 in debts dating back to 1995 – which accounts for approximately 80 per cent of the GSA’s annual budget, according to VP (External) Erik Chevrier.
Chevrier said he was concerned with the tone of correspondence from CFS at the time.  “[CFS] seem to give an impression that a referendum is not about democracy or our members, but about procedure – and that they can deny our members the right to vote. It doesn’t seem that they care about our members but more about applying our rules to them,” Chevrier said.
The Dawson Student Union will follow CFS bylaws when it votes next year, according to Perks.
Ontario and BC may vote
Two CFS referendums may also be held in Ontario in the coming months. According to Brian Kombani, president of the Trent Central Student Association, students can expect a referendum next year.
The Central Student Association at Guelph University (CSA) joined the list of unions holding spring referendums late Wednesday after the Ontario Superior Court granted them the right to hold a vote. The decision concludes a disagreement between the CSA, CFS, and CFS-Ontario.
The University of Victoria Students’ Society (UVSS) may also see a referendum, according to UVSS Chair-elect James Coccola. Though UVSS has been a strong supporter of CFS in the past, a pro-referendum slate won 11 of 15 possible positions at the student union this spring.
“Our slate is very much in favour of holding a referendum because we have met the requirements to hold a referendum and [are] within the rights of the students to hold one,” Coccola said.
As this story went to press, CFS national treasurer Dave Molenhuis and CFS-Ontario chairperson Shelley Melanson had not responded to The Daily’s multiple interview requests.

Plans to reduce massive highway interchange unveiled, includes increased public transit, and fewer house demolitions
An alternative to the province’s plan for the reconstruction of the Turcot interchange was unveiled at Montreal’s public health department Thursday. The Turcot375 project – developed by urban planners Pierre Gautier and Pierre Brisset – involves a major downsize of the highway superstructure, and a city-wide shift toward a stronger public transit system.
The development comes two weeks into backroom negotiations between the province, which has sought to expand the vehicular capacity of the Interchange, and the City, whose representatives are pushing for an increased public transit alternative.
Gauthier and Brisset asserted that their plan would be more environmentally and socially beneficial than the province’s blueprint for the Interchange, which involves an 18 per cent increase in the Turcot’s vehicular capacity.
“The foundation of our plan is a major reduction of the vehicles that use the interchange,” said Gauthier, an assistant professor at Concordia’s school of the geography, planning, and the environment.
The Turcot Interchange connects the Ville Marie and Décarie expressways, and is located between Westmount and St-Henri, adjacent to a smaller community known as the Village des Tanneries.
With chunks of concrete falling off the elaborate 18-lane highway structure, it has been apparent that the Turcot would need to be refurbished for several years now. Discussion of the Interchange’s reconstruction have been ongoing since 2001, though progress has been slow – and contentious.
The Turcot375 plan calls for the removal of eight of the Interchange’s eighteen lanes, four of its on- and off-ramps, and for its traffic volume to be reduced from 290,000 vehicles per day to 180,000 vehicles per day. The MTQ’s plan, by contrast, calls for an expansion of the interchange to accommodate 320,000 vehicles per day.
“Based on data we have looked at, we know that there will be an increase in cars,” said MTQ spokesperson Mario St-Pierre in an interview with The Daily in November. “That has nothing to do with any plan or will of the MTQ.”
Several urban planners take issue with the fatalism of the MTQ’s approach, however. Jason Prince – the coordinator of the Community-University Research Alliance at McGill and co-editor of the book “Montreal at the Crossroads: Superhighways, the Turcot and the Environment” – is one of them.
“For the hundreds of thousands of Montrealers who communte to the downtown by car, is it because they have no other option? I think the answer is yes,” said Prince.
He added that the city’s power in province-level negotiations such as this has been attenuated by the depopulation of the downtown and growth of the suburbs in the past four decades.
“This political problem of two million people in the suburbs and one million people downtown is the direct result of these highways we built in the fifties and sixties,” he said.
The Ministere de Transport de Quebec (MTQ), which is responsible for the province’s highway system, unveiled its plan for the Turcot in 2007. In calling for a massive expansion of the interchange, and the demolition of 160 housing units, the proposal was met with fierce opposition from numerous groups in St. Henri.
Following a public consultation last June, Quebec’s Bureau d’audiences publiques sur l’environnement (BAPE) demanded that the MTQ go back to the drawing board, and account for locals’ demands for an alternative that involves fewer cars and more public transit.
The mémoire presented to the BAPE commission by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal cited the MTQ’s 2003 estimate that the socioeconomic cost of traffic congestion in Montreal is approximately $1.4 billion a year, and went on to state that the final plan “must include carpooling and public transit lanes as well as accommodate rail transportation.”
The BAPE’s final recommendations, released in November, echoed the City’s concerns and condemned the MTQ’s planned housing expropriations, and stated that the residents’ concerns about the pollution generated by highway system should also be heeded.
Louis Drouin, head of the Montreal public health department’s urban environment section, agreed that the respiratory health of residents of St-Henri and the Village des Tanneries needs to be considered in any future plan for the Turcot.
“These populations are not in such good health; a lot of respiratory disease and asthma,” he said.  “More cars in the city means more public health impact.”
He added that the city’s long-term plan should include a modal shift toward public transport, such as buses and light rail, and active transport, like cycling.
“The city adheres to the same principles as we do,” said Gauthier. “The MTQ comes to it with a very narrow-minded approach: very technical and very focused on increasing highway capacity.” He added that modeling for a reduction in the Turcot’s traffic capacity demanded a reconceptualization of the city’s entire transit system, the details of which are included in the Turcot 375 proposal.
“We’re talking about sustainable urban development,” said Gauthier.
The extent to which the province is considering an integrated public transit system for the future Turcot remains unclear.
Gauthier concluded that a substantial amount of transit infrastructure will have to be constructed during the renovation of the interchange, and that this infrastructure will probably have to encompass an expanded transit system.
“Nobody can expect this reconstruction to work without any disturbance. The capacity will be reduced on the interchange for five years [during construction],” he said. “Urban transit is the solution… This is a once in lifetime opportunity to changes people’s habitudes.”
On March 12, the CBC reported that the MTQ now plans to demolish 100 of the residences – 60 fewer than originally planned. The same story also reported that Transport Minister Julie Boulet is expected to announce the province’s final plans for the Turcot by the end of the month.
But as the unveiling of the final plan approaches, members of the St-Henri community have become increasingly critical of the opacity surrounding the negotiations. On March 3, members of Projet Organisation Populaire Information Et Regroupement (POPRI) stormed the Montreal office of the MTQ and staged a sit-in, demanding a meeting with Boulet.
“There’s a veil of secrecy that will not be lifted until there is a quote-unquote consensus,” said Derek Robertson, a member of POPRI. “They’re doing this with a lack of transparency and a lack of respect for the citizens who are most affected by this project, and that is the residents of the Village de Tanneries.”
He added that POPRI has been granted their requested meeting with Boulet on April 1.
Drouin agreed that the issue of accessibility is important.
“It’s not a perfect process,” he said. “It’s a process by the MTQ with Montreal officials. It’s not an open process; it’s quite dark. The best kind of process is an open process with all the stakeholders involved.”
Robertson stated that he supported the main overall design of the Turcot375 option presented by Gauthier and Brisset, although had reservations about its plan to divert some of the interchange’s traffic into ground-level arteries, as it could potentially cause an increase in accidents.
“We all agree that it needs to be replaced. The question is what with,” said Robertson. “We really have a chance to right a wrong and a chance to rebuild for the 21st century. We should do so with a 21st-century mentality. And the [MTQ’s] projects are very much rooted in a mid-20th-century mentality.”
