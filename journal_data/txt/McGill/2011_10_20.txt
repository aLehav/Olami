McGill alum announces run for NDP leadership next March 
Thomas Mulcair, MP for Outremont and deputy leader of the NDP, announced  his intention to run for leadership of the NDP party last week.
Mulcair, who graduated from McGill in 1977, was last at McGill in September to speak at the Science and Policy Exchange, where he refused to cross picket lines formed by the striking McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA).
“After Jack [Layton]’s death we were all in a period of deep mourning and shock,” said Mulcair. “I had to make sure I had Canadian support and the support from my caucus colleagues.”
“I have the support of 33 MPs, which is more support than all other candidates put together,” he continued,  adding that he counts Lorne Nystrom, former Saskatchewan NDP MP, and Dominic Cardy, leader of the New Brunswick NDP, as supporters of his campaign.
Mulcair, who has campaigned on the idea that he will be pushing centrist policies for the party, said that he hopes he can bring a new direction to the party.
“The most important thing for me is that the vision we have always had for Canada in the NDP can start to be a reality by forming the first NDP government,” he explained.
Mulcair gave examples such as Gary Doer, former Manitoba premier and current US ambassador for Canada, and former Saskatchewan premier, Lorne Calvert, as examples of centrist NDP leaders who have had successful governments. “What they were able to do was convince their voters that they would provide stable, confident public administration,” he said.
“People have to be sure, before they are going to elect a new government, that they are actually going to be able to balance the books, do a good job, respect their social democratic values, and their roots, but at the same time convince the public that they can be elected,” he continued.
Mulcair referred to his previous experience in Quebec City and in his Outremont riding, where he was elected as an MP for the third time in the last May’s federal election, as examples of his success in government.
He also spoke of the success that the NDP had in the previous federal election, stating that “what [Layton and I] did in Quebec was unique. We connected with people on the level of their values. We were able to reach beyond the traditional base and we were able to produce extraordinary results.”
When asked about the ongoing MUNACA strike, Mulcair said, “They have my full support.”
“The University itself boasts quite proudly, and rightly so, that it is one of the best universities in the world, and those support workers are an integral part of making McGill one of the best universities in the world,” he continued.
Brian Topp, current president of the NDP, is among Mulcair’s competition for NDP leadership. When asked about how Mulcair entering the race will affect his campaign, Topp stated that, “I’m going to focus on my own campaign and, in March, members will make their choice.”
Sam Harris, co-president of NDP McGill, said that the group is not yet ready to endorse a candidate for the NDP leadership election this March. Harris explained that it may in the future, but not until all the candidates have submitted their nominations, the deadline for which is January.
Mulcair concluded by saying that the NDP had to move beyond its traditional base. “We have to connect with people across Canada on the level of their values and make them understand that the NDP is really the only real offer to form a progressive government in the next election,” he said.
“Before getting elected we are going to have to connect with the Canadian voting public and make sure they understand we are going to have an experienced, seasoned competent team of senior people who are capable of running a G7 country like Canada,” he continued.

New strategies failing to reduce pedestrian accidents
The Service de police de la ville de Montréal  (SPVM) is pushing to curb jaywalking after recent research found that, in 2010, 50 per cent of automobile deaths each year involved pedestrians. Of those deaths, 61 per cent were caused by jaywalking.
In 2005, there were 1,818 collisions in Montreal involving pedestrians, including 24 fatalities. In response to this issue, Officer Sophia Provost,  the lead officer for Pedestrian Safety, worked with the SPVM Road Safety Division on a five-year plan, based on the “three E’s”: engineering, education, and enforcement.
Furthermore, the plan increased fines for jaywalking. Emma Quail, a McGill graduate, was fined for jaywalking three years ago.
“I walked across the street on Mont-Royal and just east of St. Denis when the light was red and some person on the other side was waving at me to stop, but I did not think much of it, so I continued regardless,” she said.
A police car was stationed across the street and she was ticketed $38.
“Apparently the cop was just waiting there for people all day,” she continued.
Despite the ticketing threat and visible SPVM presence, Montrealers are still jaywalking. The Daily spoke with several students at the intersection of Duluth and Milton, all of whom admitted to jaywalking regularly. Even Quail admitted that she still jaywalked, “just not when a police car is around.”
One international student, Fanny Devaux, a U2 Political Science and Hispanic Studies student from France, didn’t know jaywalking is illegal in Canada.
“I had no idea, I do it all the time,” she said. “I guess I’ll be more careful now.”
Students do not appear to factor into pedestrian accidents, however. It is Montreal’s ageing population that weighed significantly in the statistical analysis, representing up to two-thirds of accidents.
However, Emilie Boutin, a U1 Education student, said she jaywalked much less in Montreal than in her hometown of Ottawa.
“I know three people who got fined in Montreal. Don’t do it in front of the police in Montreal, you will get fined,” she said.
The SPVM’s program seems to be working. The police issued 44,000 jaywalking tickets to pedestrians last year.
Other than fining jaywalkers, by the end of 2010 the municipal government had completed streetscape improvements at 114 intersections, including painting zebra crossings and installing countdowns on pedestrian traffic signals.
Despite the increased ticketing and infrastructure improvements, pedestrian fatalities have not been reduced. There have been nine pedestrian deaths in Montreal since September 1 this year.

Severe food security issues anticipated as global population rises
Last week, a team of researchers from Canada, the United States, Sweden, and Germany published research in the Nature International Weekly Journal of Science that includes suggestions for a plan that could double the world’s food production.
McGill professors Elena M. Bennett, from the Department of Natural Resource Sciences, and Navin Ramankutty, from the Department of Geography, were two of the researchers that worked on the paper, which states that in order “to meet the world’s future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture’s environmental footprint must shrink dramatically.”
According to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), hunger is the world’s number one health risk, and 925 million people do not have enough to eat.
Julie Marshall, spokesperson for the WFP, said, “one in seven people wake up not knowing where they can get food today” as a result of poor food distribution, high food and fuel prices, and a lack of social safety nets.
Furthermore, according to the UN, the world population is on track to surpass 9 billion by 2050, foreshadowing unprecedented demands on agriculture and the environment.
According to Ramankutty, the researchers were looking for a way to meet the world’s future food security needs while at the same time reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. Research involved analyzing satellite images and agricultural census statistics at the national and subnational levels and to get a fuller picture of what agriculture looks like around the planet.
Ramankutty explained that this allowed them to “spatially determine where to get the biggest bang for the buck” in terms of agricultural productivity.
From the data, the team developed a five-part plan, which included focusing on climate change and biodiversity problems and increasing food production in other parts of the planet.
Ramankutty, who has been a part of this research since he began his PhD at the University of Wisconsin over a decade ago, said that this five-point plan is not new.
“Our contribution is to say that the five-point plan can actually make a big difference and double global food supply,” he said.
He admitted, however, that “feasibility is a huge challenge.”
“It’s a challenge of policy, technology, economics, [and] consumer preferences,” he said.
Randy Shore, who writes “The Green Man” blog for the Vancouver Sun, had similar concerns. In an interview with The Daily, he explained that he has a “more jaundiced view of how quickly we might be able to attack the problem.”
“I have no problems with the research itself,” he explained. “I think it’s typical of scientists to take a view from 30 million feet, looking at the entire planet as a single integrated system.”
According to Shore, the problem is that the world is actually made up of many complex political and economic systems related to food production.
“We’re talking about dismantling subsidy systems ingrained in Canadian, American, and European agriculture,” he said – something he explained would be extremely disruptive to people’s lives.
Shore did, however, recognize progress in waste reduction, explaining that we are already taking small steps towards reclaiming wasted food. He gave examples of programs that redistribute surplus food from restaurants, such as The Food Bank For New York City.
“This will not be done by us alone, but by everyone involved in the issue,” said Ramankutty.

Citizens march to the Montreal Egyptian consulate
On Saturday, October 15, Montrealers gathered in Phillips Square with signs to speak out against the treatment of Coptic Christians in Egypt and to show their solidarity with them. The Montreal branch of the Canadian Coptic Association (CCA) organized Saturday’s demonstration and subsequent march.
Copts are an ethno-religious group in Egypt commonly identified as Christians, though there is debate as to whom the term actually refers.
Nader Shahid, a member of the CCA, spoke about why the demonstration was organized.
“We initiated the march today for the recent incident that happened in Egypt, crushing and running over Christians marching peacefully in Egypt, using military vehicles,” he said.
On October 9 in Cairo, thousands of Coptic Christians peacefully demonstrated against the attack on a church in the southern city of Aswan. In response to the demonstration, more than 1,000 members of the Egyptian security forces were deployed. At least 24 deaths and hundreds of injuries were reported.
The CCA released a statement in a communique about the demonstration.
“The Copts who peacefully demonstrated last Sunday in Cairo, against those who burned a church, were submitted – at the hands of the Egyptian army’s forces – to a massacre of incredible savagery,” the statement read in French.
The statement continued, noting the daily nature of violent acts against Copts, stating that Copt victims “do not have confidence anymore in the Egyptian authorities.”
Shahid explained the plan for the demonstration as speakers addressed the crowd of about fifty people.
“We’re going to go around the downtown area and we’re going to finish in front of the Egyptian consulate to deliver our message of our anger of what’s happening,” he said.
Demonstrator Marsa Abdelmalak emigrated from Egypt one month ago. She noted the habitual nature of violence against Christians and churches.
“We are truly here today because they are in the middle of killing Christians in Egypt. I just arrived one month ago and the situation is very difficult over there. Life is supportable. They come to attack the churches, they attack Christians everywhere,” she said in French.
“One month, I saw all of it with my eyes. I left my country because of that. There is not any more security,” she added.
Shahid spoke to solidarity between Copts in Egypt and those in the diaspora.
“We left Egypt and we’re living here as Canadian citizens but we show solidarity with our people over there,” he said.
“They are so oppressed over there, plus the recent incident shows cruelty and rudeness of how to treat them and not providing them equal human rights.”
Shahid also noted that since the January 25 revolution, the Coptic situation has continued to be “overlooked.”
There are a reported 7 million Copts within Egypt’s total population of 82 million. Shahid estimated that the actual number of Copts is higher.
“But I would say for the counting reasons and the discrimination [the numbers] might be a little bit more,” he said.
A young demonstrator, Lisa, explained her feelings about recent killings in Egypt.
“They are killing us in Egypt. They want us to stop talking and not open our mouths and saying our prayers,” she said. “I’m afraid for them because they are afraid to go in the street even.”
In their communique, the CCA in Montreal stated their demand for “the presence of an international committee to oversee that Copts have been subjected and continue to be subjected to violence. This is an obligation of the countries of the free world, to respect human rights.”

Economic Education Committee to propose financial reforms to General Assembly
As the Occupy Montreal demonstration nears the end of its first week, the burgeoning alternative community in Square Victoria is becoming increasingly organized.
Numerous committees have been formed by General Assemblies (GAs) held daily on-site. One such committee, the Economic Education Committee, was proposed by Montreal politician Jean-Patrick Berthiaume during Tuesday’s GA.
Berthiaume said the committee’s first purpose will be to accommodate speakers visiting the occupation from the nearby Forum International de l’Économie Sociale et Solidaire (FIESS) conference.
“I must, with my committee, make them comfortable, have something if it’s raining or everything, and be there to say, ‘Hi, I’m the link between you and us,’” said Berthiaume.
FIESS was held at the Palais des congrès from October 17 to 20. The conference hosted speakers from around the world to promote, develop, and discuss social and solidarity economics.
Speakers from the conference visited the occupation and spoke with occupiers on Wednesday and Thursday. Berthiaume said that, after the speakers had left, the committee would start to look for solutions to their issues with the existing economic system.
“After that the committee will also become permanent to enhance all the resources that we could check to know which kind of way we could change our world,” he said.
One of the central concerns held amongst the occupiers is of the growing financial inequality in society, while a common criticism thrown back at the occupiers is their lack of clear goals or solutions to address these issues. According to Berthiaume, the committee addresses both these criticisms.
“There’s a goal,” he said. “The goal is that we want a new world, we want to change things, and we must try it. That’s what we’re doing. Each person that talks to me about this – ‘Oh, what are we doing?’ Well, the first thing I see is the greatest laboratory of democracy that I can imagine. We’re trying it; we’re making it happen…because if we want to propose to all the others a new solution we must show them that it’s possible. So that’s the main thing,” he continued.
Furthermore, Berthiaume said the committee’s proposals would be targeted at the occupation community only, not society as a whole.
“I’m not here to tell the government what to do. I’m here to see what we will do without the government, without the one per cent. Are we able to do something? Are we capable of living together? That’s the main thing that I’m looking at, not really to know which kind of message that will be brought to them,” he explained.
The committee meets every afternoon and submits proposals for GAs. The proposals themselves are then submitted to a GA procedural committee.
Berthiaume said he would respect the GA’s decision regarding any proposals that came out of the committee.

MUNACA schedules case to be heard again in January 
The provisional injunction that restricts McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) members’ picketing was extended on October 13, and will remain in place until January 21, at the request of the union.
MUNACA President Kevin Whittaker explained the union’s logic behind this decision.
“Our lawyers advised us that, even though the injunction is quite severe, contesting it on its merits would probably not be successful. Furthermore, if our contestation on the merits was unsuccessful, it would result in a permanent injunction,” Whittaker said.
Previously, the provisional injunction required renewal every ten days.
Michael Di Grappa, McGill vice-president (Administration and Finance), spoke to the University’s proposed timeline for the injunction.
“We, McGill, had proposed a process that would have [had the status of the injunction] resolved by sometime in November. The union came back with a schedule, for whatever reason, that extended it to [January] 21. So, that was their proposal and the judge accepted it,” Di Grappa said.
Whittaker explained the implications of a permanent injunction against the union.
“That would mean that the injunction rules would apply forever. For example, we would never be able to have a demonstration on campus,” he said, adding, “to avoid this outcome, and to avoid returning to court shortly to go through the same exercise, we decided to have the case heard in January.”
The Daily viewed the public civil case file in full.
McGill’s original motion, submitted on September 23, was to grant of a provisional interlocutory injunction, an interlocutory injunction, and a permanent injunction. The motion was supported by three affidavits and 13 evidentiary exhibits, including videotapes of union picket lines taken by Security Services.
In the original motion submitted by McGill, union members would have been required to maintain a distance of 10 meters from McGill property, and gather in groups of no larger than 10 persons.
The provisional injunction, first issued on September 23, was subsequently extended twice: on October 3 and on October 13. It will now remain in effect until January 21.
The extended provisional injunction retains the provisions that MUNACA members cannot use amplification devices or create noise within 25 meters of McGill property, be within four meters of the campus, or gather in groups of more than 15 people.
The court proceedings for the interlocutory injunction were agreed upon on October 13, after the union submitted an alternative timetable.
The affidavits, analyzed by Judge Brian Riordan, were authored by Operations Manager of McGill’s Security Services Christopher Carson,  Associate Director  of University Safety and head of Security Services Pierre Barbarie,  and Director of Labour and Employee Relations Robert Comeau.
MUNACA and McGill are in conciliation today and tomorrow. Since October 13, there have been three conciliation meetings. Both parties have presented offers to “resolve all non-economic matters in dispute.” At the time of press, neither party had accepted an offer.
MUNACA occupies the chair of the Board of Governors’ office
On Tuesday, the union set up picket lines around the Montreal office of Stikeman Elliott LLP to “occupy” the workplace of Stuart Cobbett, the chair of McGill’s Board of Governors.
MUNACA members, including union executive member Colleen O’Brien and strike coordinator Joan O’Malley, said that they met briefly with Cobbett to deliver a letter written by union President Kevin Whittaker.
Cobbett described the presentation of the letter as “odd” in an interview with The Daily. He said the members arrived in his office reception area unannounced and uninvited.
“When they first came I was out and they were told that, long story short, ultimately they would not leave and insisted on seeing me, so I went up and saw them,” Cobbett said.
“They handed me a letter from the president of MUNACA, Kevin Whittaker, asking me, as Board Chair, to do whatever I could to get the strike resolved,” he said.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Whitaker explained that MUNACA is asking McGill’s Board of Governors to use their position to work towards a fair resolution of the strike. He stated that “it is now up to them to use their position of influence to bring this dispute to a rapid conclusion.”
Though Cobbett said that the Board of Governors receives regular reports on the strike, he said that “ultimately, the Board of Governors is not there to interfere with what management is doing and what the administration is doing. We set the broad parameters and then it’s over to management.”
Union members left a message in sidewalk chalk outside Cobbett’s office, reading “Mr. S.H. Cobbett, please help us get a fair contract.”
MUNACA members had previously visited the office of McGill Board of Governors member Kathy Fazel on October 12.  The union announced that they had received a “firm commitment” from Fazel.
Cobbett said he heard from Fazel that MUNACA workers had appeared in her office, however, he had “no specific warning” that they would do the same to his workplace.

City bylaws allow occupation, authorities “tolerate” overnight stays
As Occupy Montreal enters its fifth day, protesters have found an unlikely ally: the City of Montreal bylaws. While parks in Montreal are subject to regulations that explicitly forbid overnight stays, rules regarding public spaces, such as Square Victoria which protesters are occupying, are much less clear.
The hundreds of protesters occupying Square Victoria as part of the global Occupy movement have stressed this distinction in order to justify their stay.
The City of Montreal is divided into 19 boroughs, each with its own set of laws. Square Victoria falls under the purview of the Ville-Marie borough council.
While there is nothing in the City’s regulations that outlaws overnight stay, several bylaws could potentially be used to disturb the protest. Section I of the Règlement du conseil d’arrondissement 24-069 prohibits the “occupation of public domain” and defines “occupation” as “the presence of an installation on the ground without a permit.”
According to Jean Hétu, a professor at the Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Law and an expert on municipal law, the tents set up in the square could be considered an “occupation” by city authorities.
Despite the lack of a permit, the Montreal Police (SPVM) has allowed the occupation to continue.
An SPVM officer explained the situation to The Daily.
“We’re tolerating, as long as they don’t cause any problem,” he said.
Authorities around the world have been left puzzled as to how to deal with the Occupy protests that have so far enjoyed broad popular appeal.
At a meeting Tuesday with the city council, the mayor of Montreal, Gérald Tremblay, described the protests as “worldwide” and “legitimate.”
Other cities, such as New York, are having their own issues surrounding the protests.
New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has sought to maintain an impartial tone between Canadian real estate company Brookfield Properties, which owns Zuccotti Park – the site of the Wall Street occupation – and the occupiers who have taken it over. While the mayor has repeatedly stressed the right of the protesters to peaceful assembly, he has also expressed concerns for residents around Zuccotti Park.
“The longer this goes, the worse it is for our economy,” he said on October 14, during his weekly appearance on WOR Newstalk Radio 710.
Meanwhile, Brookfield has struggled to maintain a positive image. Despite reports of an attempt by Brookfield to evict the protesters on October 14, Andrew Willis, a spokesman for the company, denied the allegation.
“There was no attempt at eviction,” he said to The Daily.
Speaking to the events of October 14, Willis explained that Brookfield merely sought to “clean a portion of the square.” However, a set of stringent rules, prohibiting the use of tents and sleeping bags, were later imposed on the occupiers.
According to Ruthann Robson, professor at the City University of New York School of Law, the legality of the new set of rules is dubious.
“This could be subject to litigation. If there is writing on those tents, then it becomes a First Amendment issue,” she explained. In the United States, the First Amendment protects freedom of speech.
Protesters in New York have used the legal ambiguity of their camping zone to their advantage. According to Robson, the private ownership of Zuccotti Park curtails the authority of the city, and allows protesters greater flexibility in exercising their First Amendment rights.
According to Robson, Brookfield owns and manages Zuccotti Park in exchange for zoning incentives and the use of bigger office spaces.
In Montreal, the designation of Square Victoria as a public space gives the protesters considerable leeway as well.
“Public spaces,” Hétu said, “have to be made available to the public.”
Although there is a regulation against overnight stays, he explained that a protester “can cite the Charter and some judge might rule in favor of it,” in reference to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
According to Hétu, the case is not without precedent. In 2008, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that homeless people were allowed to set up tents in public spaces. While the decision of the court did not take free speech into account, it illustrated that the municipal bylaws can be trumped by constitutional concerns.
However, Hétu warned that free speech was not without limit.
“If there is urination and some degradation of public property, then this could become a public health issue,” he explained.
