Turning focus toward celebration and appreciation
From November 21 to 25, the Quebec Public Interest Research Group at McGill (QPIRG McGill) held their annual “Culture Shock” series surrounding themes of anti-racism, migrant justice, and Indigenous solidarity. QPIRG is focused primarily on social and environmental justice, and they run many annual events, including Rad Frosh and Social Justice Days. The Daily sat down with two of the organizers of this event, Yara Coussa and Maria Radu, to find out more about how these themes came to be and what the organizers of this event series hoped to accomplish.
Coussa is a fourth-year Honours International Development Studies student. They are the Events Coordinator for Queer McGill, and they have collaborated with QPIRG on several events, including “Culture Shock.” Radu is in her final semester at McGill and got involved in her second year when she joined one of QPIRG’s working groups. She now acts as the Campus Outreach Coordinator and has been in this position for almost a year. 
This year, the focus of “Culture Shock” was “joy, pleasure, and celebration as community building.” When asked how this theme came to be, Radu stated that it was proposed by the Popular Education Committee of QPIRG and inspired by other campus events from the last year which were “not just about fighting the good fight, but also being able to take time and appreciate how far we’ve come.”
Some events that took place were “Nightlife as Community Building,” which explored how party culture can act as a safe space for marginalized people; “Places of Rest: An Interactive Mapping Experience,” which brought members of the BIPOC community together to physically map out safe spaces in Montreal; and “Un(PAC)k: Caring for ourselves and each other,” an event that led a discussion about the “Social Change Ecosystem.”  Further events included “Filthy Wholesome Dirty Talk,” which taught participants how to use dirty talk for pleasure; “ALL MY RELATIONS: Indigenous Crafting, Culture, and Connection,” an event that brought in Indigenous artists to make soap carvings and dream-catchers; “Clowning Around,” a workshop that introduced participants to “drag, clowning, [and] gendered performance”; “QTBIPOC Comedy Night,” a comedy show featuring “They Go Low, We Go Laugh”;  and “The Fortuna Kiki Ball by Mami Cuarta Mulan,” a fundraiser to help sponsor a similar Kiki ball in Peru. 
Of these events, both Coussa and Radu claimed that they were especially excited about the QTBIPOC Comedy Show, which Radu was heavily involved in planning. Coussa stated that the comedy night served a unique and central purpose, as “not often do we get to highlight specifically the voices of queer, trans, BIPOC comedians.” This event was in collaboration with “They Go Low, We Go Laugh,” a comedy club for women of colour. Coussa scouted out this group when looking for different people and organizations to collaborate with on this year’s “Culture Shock” series, having previously attended one of their live shows to find out more about the group’s comedy style. 
A lot of the events came together in a similar fashion, through the connections that members of QPIRG and Queer McGill have to the Montreal community. For example, QPIRG supports many working groups, autonomous organizations, and collectives working on issues that reflect QPIRG’s mandate, and these groups provide more access to various networks. For instance, the Pan-Asian Collective (PAC) leads the aptly-named event “Un(PAC)k: Caring for ourselves and each other,” which covered the Social Change Ecosystem Map, a book by Deepa Iyer that provides direction for those looking to get started in the realm of social change, and Pleasure Activism by Adrienne Maree Brown, which explores how to make social justice a positive experience. 
The Daily attended the “Nightlife as Community Building” event, moderated by Adrienne Pan and featuring panelists Cuartababy, Camellia Jahanshahi, and Marlyne Lust. The focus of this event was on exploring how queer nightlife can lead to queer joy. The panelists were all involved in the nightlife scene in Montreal, from the ballroom scene to organizing burlesque shows for queer BIPOC. Cuartababy commented on the shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs on November 19, stating that “[there is] still a need for queer spaces that are safe.” Among the panelists, there was a major focus on creating space for marginalized people to be safe, and beyond that, for them to experience joy. In recounting a party specifically for queer people that was shut down by police, Pan stated that “parties can be very political.” Thus, given that the focus is on nightlife as a way to experience joy, the whole theme of “Culture Shock” for this year remains political, even though it does not directly focus on, as Radu put it, “fighting the good fight.”   
In reflecting on how their involvement with QPIRG and Queer McGill has affected their lives, Coussa and Radu also talked a lot about space, specifically how they’ve learned when to step aside and give space for others and how to create safe spaces for marginalized people. Coussa went on to describe how being a part of these groups, and interacting with the extremely diverse people who work in and around QPIRG, has given them the opportunity to think in ways they might never have before, and Radu agreed. Coussa expressed that “being in that space, [an] anti-oppressive, sustainable space, it changes us as people.”
As a final note, Radu highlighted the library resources available through QPIRG and Queer McGill. She spoke about Queer McGill’s library, the largest anglophone queer library in Quebec, and QPIRG’s  Alternative Library, both of which provide vast resources for McGill students. Additionally, future events led by QPIRG will be announced in the coming months, and while nothing is concrete yet, Coussa stated that they would love to see events that focus on anti-capitalism, a goal embodied in the accessibility of the aforementioned library resource.

Divest McGill organizes collective scream on campus
In the minutes leading up to 1:00 PM last Thursday – a crisp, clear, pre-finals November afternoon – Divest McGill organizers passed out flyers at the Y-intersection to invite those passing by to take part in the upcoming “one-minute scream.” “Celebration” by Kool & the Gang blared through speakers as Divest organizers counted down: “T-10 minutes until the scream!” “T-5 minutes until the scream!” and eventually, “T-1 minute!” 
As 1:00 PM grew nearer, over a hundred students gathered at  the intersection. Counting down from three, Divest organizers prompted everyone to scream. The cacophony of anger that emanated from the centre of campus ensued for one whole minute, expressing the crowd’s exasperation toward grievances like the McGill administration’s climate inaction, finals stress, and general frustration. At 1:01, the screaming ceased and students dispersed to head back to class, go to the library, or otherwise continue on with their day. 
“We wanted to […] get people to just kind of vent out their grievances with the university,” Carley, a member of Divest McGill, told the Daily, “whether it be related to climate justice or divestment, or unpaid student internships, or the extremely high cost of living or food on campus, the undemocratic student bodies, literally anything that you’re mad about.” 
The collective scream is distinct from other actions organized by Divest, such as the #OccupyMcGill occupation of the McCall MacBain Arts Building last winter which lasted almost two weeks. Carley explained that that action was particularly “risky,” able to be done because of the privilege afforded to many Divest McGill members. “We’re trying to have a diversity of actions, that […] students, staff, faculty, anyone can really join,” says Carley. She explained that the scream served as a way to engage as many students as possible through a “really easy action” to get involved in. 
She also added that the scream served as a reminder to McGill’s administration that Divest is still calling for divestment, 10 years after the creation of the organization. She explained that the scream was effective in “reminding [the Board of Governors] that we’re still here after ten years, despite their PR campaigns trying to prove us wrong. We still believe in this, and many other people do.” 
In her opinion, the event had great turnout, garnering over 1,000 likes on their Instagram post promoting it. “Having these accessible events […] that you can repost online, no matter your status, is really important to create a movement that is serving the people that it’s impacting the most.”

Every Friday from 12:30-2:00 PM, a bright yellow door in the heart of Milton-Parc leads the way to affordable, vegan meals. On November 11, the Rabbit Hole Café officially reopened for the academic year. It operates out of the Yellow Door, a community organization that promotes intergenerational social inclusion, located at 3625 rue Aylmer. 
The Rabbit Hole Café  is a long-running vegan collective kitchen that provides inexpensive meals for community members during the academic year. The service is cash-only and they ask visitors to either bring their own container or eat in the coffeehouse downstairs.
 This year, it is run by four dedicated and kitchen-trained volunteers who oversee the entire food preparation and serving process. Nicky DiCaprio, Admin and Communications Coordinator for the Yellow Door, told the Daily that “they all have cooking experience […] and are trained in food safety and cleanliness, so they’re trustworthy, and it’s just seriously so good. Everything they make is with love.”  
In an interview with the Daily, Rabbit Hole volunteer, Viva Noronha explained that the café was “the perfect intersection of cooking as a passion as well as just spreading my love for food to the community.” Noronha described that the kitchen works very collaboratively, “I stir a pot, I wash some dishes, I drain the beans [..] if anybody needs help, we help them.” 
Noronha expressed that “everyone has been really receptive to the food.” So far, they have served a $3 Indian chickpea curry, $3 homemade squash ravioli, and $4 Cuban congrí, as well as $1-2 desserts. “The chickpea curry we did was my mom’s recipe, so that was very close to my heart,” Noronha said. “It was really empowering to see people just enjoying food that I grew up eating.”
Both Noronha and DiCaprio emphasized the need for services like this in the McGill community. “With inflation prices being crazy, like grocery prices are insane, I think this is a really good resource for students,” DiCaprio stated. “To eat healthy is super expensive these days. So this gives students and the whole community an affordable, vegan, delicious, warm meal.” 
McGill currently operates under an exclusivity agreement with the Compass Group. Some students claim that privatization has led to a decrease in diverse and affordable food options on campus. Noronha also pointed out the Compass Group’s role in the prison-industrial complex, as it provides food services to correctional facilities in Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. 
In contrast to most of McGill’s food services, Noronha explained that Rabbit Hole allows “community members to gather and really enjoy and respect the food they’re eating and know where it’s coming from, [which is] maybe the main reason why I wanted to do this.” McGill students can also take advantage of Midnight Kitchen’s free weekly vegan meal servings or register for the SSMU Pilot Grocery Program before November 30th. 
Community members interested in becoming involved with the Yellow Door are able to participate in their free intergenerational wellness initiatives, such as the Art Hive, their reading groups, or Friday Night «Hootenanny» Open Stage music events. They can also volunteer with the Generations program, which pairs them with a senior to provide support to.
The Rabbit Hole’s last lunch service of the year will be this Friday, December 2, but they will be back January 6 for the Winter semester.
