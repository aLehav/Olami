Controversial bill criticized for human rights violations
Despite the Parti Québécois’ (PQ) harsh rhetoric over the Canadian immigration policy, it remains to be seen how far the newly elected government is willing to push the boundaries of its parliamentary minority in proposing long sought-after immigration and language policy reforms.
In particular, the PQ has heavily criticized the Harper government for its proposed Bill C-31, “Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act.”
Introduced by Conservative Minister of Citizenship Jason Kenney, Bill C-31 is an attempt to clean up abuse and fraudulence in the refugee system, and has been condemned by some as a violation of basic human rights.
Since passing its third reading in June, the act has been slammed by PQ critics for putting unprecedented power over citizenship in the hands of a few cabinet ministers, while leaving those legitimately seeking asylum vulnerable to an array of emotional and psychological dangers.
PQ Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Bernard Drainville identified the bill as an ideological departure from Quebecois values, adding it to the list of policies that would divide an autonomous Quebec from the rest of Canada.
“Again, this situation demonstrates how Quebec needs to control immigration on its territory and not be subject to the decisions made by another country that does not share our values,” he told the National Assembly in French in May.
Stephan Reichhold, Director of the Table de Concertation des organismes au service des personnes réfugiées et Immigrantes (TCRI), told The Daily, “From my past experience in the business of refugees, between the Liberals and the PQ, very little changes. They are similar in terms of policy, funding, and budget.”
“Although the discourse may change a little, the PQ has been more outspoken about Bill C-31 in the past. But now they are in a position that makes it easier for them to criticize the current system,” he continued. “Fortunately, the PQ has always been open minded to humanitarian and refugee policies.”
Under Bill C-31, refugee claimants can be automatically detained for up to one year without judicial review if the Minister of Public Safety deems their arrival “irregular.” The process would include less consideration of individual cases, instead allowing an expedited judicial review for refugees applying from countries that are deemed generally “safe” by the minister.
According to an Australian parliamentary inquiry, incarceration in a foreign country, coupled with previous traumatic stress and isolation from social groups, has been proven to increase chances of depression, self-harm, and a plethora of stress-induced physical ailments and disease.
The bill also allows parents to be separated from their children and kept from reuniting with other family members in Canada for up to five years.
Quebec’s immigration policy is currently unique in Canada in that it allows immigrants who are at risk of federal deportation to remain in the province on humanitarian grounds.
However, the PQ has recently faced heavy criticism surrounding proposed laws that would strip newcomers deemed “not proficient in French” of a number of political rights, including the ability to hold public office or raise funds for political parties.
“It is not only for newly arrived Quebecers; it’s for everyone,” Marois told journalists in French in August. “Every citizen of Quebec that wants to be elected as a mayor, as a councillor, as a MNA must have a knowledge of French.”
Still, refugee defense groups like the TCRI are hopeful that the PQ will make good on past promises and make settling immigrants into the labour market a higher provincial priority. Whether the PQ will try to reconcile its liberal stance on refugee reform with more severe attempts at preserving traditional Francophone heritage, however, remains to be seen.
The Parti Québécois declined to comment for this article.

Tami Starlight urges people to “unpack their privilege”
Since April, anti-colonial and indigenous activist Tami Starlight has been traveling across North America offering decolonization and anti-oppression workshops.
Starlight’s workshop tour, which made a stop in Montreal last Thursday at Concordia University, included a historical discussion on decolonization and oppression in Canada, as well as the “basics of grassroots, horizontal, democratic, anti-oppressive, collective community organizing.”
Starlight described herself as an “indigenous two-spirited woman of trans experience,” explaining that she has faced oppression and multigenerational patterns of colonialism and was thus in an ideal position to facilitate the workshop.
“Often people who facilitate these workshops on anti-oppression have grown up with tons of privilege,” she told The Daily.
Starlight started the workshops while working with the Occupy movement, and soon noticed a disconnect between many Canadians and their colonial past and present.
“People come to these workshops with fairly basic knowledge [of colonization],” she said. “[But] there’s a need to unpack their privilege and develop an understanding of anti-oppression.”
For Starlight, “unpacking of privilege” includes acknowledging the government’s role in “perpetrating the madness.”
In the workshop, Starlight argued that capitalist ideologies, based in extraction and exploitation, have resulted in systemic oppression and effectively silenced indigenous voices over the years.
Supporting the state through capitalism, she said, and cultivating a false sense of “uber-nationalism,” only aids this continuous oppression.
“It’s going to be a long struggle,” said Starlight. “There are a lot of people drinking the Kool-Aid, so to speak. But when it comes to being engaged with your community in a meaningful way, we need to understand all of these privileges and all the colonization and historical context in which we are all operating.”
In closing, Starlight advocated for community building as a solution.
“Part of the system that perpetuates [oppression] is that we don’t know each other at all. We are disconnected from people and their historical contexts,” she told The Daily.
“We’ve developed a Canadian culture of minding our own business […] a so-called ‘sleepy nice Canadians’ reputation. When we create community capacity and relationships with people in meaningful ways, then we are a strong community, and then we can create change.”

Jane Everett discusses security, disciplinary hearings
Jane Everett is the former Dean of Students and is currently a professor in the Department of French Language and Literature at McGill. She sat down on Thursday with The Daily and CKUT’s Gretchen King to discuss the previous year and the challenges ahead.
The McGill Daily (MD): At the end of the year there was a message from the principal that described the year as having a “rock n roll” feel to it. Do you have a welcome back message that follows up to what happened last year?
Jane Everett (JE): I can only speak as a person who is a prof, and a welcome message would be: this is an exciting place to be, where we’ve gone through experiences in the last year that I think sensitized everyone to a number of very important issues. And that we should use that energy going forward as a way to question our assumptions – and by ‘our’ I mean the whole community – and to use this influx of new energies coming from the new students primarily but also the new colleagues to help us gain perspective of all the things that happened in the past year, and in the years preceding that.
Gretchen King (GK): What about your views on the student strike? […] What are your concerns about accessible education at McGill as a prof now, but also as the former Dean of Students in the last five years?
JE: It’s very difficult to answer that question without seeming to take sides, and I truly don’t have a side in this because I don’t feel well enough informed on any of these issues…. It was very difficult to get critical distance from all the various arguments that were coming my way, because I heard all sides or many sides and it was hard for me as just an individual to step back an take a look at what was going on and to make up my mind about things. […] There was also the sense that last year we were so immersed in everything, we were trying to keep the University moving as usual…understanding sometimes that usual business will be disrupted for reasons that we can’t do anything about – and that’s fine – but you still have to do your job […] in my case often questioning whether I had the mandate to intervene from anybody. The term Dean of Students is a bit misleading in some ways…some people see it as someone who has oversight over what students do…others see it as a position of pure advocacy for students…. It’s more of an office that connects all things that have to do with students, whether it’s student affairs, student services, student groups and so forth. […]
GK: As Dean of Students last year, I’m sure you heard students talking about the presence of police on campus. […] Do you feel that securitization is a valid concern among the people that you have been in conversation with over the last year? And as a prof, what are your views of cops on campus and the impact of the provisional protocol?
JE: I don’t think any member of the McGill community supports the presence on a regular basis of police on campus…there is no place for them here. If there was a hostile intruder I would welcome them. This is a different case, so I think it would have to be on a case-by-case basis. The reference to securitization, I heard that concern expressed a great deal and I heard students…worrying about being videotaped just walking around. If you were wearing a red square some people felt that they were targeted there. I heard other people say, I’m very happy to have them here, that way we can be sure that things won’t get out of hand again. […] As to there having been an official University response to that so far, the mills of universities grind slowly. […] There was a feeling that we got plunged into a situation [and] we just hadn’t thought ahead of how things might unfold.  So the provisional protocols were kind of an attempt to look ahead a little bit and to provide some clarity […]
GK: …Just last semester there were over fifty [disciplinary hearings] and the semester before we saw a number of students facing disciplinary hearings for their participation in actions to support the MUNACA strike. Are you concerned that these codes, procedures, and hearings are being used against students participating in extracurricular activities such as demonstrations, protests, and support rallies?
JE: That’s not how I view the code [of student conduct] or the Charter. I see them as two balancing documents. The code helps us understand when students have violated the rights of other students or have violated certain university codes…. I would never as Dean of Students…support using the code to suppress dissent. People can express dissent, they can express disrespect, lack of deference, and those are not code offences. You can do it in many different ways. […] I’m looking forward to being a spectator to see what happens with the discussion around the revision of the student conduct because I don’t think it’s well enough known. The suggestion has been made on a number of occasions that we provide something similar to the Fairplay Brochure, [which] gives scenarios about plagiarism, cheating, and things that have to do with what we call academic offenses, but there is another zone which are the non-academic offenses. […] It would be helpful maybe to have a brochure like that.
This interview has been edited for space and clarity.

Focus on maintenance and renovation of infrastructure
Montreal’s $4.1 billion Three-Year Capital Plan (TYCP) will continue to emphasize rehabilitation of the city’s deteriorating infrastructure over development of new initiatives, with 75 per cent of the budget dedicated to maintenance and renovation.
The TYCP is released each year and outlines the city’s capital improvement projects for the next three years.
Approximately sixty per cent of the 2013-2015 TYCP is dedicated to water and roads, with $1.4 billion allocated to the city’s water and sewage systems and $1.1 billion to be put toward modernizing transportation infrastructure.
Taxpayers will be responsible for financing approximately 47 per cent of the TYCP. At a public consultation of the TYCP held by the city’s Finance and Administration Committee on September 11, one anxious Mile-End resident asked about the tax burden. City councillor Michael Applebaum replied in French that, although particular attention was given to the individual taxpayer’s ability to contribute, “exceptional efforts” would be required of the public to tackle aging infrastructure.
Two days later, La Presse leaked the city’s 2013 operating budget, revealing a 3.4 per cent tax hike – one-third of which will go directly to a fund established explicitly to finance the rehabilitation of the city’s water production and distribution systems.
Infrastructure in Montreal and Canada
A report released last week by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) stated that about thirty per cent of Canadian municipal infrastructure is in a “fair” to “very poor” condition, with replacement and repair costs totaling roughly $171.8 billion.
In late August, Le Devoir reported that the number of tunnels and bridges in critical condition in Montreal had jumped from 12 in 2011 to 27 in 2012, according to city inspections initiated after the 2011 collapse of a 25-tonne beam in the Viger tunnel.
According to the TYCP, $44 million will be spent on bridge, tunnel, and overpass upkeep and development in 2013 – a number significantly lower than the $61 million Mayor  Gérald Tremblay had previously announced.
McGill Civil Engineering professor emeritus Saeed Mirza told The Daily that three factors contribute to the critical state of Montreal infrastructure: poor construction, little investment in maintenance, and sheer age.
According to the FCM report, only about 15 per cent of Canadian drinking water infrastructure requires attention.  In Montreal, on the other hand, “in some parts of [the city], we are losing between thirty to forty per cent of our purified water because of pipe leaks,” Mirza told The Daily.
More money is needed
“The previous generation did not spend the money that it needed to on maintenance, and I give Mayor Tremblay a lot of credit… but we need a lot more,” said Mirza.
The city estimates that despite the current TYCP, an additional annual investment of $700 million will be necessary to fully renovate existing municipal infrastructure and has asked the federal and provincial governments to help meet these needs.
Mirza said he is doubtful that Quebec will come through.
“In the end, it’s going to have to be the user that pays,” he said. “[At the provincial level] infrastructure competes with education, it competes with health.”
Criticisms from Projet Montréal
Since its foundation in 2004, Projet Montréal – one of the city’s three municipal parties – has advocated for better initiatives in sustainability and public transport.
“We think this is a continuation of what the Tremblay administration has always been doing […] and that the Three-Year plan does nothing to help bring Montreal into the 21st century,” said Peter McQueen, Projet Montréal’s city councillor for the Côtes-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough.
“It offers nothing in terms of new transport initiatives for residents,” he said.
McQueen and Projet Montréal also object to the fact that five per cent of the TYCP – representing over $206 million – is earmarked for a collection of cultural heritage projects in honour of Montreal’s 375th anniversary. Of that $206 million, $110 million will go to the Société du Parc Jean Drapeau, a paramunicipal body that runs Parc Jean-Drapeau and, according to McQueen, does not answer directly to the city.
… and from Westmount
This year’s TYCP was released in September – earlier than previous years – in order to facilitate project planning.
Finance and Administration Committee Vice President and Westmount Mayor Peter Trent said he believes this is a good idea, but that problems arise because this means that the TYCP is approved before the city’s operating budget. During a public consultation held on September 13, he attempted to pass recommendations to halt the adoption of parts of the TYCP until the operating budget had been examined, but failed to receive support from majority party Union Montréal.
“I suspect that it has something to do with the partisan project,” explained Trent. “You know, in Westmount, the city councillors all run as independents. In Montreal, there are three political parties – and they’re just always at each other’s throats.”
The TCYP will be officially adopted by the Agglomeration Council on September 21.

Management claims workers are on strike, not lockout
The management of Hotel Espresso in downtown Montreal is disputing the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) claim that its employees are on lockout.
The CSN represents 5,500 people in the hotel industry in Quebec at 35 different hotels.
Unionized hotel workers and their employers have been negotiating their contracts in Quebec throughout the summer.  The negotiations have often been hampered by 24-hour strikes, walkouts, and lockouts across the province.
On Sunday, September 9, a 24-hour strike occurred at the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis. This strike was just one of many that have been occurring in Montreal and throughout the province since unionized hotel employee contracts expired in May.
Issues under negotiation include wage increases of three per cent, job security, and pension increases, according to the CSN.
CSN Spokesperson Michel Valiquette told The Daily that the 24-hour strikes occurred “to put pressure for an agreement at the other hotels that have agreements already.”
According to the CSN website, three hotels in Montreal have remained on lockout since August: The Holiday Inn Select, Hotel Maritime Plaza, and the Hotel Espresso.
Stefano De Vito, general manager of the Hotel Espresso, said that the employees at his hotel are on strike, not locked-out.
“This is not a lockout; it is a strike […] they can come in anytime they want, they can come back to work, they are free to work,” he told The Daily.
The CSN website says that Hotel Espresso prevented eighty of its employees from entering the workplace on August 16.
De Vito disagrees.
“We were negotiating, and at noon we left for lunch, and [the union] planned a manifestation while we were negotiating,” he said. “I saw it as a sign of provocation, so I said I was going to cancel the afternoon negotiations.”
Jessica Insogna, a front desk employee at the hotel and U1 Kinesiology student at McGill, told The Daily that the union distributed t-shirts during negotiations.
“They gave them out to all the union employees and said ‘wear them to work tomorrow,’” she said.
After De Vito found out, he allegedly told the workers that they would be sent home if they wore the t-shirts the next day.
“And then the next day, apparently, we were on strike. Most of the front desk employees weren’t aware of what was happening,” said Insogna. “I would say ninety per cent of the front desk staff didn’t get a phone call to turn up at the General Assembly to vote.”
Insogna said she was not allowed to return to work because of her status as a unionized worker.
Of the 35 hotels that started negotiations this past summer, 15 have reached agreements with hotel management as of press time.  Twenty hotels across Quebec remain in negations that will continue into October and November.
When asked if there was a threat of more strikes, Valiquette replied, “It is still a possibility. We would like to give a chance to the negotiations. If we don’t, for sure it will be a possibility to have another 24-hour strike or more.”
The general manager of the Holiday Inn Select did not wish to comment on the issue. The Hotel Maritime Plaza was not able to be reached by press time.

Concerns raised about Bill 101 and student diversity
The Students’ Society of McGill  University (SSMU) released a statement in response to the provincial election results and recent mandate announcements made by Marois’ Parti Québécois government. Uploaded by SSMU’s Communications and Publications Manager on September 11, the statement outlined the society’s concerns for expansion of Bill 101 and adoption of the Secular Charter to Quebec.
Bill 101, or the Charter of the French Language, defines French as the official language of Quebec. The new minority government under Marois seeks to strengthen the legislation and introduce a new bill to ensure that francophones cannot enroll in English CEGEPs.
In its online statement, SSMU announced that it “will remain vigilant…and advocate on behalf of our members in the face of measures which could negatively impact the ability of some to work, [and] receive services…”
In an email to The Daily, SSMU Vice-President External Affairs Robin Reid-Fraser explained, “since we have so many anglophone students, it could impact their abilities to get jobs.”
Reid-Fraser added that she maintains contact with the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) and student associations at Concordia in order to work together.
“We all come from different Quebec-wide associations, or [some schools] don’t have one at all, but it may be a good time to form a sort of coalition of anglophone campuses to make sure our students are being clearly represented,” she said.
SSMU offers representation to the francophone population of the University through the Francophone Affairs Committee.
The statement also commented on the government’s potential adoption of the Secular Charter, which would restrict public display of all religious symbols with the exception of the Christian crucifix.
According to the SSMU Constitution, the society “commits itself to groups, programs, and activities that are devoted to the well-being of a group disadvantaged because of irrelevant personal characteristics that include but are not limited to race, national or ethnic origin, colour, [or] religion….”
“The diversity of our student body is important and we need to be sensitive to how government policies will impact students in different ways…. Advocating for students who are being affected by imposed secularism fits into [the constitution],” explained Reid-Fraser.
The statement was not discussed during the first SSMU Legislative Council of the academic year, which was held on September 13.
Former Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) representative Sean Phipps was not present. The AUS representatives, who hold three SSMU Legislative Council seats, are elected by the Arts undergraduate students in a general election. Article 12.15 of the AUS Constitution states that,  “In the event of a leave of absence by any member of the Executive Committee or Arts Representative to SSMU, Council shall have the authority, if deemed necessary, to appoint a temporary replacement from amongst its members.”
AUS VP External Brian Farnan stated that Phipps was not dismissed but submitted a friendly resignation to the AUS Executive Committee. “I must stress, to my knowledge, that AUS executives have received words [but] no reasons. It was friendly, everything was fine,” he said.
Regarding the pending reappointment of the new representative, AUS President Devon LaBuik said, “The AUS will reappoint a new representative as soon as possible. It shouldn’t affect the representation of AUS in a huge way but Sean’s resignation is certainly a loss.”
Phipps could not be reached for comments at press time.
