French has improved among judges
Justice Pierre Dalphond of the Court of Appeal of Quebec called for strengthened bilingualism in federal and Quebec courts, while he spoke to a small crowd of students gathered for SSMU’s Francofête’s inaugural event at the Faculty of Law on Wednesday.
“Access to justice means being able to be heard in one’s language and to be understood in it,” said Dalphond, one of 25 judges sitting on Quebec’s highest appellate court.
Both Quebec and Canada have strong constitutional protections to ensure that citizens have the right to bring cases forward, to be heard and to testify before courts in either English or French.
While bilingualism has greatly increased among Canadian judges in recent years, institutional unilingualism was prevalent in the Supreme Court of Canada until just a few decades ago, according to Dalphond. In 1979, a majority of the judges sitting on Canada’s highest court were unilingual anglophones. Today, the court is composed by and large of bilingual or functionally bilingual judges, with a few exceptions. “Federal Courts, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Tax Court of Canada are all able to ensure that its judges understand its proceedings without an interpreter.”
Nonetheless, he stressed there is still room for improvement.
“The Supreme Court of Canada stands alone in having non-functionally bilingual judges hearing cases in both official languages. Ideally, we’d have [all] bilingual judges,” said Dalphond.
Dalphond’s sentiments were echoed by Liberal Party MP Denis Coderre’s proposal prior to Parliament’s prorogation last December to require Canada’s top court be functionally bilingual prior to appointment.
Dalphond also commented on lagging bilingualism within Quebec’s judiciary.
“We in Quebec cite cases coming from English Canada all the time, but since most of our judgments aren’t translated in English, coupled with Quebec’s distinct civil law tradition, most anglo-Canadian jurists are kept in the dark.”
As a means to disseminate Quebec’s jurisprudential contribution, Dalphond proposed that translations of Quebec’s most relevant cases be made available in English, though he recognizes that the province has a legitimate desire to project a staunchly francophone identity.
“I understand that the easiest route to spread Quebec’s legal thinking would be simply to translate cases. But out of principle, there ought to be greater initiative from judges from the rest of Canada to be open to the French language,” said Hughes Doré-Bergeron, the event’s organizer and a member of SSMU’s Commission des affaires francophones.
Kay Turner, SSMU President, who helped put on Francofête, emphasized the importance of francophone events at McGill.
“Sometimes francophones feel excluded from events on campus…. It’s really nice to have a series of events that celebrate franco culture, and sharing it with other students,” she said.

Hundreds of demonstrators await collective agreement on salary levels
Prospective students visiting McGill’s Open House on Sunday, January 25, may have noticed a tangled mass of demonstrators at the Roddick Gates.
Hundreds of members from the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) responded to a January 21 executive bulletin urging members to prove the seriousness of their cause by using the Open House to draw attention to their search for a collective agreement with the University.
“Let us show the University that we are willing to give up our time on a Sunday to demonstrate how unhappy we are with the state of negotiations,” said Maria Ruocco, the union president.
The demonstrators picketed the Roddick Gates between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and the demonstration was covered by CTV News at 6 p.m.
“It was to expose ourselves, we just want to make more people aware of our cause,” said Ruocco.
Mookie Kideckel, U1 History student and Daily contributor, volunteered at the Open House for the History faculty and witnessed the demonstration.
“I thought they were on strike when I first saw them, but they were just demonstrating,” said Kideckel. “They were walking in circles. I didn’t know what it was, but I got closer [I noticed] it was MUNACA. Cars were honking, [but] it seemed friendly.”
MUNACA has been searching for a new collective agreement with the University for the past 13 months. The union now has a mandate from its members to use pressure tactics up to and including a general strike. The University has promised to keep open the services that MUNACA employees operate in the event of a strike, although it has noted that some services will be scaled back. Both the University and MUNACA employ a negotiator who is working with a third-party conciliator to reach a settlement.
 Ruocco stressed that McGill and the union have long agreed on every point in negotiation except salary increases.
“Basically, all we want are fair wage increases. We’re hoping that the University comes back to the table with a fair proposal.”
Where the Univesity is currently offering 8.5 per cent over three years, MUNACA is requesting ten per cent.
According to McGill Human Resources’s web site, budget constraints are complicating an agreement with MUNACA’s demands.
“It is important to note that Quebec universities, including McGill University, are facing significant budget deficits which the Ministry of Education has directed must be eliminated within the next three years,” reads their web site.
Neither McGill Human Resources nor the MUNACA web site have updated details regarding the negotiations since December.
But Ruocco said that their message has not changed.
“We want a fair collective agreement and that’s always been the message that we’re giving the administration.”

Students from across Canada will convene at McGill this week to discuss ways to mix business with sustainability.
The sixth annual McGill Business Sustainability Conference, which begins today and runs until Saturday, is focusing on the theme “Awake.”
According to conference co-chair Jacob Schickler, this year’s organizers chose the theme in order to reflect on the prominence that sustainability initiatives have taken in recent years.
“Five years ago, people used the word sustainability in a different way, it was a buzzword,” he said. “It’s not about people turning their lights off anymore; it’s about how we’ve become awakened to the fact that we have to do something right now.”
The conference organizers hope participants will critically analyze current sustainable business models, and discuss those that are mutually beneficial to the environment and the economy.
While the daytime sessions – which bring together representatives of corporations, NGOs, and professors for small presentations – are open only to pre-registered attendees, students may purchase tickets to attend either of the two keynote speeches, taking place on Thursday and Friday evening.
Tonight’s keynote speech features Steven Guilbeault, a founding member of Équiterre, which campaigns for ecological agriculture, fair trade goods, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation in Montreal. He is also a spokesperson for Greenpeace’s climate and energy campaign.
Robert D. Weese, a Vice President at General Electric (GE) Canada who works with all levels of government in support of GE’s Canadian business, will give Friday’s keynote speech.
The conference will also host green groups from various universities at a sustainability fair from 3-5 p.m. on Friday in the Shatner ballroom, which is open to the public.
Both keynotes take place at 5:30 p.m. Thursday’s speech will be held in Moot Court, Chancellor Day Hall, and Friday’s speech will be held in Bronfman 151. Tickets to each event are available at the door and cost $5.

Quebec has lowest provincial average
Last week the amount of debt Canadian students owed to the Federal Government for student loans surpassed $13-billion.
Rising student debt has been brought to the foreground due to Canada’s current economic crisis.
Quebec’s debt averages are the lowest in the country, at $13,000 per person who has student debt. The Maritimes have the highest regional average at $28,000.
Approximately 360,000 students are currently taking out loans from the Canada Student Loans Program, but an extra $5-billion is taken out from provincial loan programs and more still from other loans, including from credit cards, banks, and family, resulting in a broad spectrum of student debt volume across the country.
“[The student loan process] is all so confusing for young students,” wrote Julian Benedict, co-founder of the Coalition for Student Loan Fairness (CSLF), in an email. “[Students are] just trying to get their education without falling into a debt trap.”
Many believe that the effect of student debt runs deeper than monetary and academic concerns.
“[Student debt] affects people’s health, the chances of their completing their degrees, and their impact on society,” said Katherine Giroux-Bougard, Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) President. “Students with a lot of debt are less likely to contribute to the economy, and are less likely to buy houses, start a family, and raise children.”
The solutions to rising student debt vary widely, from tackling the debt itself, to lowering to interest rates, which are presently about one three per cent above bank lines of credit, to lowering tuition fees.
Giroux-Bougard and the CFS’s initiatives are based on increasing the funding channelled to postsecondary education via the Canada Social Transfer, increasing graduate student funding and financial support for First Nations students, increasing funding for the Canada Summer Jobs program – designed to help students get jobs during the summer to help pay off debt.
The goals for Benedict and the CSLF, the only national non-profit organization in Canada whose mandate is focused on student loan borrowers, include democratizing the student loan system by calling for an ombudsperson office, eliminating high interest rates on loans in repayment, abolishing interest during the six-month grace repayment period following graduation, and improving debt reduction measures.
The issue of student debt in Canada is broad and diverse, and likely will not be solved quickly or comprehensively. Giroux-Bougard was concerned that if high student debt isn’t tackled soon, it could have far-reaching consequences for the already crippled Canadian economy.
“Tuition fees increase year after year,” said Giroux-Bougard. “We’re on a slippery slope in Canada.”

Free software movement founder speaks on software human rights
The father of the free software movement descended into a packed room at Concordia Monday explaining to 125 people why freedom is just as important in software as it is in the rest of life.
Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation and lead architect of the GNU Project – which developed part of the GNU/Linux operating system – stressed that there is an ethical requirement to use software that is “free as in freedom, not as in beer.”
“People are not taught to ask ‘how will it affect my freedom?’” Stallman said of software. “A program is free software if it respects a user’s freedom and the social solidarity of its community.”
He argued all ethical programs must allow the four freedoms: the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study how it works and adapt it to your needs, the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour, and the freedom to improve the program and release it to the public to benefit the community.
The vast majority of computer programs are proprietary software, containing licences that make it illegal to exercise some or all of the four freedoms. This leads to ethical dilemmas, according to Stallman.
“Whenever a friend says, ‘I like this program, can I have a copy?’ you have a dilemma,” he said. “[One solution] is don’t have any friends; the other is to reject proprietary software.”
Stallman has always focused on freedom since beginning the GNU Project in 1983 and maintains that software is undemocratic if it fails to provide the four freedoms to users.
In his own life, Stallman tries not to use propriety software, such as Microsoft Word and iTunes. His boycott leaves him unable to use cell phones, taxis with map finders, and most laptops. He admitted in the talk, though, that his flight to Montreal likely used some proprietary software.
“If someone offers you a proprietary program to use, you should say no, for your freedom’s sake,” he said, emphasizing that the relative freedom of programs concern all consumers, not just programmers.
While Stallman supports free software, such as Firefox, OpenOffice, and different distributions of the GNU/Linux operating system, he said that calling these projects “open source” dilutes the emphasis on freedom.
He also encouraged schools to teach students how to use free software, so that students are not locked into using proprietary software from a young age – a preference which becomes costly once they leave school.
“If we want freedom to prevail, we have to fight for it,” he said. “If you teach people about freedom, they’re more likely to care about yours.”

System designed to service only five per cent of student body at one time
Students and staff have consistently had problems accessing the myMcGill portal throughout January due to a higher than expected demand on the system. According to Doug Jackson, the Director of Information System Resources, myMcGill has been experiencing problems since the first day of the this semester.
“The portal has been going in and out of service for the past two weeks,” said Jackson. “Each day, the system has been easily down a minimum of one to two hours.”
Jackson explained that the hardware housing the portal simply could not cope with the high number of users.
“When the system was first put together, we anticipated an average number of 3,500 users at one time,” said Jackson. “However, that number increased to 6,000 last Fall and increased again this Winter.”
The system collapsed primarily because of high usage during the course change period, a shift that Network Communication Services (NCS) – which provides campus-wide access to the Internet and McGill central systems – was unprepared for.
“Initially, we assumed that about five per cent of the student population would access the portal at any given time,” Jackson said. “However, it turned out the portal is much more popular than we first anticipated.”
Jackson added that improving the system afterward proved to be a difficult task.
While NCS did not receive complaints during myMcGill’s downtime directly, the Information Technology helpline did receive several.
“Everyone uses myMcGill – students, academic staff, and administrative staff,” said Jackson. “Complaints were heard from all constituents.”
Currently, the portal is up and running again, as the number of users normally drops after the course change period. Jackson, however, is looking for a more permanent solution to myMcGill’s capacity problem.
“We’ve been working on a project since last Fall to increase the number of users the portal can handle,” said Jackson. “Unfortunately, we could not finish the project by the beginning of January.”
The project is still in the works and will be launched in late February, during reading week, when the number of myMcGill users is low.

Vancouver store fined, BUTT continues to be sold
American Apparel’s West Vancouver location was recently fined $100 for improperly displaying an “adult publication,” BUTT Magazine, within the store.
The fine was the indirect result of mother Trina Campbell’s complaint to mall management about the easy accessibility of the magazine.
On January 13, Campbell was shopping with her 13-year-old daughter in Park Royal Shopping Centre’s American Apparel store, when she picked up an unwrapped copy of BUTT Magazine, a quarterly gay culture publication from the Netherlands, out of a backpack of a mannequin in the window display, according to the local West Vancouver paper North Shore News.
Campbell told the paper that upon opening the magazine, she was exposed to “a double-page spread of two men having full-on sexual activity, not just suggestive.”
In a statement to the media, American Apparel called the incident “regrettable,” but defended the validity of BUTT  as “a respected publication of art, fashion, and gay culture.”
Patricia Leslie, communications manager for the West Vancouver municipality explained that no direct complaint about American Apparel was filed.
“We responded to a complaint we heard through the media. The store was fined for not following by-laws,” Leslie said.
According to West Vancouver’s by-laws, any “adult publications” are to be stored on a shelf at least 1.2 metres from the floor, and covered by opaque plastic.
Media coverage of the event prompted reactions from those who supported Campbell’s complaints. In a letter to the editor of the North Shore News, a fellow Vancouverite applauded Campbell for protesting a “highly pornographic magazine.”
According to the supporter, “Our children’s innocence is a precious commodity and to defend this in the public forum takes a lot of courage. Hopefully other parents will follow suit and let retailers who market to children know that they will not spend their money in stores where the environment is highly sexualized.”
However, Campbell maintained that she was not so much concerned with the nature of the content, but the ease with which she, and youth such as her daughter, were able to access it, according to the report in the paper.
Ren Haskett, Policy and Equity Coordinator for Queer McGill, stressed the importance of having gay publications such as BUTT available to the public.
“Having representations of gay men – and queer people generally – in the media and easily accessible at stores such as American Apparel helps promote positive sexual images for people in the community, and especially for people who may be questioning,” Haskett said.
American Apparel recognized that some of the content within the magazine is classified as mature, but reinforced that the company has taken measures to ensure the magazine is not available to minors.
“We have always taken the precaution to shrink wrap the publication and we do require I.D. (18 and over) to purchase [it],” their press release read.
Moreover, American Apparel asserted that no nudity was in direct view of the public.
“The woman in question went out of her way to retrieve an unwrapped copy of the magazine that was inside of the backpack of the mannequin on an off-limits store display,” explained the release.
This is not the first time American Apparel has come under scrutiny for sexual content; the retail chain is well known for their infamously provocative ad campaigns, and CEO Dov Charney has faced several counts of sexual harassment.
BUTT Magazine will continue to be sold at American Apparel locations nationwide.

Student interest in SSMU activist initiative continues to steadily decline
Only four people attended the re-launch of Reclaim Your Campus (RYC) this Monday – three were representatives from McGill unions, and the last was from CKUT, a campus -community radio station.
SSMU VP External Devin Alfaro and coordinator of RYC, attributed the low turnout at the meeting to general student apathy.
“I would like to see this turn into a strong group, but people are not willing to put in enough time and effort to make it work,” he said.
“If a student organization loses its space on campus, it’s easy to bring people together and turn their anger into a campaign for change, but when there isn’t a specific issue that unites students, it becomes difficult to motivate them.”
But with such a low turnout at the meeting, little progress could be made on the group’s mandate.
Alfaro launched RYC last semester to give a voice back to students, in response to concern that their interests are being ignored by McGill administration. But, after holding a demonstration in September against McGill’s union relations, a Board of Governors staffed by appointed members, and undemocratic administrative decision-making processes, interest in the group dwindled and the campaign collapsed. A meeting later that month was attended by only 20 people, a small fraction of the approximately 100 people at the demonstration.
Attendees at this week’s meeting aired grievances against McGill and discussed ways of using the media to put pressure on McGill administration and push for change.
Maria Ruocco, President of McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), that represents lab technicians, librarians, and porters, shared her experience of working with the media.
“Bad press does work; you have to hit the Principal and you have to hit key dates. By using the local and national media, your discontent will be registered. McGill has a great reputation worldwide, and the administration does not want it to be tarnished,” Ruocco said.
Dan Pujdak, a representative from Association of McGill Undergraduate Student Employees (AMUSE), discussed plans to launch a “Screwed by McGill” essay contest later this semester that would give students a venue to express their issues with McGill and to increase awareness about the widespread discontent among the student body.
While a second meeting for this semester was not scheduled, and advertising remains minimal, Alfaro remains committed to the concept of RYC.
“The problems that sparked the campaign last semester are still very pressing. The whole idea of the group is to draw the links between different organizations at McGill so they can work together to overcome difficulties they share with the McGill administration,” Alfaro said.

Lack of resources in the North makes screening sparse
As many as 30 per cent of Northern Quebec’s Inuit women could be infected with human papilloma virus (HPV), according to new findings presented Monday by Dr. Paul Brassard of the McGill Department of Epidemiology.
Of the 550 surveyed Inuit women from Nunavik, Quebec, about a quarter carried high-risk strains of HPV, a viral infection that accounts for most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. The rates were especially high among girls aged 15-19, 60 per cent of whom carried some form of HPV, with some carrying high-risk strains responsible for dangerous reproductive cancers.
While cervical cancer was once one of the most common cancers in Canadian women, it has been in decline for the past 50 years, likely due to increased awareness and wider availability of the Pap test. According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,  1,500 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in Canada every year, though the figures are likely much higher for under-screened lower socioeconomic groups, including immigrant, and First Nations women.
Brassard found that only about half of Nunavik women went for regular pap tests, well below the Quebec average, and that these low screening rates may explain the prevalence of HPV and cervical cancer in First Nations communities.
“Sixty per cent of cervical cancers appear in women who have not been screened in the past three years,” said Brassard, adding that low screening levels put middle-aged women particularly at risk.
“[There is] sub-optimal [Pap test] coverage in women over 40, when risk of cervical cancer reaches its peak,” he said.
Brassard noted that rates of HPV in First Nations women are between two and six times the national average, and that a systematic testing like that used for mammograms would be the best form of prevention – since early detection could make most cervical cancer avoidable.
But in order to implement such a substantive program, vast resources would be necessary. He explained that with a high turnover of nurses and doctors, many new medical professionals are unfamiliar with the procedures and require proper training. He also claimed the written pamphlets and educational brochures produced by the province were an inappropriate medium to reach Inuit communities, who have strong oral traditions.
While doing his fieldwork, Brassard worked on community awareness by speaking on the local radio show about HPV prevention and encouraging women to call in with questions. While local Inuit leaders were supportive during his eight-year study, Brassard noted that they were often constrained by their lack of resources and other community problems.
“The other big issue up North is ‘competing priorities,’” Brassard said, citing the environment, social issues, and more pressing primary care health issues as competiting for the resources and attention of local leaders.
“When you go in and try to improve these preventable diseases, it usually gets put on the back burner.”
Last fall, the Quebec government implemented a province-wide HPV vaccination program, offered free of charge to girls aged 9-16 through the school system. Girls who are younger than 18 but not attending school could be vaccinated for free while women over the age of 18 must pay for the vaccine, which costs up to $400, and lasts only six years.
The government of Canada allotted $300-million in its 2006 budget to provide HPV vaccinations until 2010, but Brassard estimates it will be 20 years before the results are measurable.
The Quebec government is currently working on a systematic Pap screening process, but has not implemented one yet. Systematic screening processes exist in other provinces and territories, such as the Northwest Territories, where up to 80 per cent of women are screened regularly.
