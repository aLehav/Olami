McGill contemplates “worst case scenario”
Nearly a month after the Parti Québécois (PQ) gained a plurality in the National Assembly, McGill is concerned about the change in rhetoric from the government regarding university financing. Higher Education Minister Pierre Duschesne told La Presse on Saturday that he was not convinced about the existence of university underfunding.
Various actors from the education sector plan to debate the issue at a summit on higher education later this year.
Without a tuition hike or an increase in government funding to solve the problem, the University could be heading toward a “worst case scenario,” according to Vice-Principal (External Relations) Olivier Marcil.
“We can have a lot of success with limited resources when we compare McGill to other world universities, but at some point it’s an elastic that will reach a breaking point,” Marcil told The Daily in French.
The notion of underfunding is mired in controversy.
In an interview with The Daily, Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) President Martine Desjardins alleged that university underfunding was fabricated by the Conférence des Recteurs et des Principaux des Universités du Québec (CREPUQ) in 2007 as a justification for the tuition hikes.
CREPUQ brings together administrations from 18 Quebec universities.
“From our perspective, we are talking about mismanagement. There have been numerous studies that prove that universities have the money, but that it isn’t allocated for research and education,” Desjardins told The Daily in French. “They are transferred into funds that have nothing to do with education.”
A study conducted by CREPUQ in 2010 found that universities in Quebec were underfunded by around $620 million for the 2007-2008 academic year. This number, however, was disputed by the Institute de recherché et d’informations socio-économiques (IRIS), a progressive think tank based in Montreal.
According to a 2011 report by IRIS that quotes CREPUQ’s study, “[the figure $620 million] is not based on an analysis of universities’ needs that points to a lack of resources, but rather on ‘the current difference between the financial resources Quebec universities have at their disposal compared to what institutions in other provinces have.’”
The number only reveals the “additional resources [universities] would gain if Quebec raised its tuition fees to match the Canadian average,” continued the report.
Ludvic Moquin-Beaudry, communication secretary for the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), told the Daily in French, “The money invested per capita in Quebec is more than the Canadian average. The problem is not about a lack of funds. It’s about where the money is being spent.”
McGill’s latest budget stated that revenues have grown “consistently” over the last few years, but have failed to keep up with rising expenditures.
According to the budget released by the University this year, most of these costs are associated with “increases in salary and benefit costs.”
Net assets have increased from $873,290 at the end of 2009 to $1,167,625 in 2012, the budget read.
McGill’s debt for its operating budget is equal to 16.5 per cent of the University’s total operating revenue. It reached a high point of 28.4 percent in the 1991 fiscal year and fell back to its lowest point at 3 per cent in the 2002 fiscal year.
Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum is slated to represent the University at the upcoming education summit, according to Marcil. The University plans to work closely with CREPUQ to explain the “real situation” to the government, he said.
ASSÉ will consult its members before deciding whether to attend the summit.

An anti-police brutality march numbered around 350 last Saturday and remained largely peaceful, with no major confrontations between police and protesters.
The march departed from Place Émilie-Gamelin at around 8:45.p.m. and was declared illegal from the onset by the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) because the route was not shared with the the police beforehand.
The demonstration was called, along with the annual March 15 protest against police brutality, after the recent announcement by the Police Ethics Commissioner that 46 per cent of all ethics complaints made during the student strike had been dismissed.
Led by a band of black-masked protestors, the crowd chanted anti-police slogans and carried signs with the acronym ACAB, which stands for “all cops are bastards.”
The protestors were flanked by riot police throughout the march and followed by mounted police. Fireworks were ignited throughout the demonstration.
The demonstration ended around 11:00 p.m. after protesters were driven onto sidewalks by police.
One protester was given a ticket for launching a flare at a police officer.

Space to be used to add confidentiality to legal counselling
The renovation of the Legal Information Clinic at McGill is currently underway following the temporary closure of the “Green Corner” on the first floor of the Shatner Building.
The Clinic is a free, non-profit, student-run information service. It also runs the Student Advocacy Program, which provides advice and representation to McGill students going through disciplinary and grievance processes.
In summer 2012, the Clinic served over 1,000 clients and referred about 2,000 students to other legal services. In addition, the Student Advocacy Office assists about 150 to 200 students per year.
In an interview with The Daily, Clinic Executive Coordinator Emily Elder explained the reasons behind the expansion of the Clinic.
“Students and [the general] public come into the Clinic to access our services,” said Elder. “Some people come in with very confidential issues, such as sexual assaults.”
“The additional room at the Clinic will allow us to provide a fully secured space for them to discuss their issues with our volunteers,” she added.
In addition to increased confidentiality, the additional space will allow the Clinic to add two more volunteers to every shift on top of the four to five volunteers currently serving the Clinic.
“Most people in Quebec cannot afford legal services, and thus the services provided by the Clinic become very important for anyone from the McGill or Quebec community who cannot afford that,” said Elder.
The additional space will also house the Student Advocacy Office, which will continue to help McGill students advocate for their rights and deal with issues related to discipline and other legal negotiations within the McGill community.
The new space was originally occupied by the Green Corner project led by Organic Campus, one of SSMU’s 21 student-run services.
Since its establishment several years ago, Organic Campus has used the Green Corner to sell baked goods and local produce, as well as for other “green” groups on campus to gather and post information.
In an email to The Daily, SSMU VP Clubs and Services Allison Cooper explained that the Green Corner was “a creative idea to use the little perhaps [six by six foot] space behind the vending machines, but in practice was a little-used hang-out spot that always smelled a little weird.”
According to Cooper, the SSMU Environment Committee and other green groups on campus came to an agreement with the Legal Information Clinic to reduce the space designated to the Green Corner.
“The SSMU Building Committee made the decision [to expand the Legal Information Clinic at McGill] at least last year,” she wrote.
SSMU Sustainability Coordinator David Gray-Donald told The Daily in an email that “the idea is not to kick Organic Campus out.”
“Rather, there has been a temporary displacement of furnishings during the renovation process and then Organic Campus will continue using the space,” he wrote.
“They took some of the space away to extend the legal services clinic,” said Noemi Stern, one of the Organic Campus coordinators. “I mean, we will just have less space, but it should be okay for Organic Campus.”

Union says back to work legislation skewed negotiations
Canada’s largest postal worker union, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), decided on October 5 to endorse two tentative collective agreements with the Canada Post Corporation (CPC): one would cover rural postal workers, the other urban.
The Union has said that its decision is largely the result of legislation passed by Parliament in June 2011, which mandated union members’ return to work and included penalties for non-compliance ranging from $1,000 a day for a single worker to $100,000 a day for the whole union.
In a post on the CUPW website about the tentative agreement for the urban unit, CUPW President Denis Lemelin said that the Union “would never have agreed to these changes if [it] had the right to strike.”
The 2011 back-to-work legislation also stipulated that a government-appointed arbitrator would choose between offers put forward by the CPC and CUPW without considering a compromise.
The tentative agreement between the CPC and CUPW was reached without an arbitrator.
In a press release issued last Friday, Conservative Labour Minister Lisa Raitt stated, “I have always said that the best solution to any labour dispute is one that the parties reach themselves.”
The first appointed arbitrator, former Ontario judge Coulter Osborne, quit when the Union filed a court challenge because he was not bilingual. The second arbitrator, Guy Dufort, was ordered off the case by a Federal Court judge after CUPW raised concerns about his background as a Canada Post lawyer and Conservative Party candidate.  Both were appointed by Raitt.
According to Lemelin, the Union had to decide between “the decision of an arbitrator…or trying to achieve something.”
CUPW members will be voting from November 13 to December 19. Should the agreements be ratified, they will put an end to the two-year struggle that was precipitated in 2010 when the CPC introduced “Modern Post,” an attempt to modernize and streamline mail-delivery.
According to the Union, the Modern Post initiative would have put hundreds out of work and resulted in harsher working conditions.
The collective agreement between CPC and CUPW expired in January 2011.
CPC spokesperson Anick Losier told The Daily that the Crown corporation is “very pleased that we have hit this new milestone and we now need to work together to transform our business, which is certainly suffering in the face of digital alternatives.”
For the Union, the two agreements would essentially achieve the maintenance of basic rights and benefits accorded in previous agreements, as well as protection for new hires.
Among the Union’s victories in the collective agreement for the urban unit are the protection of paid half-hour lunches, the rejection of the CPC’s previous attempt to replace retiree benefits with a spending account, and entitlement to a defined benefit pension plan for future employees.
“The most important thing is the pension plan…the second one is that we still have job security so people can plan their lives and that the working conditions will be the same,” Lemelin told The Daily. “I think we achieved to protect what we have.”
Lemelin also added that even if the agreements were ratified, the Union would still be busy.
CUPW filed a constitutional challenge in the Ontario Supreme Court last October, which argued that the back-to-work legislation violated the freedom to associate as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
“As workers and citizens of this country, we […] deserve to be respected, we deserve to have a government that is really looking after the people and not only protecting big corporations,” said Lemelin.
