MUNACA and McGill begin to address monetary issues at the bargaining table
McGill’s non-academic workers set up picket lines early Wednesday morning around exits from the Jacques-Cartier Bridge.
The McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) has been on strike since September 1.
Union members began picketing near the bridge at about 7:30 a.m., and MUNACA VP Finance David Kalant estimated that there were between 500 and 600 union members participating.
Picket lines formed on de Lorimier at the intersections with de Maisonneuve and Ontario.
“We were making our presence [felt] there. We would also occasionally cross the streets and we were also trying to hand out flyers to the cars when they were stopped at the light,” Kalant told The Daily on Wednesday. He added that police were on the scene “almost immediately.”
“They were there very quickly and directing us not to cross on the red lights. So, we obeyed and we crossed where we could on green lights, back and forth, just being visible, and overall it was quite civil,” said Kalant.
The Montreal Gazette reported that traffic was slowed for the duration of the union’s picketing.
According to Kalant, the delay was minor.
“It didn’t really hinder traffic that much and it didn’t cause any serious problems, but it did get a lot of attention from people,” he said.
“It’s probably the only bridge onto Montreal that you have good access to…and we knew there’d be a lot of traffic and so there’d be a lot of exposure and the ability to publicize the fact that we have been pushed further and further away from McGill University in terms of trying to get our message across in our picketing,” Kalant said, referring to the three injunctions that McGill has won against the union.
The union’s picketing activities are legally required to operate within the restrictions outlined in the injunctions. The restrictions limit picketing around university property, the workplaces of members of McGill’s Board of Governors, the homes of senior McGill administrators, and the McGill University Health Centre construction site.
Kalant said that union members left the bridge at around 9 a.m. and convened at Papineau metro station before walking back to McGill’s downtown campus along Maisonneuve.
“The police did a road closure of the street for us so we handed flyers out along the way,” he said.
McGill issued a statement to the media in response to the union’s activities.
“We think it’s unfortunate that the union has chosen to use this dispute to affect others who aren’t connected with it in any way,” the statement reads.
Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa was unavailable for comment, as McGill and MUNACA were in conciliation meetings on Wednesday. The two parties are scheduled to meet again on Friday.
Both McGill and MUNACA informed The Daily that “monetary issues” – wage scales, benefits and pensions – would be discussed at the table in the current round of negotiations.
MUNACA President Kevin Whittaker spoke to The Daily on Tuesday, before negotiations began for the week.
“Right now we’re starting to discuss our primary issues, which are wage scales, and our protections for the benefits and pension,” he explained.
“And we have been told that we should make ourselves available for the weekend – this was coming from the conciliator,” continued Whittaker.
“We are hopeful that we will at least be able to discuss these issues and make it clear to the conciliator what our concerns are and why we are out on strike, because it is these reasons that have caused this strike,” he added.
McGill’s statement explained the University’s position on negotiations in light of the introduction of monetary matters into conciliation.
“We are at the table [Wednesday] and again on Friday, with monetary issues on the table, and we think everyone should really be focused on negotiations right now because that is how this is going to be resolved.”

Occupiers plan for the coming winter
With Occupy Montreal almost two weeks old, occupiers in the growing tent city are running out of room.
Earlier this week, an attempt to expand the encampment into Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle, a public square two blocks away, was met with opposition from the City of Montreal.
“We asked City Hall on Monday night, and again on Tuesday morning, but they said we couldn’t camp there,” said occupier Laurent Goncourt in French.
Gonzalo Nunez, a public relations officer for the City, told The Daily on Wednesday that the City’s decision was for public safety reasons. “Our emergency services have to be able to intervene in an emergency situation, so we’ve asked the protesters to stay on one site,” he explained.
Although occupiers were in Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle earlier this week, they have since left. The occupation is currently contained to Square Victoria, which was renamed La Place du Peuple on the first day of the occupation.
Stéphan B., an occupier working in the communications tent, explained to The Daily in French that, for the time being, there is enough space in Square Victoria.
“But, in the future,” he said, “I don’t know what will happen.”
Occupiers are also discussing ideas for continuing the occupation into the winter.
“When it gets cold, people will start to leave if they’re not comfortable,” said Goncourt.
A yurt – a circular, portable, wood-framed shelter – was erected this week, and social activist Mostafa Hennaway has proposed that people move into empty floors in the adjacent Bourse de Montréal building as the weather gets colder.
Most occupiers seem willing to stay within the law to sustain the occupation.
“From my understanding, we’re trying to do a legal occupation,” said Tara, a volunteer at the information tent. “In New York City, they’re not even allowed to camp. This is the Rolls Royce of occupations.”

Protests and massacres in home country denied, blamed on foreign nations and media
A day before Tunisia’s first free national elections, members of the Syrian community in Montreal gathered in force to support the authoritarian president of their homeland, Bashar al-Assad, and to denounce protesters whom the Syrian army has killed by the thousands this year.
Beginning in the late afternoon, and continuing until nearly eight in the evening, around two hundred people met on the west side of Parc Jeanne-Mance, chanting “We support Bashar al-Assad” in Arabic and carrying placards sporting pro-Assad slogans, like “We trust our president.”
The Montreal rally came a few days after a government-organized rally, attended by tens of thousands of Assad loyalists, in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo.
Assad succeeded his father as Syrian president in 2000. Since March, Assad has been sending armed troops, tanks, and snipers into Syrian cities in response to largely peaceful protests calling for democratic reforms and, more recently, for Assad’s ouster. The UN estimates that over 3,000 people have been killed in the government crackdown, including nearly 200 children. Opposition groups maintain the number of dead is over 5,000.
Some of the protestors on Saturday denied the existence of large-scale unrest in Syria. “Thanks to God, everything is perfect,” said one man, who did not give his name. “Everything in Syria is positive. There is nothing negative. And all of Syria, they support Bashar [al-]Assad.”
Asked why there were protestors in the streets of Syrian cities – tens of thousands have participated in protests nationwide – the man replied, “The people of Syria are 23 million. If you see a few – five, ten, twenty – that doesn’t change.”
Those that did acknowledge the protests in Syria were quick to label them the product of foreign interference. The countries named by demonstrators ranged from Turkey and Saudi Arabia to France and the United States.
One man called for “the Americans and the French to leave Syria alone. We can fix our own problems. Our president is working on it.”
U.S. President Barack Obama called for Assad to “step aside” in August, the same day the U.S. imposed energy sanctions on Syria.
Several demonstrators suggested that Israel was bankrolling the protests as retribution for Assad’s hard-line stance towards the Jewish state.
Assad is “the only one right now in the whole world who’s standing up against the West and the Israelis,” said a man who gave his name as Reffat A.
Reffat went on to say that Turkey and Lebanon were assisting the Syrian opposition because “they want to give a good face to the Israeli lobby, the Jewish lobby.”
There was a widespread feeling amongst demonstrators that the international media is inflating the scope of the Syrian uprising, and distorting its true nature.
“I think all the media have no respect…for the reality and for the truth,” said one man, who asked not to be named.
“It’s a media war,” said Rami Kaplo, a Montreal lawyer.
“A lot of people just despise the Western media because of the lies,” he continued. “The Western media is not even admitting there are armed gangs” among protestors in Syria.
He pointed to the BBC, CNN, and France 24 as examples.
A number of demonstrators echoed the claim that the Syrian uprising is made up of criminals. The Syrian government frequently defends its use of force against protestors by saying that “armed gangs” have killed hundreds of soldiers and police. Despite recent reports of sporadic violence by members of the anti-Assad opposition, including the assassination of a pro-regime cleric, the vast majority of people killed since March have been unarmed protestors, according to embassies and human rights groups in Syria. Foreign journalists have largely been barred from the country.
Many of Saturday’s demonstrators were also alarmed by the presence of the Muslim Brotherhood in the uprising, saying Islamists threatened to shatter the Syria’s delicate balance of religious and sectarian groups currently held together by a rigidly secular state.
Rex Brynen, professor of political science at McGill, acknowledged that many Syrians who are not part of the majority Sunni sect of Islam are worried about encroaching Islamism.
But, he noted in an email to The Daily, “a great many of the protesters opposing the current regime in Syria are themselves avowed secularists.”
“In any case, the objection rather misses the point. Syrians should be free to decide on the nature of their political system, whether secular or non-secular, through free and fair elections. Rather than offering his people this most basic of human rights, however, Bashar al-Assad instead offers only bloody repression in an increasingly desperate attempt to cling to political power,” he continued.
One man, watching the rally with friends visiting from Syria, called those participating “kind of ignorant.”
“In Syria right now people are dying. So watching people supporting him, [playing] music while you have people dying, is kind of sad,” he said.
A march in protest of human rights abuses in Syria is scheduled for this Saturday, starting at noon in Norman Bethune Square.
Kaplo offered a cautious defence of the actions of the current regime. “Maybe they could have dealt with it differently,” he said of the crackdown. “If you’re talking about human rights, it might be wrong. But we’re talking about politics.”

Federal government grants exception to foreign elections policy
This past weekend, roughly 10,000 Tunisians lined up in Montreal and Ottawa to vote for the first time since the country successfully ousted president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali nine months ago. The ouster sparked similar revolutions across North Africa and the Middle East.
While approximately 90 per cent of Tunisians residing in Tunisia turned out to vote, the Tunisian diaspora around the world also organized itself to participate in the election. Outside of Tunisia, the Instance régionale indépendante pour les élections des Tunisiens (IRIE) was the group responsible for the organization and implementation of the elections.
According to the CBC, many Tunisians living in Canada did not think they would get the chance to vote after the federal government said in September it would not allow the Tunisian embassy to open polling stations. The CBC reported that the decision was overturned in mid-October.
Bochra Manai, general secretary for the IRIE, said, “Canada only said that they didn’t want to be part of an electoral circumscription… They had this position since September, and they continued to have it in every meeting with the Tunisian ambassador.”
In an email to The Daily, a spokesperson for the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Aliya Mawani, addressed the issue.
“Canada encourages foreign states to allow their citizens residing permanently or temporarily in Canada to exercise their right to vote in elections in their country of origin, namely by absentee ballot. All requests for foreign polling are assessed on a case by case basis,” she wrote.
In February 2008, the federal government established a policy to reject requests made by foreign states to count Canada as an extraterritorial electoral constituency.
Mawani defined an “extraterritorial constituency” as “a voting district or riding determined by a foreign state to include territory in Canada – essentially making Canada a riding of a foreign country.”
Manai attributed the federal government’s position to a misunderstanding. “They didn’t want Canadian citizens to be a part of a foreign assembly, but the fact that we are electing deputies for the [Tunisian] assembly doesn’t mean that they are representing us. They are not representing anyone [in particular]. They are representing all the Tunisians,” she said.
“We had the right to vote here because Tunisia and the [IRIE, who organized the election within Tunisia] thought it would be important to hear what the Tunisians outside the country have to say. There is no representation of Canada or any other country [in the Tunisian assembly],” Manai continued.
Haroun Bouazzi, a Tunisian citizen living in Montreal, said, “The Tunisian people really wanted to participate in this change… We saw that people were waiting in line for hours, even outside Tunisia. For the vote in Canada and other countries, the participation was very strong. The Tunisian people really wanted to be a part of this.”
Manai said that the IRIE was worried about accommodating the masses of people coming from all over and outside of the city to vote.
“A lot of people came from cities outside of Montreal. The people organized themselves and came in buses. We were scared of the number of Tunisians we would have to deal with,”   she explained.
“We had to deal with many challenges in every country, but it was part of the excitement,” she continued.
Borhene El Kamel, spokesperson for the Tunisian Embassy, said the election went “extremely well, in an ordered, democratic and transparent manner” in Ottawa.
“That was the same case for the elections held in the other foreign countries as well as in Tunisia,” he continued.
Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party, was declared the winner early this week, with over 40 per cent of the vote.
Manai said that she thought that “a lot of people are really scared of what the party could say or do.”
She proposed that Tunisians should be patient, however. “If this new government will put in danger the freedom we fought for during the last year… I will, as [a] Tunisian, fight for them again. That’s my position for the moment.”

Budgetary decisions contested outside of Liberal Party Convention in Quebec City
On Saturday, October 22, hundreds of students from around the province gathered in Quebec City to protest tuition hikes and other budgetary measures announced by the provincial government last March.
Starting on the outskirts of the city, the protest moved downtown to the Quebec City Convention Centre, where about 2,000 delegates were meeting for the Liberal Party Convention, the majority party in the Quebec National Assembly.
The theme of the protest was “rouge de colère” – red with anger. Tomatoes were thrown at a poster of Premier Jean Charest’s face, and some students came dressed in red.
Quebec university tuition is set to increase $325 per year, for five years, starting in September 2012. The increases will raise base provincial tuition from $2,168 to $3,793, which is below the Canadian average.
In March, the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) referred to the increases as a “declaration of war against students.”
About ten McGill students took part in a SSMU-organized bus trip to the demonstration and back. Among them was SSMU VP External Joël Pedneault, who explained in an email to The Daily that SSMU’s stance is to “oppose all financial barriers to accessing university, including tuition fees.”
“Tuition hikes will not only increase the amount of debt people have to get into to finish their degree,” he wrote, “but might also deter some people from even enrolling in university in the first place.”
Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand disagrees.
“Nothing allows us to establish a causal relationship between the amount of students enrolled in university and tuition,” wrote Bachand in his official budget plan, released in March. He said that a third of the generated funds will be returned to students through bursaries.
The Quebec government says these are necessary measures to deal with inflation, and claims that students would still be paying less than 17 per cent of the total cost of their studies by 2017.
Pedneault remains skeptical.
“It seems to me that the Quebec government has decided to raise tuition fees…because it is much easier than raising taxes on the private sector or wealthy taxpayers, both of which might decide to withdraw their support for the current government if they had to finance a larger portion of public expenditures,” he said.
He also believes that the government has chosen “the one method of financing universities which primarily benefits financial institutions – incurring debt means having to pay interest, every cent of which goes straight to the finance sector.”
In March, McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum told the CBC that she had hoped for even more of an increase in tuition. In her view, “the government has been quite timid in the steps that it has taken with respect to tuition. This will leave Quebec’s universities still dramatically underfunded vis-a-vis their Canadian counterparts.”
Yet Pedneault maintained that “the government is essentially banking on its false hope that students will not be able to organize to prevent tuition increases.”
Marie-Pier Isabelle, president of the Quebec Young Liberals, said that no matter how many protests are conducted, the government would not overturn its decision.
“Throwing tomatoes is certainly not the way to go about dealing with these issues,” she told The Daily in French after the demonstration. “However, the Liberal Party is always open to discussing ways in which to make higher education more accessible. That remains one of our priorities,” she continued.
Another demonstration protesting tuition hikes is scheduled for November 10 in Montreal.

Government has no accurate estimates for homeless population
Despite an increase in provincial government funding to combat homelessness – in 2009, $14 million was allocated over three years for preventative measures – the numbers of homeless people are on the rise in Quebec.
According to multiple organizations that offer services for homeless Quebeckers, there has been a significant increase in the demand for services like temporary shelter and clothing distribution.
Despite these reports, neither the provincial nor federal government is able to provide a reliable estimate for the number of homeless people in Quebec.
According to François Saillant, a spokesperson for le Front d’action populaire en réaménagement urbain (FRAPRU), the question of quantifying homelessness is fraught with political difficulties.
“It could potentially be done to marginalize the homeless. It’s been done in the past,” Saillant explained.
Estimating the size of the homeless population is important because the number can affect the amount of government funding allocated for social services.
There have been several attempts by the federal government to determine the number of homeless people in Canada. However, many social organizations  have criticized these studies as being too conservative, and some are questioning the necessity of quantifying the homeless population at all.
According to Maude Ménard-Dunn, a community organizer for the Réseau d’aide aux personnes seules et itinérantes de Montréal (RAPSIM), the money that goes towards these studies would be better spent elsewhere. RAPSIM bills itself as an umbrella organization for homeless shelters in Montreal.
“We are not opposed to a census for the homeless,” Ménard-Dunn said. “However, we believe that there is more of a need for social services.”
Most studies are conducted by calculating the number of individuals who make use of homeless shelters.
However, these numbers do not account for those who do not utilize these services.
“It’s obvious that not every homeless person will use these resources,” Ménard-Dunn explained. “They are people who do not use these resources and are still on the street. There is also the people who couch surf.”
Couch surfing is a form of homelessness in which an individual sleeps in different peoples’ homes rather than utilizing shelter services.
“This phenomenon mainly affects women,” she said. “They’ll offer sexual favors in exchange for a place to sleep.”
The definition of homelessness is also of significant importance.
Various organizations classify homelessness in different ways. For instance, unlike governmental definitions, the Fédération de ressources d’hébergement pour femmes violentées et en difficulté du Québec considers victims of family violence to be homeless.
A 2006 study commissioned by the Centre Nationale sur la violence familiale, found that when abused women were not recognized as homeless, the capacity to improve their situation “would be severely diminished.”
Meanwhile, the demand for homeless services in Montreal continues to rise. While there is no hard data, according to RAPSIM, the services are overwhelmed.
“We are talking about thousands of people who are turned away from shelters due to lack of space,” Ménard-Dunn explained.
“We are asking for a national policy on homelessness. There needs to be a real vision for the government. We need to know where we will be in 10 years,” she said.

Families demand “justice, truth, and dignity”
A commemorative vigil and march to remember victims of police killings took place in Montreal last Saturday.
“Police everywhere, justice nowhere,” the crowd, consisting of victims’ family members and their supporters, chanted in French as they started their march in front of the office of the Montreal Police Brotherhood. The demonstration was organized by The Justice for Victims of Police Killings Coalition, which includes the relatives, friends, and allies of Anas Bennis, Claudio Castagnetta, Ben Matson, Quilem Registre, Gladys Tolley, and Fredy Villanueva – all of whom died as a result of police actions and interventions.
Andrea Figueroa, a representative of event co-sponsor QPIRG McGill, explained in an interview with The Daily that the coalition was formed in 2010 after the Forum Against Police Violence and Impunity was held in Montreal.
“[The families of the victims] met with a bunch of other folks who were helping organize the conference, and wanted to organize something that happened every year that was sort of in memory and to highlight the injustices that have been happening to all these families,” said Figueroa.
According to their website, the Coalition seeks “dignity, justice, and truth” because they believe that some of the investigations into the police-related deaths were inconclusive and dubious.
“The common demand they all have is that they want justice for their families, for their families’ members that have been killed, and nothing has happened yet,” said Figueroa.
After the march, the group gathered to express their solidarity with the families of the victims and to listen to their concerns. Julie Matson – the daughter of Ben Matson, killed by a member of the Vancouver Police Department in 2002 – addressed the crowd to express her worries about the reach of police impunity.
“If you look at us, we are all really normal people – this is the thing about this kind of violence, is that it affects everybody,” she said.
Lilian Madrid, the mother of Fredy Villanueva, was among the members of the Coalition that led the march down St. Denis.
“What we are asking for is justice… We want justice to be made,” said Madrid. “We want that police officer to pay for the death of my child. We are not asking for money, what we are asking for is justice.”
Madrid also told The Daily that she believed racial profiling played a part in her son’s death. “All the boys that were there…there were no Québécois,” she said. “They all were Latino and people that have come to Canada to seek refuge, people from other countries.”
Following the highly publicized investigation into Fredy Villanueva’s death, Dany Villanueva, Madrid’s other son and a key witness in the investigation, is facing deportation to Honduras.
Robyn Maynard, a social justice organizer in Montreal and Convergence des luttes anticapitalistes member involved with the march and vigil, agreed with Madrid.
“[Police brutality] happens to people who are socially profiled, people with mental health issues, people who are very poor, whose lives are not given as much value in our society,” Maynard said. “Those are the people who the police can kind of have impunity to kill because there are no repercussions.”

Parliamentary committee seeks to clarify law, end taxpayer-funded court case
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) is battling the Information Commissioner of Canada, Suzanne Legault, over a section of the Access to Information Act that gives the broadcaster an exemption from releasing certain records. The case is currently in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The CBC received 327 Access to Information requests (ATIs) last year and responded to 257 within the government-mandated time frame. The Information Commissioner reviews complaints about how ATIs are handled.
The CBC is contesting the extent to which Legault can investigate complaints. In 2010, the Federal Court ruled that Legault could examine information herself and decide whether or not the CBC should be required to release it. The CBC disagrees, claiming that, by law, some information is exempt from being released under the Act.
The Conservative government brought the CBC, as well as all other Crown Corporations, under the Act in 2007. The Act’s purpose is primarily to “extend the present laws of Canada to provide a right of access to information in records under the control of a government institution.” However, the CBC has a special exemption; Section 68.1 states that the Act does not apply to the broadcaster’s journalistic, creative, or programming activities.
In a meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics last Thursday, Konrad von Finckenstein, former Federal Court judge and current chairman of the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), said “the easiest way to fix it is to establish by legislation” whether the Information Commissioner can look at the documents or not.
“Unfortunately, the section in dispute here has been drafted in such a way that you have a double exemption: the Act does not apply, except it does apply,” Finckenstein told the committee.
On Tuesday, Legault proposed a “discretionary, injury-based exemption” that would require the CBC to prove that revealing certain information would cause them harm.
Some Canadians are concerned that the court case is a costly way of resolving a dispute between federal institutions, since taxpayers are paying the legal fees for both sides.
“I think that the fastest way to end this battle would be for Parliament to reconsider Section 68.1,” said Dean Del Mastro, a Conservative MP involved in challenging the CBC, in an interview with The Daily.
Del Mastro disagrees with the way the CBC has been using Section 68.1.
“They’re, in fact, using that clause to exempt all of their expenditures, which is not the intent of access to information laws,” he said.
Derek Fildebrandt, the national research director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, agrees that the court battle is a waste of money, but doesn’t think that the legislation has to be changed.
“The spirit of the Act was very clear and the CBC has flat-out refused to acknowledge that it applies to [them],” he said. “You can’t spend $1.13 billion without being accountable for it.”
Fildebrandt has experience filing ATIs, and calls the CBC’s current process “an unmitigated disaster.”
“There are some serious problem spots for access to information right across the federal government, but the CBC stands up as the absolute worst,” he said.
Although public interest groups and other media sources do file ATIs, media conglomerate Quebecor has filed the majority of ATI requests with the CBC. Quebecor has challenged the CBC for refusing to release, among other things, the costs of operating its fleet of vehicles.
The CBC responded to challenges from Quebecor in a statement on its website: “We, and [Legault], are trying to clarify the rules which protect ‘journalistic, programming, and creative activities.’ This is the proper thing to do.” The CBC statement added that it reports to several government bodies, and is, therefore, already being held accountable.
While giving a talk at the University of British Columbia about the future of Canadian broadcasting, CBC President Hubert Lacroix explained that the CBC is fighting to protect its journalistic sources.
Yet, Quebecor CEO Pierre Karl Péladeau told the Parliamentary committee on Thursday that “of the 16 Access to Information requests that are before the court, not a single one is in any way related to journalistic sources.”
Lacroix will appear before the committee next Tuesday.
