Four editors have left the campus publication after publishing an article criticizing adoption by same-sex couples
Four editors and about ten writers have left the Prince Arthur Herald after the November 18 publication of an article criticizing adoption by same-sex couples.
The article, written by Rick Fitzgibbons – director of Comprehensive Counseling Services in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania – and originally published on mercatornet.com, argued the damaging social and psychological effects that children raised by same-sex couples could suffer. Mercatornet.com describes Fitzgibbons as having practiced psychiatry for 35 years.
The Herald, almost a year into its existence, is an entirely student-run online newspaper based at McGill. According to its statement of principles, “Our authorship shall reflect freedom of expression, and vigorous, open, intellectual debate. We will pride ourselves on hearing all sides, cherishing intelligent and well-informed dialogue.”
Alexandra Markus, a former assistant editor at the Herald, said the newspaper doesn’t “really have much of a filtering process.”
“They don’t refuse articles, because they believe that refusing any article is censorship,” she said. “They took this whole no censorship thing a little bit too far – a lot too far, actually.”
Deane McRobie, former managing editor, said he had been told to “axe liberal articles.”
McRobie said he left the Herald about two weeks before Fitzgibbons’ article was published, saying that he was at odds with some of the members of the Board of Directors. According to McRobie, “There were probably forty articles out of which I edited things that could’ve exploded, like [Fitzgibbons’] article.”
“I took a lot of heat for the being the one who would send these articles back,” he added.
“I didn’t resign of my own accord. I was fired, but I saw it coming in that, I mean, the situation could not have gone anywhere else after a certain point,” he continued. “The Directors were not very tolerant of views but their own.”
Cameron James, former Herald business and finance editor, was the last editor to resign, two days after Fitzgibbons’ article was published. James said the article was one of several reasons he quit.
“When I brought it up to the company in terms of my opposition towards it, they defended it with the concept of free speech and no censorship – which I 100 per cent agree with – but the fact of the matter is that the article was, I thought, poorly written, poorly cited, it wasn’t well-researched,” he said. “If an article is poorly written, it just shouldn’t be published, regardless of the argument.”
After reading the article, James contacted the Herald’s managing editor, Rebekah Hebbert, but did not receive a response. He then contacted the newspaper’s CEO, Alexandre Meterissian, and another editor who had resigned.
James then contacted his writers, whom he said offered support for his resignation. He resigned the next day, as did several of the business and finance section writers.
In an email to The Daily, Herald Chief Communications Officer Marc-Olivier Fortin stated, “We don’t discuss any internal matter concerning the company. However, know that the majority of vacant positions have been filled and that we will continue to present both sides of the debate.”
Markus, as well as McRobie and James, commented on what they saw as a more partisan direction the Herald has recently taken. McRobie said the paper “got hijacked.”
According to McRobie, at the Herald opinion pieces undergo three edits, with articles in other sections going through two. Neither James nor Markus saw Fitzgibbons’ article before it was published.
“I think my job in retrospect, or what I was doing most importantly, was keeping the crazies at bay, and when I left, the floodgates broke loose,” McRobie continued.
The Herald has not removed the article nor has the editorial board acknowledged any of the resignations on its site. A “Letters to the Editor” page was posted on November 23. When The Daily went to press, it featured three letters supporting the article and four letters criticizing it.
James called the “Letters to the Editor” page “kind of their concession,” as opposed to removing the article.
“The company position on it was like, the damage has already been done. Regardless of whether it was a poor article or not, there’s no point in removing it now because that would only, I don’t know, show a sign of weakness or something,” he said.
McRobie described “a business model in play” aimed at generating website traffic, building a solid fan base, and creating controversy, although he noted that it “happens almost necessarily at the expense of quality, or the expense of balance, or at the expense of journalistic integrity.”
“It’s sad. It was a great idea to begin with. It was supposed to be a campus alternative. It was supposed to be the kind of free speech, free-thinking alternative to existing campus media,” he added.
Markus emphasized that the Herald staff “have been nothing but kind to me.”
“I honestly don’t have any complaints about anyone in particular,” she said. “They were a joy to work with, but it just got too much.”

Munroe-Blum discusses McGill’s importance to Quebec economy
While Principal Heather Munroe-Blum spoke to some of Montreal’s biggest corporate stakeholders about McGill’s continuing impact on Quebec, MUNACA strikers sought to make an impact of their own.
The lunch and talk, which was hosted by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, centered around “McGill’s heritage and its ongoing impact on the province of Quebec, the role of universities, research, and graduate diplomas as wealth drivers in our society,” according to a press release.
Eight MUNACA supporters, who individually rose from tables around the room to condemn the actions of the Principal – crying out “shame on McGill” and “please resolve the strike” – were quickly escorted out of the building by security.
Over 100 MUNACA strikers picketed outside of the Sheraton Centre on René-Lévesque Ouest during the lunch.
According to MUNACA VP Finance David Kalant, who was picketing outside, “[MUNACA] is here to send [Munroe-Blum] the message that we’re still on strike – she’s talking all about community at McGill, and we’re part of it, but right now we’re not really part of it.”
Munroe-Blum sat at a table of honour with other guests, including the chair of McGill’s Board of Governors Stuart Cobbett, and editor-in-chief of the Montreal Gazette Alan Allnutt.
Michel Leblanc, CEO and president of the Board of Trade, opened the lunch by explaining in French that schools, such as McGill, are “part of the wealth of Montreal.”
In speaking about the importance of financing universities, Leblanc pointed out McGill’s role as a leader in its recent changes to the MBA program – which included raising MBA tuition from just over $2,000 per year in 2009 to $32,500 this academic year.
“It is in our interest that we project internationally the quality of training that we can provide. In doing what we did with the MBA program, we did just that, and I congratulate McGill and Heather Munroe-Blum,” he said.
Munroe-Blum, who delivered her speech in both French and English, covered topics such as McGill’s underfunding, competition with other universities and countries, and the strength of the McGill community.
Minutes into her speech, one MUNACA supporter stood and yelled, “Heather Munroe-Blum, is this leadership? Sending in riot police to your campus. I was there that night on November 10. Is that your idea of community?”
Munroe-Blum continued her speech despite being interrupted every few minutes by similar union supporters around the room.
Referring to current difficulties being experienced by the global economy, Munroe-Blum stated in French that McGill, too, experiences “highs and lows, as is evident.”
“In such circumstances, it is good to look back and consider everything we’ve achieved. Fifty years ago, Quebec did not have an organized post-secondary education system… Today Quebec has an exceptional university system,” she said.
“Our economy is only as strong as our education system, and that system is only as strong as the people who support it,” she said. “Students, their families, employers who know the importance of an educated work force, and generous visionary community leaders must support our universities, along with stable, effective, predictable, government support.”
“When you are investing in education, you are investing in your economy … you are investing in healthy civil society,” she added.
Referring to a report that was released at the lunch by SECOR – a Canada-based international strategic management consulting firm – titled “Driving Excellence and Prosperity in Quebec,” Munroe-Blum stated that McGill’s “education and training of highly skilled people” increases Quebec’s productivity by nearly one billion dollars each year.
Kalant spoke to The Daily after the event, explaining that the protests, both in and outside of the building, had been planned throughout the week prior.
Although he did not know how the message was received, Kalant explained that, “the point being, the message was received. We got our message through.”
Kalant confirmed that the MUNACA supporters who spoke out at the lunch were free to leave without consequence after being escorted out of the building.

Campus weighs in on the Conservative government choosing unilingual candidate
The appointment by the Conservative government of unilingual Michael Ferguson as Canada’s new Auditor General has sparked controversy.
The government’s own job posting stated: “proficiency in both official languages is essential.”
On November 3, the Liberals walked out of the Senate and all NDP members voted against the appointment, calling the decision an abuse of power.
Asked why NDP did not choose to boycott the vote, co-President of NDP McGill Samuel Harris explained, “The NDP strongly disagree with it. We represent the most francophones out of any party, but expressing our opinion in Parliament and voting against it sends a stronger message.”
Section 20 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom states, “Any member of the public in Canada has the right to communicate with, and to receive available services from, any head or central office of an institution of the Parliament or government of Canada in English or French.”
However, McGill political science professor Richard Schultz said that Section 20 does not specifically apply to the position of Auditor General.
“If I was to go up to the Auditor General’s office, it would be like me going to the post office in the sense that I could get service in English or French, but there is nothing in there that says he has to be [bilingual], it’s just taken for granted,” he said.
Schultz called the decision “offensively rude,” however.
“It’s an affront to Parliament because the Auditor General is a parliamentary officer. He or she serves Parliament, not the government,” he said.
In fact, Schultz believes opposition parties were “snookered.” Ferguson had been the Auditor General of New Brunswick, Canada’s only constitutionally bilingual province.
“It must have been assumed he spoke both languages,” said Schultz.
Schultz continued by saying he didn’t consider the appointment anti-francophone, but noted, “I can’t imagine how Anglophones would feel if we appointed a unilingual francophone to that position.”
Harris disagreed, saying, “It’s plain and simple, because he’s not bilingual, he’s not qualified for the job. It’s not partisan, it’s just part of the job requirements.”
Schultz said that, though he has no doubt Ferguson is highly qualified, he thinks Ferguson should resign as Auditor General.
Ferguson declined to comment, writing in an email to The Daily that he “[wasn’t] taking interviews at the present time.”

“Issues” over how resources shared between federal government and territories
The University of the Arctic will be forced to cut back its programs in Canada – and across the arctic region – due to a recent decision by the Canadian government to cut the funding to the university by 75 per cent.
UArctic is a multi-national cooperative network of universities, colleges and institutions promoting research and education in the north. Canadian funding to UArctic has been cut to approximately $150,000 from over $700,000.
Federal funding for UArctic has been conditional on the northern territories providing additional funding, which they have not done. Territories have instead spent the money on their own colleges, such as Yukon College, Aurora College, and Nunavut Arctic College.
A spokesperson for the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation, an organisation focusing on improving governance in the Arctic, said, “There are severe issues with how resources are shared between territorial and federal governments.”
“[UArctic] doesn’t really fill the needs of the northern youth,” he explained.
UArctic does not grant degrees itself. Instead, it runs programs through over 140 colleges and universities in countries in and around the polar region.
Since its start in 2001, over 10,000 students have enrolled in a UArctic program.
Of the 140 institutions who are members of UArctic, more than thirty are in Canada.  A three-quarter cut in UArctic’s Canadian government funding would reduce the services available to Canadian students, though it is still unclear exactly what form the reduction in services will take.
A decision has already been made to move the undergraduate office from the University of Saskatchewan to the Northeastern Federal University in Yakutsk, Russia.
In a statement released on its website, UArctic assures Canadian students that “UArctic has already taken steps, however, to ensure the continuity of service of programs.”
These programs include the Circumpolar Studies program, which focuses on the people and issues of the arctic region, and the north2north program, which is an exchange program between northern communities.
These programs are designed to “empower the residents of the Circumpolar North, by building human capital through higher education,” according to UArctic’s mission statement.
Lars Kullerud, president of UArctic, is hopeful that the Canadian government will be convinced to continue its funding. In a statement released on the UArctic website, he comments, “Our Canadian members remain committed with their own resources to continue to be strong partners in this work while we wait for a resolution of the funding impasse in Canada.”

Parties collaborate in effort to provide clean drinking water
The Conservative government has decided to back the Liberals in their efforts to address the need of First Nations communities in Canada for clean, running water, after a motion passed at the House of Commons on November 17. The motion, which was moved by interim Liberal Party Leader Bob Rae, seeks to create a bill with all parties to improve access to clean drinking water on First Nations reserves.
The motion was passed days after Ecojustice, a non-profit environmental law firm, issued its report on water quality in Canada. The report gave the federal government a failing grade,  and stressed the lack of improvement in the quality of water for First Nations communities. Grades were determined by evaluating treatment and testing requirements, drinking water quality standards, source water protection, and measures for transparency and accountability.
According to the report, “Federal management of water – for places like First Nations reserves, military bases, and federal parks – still fails to meet basic benchmarks for safe consumption.”
Rae addressed the House of Commons during the debate on the motion, urging them to begin efforts no later than spring 2012.
“[We need] to address, on an urgent basis, the needs of those First Nations communities whose members have no access to clean, running water in their homes,” said Rae.
“We have to recognize that Canadians live, unfortunately, in very different conditions depending on where they live. A continuing affront to our sense of wholeness, justice, and fairness as Canadians is the fact that members of First Nations communities and other aboriginal communities across the country are living in conditions of deep poverty and great hardship,” he added.
John Duncan, Conservative MP for Vancouver Island North and Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, announced the availability of new funding to address the pressing water issues for Aboriginal communities in Northern Manitoba.
“I am proud to announce today that, in addition to those ongoing commitments, we are also providing an additional $5.5 million to support infrastructure improvements in Manitoba’s Island Lake community,” said Duncan during the House debate.
In an interview with The Daily, Carolyn Bennett – MP for St Paul’s and Liberal Critic for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development – said that this is not only an issue for Aboriginal communities.
“It’s something that all Canadians are embarrassed about, because it really is that so many of our citizens are actually living in third world conditions, when we have the constitutional responsibility to serve these conditions,” said Bennett.
“We hope that as we come up to the budget, that we will demand a real strategy for this because we won’t be satisfied until 100 per cent of First Nations homes have fresh running drinking water and waste water management,” she added.
Randy Christensen, author of the report issued by Ecojustice,  expressed his satisfaction in a press release, and expressed the need to move towards better access to clean water for First Nation communities in Canada.
“The government’s commitment to ensure all First Nations reserves have clean drinking water is a move in the right direction, and all parties in the House deserve credit for stepping up on the issue,” said Christensen.
Bennett also said that many First Nations communities within Quebec have been identified because of their lack of clean water.
“There were certainly many communities identified in Quebec that have problems. When I was at Akwesasne – which is partly Quebec, partly Ontario and partly the US – they had [water quality] problems,” she said.
According to Bennett, the proposed bill will be a step in the right direction, but she believes that government needs to do more to help First Nations communities.
“The long-term solutions are not only the infrastructure and building the systems, but also getting the training to the community so they can keep those systems operations. So it’s the long-term sustainability of the systems that we are also calling on the government to approve,” she said.

New demographics depend on non-perishable donations
The use of food banks in Montreal has increased by 32 per cent in the past four years, according to a Hunger Count survey released this month by Moisson Montréal, Canada’s largest food bank.
Moisson Montréal collects and distributes food aid to 211 organizations on the Island of Montreal, providing food for almost 150,000 people each month.
According to Hunger Count’s report, new demographic groups are turning to food banks to stave off hunger, such as the elderly, students, and those with jobs.
Dominique, age 45, was a Social Work student at the Université de Montréal until mounting debt forced him to withdraw. Now he uses the food bank almost every day.
“If you have nothing, you eat nothing. I can’t even afford to put milk in my coffee,” he said.
The growing demand for aid, combined with a shrinking donation pool, has begun to strain local food banks.
According to Fred Mehrabi, coordinator of Côte-des-Neiges food bank MultiCaf, “The amount of food we have received in donation has decreased by about 10 to 15 per cent.”
He continued, “Although Moisson Montréal is our main supplier, the food we receive from them is insufficient to complete our food baskets, [so] we have to find donations wherever we can.”
Dany Michaud, executive director of Moisson Montréal, explained how the organization is dealing with the strain.
“We have improved the efficiency of our operation in order to respond to this increase, to make more with less, to maximize the food we receive,” he said.
The situation faced by food aid organizations is not unique to Montreal. A similar report released by Food Banks Canada indicates a 26 per cent increase since 2008 in the need for food aid in Canada.
According to Marzena Gersho, director of communications and national programs for Food Banks Canada, “It takes support from everyone to really make an impact. The government at all levels, the public. We do need to address the short term solutions, but in terms of reducing hunger it is about that long-term impact.”
In regards to action on a federal level, Gersho said, “We propose policy recommendations to government that stress a number of things such as cost of housing, access to employment insurance, child tax benefits. We work with government at all levels to include policy that will really help to reduce hunger.”
Looking forward, there is hope among food banks that the holiday season will help sustain resources in the moths to come, but the hope is tentative.
Mehrabi said, “It is a time where everyone wants to give and to help out, we do our best campaign at this time but it’s a matter of sharing, and I’m afraid people might not have as much to share this year.”
“We have to do what we have to do. We will make adjustments. There is no option of refusing people who come to the food bank,” he added.
Moisson Montréal is holding its Christmas Food Drive until December 9, in which the organization hopes to provide 35,000 households with a Christmas meal.

Montreal police clear Square Victoria over five weeks after occupation began
After over five weeks of protest, the Occupy Montreal movement in Square Victoria – which occupiers had renamed Place du Peuple – has ended, as the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) moved in early Friday morning to dismantle the remaining tents. While no arrests were made, 16 protestors were escorted out of the park after tying themselves to the onsite kitchen tent.
Signals that the occupation was ending came earlier in the week, as the City of Montreal changed its attitude towards the movement. City spokesperson Gonzalo Nunez issued a statement last Wednesday night saying that “the period of tolerance is over.” Protestors were then given warnings  by the City instructing them to remove all “installations” from the square, and prohibiting them from occupying the square from midnight to 6 a.m., citing various city bylaws.
While some protestors seemed confused about what exactly was going to happen, most planned on cooperating.
“We are leaving this place on good terms,” said Greg Adams, a protestor who was still living on site as of early Friday morning. “We have our heads held high, a song on our lips and joy in our heart.”
At 9 a.m. Friday morning, crowds of police officers stopped traffic and cordoned off the area surrounding the park. They proceeded to dismantle the remaining tents, despite jeering and chants of protestors. City workers gathered the remains of the site, and material that was deemed reusable was put into storage, from which people could retrieve their belongings starting next Tuesday.
The atmosphere of the eviction remained largely peaceful, as the only major altercation between police and protestors occurred when a group, codenamed “Steve,” peacefully tied themselves to the on-site kitchen tent and refused to leave. “Steve,” along with dozens of occupiers who stood outside of the police line, chanted various protest slogans, the most popular being “We are the 99 per cent. You are the 99 per cent.”
The group was cut loose from the tent and escorted off the premises by police officers, who had the square completely cleared by noon.
When asked how he felt about relations with the police officers, one anonymous protestor, who had been living in the camp for the past four weeks, replied, “I only got one hug, so I’m a little disappointed, but not dismayed.”
SPVM Sergeant Laurent Gingras said in French that the operation went well. “There was a good collaboration between the people and police and they didn’t have to resort to force,” he said.
Despite eviction, protestors seemed to agree that the movement is far from over.
“The occupation is symbolic,” said protestor Pierluc Benson as he packed up his tent. “This is just the physical part of the movement. The mental and spiritual part is still there.”
Occupiers planned to hold a protest last Saturday afternoon, where they would discuss the future of the movement.

Reform Project sets tight deadlines as it tries to maintain November 10 momentum
About fifty students, faculty, and community members, including striking McGill non-academic workers, gathered off-campus last Thursday evening to take part in a student-led initiative to reform McGill’s governance structure, beginning with the University’s Board of Governors (BoG).
The BoG – the highest decisionmaking body in the University – is made up of 25 voting members and two student non-voting observers, and meets six times a year.
The initiative, known as the McGill Governance Reform Project (MGRP), emerged from a demonstration immediately following November 10.
One of the project organizers, former Daily News and Features editor Niko Block, recounted how discussions around the project began on November 11.
“We need to do something that is big and lasting, and we need to create some fundamental institutional change at McGill,” he explained.
“We need governance reform because there’s no accountability whatsoever within this institution,” Block added.
Stephen Strople, McGill secretary-general, commented on the MGRP in a statement to The Daily.
“I believe the Board is always interested in hearing what its members say about governance or other issues, and that, of course, includes its student members,” he said.
Arts Representative to SSMU Jamie Burnett spoke to the significance of governance reform.
“McGill is, and always has been, a fundamentally undemocratic institution, and I think that undemocratic institutions don’t produce good decisions for the people that make up that institution and are affected by the decisions and activities of that institution,” he said.
A group of between 15 and 20 students met twice before Thursday’s assembly in order to plan and organize. SSMU VP Clubs & Services Carol Fraser facilitated the assembly, which ran according to loose Robert’s Rules of Order.
Three proposals were brought to the meeting and ratified. The proposal on the project’s guidelines states that the project’s assembly “stands in support of a governance structure that is democratic, transparent, accountable, and more appropriately reflects the social and academic interests of the McGill community in the context of broader society.”
The next two proposals addressed the structure of a commission and a follow-up assembly.
The commission will consist of 12 members responsible for researching and presenting recommendations at a subsequent general assembly. However, the election of commissioners stopped due to a debate over the election process.
Associate Islamic Studies Professor Michelle Hartman voiced her concerns.
“This is a certain assembly of people who were able to come at a certain time… It’s a bit weird to be talking about governance reform and all these democratic processes and using Robert’s Rules of Order and doing this in a very proper way, but then to form a commission from people sitting in a room and to just appoint them is, to me, ironic.”
After two hours, quorum was lost, at which point the assembly became an informal discussion regarding how the assembly was run.
Associate History Professor Daviken Studnicki-Gizbert explained that the assembly had focused too much on amendments to the wording of proposals.
“My reading of the situation was that we latched onto the wording,” he said.
Speaking to The Daily after the assembly, Burnett said, “I think it represents a lot of the problems that we’re trying to solve in terms of people at McGill. Whether they’re students or workers of the community around the University, [they] don’t have a lot of experience working with each other, and don’t have a lot of experience talking about what a community is.”
“I think a lot of students who have been doing the planning for this just didn’t understand where other people may be coming from and didn’t structure the meeting in such a way that those concerns really could be brought in,” Burnett added.
Gregory Mikkelson, an associate professor in the Environment and Philosophy departments, spoke about his impressions immediately after the assembly ended.
“I’m really glad that this happened – that there’s an effort being made. I’m not entirely clear on whether they’ll be able to pull it off, especially in the time that they envision,” he said.
The commission is to finalize its recommendations by January 30, 2012 for ratification before a general assembly.
Block explained the time frame put forward in the assembly.
“A movement can lose a lot of steam over the summer,” he said. “If we don’t accomplish something on a relatively large scale along those lines by the end of the year then I think that we will lose steam and this issue itself could just could kind of die out.”
The follow-up meeting for the MGRP is scheduled for Friday at 3 p.m.

McGill accedes to three of union’s five demands, but hours will not be increased
For the first time in their history, McGill’s Teaching Assistants (TAs) have signed a new collective agreement without going on strike.
In a General Assembly last Thursday, the TA unit of the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) voted overwhelmingly in favour of ratifying the contract offer in a vote of 97 to 26, or 77 per cent.
Of the five primary demands the union was seeking, McGill, in large part, acceded to three – a pay raise for TAs of 7.3 per cent across three years, paid training, and multiple mandatory meetings with course supervisors.
The hourly wage for TAs will increase from $24.99 this year to $25.51 in January 2012, $26.51 in 2013, and $26.83 in the final year of the contract.
In response to the union’s demand for a nine per cent wage increase across three years, McGill had initially offered 3.6 per cent across the length of the contract.
Michael Di Grappa, vice-principal (Administration & Finance), maintained that the increase in hourly wage did not amount to 7.3 per cent over three years, but was instead the original 3.6 per cent offer, in addition to “changes in the way TAs will be compensated for their paid holidays.”
Lerona Lewis, AGSEM president, said that the administration’s effort to couch a pay increase in “changes” to statutory holiday payment was a “ploy…so that it doesn’t appear that it is actually a 3 per cent increase in pay [in the contract’s first year], simply to justify that they don’t have any money.”
“The bottom line is that there was an increase… The way you present your arguments or you frame it, the University can do it to suit their agenda, but the bottom line is that we know there was an increase,” she added.
After five months of negotiations – and an initial rejected offer – the administration presented AGSEM with a second offer on November 18. The administration had previously rejected all of the TAs’ main demands, precipitating the union’s use of various pressure tactics over the last month.
Last Thursday’s ‘yes’ vote means that TAs will not strike this spring.
In addition to new mandated meetings with course supervisors and the wage increase, TAs will also have access to a three-hour paid training session, offered in September and January.
The sessions will cover the planning of effective discussions, grading in humanities and sciences, preparing lectures, and grading and feedback in French.
In the week leading up to the vote, the AGSEM executive extensively discussed one new addition to the contract: Article 22.
McGill’s version of the article read: “the hiring unit shall make every effort to maintain adequate teaching support for undergraduate courses by such means as utilizing Teaching Assistants, or the equivalent in accord with established practices.”
The administration agreed to AGSEM’s version, which changed “maintain” to “improve,” and deleted the clause regarding the “equivalent” of TAs.
The administration has refused, however, to make a commitment to increasing the number of hours TAs are able to teach, a major defeat for some AGSEM members.
Biology TA Justin Marleau spoke to The Daily immediately after voting, saying he was disappointed in the contract. “We didn’t get any commitment about the stabilization of TA hours… After we got the pay increases in the last bargaining agreement, they just cut our hours,” he said.
Dominique Jacques, an Atmospheric Sciences TA, said that, without increased hours, anything else was “very little in terms of gains.”
Article 22, for Jacques, was “complete bullcrap. It’s words that mean nothing.”
Molly Alexander, AGSEM’s advisor from the academic department of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, said that the clause “sets [AGSEM] up for the next round” of negotiations, while acknowledging that it had no binding power.

Health effects of chemical discussed
Video footage of police officers using pepper spray against student protestors at the University of California – Davis (UC-Davis), has drawn international attention. The images, which have been widely circulated on the internet, have renewed a debate over the proper usage of the substance.
Deborah Blum, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has written extensively on the subject, considers weaponized pepper spray a potentially dangerous tool. In an interview with The Daily, she explained some of its harmful effects.
“Pepper spray works by amplifying allergic sensitivities. It irritates and damages eyes, membranes, bronchial airways, anything it touches. It is particularly dangerous to asthmatics,” Blum said.
The dangerous effects of pepper spray are well-documented. In 2000, researchers at the University of Helsinki found that pepper spray, or Oleoresin Capsicum spray, could cause immediate, but not permanent, damage to the corneal structure of the eye. In another study, published by the Journal of Correctional Health Care in 1997, experts noted that the inappropriate use of pepper spray could inflict “behavioral and mental health effects” on individuals.
In the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a request to the California appeals court in 1999 to declare the use of pepper spray dangerous and cruel.
Pepper spray has been found to be a contributing factor to many deaths of individuals in police custody in the U.S. Fewer deaths have been reported in Canada, where pepper spray is subject to tougher regulation: for example, pepper spray is sold as bear repellant, and  civilian use against humans is prohibited.
Blum argues that police officers are not properly trained to handle pepper spray, and that the incident at UC-Davis is part of a wider problem.
“There have been comments from law enforcement officials that this was inappropriate use of pepper spray. Who decides that they could use pepper spray anyway?” she asked.
Blum added that more severe punishments should be leveled against officers who use the substance abusively.
“The officer at UC-Davis was only given a paid suspension. That is not punishment,” she said.
Information on the UC-Davis and Montreal police departments’ training methods could not be obtained by The Daily at the time of press. However, the Institut de police du Québec says that pepper spray should only be used after the suspect has been warned verbally, and considers it to be less serious than physical force.
For Blum, pepper spray is not taken as seriously as it should be.
“I know people who were both tasered and pepper sprayed. Being pepper sprayed is far more painful. It should only be used if the officer is threatened,” she said.
In Quebec,  the Association paritaire pour la santé et la sécurité du travail – an agency that aims to promote a safe working environment for government employees – issued a series of recommendations on the use of pepper spray in 1998. It states that suspects should only be vaporized for one to two seconds.
According to Blum, the families of some of the UC-Davis students who were pepper sprayed are now looking to file a lawsuit.
“They’re looking at a lawsuit,” she said. “Some of the students were sent to the hospital, and one was definitely coughing up blood. It’s just shocking.”

Increases to improve sustainability and efficiency in natural resource industries
A report released earlier this month by the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE)  suggested that Canadian provinces charge higher fees for water use in the natural resource sector in order to improve efficiency and sustainability.
According to the report, titled “Charting a Course: Sustainable Water Use by Canada’s Natural Resource Sectors,” 86 per cent of Canada’s water is used by the natural resource sector, which includes mining, agriculture, thermal power, oil, and gas industries.
The report also included three main recommendations to encourage efficiency and sustainability in the future: the use of policy instruments such as an increase in water fees, the collection of better data on water use by the federal government, and collaborative governance involving a wide range of stakeholders.
NRTEE Vice-Chair Mark Parent  said that the suggested fee hike was less than 1 per cent.
“We’re not in a water crisis yet, and so a small price at the start could create sustainable conservation behaviour of about 15 per cent for that 1 per cent [price] increase,” he said.
The goal of the report was to address concerns about the future sustainability of water usage in Canada, given the prediction that there will be competing demands for water in the future.
“We’re trying to come up with suggestions before there’s a crisis,” said Parent.
He explained that, “with climate change, governments around the world are behind the ball, trying to make up policy in the middle of crisis… So we’re really being proactive in this report, trying to get ahead of [the problem].”
According to Parent, many industries in the natural resource sector were supportive of a water fee hike.
“They get [that] they need water to produce their products, so they’re concerned about it being there in the future,” he said.
Some corporations involved in these industries, however, do have concerns. Among them are corporations in the pulp and paper industry. According to Parent, they worry that even a 1 per cent increase would be financially problematic, given their recent performance.
Other industries already pay premiums that allow them to employ more sustainable practices. In the hydro-electric industry, for example, much of the water that is used goes back into the system.
Hydro-Québec Media Relations Representative Gary Sutherland  explained that the company already pays water-power royalties to the Quebec government in order to employ hydraulic power.
“Hydro-Québec’s electricity generation activities do not imply a consumption of water or withdrawal from the water cycle,” Sutherland explained. “Electricity generation makes use of the hydraulic force of moving water and the water flows back into the river with no loss in quality.”
Whether provincial governments will actually adopt the proposed fee hike remains to be seen.
The Quebec Ministry of Sust-ainable Development, Environment, and Parks (MDDEP) declined to comment publicly on the report but did refer to its current water regulations.
The MDDEP’s current regulations set water fees in Quebec at $0.0025 per cubic metre of water used after using 75 cubic metres, with a higher fee of $0.07 per cubic metre set for certain industries.
“The department does not intend to amend this regulation in the short term,” stated MDDEP spokesperson Hélène Simard in French.

Protest moved after campaigners denied access to Gare Centrale
About fifty people gathered for a flash mob in downtown Montreal last Friday evening to bring attention to Bill C-4, the Preventing Human Smugglers from Abusing Canada’s Immigration System Act.
The demonstration was organized by the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) and B. Refuge – a working group of QPIRG-McGill – as part of the Canada Can Do Better Campaign, an advocacy effort for non-citizen youth in Canada.
The bill seeks to crack down on human smuggling into Canada by expanding the government’s ability to detain and prosecute those involved in smuggling operations, including a measure authorizing mandatory one-year detainment. Organizers of CCR and B. Refuge’s campaign worry that the law will result in more detainment of children and separation of children from their families.
Organizers had announced that the flash mob would take place in Gare Centrale, where participants would sing and gather signatures for a petition calling for reform of Canada’s laws regarding detainment of non-citizen children. However, when the flash mob arrived Friday afternoon, they were told by security that they could not hold their demonstration in the station, despite having received prior approval from the police.
 
“I explained to them that it’s like I’m going to go dance in your house at 3 a.m.,” a security guard at the station said. “It’s a good cause, but it’s private property.”
According to the guard, the station’s main concourse is owned by Canmarc, a real estate investment trust based in Montreal.
After a discussion with security, the group headed to Phillips Square and marched about a
block on Ste. Catherine, singing lyrics calling for a stop to C-4 to the tune of “Frère Jacques.”
Olivia Dogget, a U3 Cultural Studies Honours student who is handling public relations for the campaign, expressed some disappointment about security’s decision not to let the flash mob occur in the train station, but said she thought the demonstration had achieved its goal.
“We still got the message across, even if not in the original form,” she said as the march halted on Ste. Catherine.
“I think a lot of people are unaware that Canada has immigrant detention centers. They’re overcrowded and don’t meet family needs. How can you expect [children] not to have a traumatic experience?” she asked.
At least one bystander sympathized with the cause. Chantal Khoury, a Concordia Fine Arts student in her fourth year who was sitting with a friend nearby, said, “we just found out about it. I’m all for stopping it [Bill C-4].”

“Issues” over how resources shared between federal government and territories
The University of the Arctic (UArctic) will be forced to cut back its programs in Canada – and across the arctic region – due to a recent decision by the Canadian government to cut the funding to the university by 75 per cent.
UArctic is a multi-national cooperative network of universities, colleges, and institutions promoting research and education in the north. Canadian funding to UArctic has been cut to approximately $150,000 from over $700,000.
Federal funding for UArctic has been conditional on the northern territories providing additional funding, which they have not done. Territories have instead spent the money on their own colleges, such as Yukon College, Aurora College, and Nunavut Arctic College.
A spokesperson for the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation, an organization focusing on improving governance in the Arctic, said, “There are severe issues with how resources are shared between territorial and federal governments.”
“[UArctic] doesn’t really fill the needs of the northern youth,” he explained.
UArctic does not grant degrees itself. Instead, it runs programs through over 140 colleges and universities in countries in and around the polar region.
Since its start in 2001, over 10,000 students have enrolled in a UArctic program.
Of the 140 institutions who are members of UArctic, more than thirty are in Canada. A 75 per cent cut in UArctic’s Canadian government funding would reduce the services available to Canadian students, though it is still unclear exactly what form the reduction in services will take.
A decision has already been made to move the undergraduate office from the University of Saskatchewan to the Northeastern Federal University in Yakutsk, Russia.
In a statement released on its website, UArctic assures Canadian students that “UArctic has already taken steps, however, to ensure the continuity of service of programs.”
These programs include the Circumpolar Studies program, which focuses on the people and issues of the arctic region, and the north2north program, which is an exchange program between northern communities.
These programs are designed to “empower the residents of the Circumpolar North, by building human capital through higher education,” according to UArctic’s mission statement.
Lars Kullerud, president of UArctic, is hopeful that the Canadian government will be convinced to continue its funding. In a statement released on the UArctic website, he comments, “Our Canadian members remain committed with their own resources to continue to be strong partners in this work while we wait for a resolution of the funding impasse in Canada.”
