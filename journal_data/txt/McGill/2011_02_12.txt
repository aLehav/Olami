FECQ criticizes extravagant travel costs
Outraged by CEGEP administrators’ large entertainment expenses, Quebec unions have demanded that Bill 44, a provincial law to increase transparency, accountability and reform CEGEP spending, be brought back to the National Assembly’s agenda.
A February 2 article in the Journal de Québec revealing the spending patterns of CEGEP administrators sparked the controversy. According to the newspaper, entertainment expenses in 2010 – including conferences in luxurious hotels in Brazil, Guadeloupe, and Europe – amounted to at least $324,000 dollars.
Léo Bureau-Blouin, the president of the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ), called the spending “extraordinary” and “excessive.”
“They were talking about five-star hotels to hold meetings of the CEGEP Federation, or trips to Europe, or in Morocco, that could have been avoided,” said Bureau-Blouin. “We think that it was a lot of money that could have been spent on more priority aspects of CEGEPs.”
“In many regions of Quebec, there are great needs for psychologists, or for classes, or for new computers, and we are seeing that CEGEP administrators were making trips to, like I said, Morocco, or to China,” he added.
However, CEGEP representatives have criticized the accuracy of the Journal de Québec accusations.
“We found that this article is incorrect, that it is false on many respects,” said the CEGEP Federation director of communications Caroline Tessier in French.  “There is some information that is not fair, or that in any case implies negative things that are not the reality. I am thinking for example of everything concerning international trips. This is part of CEGEPs’ mission, so it is normal for them to travel abroad.”
Nevertheless, FECQ and the Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ) – a union representing nearly 180,000 members, including over 100,000 education personnel – have used the controversy to push for the adoption of Bill 44.
Bill 44 was first introduced to the National Assembly on October 30, 2008, to tighten rules regarding the financial management of CEGEPs, by increasing transparency and accountability. However, after two years of detailed study and numerous amendments, the bill has stalled.
“We also think that by making public the meetings and the statements of administrative councils, it will be much easier to follow the activities of CEGEPs,” said an adviser for the CSQ, Gabriel Danis, in French.  “So it’s for this reason that we were making the link between the frivolous expenses that were revealed in the newspaper and Bill 44.”
It remains to be seen whether the bill will be re-introduced to the National Assembly.
“We think that we really need to have clear rules about how we spend money that comes from the Quebec government that is given to CEGEP students, because we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that are given to Quebec CEGEPs,” said Bureau-Blouin. “We can’t wait anymore and we hope that the ministry of education will hear our calls.”

The winter 2011 General Assembly (GA) hovered around quorum in the Adams Auditorium Thursday evening, but successfully bound SSMU to investigate the campus bike ban and approved an update to the society’s investment bylaws.
Jonathan Glencross, a student who has worked extensively on campus green projects, argued that the spirit of the bike motion should reflect a collaborative attitude with administrators. The motion ultimately passed with an amendment that charged SSMU to conduct meaningful consultation with the administration on whether biking is indeed a “valuable asset.”
The investments motion also passed with amendments to mention consultation with the Financial Ethics Review Committee (FERC) and SSMU Legislative Council.
Students debated a motion condemning the unilateral appointment of McKinsey and Co. consultants offering pro bono work to the university. Whereas clauses in the motion described past controversial recommendations McKinsey had made.
Brendan Steven, founder of the Prince Arthur Herald, agreed with the motion’s criticism of the unilateral decision-making process, but felt that “the guns here are targeted at the wrong thing” and that students “shouldn’t base a condemnation on consultation on three or four examples.”
Arts Senator Tyler Lawson noted the urgency of the motion in light of austerity measures McKinsey has recommended for other schools.
“McKinsey was directly involved in the independent review of higher education in England – they produced a report right before the government there introduced austerity measures and tripled tuition,” he said. “In the spirit of the GA, we have an opportunity now to take a strong stance as a group, as students, in the name of student power,” he said.
The motion passed, but without quorum – at which point the GA devolves into a “consultative forum.” Resolutions passed by this body are non-binding.
As a consultative forum, students also mandated SSMU to defend groups such as TVMcGill and the McGill First Aid Service that the administration asked to disassociate from the University. It proposes that SSMU bar the University from using the society clubs and services on any publication or promotional material if “the University is unwilling to negotiate.”
Speaker of Council Cathal Rooney-Cespedes explained that the resolution regarding SSMU improvement was struck from the agenda as it involved direct financial decision-making, an inappropriate topic for the GA. It will be pushed to the next Council agenda.
Executive Committee Report
The auditorium erupted with questions aimed at SSMU President Zach Newburgh’s own presidential portfolio after VP Clubs and Services, Anushay Khan, announced that she would be working with Newburgh and a third-party researcher to restructure her portfolio.
Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, VP External in 2009-2010, asked Newburgh if he would be “clarifying the structure of his own portfolio,” and whether executives could hold part-time jobs, as Newburgh had claimed in a TVMcGill interview from the previous day.
Newburgh replied that he “would be more than happy to do so,” and further stated that each executive was working on individual job descriptions that will be approved at next legislative council.
Councillor Maggie Knight asked Newburgh to personally clarify why councillors had to refrain from discussing the incamera council session in which Newburgh revealed his involvement with startup networking website jobbook.com.
Newburgh responded that the confidential session was technically a trial, and therefore only the accused is allowed to disclose information. Although some rules can be suspended regarding confidential sessions, those protecting “the rights of the accused” cannot be overturned.
Alex McKenzie, U1 Arts and Daily staffer, asked whether Newburgh, as the accused, would be releasing any information about what happened in council.
“The GA is not the time or place to deal with this particular matter … right now we need to move forward,” replied Newburgh.
Although he delivered his own report, VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki was notably absent for a portion of the Executive Committee’s report to the Assembly.

McGill researchers will receive $3 million from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), which hopes to support practical application of multidisciplinary research
McGill researchers will receive $3 million from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), which hopes to support practical application of multidisciplinary research. This investment is a part of NSERC’s $55-million investment to university research teams across Canada announced on January 20.
According to an NSERC press release, “The goal of the program is to increase research and training in areas that could strongly influence Canada’s economy, society or environment in the next ten years.” The grants support research led by at least one researcher and in collaboration with a supporting organization.
This year’s grant will target environmental science and technologies, information and communication technologies, manufacturing, and natural resources and energy.
According to a McGill press release, the seven teams awarded funds will collaborate with government and industry partners. McGill VP Research and International Relations Rose Goldstein attributed the focus on collaboration to an attempt to apply basic research to real-world problems.
“I think there is a growing realization that as good as our basic research is…it must be supported we want to see it translated into real life applications,” said Goldstein. “I think there is a growing, hopefully openness on the part of universities to work better with other partners, including industry.”
“These awards are the result of a competitive, peer reviewed process managed by the NSERC,” wrote Michel Cimpaye of Industry Canada, in an email to The Daily.
The funding is invested through NSERC’s Strategic Project Program. NSERC reports to Parliament through the Minister of Industry.
Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics professor Ghyslaine McClure and her team received $522,450 for three years. McClure’s project aims to develop a seismic risk assessment method for schools and hospitals in Eastern Canada. McClure’s partners are the Ministère de l’Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport du Québec, l’Agence de la santé et de services sociaux de Montréal. McClure also has an industry partner: the office partitions company Rampart Partitions Inc.
“The success of a proposal resides not only in the originality of the research approach and the strategic importance of the research for Canada, but also the quality…of the research team and the support of partners,” said McClure in an email to The Daily.
She described the selection criteria as “very strict.”
NSERC’s funding processes will be reviewed by a Research and Development Review Panel formed by the federal government in October 2010. The panel is composed of six Canadians from the academic, business and government sectors and operates independently from the federal government.
It “will offer analysis and recommendations to improve our system of support to enhance business innovation,” according to an October 14 speech by the Gary Goodyear, the Minister of State (Science and Technology) to the panel.
Goldstein explained that the review panel will look at how policies and programs can be improved in order to encourage the applicability of fundamental research and to enhance innovation.
David Robinson, associate executive director for the Canadian Association of University Teachers, voiced concerns about the review panel, including the lack of academics on the panel.
He noted that similar review boards have in the past recommended the commercialization of research. He also described the relationship between university researchers and business as a “clash of cultures.”
“Corporate research is more secretive,” said Robinson. “University research is more collaborative.”
“I know that there is this fear, this is not new to me. I don’t think there is any evidence that that’s really happening,” said Goldstein referring to Robinson’s concerns. “I think there is a general understanding that…it’s really a question of supporting [fundamental and basic] research to make it more applicable.”

A  throng of about one hundred Montrealers gathered in front of the Egyptian consulate Friday afternoon to celebrate the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak earlier that day.
Mass protests have taken place in Cairo and throughout the rest of Egypt since January 25 – ten days after a similarly widespread protest movement led to the resignation of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
“Today is an incredible day,” said Mostafa Henaway, a member of the local Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! “Nobody expected this so soon after yesterday’s speech by Mubarak. … The mood is euphoric. This was something that was considered impossible.”
Mubarak has sat in the president’s office since 1981. Discontent has been mounting in recent years as a result of rising food prices and unemployment rates among the under-thirty demographic. Approximately half of the country lives below the poverty line.
Ehab Latoyef, a member of the Canadian Arab Federation, was among those attending Friday’s rally.
“There was a lot of discontent in Egypt for many years whether financial, respect for human rights, dignity, employment, prices – all that was accumulating,” he said. “But for it all to come to closure in two weeks like that was unexpected for everybody.”
Latoyef added that in his opinion the recent release of U.S. diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, as well as the Palestine Papers, has galvanized the demonstrations. Documents revealing Egypt’s complicity with Israel’s 2009 attack on the Gaza Strip, killing 1,400 Palestinians, are now available to the public as result of these sources.
Mubarak’s executive powers were handed over to the military Friday morning. Despite the military’s close connection with the U.S., their handling of the uprising has thus far been sensible, Latoyef said.
“The army is acting in a respectable manner today, and it is not showing any signs of greed to power. Of course, on the other hand, when you taste power, you want to keep it. That’s human nature,” he said.
“What’s needed now is to put the army in check all the time – not to make it feel that it has the right to make decisions. It’s just a caretaker,” he added.
Latoyef noted, as many others have, that there is no obvious successor to the current provisional government, nor does Egypt have any well-organized political parties at the moment.
“It’s a problem, but I think it’s also a safeguard – meaning that the fact that there is no one dominant party in Egypt at this point is part of the road to a healthy growth in the Egyptian democratic process,” he said.
Henaway commented on the broader impact the Egyptian revolution will have on the Arab world.
“Tomorrow in Algeria there is a national day of action; we see ongoing demonstrations in Jordan, Yemen, and all over the Arab world. A movement is really, really burgeoning at this moment and I think is taking everybody by surprise.”
Dina, who grew up in Cairo, also attended the demonstration.
“Me and my husband left Egypt and came here because we [didn’t] find a good job, and there is no security there – a lot of problems in Egypt,” she said. “I’m so happy he’s gone, because a lot of people are suffering from poverty and a lot of people don’t have an opportunity to have work.”

Matthew McLauchlin, co-chair of the NDP federal LGBT committee speaks with The Daily
Last Wednesday, the House of Commons narrowly passed MP Bill Siksay’s (NDP Burnaby-Douglas) private member’s bill to enshrine gender identity and gender expression in the Canadian Human Rights Act as well as the Criminal Code. The bill was based on research by social-work students at the Carleton University, and mirrors two private member’s bills that Svend Robinson – the first MP to come out as gay – sponsored concerning sexual orientation.

Matthew McLauchlin, who co-chairs the NDP federal LGBT committee, worked with the trans community in promoting the bill and spoke to The Daily about its implications.
The McGill Daily: What kinds of discrimination do trans people face at the federal level, and how would the law affect judicial processes?

Matthew McLauchlin: Human Rights tribunals would hold private and public actors accountable at the federal level of jurisdiction. … Banks and air travel are the site of a lot of discrimination in the private sector. Federal government services such as the army, RCMP, and prisons are also the site of a grotesque amount of discrimination.For full human rights protection, the bill would have to have to see similar legislation in the provinces, so as to cover areas such as housing and health care.
MD: Private-members’ bills generally do not make it to third reading. Could you comment on the fear that it won’t make it through a Conservative-dominated Senate?

MM: The precedent has been that when the House passes a bill, the Senate has been wary of blocking it. That changed under the Harper government. He promised not to appoint new senators and then he did. The Conservatives have abused their presence in the Senate to block legislation, such as the NDP’s climate change legislation [Bill C-311]. We’ll be pressing the Senate hard and contacting the community to do so as well. … The bill now has to go through the same stages and readings at senate…  and it would all have to take place before any elections were called.
MD: A McGill prof, Douglas Farrow, recently signed an open letter telling MPs not to vote for the bill, telling them it would open up a “can of worms” such as the bathroom scare, the provision of unisex washrooms, and over-crowding hospitals because of sex-reassignment surgeries (SRS). What is your response to this claim?

MM: First of all, hospitals fall under provincial jurisdiction, and secondly, well, there’s maybe ten annual SRS surgeries carried out in the province of Manitoba. If anything, this will be all for the good; there have been barriers to accessing what has long been established as a medically necessary set of procedures.
As for the bathroom scare, this one really hurts me. My partner is trans and I know what he goes through. In the more than one hundred jurisdictions around the world where similar protections have been put into place, there has never been a recorded case against anybody who has tried to engage in reprehensible behaviour in the washroom. Trans people already use washrooms and locker rooms, and it’s trans people who get subject to violence and discrimination.  Crimes are still crimes, and trans people already use washrooms and locker rooms.
MD: Another criticism of the bill is that it does not define gender identity and expression.

MM: None of the other grounds for discrimination are defined…not race, religion, sex orientation, because the law is meant to be applied in terms of social understanding of what those concepts refer to. … If we have survived and managed to make use of the Canadian Human Rights Act without defining the other concepts, the same ought to be true for gender identity and expression.
As Bill Siksay said effectively in parliament, “A right that has to be explained is not an effective right,” and trans people or people who do not fit traditional gender stereotypes should not have to think their way into protection under legislation that defines grounds of discrimination for different groups.
For example, in New York City two years ago, a non-trans woman was evicted from a restaurant because she had gone to use the woman’s washroom and someone thought she was not a woman, and therefore had no business being there, even though she showed her ID. She won a human rights case because New York city human rights code specifies gender identity and expression.

Montreal police force moving to address racial profiling with mixed results
On April 9, 2007 Félix Fini and his girlfriend Christy Coulibaly were driving home from a friend’s party when they were stopped by a Service de police de la ville de Montréal (SPVM) squad car for a routine traffic stop. The incident spawned a two-year legal struggle with the City of Montreal that culminated on February 5 with the Quebec Human Rights Commission recommendation that the couple receive $10,000 each in damages for violation of their civic rights based on ethnic or national origin.
From the Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso respectively, Fini and Coulibaly graduated from the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières in 2007. They both arrived in Canada in 2002, but Fini was not eligible to use a Quebec driver’s license. As a result, when stopped in 2007, Fini presented the police officer with his license from the Ivory Coast that he was authorized to use temporarily.
After a background check, the police officer told Fini his license was suspended due to an unpaid ticket. Fini was unaware of the suspension as he and Coulibaly had recently moved, and had not received notice in the mail. The police officer also noted that the car was not registered in Fini’s name – it was registered to Coulibaly.
The couple waited outside the car with their two-month old baby for the entirety of the 45-minute stop. The officer refused Fini and Coulibaly’s request to allow their baby to sit in the police car during their questioning. Their child continues to suffer from respiratory problems as a result of the incident.
In her court deposition over two years later, the officer stated that she told Fini he could “go live elsewhere” and should return to his country when he became frustrated and criticized Quebec law.
Fo Niemi is the Executive Director for the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), who assisted Fini and Coulibaly in their case.
“In dealing with racial profiling the evidence is never directly explicit…[but] in this case, what is a dead giveaway is the kind of comments made by the police officer that reveal a certain degree of racial bias,” Niemi said. “We felt that, based on the information he provided, it was a case of driving while black – a routine traffic stop that could’ve been influenced by his race.”
In a CRARR press release, Fini described the recommendation as “a nice moral victory for us.” The SPVM declined to comment on the decision.
“The SPVM is part of the City,” said SPVM spokesperson Marie-Hélène Ladouceur. “Even though there’s two officers involved, we don’t comment.”
“There’s always a possibility that we can go on appeal,” continued Ladouceur.
Niemi said he doesn’t expect Fini and Coulibaly to receive the recommended reparations from the City  of Montreal any time soon. The Commission’s recommendation is not legally binding, and Niemi predicted that the City would continue to drag the case out for “a couple more years” before offering the minimum $500 per person settlement. He said that in the last three years CRARR has only won six of over sixty cases brought to the Quebec Human Rights Commission.
“The problem with these cases I’ve mentioned is that the investigation takes very long – partly because of the legal obstruction tactics used by the City to make these cases,” said Niemi.
“Often they say, ‘Well, they took too long to investigate so the delay caused prejudice to our police officer,’ so the City would make a motion to have the case dismissed on procedural grounds of delay,” explained Niemi. “And they keep appealing. And every time it appeals it prevents the case from being addressed on its merits.”
Dan Philip, president of the Black Coalition of Quebec, lamented that the investigative process into racial profiling does not favour the victims.
“In these cases it’s the police that investigates the police, and the results are always the same,” said Philip. “What you find is there is no access to justice, and that’s a very serious situation.”
Niemi also described how some young black men are arrested on dubious charges as a part of anti-gang tactics. He described an incident involving a black man in the summer, who had just come out of a bar on Crescent early one Sunday morning.
“He came out of the bar, [and] just leaned against the building, waiting for his friends to come out,” said Niemi. “He was arrested, handcuffed and fined for violation of a municipal by-law. And what does the by-law say? ‘Thou shalt not obstruct the circulation of pedestrians’ – because he was leaning against a building.”
Niemi was confident that such tactics are being phased out under new Police Chief Marc Parent, who was appointed in September. Parent pledged to crack down on racial profiling by re-prioritizing gangbusting tactics.
“Personally I have worked on some occasion with Marc Parent,” said Niemi, “and I can tell you that the change in the tone and in some of the orientations that have taken place since he became chief are very noticeable.”
Philip, however, was less optimistic about the prospect of change.
“There might be, for the time being, less cases, but there has been nothing put in place in order to stop racial profiling,” he said. “Nothing has changed as far as I’m concerned.”

STM offers exclusive advertising contracts to increase revenue
February 7 marked the deadline for Quebec companies to submit proposals to sponsor a Montreal metro line, the latest stage in Société de transport de Montréal (STM)’s new advertising strategy announced in November 2010. The plain involves companies entering into ten year exclusive advertising contracts on the metro line of their choice.
Received proposals will be evaluated by a committee of Transgesco, a wholly owned yet independent subsidiary of the STM that manages its commercial revenue. Since announcing the strategy, STM has since faced heavy criticism from Projet Montréal, a municipal party committed to sustainable urban development as outlined on their website.
In a statement released last November Richard Bergeron, leader of Projet and Jeanne-Mance councillor, equated STM’s new advertising strategy to “selling the metro’s soul” with advertisements that “defaced” metro stations. “The STM has reached a new low in its commercialization of public space by pursuing corporate sponsorship of metro lines,” Bergeron said in the statement.
The STM claimed that the ads would be controlled and tasteful, with specific sizes and areas designated for advertising. Dominic Perri, Transgesco president, member of the STM’s Board of Directors and councillor of Saint-Léonard borough, told The Daily. “We know how much advertising there will be and where it will be,” he said. “Projet Montreal wants to lower taxes, build tramways… they want to do this and they want to spend… Look, we’re not in Disneyland. Let’s face it; you cannot give more services with less money. It is impossible.”
According to STM regulations, prospective companies must display an interest in environmental sustainability and support public transportation in order to qualify to sponsor a metro line. Perri said selection will depend on the “quality of the partner,” not just money.
“We don’t want to deal with a company that has no environmental policy or doesn’t care about public transportation,” said Perri. “We’re forming a partnership. We’re not selling it. We’re not asking them to post ads there and that’s the end of the story – no! We work together.”
Advertising amounts to only 2 per cent of STM’s total annual revenue. According to Marianne Rouette, a spokesperson for the STM, to increase its revenue the STM aims to raise the percentage of funding it recieves from advertising. With this new plan a company would be required to pay a fixed annual fee, with rights to the highly coveted orange line costing a minimum of $6 million per year.
“We have to increase our commercial revenue,” Rouette said. “We are very low compared to the other transit societies in the world.”
Perri said revenues from the partnerships between the STM and private companies will go toward improving public transportation. He pointed to the announcement of bus stops as an example of the types of services the STM would be able to provide with more revenue.
“We want to facilitate the lives of the citizens so they say ‘I’m going to take the bus or the metro to go to work.’ In doing so, we have less pollution. That’s the whole objective,” Perri said.
Projet Montréal remains sceptical of Transgesco’s motives and voiced concerns about the secrecy surrounding their financial records.
“Transgesco was created to get around the bidding process and hide projects from the public eye,” Bergeron said in Projet’s press release. “If the STM goes ahead with its plan, most of the profits will never even reach public coffers.”
“The money will not get back to the passengers. It will be returned in terms of the service,” Perri said. He explained that profits generated by Transgesco are transferred to the STM at the end of the year.
To Bergeron, the issue is beyond services provided. For him the issue signifies a larger tendency: “We must stop sacrificing Montreal’s heritage for money.”

SSMU President speaks to The Daily
Article updated Feb. 12
Michael Yaroshefsky, president of the Princeton University’s Undergraduate Student Government (USG), Johnny Bowman, former president of Harvard Undergraduate Council, and Jeff Gordon, president of the Yale College Council, have all challenged SSMU President Zach Newburgh’s claim that his involvement with networking site Jobbook was of a purely personal nature.
“I was not representing the SSMU in an official capacity. And that should have been clear. And was made clear,” Newburgh said in an interview with The Daily, referencing his meetings with other universities student executives.
Yaroshefsky disagreed, stating in an email to The Daily that he was under the impression that he would be speaking to Newburgh about student government.
“I thought throughout the meeting that [Newburgh] was representing McGill – I even had the impression that Jean de Brabant was representing McGill too, given that we were supposed to be talking about student government and how they kept talking about the SSMU,” wrote Yaroshefsky.
Yaroshefsky went on to express his discontent with Newburgh’s pretence for the meeting.
“I came to the meeting ready to chat about student life on campus, as he claimed we would. In reality, he had other intentions, as he brought with him Jean de Brabant and both of them pitched Jobbook to me for the entire meeting. I realized he had used a bait-and-switch tactic to get me to meet him. He was using his involvement in student government as a fulcrum to gain leverage for this private endeavour – it was dishonest and distasteful,” he wrote.
Johnny Bowman confirmed that Newburgh and de Brabant offered him personal shares, or shares for Harvard student government.
“SSMU is the only [student association] that was offered a financial opportunity with Jobbook,” claimed Newburgh. However when pressed further, Newburgh clarified his statement, saying, “The choice that was presented  [to other student society executives] was that one could allocate shares to wherever an individual wanted.”
In an email Newburgh sent to Yaroshefsky and other members of Princeton’s Undergraduate Student Government following their meeting, Newburgh referred to Jobbook as a student initiative created at McGill University. Josh Redel, a U3 Software Engineering student, accompanied Newburgh and de Brabant to Harvard.
“McGill was intended to be the leader,” said Redel.
Redel, who helped program the Jobbook site during the fall semester, was unaware that Newburgh had told Bowman they would be meeting to talk about student life.
“That wasn’t my understanding,” said Redel.
Newburgh also used his SSMU email account to arrange the meetings with other schools. He explained that he used his official email address because “the intention was to have a conversation about student life,” but admitted that “scheduling just didn’t end up permitting it” in some cases.
Yaroshefsky, Bowman and Gordon all rejected Newburgh’s offer to get involved with the Jobbook venture.
Confidentiality agreements
Former VP Finance and Operations Jose Diaz said that SSMU executives are approached “very, very often,” particularly the president and VP Finance and Operations. Diaz explained that in his experience, executives would investigate the legitimacy of an offer before agreeing to meet. If a meeting occurred, the executive would then report back to the Executive Committee and Legislative Council.
Newburgh explained his failure to consult the Executive Committee as a stipulation of his confidentiality agreement with de Brabant. Diaz pointed out that Board of Governors meetings are also confidential, but that the president can disclose that they attend these meetings.
Yaroshefsky, Bowman, and Gordon verified that they did not sign confidentiality agreements before hearing Newburgh and de Brabant’s pitch. Newburgh met with them in October, several months before his own confidentiality agreement expired.
Asked to explain this discrepancy, Newburgh admitted he didn’t remember whether other schools were required to sign confidentiality agreements, and called de Brabant for clarification during his interview with The Daily. Over the phone, de Brabant explained that the patent application for Jobbook had been submitted by the weekend of October 22, when the pair met with Harvard representatives.
Newburgh also stated that he didn’t remember the date that his personal confidentiality agreement ended, insisting “when I had the opportunity to present it to the Executive Committee, I did.”
The Executive Committee was informed on January 19, though VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew and General Manager Pauline Gervais were informed via email on January 13 and 17, respectively.
However, Drew stated that upon receiving Newburgh’s email disclosing his potential conflict of interest, he was confused about what action to take.
“I didn’t know much about how the Conflict of Interest Policy worked, so I didn’t really know how to think of it,” he said.
Redel revealed that in December, Jobbook employed three other McGill students to promote the site, but declined to give their names. Redel said the other students “brought up the concern about conflict of interest with SSMU.”
“They were not allowed to discuss the product before it was disclosed,” said Redel.
Redel said he did not personally sign a contract – regarding confidentiality or shares – even though he joined the company months before the other McGill students.
Executive pay
In his interview with TVMcGill, Newburgh claimed that “[executives’] entire lives aren’t paid for by the Society,” and that “the same goes for individuals who have one, two, three, four jobs that they need to have in order to sustain themselves.” He also said that “other executives are in the same boat,” but did not specify further.
Diaz questioned Newburgh’s claim about finances. He explained that the executives’ pay was increased from last year’s, and that the amount is enough to cover both international tuition – the highest student tuition fee – and living expenses. Newburgh pays Canadian tuition rates.
“The reason SSMU executives get stipends is so that they have the means to dedicate all their time to SSMU,” Diaz added.
Fallout with the University
Newburgh is the only student representative on McGill’s Board of Governors, and is currently in the process of negotiating SSMU’s lease and Memorandum of Agreement with McGill. He said that he is “pretty confident in saying that [his] relationship with the administration is going to be what it was beforehand, you know, a good one.”
Doug Sweet, director of Media Relations for McGill, said that Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson “would be the Administration voice on this,” and that Mendelson has no comment on the matter.
De Brabant refused to give an interview to The Daily, saying that he was “too upset” about the criticism Newburgh has received.
“Jean de Brabant is one of the most pushy people I’ve ever met,” said Redel. “He’s a well-aged, extremely well-experienced gentleman who knows what he’s doing.”
Redel was also disappointed with how Jobbook’s involvement with McGill has unfolded.
“It’s unfortunate because everyone, from my perspective, their hearts were really in the right place…it was always something that was meant to be good for students,” said Redel.
When asked how Newburgh personally pitched Jobbook to him, Redel replied that Newburgh asked: “Do you want to be part of something big?”

Truth and Sentencing Act projected to cost in excess of $5 billion
The Conservative government’s legislative push to “get tough-on-crime” is drawing increasingly widespread attacks from critics who call it misguided and a waste of billions of dollars. In an open letter published last Sunday, more than 500 physicians, scientists, and researchers from across the country condemned the recent Bill S-10, stating that it is overly costly, will do little to reduce drug use or the crime rate, and may cause more health and social problems.
Bill S-10 is a piece of legislation meant to target organized crime, but it would also introduce mandatory minimum sentences for minor drug possession. It is just one of several government bills that aim to change the Criminal Code of Canada and introduce tougher sentencing.
Consequences of tougher sentencing 
“We will see more people in for longer periods of time with fewer opportunities for them to get out, earn their release, and be in the community contributing,” said Kim Pate, executive director of Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, referring to mandatory minimum sentences.
Liberal MP and public safety critic Mark Holland also spoke of the ineffectiveness of tougher sentencing.
“The problem is not only that it is egregiously expensive, it actually diminishes the amount of money in a general sense for rehabilitation and programming,” he said. “It actually drives up the recidivism rate so you actually have less safe communities. In the ultimate irony, you spend billions and billions of dollars to create a less safe country.”
“The rhetoric is that it will affect the crime rate,” said Pate. “[But] if that was a remedy for creating safer communities, then presumably the United States should be the safest place in the world to live.”
According to Statistics Canada, police-reported crime in Canada has continued to decline in both volume and severity for over a decade. In 2009 Statistics Canada reported that the Crime Severity Index (CSI), measuring the severity of police-reported crime, declined 4 per cent in 2009 and stood 22 per cent lower than in 1999. Statistics for 2010 have yet to be published.
Justin Piché, a Carleton University Ph.D. candidate who researches the Canadian justice system, said, “In the context of a fiscal crisis and decades worth of declining police-reported crime rates, to me it makes little sense to be pursuing a prison expansion agenda at this time. … It is the most costly way to address the complex conflicts and harms in our communities that we call crime.”
Projected Costs
According to a June 2010 report released by the Parliamentary Budget Office, the cost of just one bill, the Truth and Sentencing Act – which limits credit given to prisoners for time spent in custody before and during trial – is expected to exceed $5 billion. According to the report, it will also require the building of about 4,189 federal jail cells at a cost of $1.8 billion over the next five years.
This greatly exceeds government estimates, which projected the act would cost only $2 billion over the next five years.
When asked about the significant differences in projected costs, Parliament Budget Officer Kevin Page explained, “[The government] said they could reduce the cost by looking at double bunking. We assumed that we would maintain capacity rates at the different prisons at roughly the same rates when we did our calculations.”
The process of double bunking – which according to Public Safety Minister Vic Toews’s CBC statement “is not a big deal” – violates prison standards set by the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.
It is also reported to lead to increased incidents of institutional violence.
In June 2010, Howard Sapers, the correctional investigator appointed by the government to review the Correctional Service of Canada’s polices, published a report revealing that double bunking in Canadian penitentiaries has increased by 50 per cent in the past five years.
The report revealed that exemptions to UN prison standards are also made in “segregation cells,” where two inmates must share space designed for one for up to 23 hours a day.
“Given high rates of mental illness, drug addiction, violence and criminal gang membership, it is difficult to see how double-bunking can be viewed as a correctionally appropriate or sustainable solution to crowding pressures in either the short or medium terms,” Sapers’s report stated.
Effects on the mentally ill
According to Sapers’s report, “the prevalence and rate of mental illness in the offender population far exceeds that of general society. We estimate at least one-in-four new admissions to federal [correctional institutions] present some form of mental health illness.”
An internal Correctional Service of Canada report, obtained by Postmedia News, stated that to handle increasing inmate populations CSC will hire more than 3,000 employees, only 35 of whom will be health professionals.
“People who suffer from mental illness are people who desperately need other forms of help, but unfortunately the police have nowhere else to put them,” said Holland. “They wait for the negative interaction with the community, or for them to break a law, and then they use prisons as a repository for the mentally ill because they have nowhere else to put them.”
“The problem is particularly severe for mentally ill female prisoners, large majorities of which have suffered sexual or physical abuse,” said Sapers.
Two-thirds of incarcerated women suffer a substance-related abuse or disorder, and one-third have been psychiatrically hospitalized in the past. Ottawa-based lawyer Michelle Mann, who specializes in native and women’s issues, commented on the need to prioritize “corrections” instead of incarceration.
“Building more prisons, building more beds, and increasing capacity will not help. That isolation will hurt because you are just going to have more people incarcerated,” she said. “Ultimately we need to find more alternatives to incarceration, more use of community corrections rather than incarceration, particularly for nonviolent offenders.”
For Piché, the problem with Canada’s justice system is both practical and ideological: “What we’re seeing is a government that is more concerned with punishing people than helping them reintegrate into society in ways that would be beneficial to the communities where they return.”
The office of Public Safety Minister Vic Toews could not be reached for comment.
