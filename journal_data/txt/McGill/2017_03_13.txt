The Daily endorses a “NO” vote regarding the “Referendum Question on Constitutional Amendments.” The amendment to Article 13.4 of the Constitution, which would abolish the requirement of having different faculties represented at the SSMU General Assemblies, would significantly decrease the efficacy of the GAs at representing a diversity of student voices, and would significantly weaken the democratic process as a result.

SSMU (Students’ Society of McGill University) governance has been particularly controversial this year. The Tangerine tent at Activities Night and excessive advertisements in the Shatner Building saw criticisms of the VP finance; the merging of McGill Counselling and Mental Health has drawn criticism as wait times have become outrageous; and, more recently, allegations against executives of gendered violence and the resulting backlash have led to the resignations of the President and VP External. At its best, SSMU should uphold and foster a safe, accessible, and diverse university experience. This year, with its persistent controversies and the election of an executive of mostly white men, SSMU has failed to do so. Rather than being an efficient governing body and voice to its constituents, SSMU has become a source of campus drama and stress for students.
At The Daily, we often interact closely with SSMU, and what we have witnessed this year has been especially disheartening and disappointing. However, we recognize that, as a governing body, SSMU has incredible potential. This coming year’s executive team will need to put in tremendous amounts of work if they are to redeem SSMU in the eyes of students, the administration, and the broader community.
The Daily interviewed each of the eleven candidates in order to decide on our endorsements. Questions centred around past experience, the executive as a political actor, and portfolio-specific details.
Furthermore, in the wake of allegations of gendered violence on the parts of both the former VP External and former President, as well as the debate which engulfed former Arts Representative to SSMU Igor Sadikov, The Daily has taken the candidates’ political stances into serious consideration with regards to these endorsements. Any stance – even one centred upon silence or neutrality – is inherently political, and should be taken into account.
We sincerely hope that the 2017-18 student executive is more diverse, and contributes to a better undergraduate experience at McGill.
Please take the time to make an informed decision; the voting period runs from March 13-16.

The SSMU President is the leader of the SSMU executive team, in addition to being a key player in interactions with the administration. The President is the only undergraduate representative on the Board of Governors, and sits on Senate. The President is also responsible for the maintenance of SSMU’s governing documents and the enforcement of its Constitution and Internal Regulations. Furthermore, the President is tasked with supporting the rest of the executive team as need arises.
Ogundeji is a U3 Sociology student at McGill. She currently sits on SSMU’s Equitable Governance Reform Committee, is a Political Coordinator at the Black Student’s Network (BSN), and works as a Floor Fellow. Prior to that, Ogundeji served as Secretary General of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS). She cites her experience as President of the Sociology Students’ Association (SSA) and VP Internal of the BSN as proof of her experience in an administrative context, including experience organizing and communicating within multiple teams.
Ogundeji’s overall platform prioritizes efficiency, SSMU accountability, and student advocacy. Her campaign slogan “Lean Back” emphasizes that McGill students should be unequivocally supported by their student representatives. Ogundeji wants to implement a SSMU Executive Code of Conduct via an ad-hoc committee under the president’s portfolio (that would be ratified by the SSMU membership), which she says is primarily a response to anti-Zionist tweets published by former Arts representative Igor Sadikov, a former Daily editor, and recent allegations of sexual assault against former VP External David Aird. She feels that there currently exists “a lack of explicit accountability measures for executives,” mainly as a result of vague language in the SSMU Constitution and executive contracts. She feels this would make potential repercussions less at the whim or vague and arbitrary definitions of misconduct.
Ogundeji also wants to collaborate with the incoming VP Student Life and SSMU Mental Health Commissioners to implement a counselling team that would address the needs of racialized students on campus: SSMU currently has a similar program for students who identify as LGBTQIA+, i.e. the McGill PRIDE Counselling Team. The proposed counselling team would instead focus on issues more deeply rooted in race and colonialism, and the potential imbedded mental health issues therein.

Shannon has no previous experience in student governance at McGill or elsewhere, even though he touts his “practical leadership experience.” When asked about his qualifications for the job of SSMU president, Shannon cited his time as a quarterback on his high school’s football team and the fact that he founded an improv club at McGill.
Shannon appears to have almost no publicly available platform. His website hosts no information about him, his experience, or his platform, but simply contains a reminder to vote. During the candidate debates he continued to lack any substantial platform, preferring to piggyback off the platforms of his opponents by simply agreeing with them. He stated that he is “pro opt-outable student fees” and “anti-advertisements.” To his credit, he has made his campaign finances public – which currently total $15.46, mostly for his website.
Lukas brands himself as a voice for “forgotten” McGill students. On his Facebook event, he says he aims “to open doors to student participation, communication and change at the General Assembly,” even though the simple existence of General Assemblies, by definition, act as forums for student participation. He will “advocate tirelessly for student concerns and world-class sexual violence policy at McGill’s Senate,” despite the fact that McGill’s Senate passed a Sexual Violence Policy in December of 2016.

Muna Tojiboeva has been a chief justice on the SSMU Judicial Board for the past two years. In 2015-2016, she was the President of the Sociology Students’ Association (SSA) and Chair of McGill Students for UN Women. She has previously served as the VP Internal of the AUS Environment Committee and the Inter-Campus Outreach Coordinator of SSMU’s Environment Committee. As an intern at a law firm, she has also gained experience working on legal documents.
Tojiboeva’s platform prioritizes the autonomy of the Judicial Board through the body’s complete separation from the SSMU Board of Directors (BoD) and Executive Committee. In her vision, as long as the Board’s decisions are compatible with Quebec law, BoD would not have the authority to overrule the Board. Furthermore, Tojiboeva has worked with the administration through her involvement with SSA and the Judicial Board. As a president, she would seek to be seen as “as someone to work with instead of work against.”
After SSMU’s inadequate response to allegations of sexual violence against former SSMU VP External David Aird, Tojibeova proposes a SSMU-specific sexual assault policy – not a unique proposal in this year’s election. Moreover, by reforming the logistics of General Assemblies, she hopes to make SSMU more relevant to students and “slowly build trust in the system.” When asked about her opinions on SSMU taking political positions, Tojiboeva’s avoided a forthright response by saying that she would “respect the democratic process” and “advocate for issues dear to students’ hearts.” Tojiboeva would also prioritize mental health, a common pillar in the platform of SSMU candidates.
Both Ogundeji and Tojiboeva reflect administrative experience and sufficient understanding of student politics through involvement in SSMU and AUS roles. However, Ogundeji demonstrates higher commitment to student advocacy. The Daily does not endorse Shannon as a potential candidate.
Both Ogundeji and Tojiboeva are committed to mental health as a key priority and propose to better support student in collaboration with mental health services. While Tojiboeva’s proposal of increased mental health services outlines budgeting priorities and process towards additional funding, Ogundeji’s counselling proposal accounts for the marginalized voices on campus by specifically catering to the needs of racialized students, as well as issues rooted in colonialism.
In response to the lack of accountability highlighted by the Igor Sadikov and David Aird case, Tojiboeva proposed a SSMU-specific sexual assault policy followed by a GA reform, while Ogundeji proposed a SSMU Executive Code of Conduct. While Tojiboeva’s suggestions promises to advocate for student interest through a democratic process, Ogundeji’s platform better addresses SSMU’s general inadequacy regarding executives’ misconduct in a more explicit manner.
As such, The Daily endorses Ogundeji for this position.

The VP Operations handles managing the use and coordinating the development of the Shatner building, overseeing the management of SSMU’s business operations including Gerts, MiniCourses, and the Student-Run Cafeteria (SRC), and operationalizing SSMU’s goals of environmental sustainability.

Anuradha Mallik is currently a floor fellow at Molson residence. She has extensive experience with the Secondary Schools’ United Nations Symposium (SSUNS) and McGill Model United Nations (McMUN) as Chargée D’Affaires and Deputé Chargée D’Affaire in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and as a Dais Member in 2015, 2016 and 2017. She was also a facilitator at last year’s Canadian Conference on Student Leadership and Head of Communications for Water for Life in the 2013-2014 academic year. Talking to The Daily about her experiences working at SSUNS, Anuradha said: “[It] consists of organizing a conference that about 1,500 people attend every year, plus about four hundred staff, so I’ve had a lot of experience with operations, contracts, the works, for […] the venues and every external body that we get involved in the conference.” Mallik is also proficient in French.
Mallik’s platform contains four parts: the Sustainability Policy, Sustainability Cooperation, Building Projects and Proactive Communication, and Revenue Generating Operations. In regards to her portfolio, Mallik wants to put an “emphasis on sustainability.”
Mallik views SSMU as a political actor and believes that “the point of the executive is to represent the voices of the constituents,” as “McGill is quite a politically charged environment with a lot of issues.” She hopes to “work with the University Affairs to go through the policy handbook because […] a lot of them are expiring soon and a lot of them need to be renewed.”
Mallik has an extensive understanding of the logistics of event planning and organizational work through her experience with SSUNS and Water for Life. This, in addition to her willingness to stand by political initiatives, such as advocacy around the creation of a sexual assault policy for SSMU, and the presence of ‘active bystanders’ in Gerts (which is run by the VP Operations), make her a strong candidate for the position. Additionally, Mallik has experience with sustainability initiatives, which is now being applied to her vision as VP Operations. Due to Mallik’s enthusiasm for equity, and the steps she has already taken to prepare for a potential VP position, The Daily endorses Mallik for VP Operations.
An earlier version of this article stated that Mallik’s quote, “[It] consists of organizing a conference,” referenced her involvement with McMUN. In fact, it concerned her work with SSUNS. The Daily regrets the error.

The VP Finance portfolio includes ensuring the long-term financial stability of SSMU in cooperation with the General Manager, overseeing funding and operations management committees, providing the Executive Committee and Board of Directors with regular reports on the financial status of SSMU, and developing the annual budget of SSMU, among other tasks.

Khan currently serves as SSMU’s Funding Commissioner in the VP Finance office, and the SSMU representative on the McGill Innovation Steering Committee. Prior to that, she worked as a Finance and Operations Assistant in the same office.
Aside from her work in the VP Finance office, Khan worked as SSMU’s Researcher on Students from Foster Care, wherein she published a report of targeted support programs available across North America with concrete policy changes and recommendations for McGill, in the aim of increasing the number of students who come from foster care. Khan, herself a student from foster care, presented the report to the SSMU Legislative Council last November.
As Funding Commissioner, Khan was responsible for the allocation of funds from nine SSMU-collected student fees, in her estimation totalling approximately $350,000. She has additionally been heavily involved in advocacy work for students from foster care, both in the nonprofit and public sector.
Past VPs Finance have often campaigned on a platform of political neutrality, but Khan disagrees with this stance: “Finance, or money, in of itself is a very political issue, and people think it’s not,” she said in an interview with The Daily. “Where you choose to buy your groceries to where you choose to invest, it’s always a political position.”
Khan wants to promote social responsibility within SSMU, and has advocated for better resource allocation and combating ancillary fees from the administration. When it comes to corporate engagements, she wants to ensure that SSMU only engages with companies that “reflect our mission,” all the while ensuring that students do not bear the burden of additional costs. She aims to do this by creating a working group to oversee the development of Socially Responsible Sponsorship guidelines, while promising to prioritize consultation with the SSMU student body.
Overall, Khan’s platform prioritizes making SSMU’s finances more efficient and more readily accessible to the McGill community. Khan wants to increase accessibility of SSMU’s financial information by providing “bi-annual graphic snapshots” of SSMU’s financial operations to show students where exactly their money is going, most likely at SSMU General Assemblies (GA).
Khan’s experience in the VP Finance office, and her understanding of the responsibilities of working with large amounts of money, make her well suited to the role of VP Finance. Additionally, her willingness to acknowledge the political nature of finance, and her commitment to directing student’s money towards worthy investments and causes, both in the corporate and social spheres, is a reassurance that students will not have to expect the burden of additional fees or unethical corporate involvement in the coming year. For these reasons, alongside her continued commitment to her advocacy work with students from foster care, The Daily endorses Arisha Khan for the position of VP Finance.

The VP University Affairs plays a pivotal role in student advocacy, sitting on Senate and representing SSMU and its constituents to the McGill administration. This coming year will see some responsibilities removed from the University Affairs portfolio, such as mental health and student services, leaving the VP University Affairs to oversee the SSMU Library Improvement Fund, work with student senators on advocacy projects, oversee student research initiatives, and implement equity initiatives.

Alexander Dow is currently an engineering senator on SSMU Council. Before that he served as the Budget Director for the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), Blues Pub Manager, Student Space Fund Commissioner, VP Public Relations for EUS Junior Council, and VP Comms and Sports for MORE housing. He told The Daily that in his time at McGill he has been consistently “working with students or working with admin.” He has “seen a lot of students hurt” and “screwed over” by admin. He says his main goal is to help students deal with the bureaucracy of the university. He values teamwork and expresses a commitment to helping students on an individual basis. He has the trust and support of the EUS and hopes to bring some of their concerns to the SSMU Council.
He stressed that if elected he is not committed to introducing any new policy. Instead he wants to “cement what already exists” and lift up side projects that have fallen by the wayside. In particular, he supports the movement to create an Indigenous studies major, as well as institute a fall reading week. He is currently working to sway the opinion of the Engineering faculty on this issue. He has limited experience with equity and mental health and would take a back seat on issues of that nature if elected, emphasizing that he would use his privilege to advance the agendas of marginalized communities on campus.
Dow likes the apolitical nature of EUS, however, he understands the need for SSMU to be more vocal on political issues. He “draws the line in taking political stances when [SSMU] starts excluding other student groups.” Dow says that while he “grieves for Palestine […] you can’t just openly target an entire community on campus, namely the Jewish and Israeli communities.” However, Dow says that he is good at working with others despite political differences. With regard to David Aird, Dow found out about his resignation five days beforehand. He thinks that the same is true for the other SSMU Execs and does not condone the negative feedback they have received in the past couple of weeks. He aims to work with campus groups such as SACOMSS to create and adopt a sexual assault policy within SSMU, but was unclear on what the specifics of this policy would be.

Oke has held multiple roles in the Black Students’ Network (BSN) over the years, serving not only as the President of the Network, but also as an External and Political Coordinator. Working as part of the Network displays a commitment to organizing and advocacy that VP UAs should have, she says.
Currently, Oke works as VP Floor Fellows of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE). She was part of the AMUSE bargaining team which negotiated with the administration to give Floor Fellows salaries, and cites the experience as an example of her adamantly advocating for student’s rights when dealing with the administration.
Additionally, as part of the proposed MUNACA-AMUSE merger, Oke was involved in writing new bylaws for the proposal, demonstrating experience in policy development, and cites her training as a Floor Fellow as being conducive to working in University Affairs, having received more than seventy hours of training as a result, learning active listening, equitable community building, and first response to crises.
Her overall platform prioritizes accountability and campus outreach, especially in a time where SSMU feels incredibly disjointed from the student body. Oke wants to create specific student positions to perform outreach initiatives to campus groups that are not formally part of the Society, saying that “in her experience, active in-person outreach is an effective way of keeping in touch with realities on campus.”
In regards to the Library Improvement Fund, Oke wants to foster healthier spaces in McGill’s libraries, adding visual and nonvisual guides in the libraries to remind students that while studying is important, “there are small actions students can take to mitigate the negative effects of many studying practices.” Oke also wants to install “happy lights” to combat Seasonal Affective disorder (SAD) during midterms and finals.
Oke plans to build on the current VP UA’s “Know your Rights” campaign, which she feels doesn’t give students the option to ask for more “tailored or relevant information.” Oke also feels that SSMU should be doing more to make student services more accessible, and intends to meet demands to improve said services by working with first years’ like in a focus group, letting them discover McGill services and subsequently SSMU officers learning about their experiences and how they can be improved upon.
Oke’s work with AMUSE, as well as her experience as a Floor Fellow and as part of the BSN make her a prime candidate for this position. The VP University Affairs portfolio requires direct relations with the administration, which Oke also has experience in bargaining on behalf of AMUSE at the level of the administration. Her initiative to reach out to more student groups in a more organized fashion would be a welcome adjustment considering many student groups feel currently alienated from the SSMU.
While Dow has a background in student politics with his work in EUS, his limited experience with equity would be a considerable disadvantage in a position which requires heavy knowledge and experience of both these issues. His stance on political issues is also disheartening, given that the VP University Affairs is the only executive other than the President who would advocate for students regarding political issues at the University level.

The VP Student Life was previously named the VP Clubs & Services. The restructured portfolio now deals with clubs and services, student services, mental health initiatives, and independent student groups.

Earle is the current VP Health and Athletics of the McGill Music Undergraduate Students’ Association (MUSA), as well as having been a Floor Fellow at the Royal Victoria College residence (RVC) for the past two years, Food Representative for La Citadelle Hall Council and Council Advisor for RVC hall council. He has also attended the Canadian Conference on Student Leadership (CCSL). In an interview with The Daily, he explained that this experience contributed to his decision to run for VP Student Life, saying that he’s “a big fan of giving back and role modelling.” He also explained that this influenced his decision to become a Floor Fellow. He is also a French speaker.
For Earle, mental health and student clubs and services are the most important part of the portfolio. At the SSMU Executive Candidate’s debate, he noted that while he cares about his personal projects, they take a back seat to these parts of the portfolio, which are “most important.” He cites mental health as his main focus, especially increasing student input – he believes that “having a student representative […] to survey the broader student population and bring it back to [faculty members on committees] opens up a whole new world,” and that increasing the quality of mental health care at McGill is crucial since, as a floor fellow, he has seen how “mental health impacts everyday life.”
Earle also views SSMU as a political actor, pointing out to The Daily that “if an external issue affects students, it will affect them in a huge way,” going on to say that executives need to do a lot of “researching […] and talking to students,” especially if the “external issue doesn’t affect the identities of SSMU execs.” Furthermore, he pointed out that execs taking ill-informed stances can “be really detrimental to the group [an issue] is affecting,” and values transparency, even if an issue is ongoing, saying that issues should be “public from the start. In addition, he believes that it’s natural that students are divided on issues and that it’s important to make sure that “both sides, or however many sides there are about a certain issue” are being heard.
The Daily endorses a ‘yes’ vote for Jemark Earle as VP Student Life. Earle demonstrates considerable experience in student engagement and leadership through his two-year long experience as a Floor Fellow, his executive position in MUSA (Music Undergraduate Students’ Association), and his key roles in student lead campaigns such as McGill Talks and Starting Minor with Mental Health. This relevant background will complement the VP Student Life portfolio and assure students that Earle is a prime candidate for this position.
Earle’s commitment to SSMU’s political nature additionally informs the VP Student Life position; political issues actively affect students, and The Daily commends Earle’s assertion that such topics cannot be ignored by student executives.

The VP External is responsible for connecting SSMU’s constituents to the wider Montreal and Quebec community. The portfolio includes communication with other post-secondary institutions and McGill’s labour unions, and lobbying the government on behalf of SSMU. The VP External is also mandated to provide support for student-run social and environmental justice campaigns.
 

Connor Spencer has been involved in student activism since arriving on this campus four years ago. Born to a labour union family, she is vocal about the importance of anti-austerity protests, demonstrated through her long time involvement with À la rue Montreal – a group which organizes across campuses for free tuition – and McGill Against Austerity. Spencer has also participated in other French and English off-campus campaigns, developing significant experience working with student activists across Greater Montreal.
For the last two years, Spencer has collaborated closely with previous VP Externals in her anti-austerity work. She has a solid understanding of the position’s responsibilities as well as ways in which the portfolio could be exercised effectively. Her campaign platform prioritizes communication and transparency among SSMU offices, between the VP External’s office and relevant community groups on and off campus, and between SSMU and the McGill student body. She identifies this lack of communication among all parties as a major area of concern in her experience working with past VP Externals, and wishes to amend this through increased consultation with student groups, affected communities, and other campuses. By doing so, Spencer hopes to initiate a sustained conversation about financial accessibility and the effects of austerity on students, especially on those who are historically marginalized.
Spencer does not agree with the Administration having a say in student politics. Nevertheless, she stresses the importance of a system in place to hold SSMU executives accountable. To this end, she plans to implement a stand alone sexual violence policy for SSMU, acknowledging the need for multiple avenues of complaint for those who have been harmed by fellow students in positions of power.
Spencer’s experiences working with past VP Externals and in anti-austerity groups have prepared her for this position. Her emphasis on making liaisons with other campuses in the collective fight against rising tuition, combined with her ability to speak fluent French, indicates her awareness of the VP External’s core duties. As such, The Daily endorses Spencer for this position.
Content warning: sexual violence
Editor’s note: The print edition of this endorsement lists Noah Century as a candidate for VP External. However, Century withdrew from the race on March 12, having faced intense criticism after he was publicly censured by Elections SSMU for a rape joke he made in an interview with The Daily. On March 7, asked in a standard candidate interview what his takeaways from the David Aird case were, he laughed and answered “don’t get caught.” Now that Century has withdrawn, Spencer is running unopposed.

In case you missed The Daily’s liveblog, check out some key moments from the debate
Asked “what do you see as advocacy priorities for SSMU in terms of improving McGill’s governance and how will you pursue those as president?,” Ogundeji replied that in her view, the central obstacle to better governance is insufficient student representation on the Board of Governors (BoG). Shannon agreed, adding that SSMU should try and forge alliances with faculty members in order to further its interests. Tojiboeva, meanwhile, stressed the importance of demonstrating that the President can collaborate with the administration. She added that her advocacy priority would be mental health.
A student asked the candidates how they would increase representation and engagement for racialized students, and what their qualifications were for doing so. Ogundeji, who is currently on the executive of the Black Students’ Network, replied that she planned to create a platform within Mental Health and Counselling to specifically address the issues unique to racialized students. She also noted that she has been working to create specific seats for racialized students on SSMU Council, “given the colonial and slave-holding history of the founder of McGill.”
Tojiboeva responded that she would be working closely with the SSMU Equity Commissioners, and that by increasing the independence of the Judicial Board she hopes to give racialized students a better platform to air their concerns. Shannon also said that racialized students should have better platforms to speak out about their experiences, but failed to suggest any concrete ideas to solve this. He added that, any time SSMU might be about to take a position on a contentious political issue, any communities involved should be given space to air their views.
“What do you see as the role of SSMU in the Montreal community and in the Quebec student movement?” Century answered that SSMU should be representing McGill students, and “participating more in developing any project that could help improve the life of students” both at McGill and across the province; he did not, however, point to any specific issues that should be prioritized. Spencer, for her part, agreed with Century that SSMU should represent McGill students through AVEQ, and said that the Society should particularly get involved in initiatives to fight the precarity experienced by students.
Asked to name “the greatest barriers to accessibility to the student experience,” Oke responded that the issue of overhead fees has been a significant obstacle for students with low socioeconomic status to succeed on campus. Dow focused his response on physical accessibility.
If elected, asked the current VP University Affairs, how would the candidates advocate for improvements to mental health on campus? Dow mentioned the Library Improvement Fund, and said that a priority would be to make study spaces more conducive to mental wellbeing. Oke, meanwhile, said that McGill’s Mental Health and Counselling Services need a better understanding of the issues which impact students’ mental health, adding that more accessible teaching practices in McGill classrooms would reduce stress, thereby reducing the burden on these services.
Asked how she would “improve health and wellbeing in frosh and orientation events,” Koparkar replied that she would be working with departmental associations on this, but that this could include providing a wider range of food options, and/or instituting a yoga period.
Asked how, if elected, she will manage money better than the current VP finance, Khan said that she would be looking at other student associations across Canada to see how they fund overheads and services. She will also prioritize making SSMU more financially sustainable.
Asked how she plans to improve the financial viability of Sadie’s, the student-run cafeteria in the Shatner building, Mallik replied that in addition to continuing current the VP Operations’ efforts with regard to branding and advertizing, she would also work with the staff to improve and better utilize institutional memory.
Asked how he would provide emotional support, and manage conflict within the executive team, Earle explained that, particularly as a floorfellow, he has had significant experience in these areas, and feels confident in his ability to be a supportive member of the team.
