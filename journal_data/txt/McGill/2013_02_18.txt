Activist to deliver petition signed by over 7,500 people
Jacqueline Rockman left Montreal for Ottawa on foot Thursday to deliver a petition signed by 7,832 people to Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
The petition was posted on December 19 on the community action website avaaz.org, and calls on Harper and Governor General David Lloyd Johnston to accept the demands made by Chief Theresa Spence, which would have ended Spence’s hunger strike.
Spence, who was on a liquids-only diet for six weeks while calling for a meeting between Harper, Johnston, and Aboriginal leaders, ended her strike on January 23 after a list of commitments supporting Aboriginal issues was backed by members of the Assembly of First Nations and the Liberal and New Democrat caucuses.
“I really feel [the petition] is still valid, that to let these men know they weren’t instrumental, we were watching and were hoping for a different outcome from them. Maybe they’ll understand,” Rockman told The Daily in a phone interview two days before her departure for Ottawa. “They didn’t respond to Chief Spence, they didn’t do what was needed to its fullness. These are people who are being victimized. I don’t want to call all First Nations [people] victims, but they have been treated atrociously.”
Rockman left from outside John Abbott College, in Sainte Anne-de-Bellevue, at 7 a.m. She was planning for the trip to take four days, first arriving at Victoria Island,where she said she would be saying her “own prayers.” She then planned to continue to Ottawa to try to meet with the Prime Minister.
“I am hoping to get to Ottawa in four days, hoping to arrive on the 18. [In Hebrew] the number 18 spells life…I feel that love will rise on a day that spells ‘life’,” she said.
The march has been dubbed the “Voice of Thousands March” by Rockman. When the petition was first posted, she had originally said the petition would be hand-delivered were it to obtain ten thousand signatures. “There are almost 8,000 people who signed the petition,” she told The Daily. “I think that is still a valid number to be brought…It’s not about me, it’s about everyone.”
Rockman asked community members to join her on the walk, and to support her with food and camping supplies.
“I’m really impressed with the community support. Occupy Montreal jumped in and loaned equipment to people who needed it. They loaned me a tent and a sleeping bag and other stuff like that,” she said.
Rockman was adamant that her actions upon arriving in Ottawa would be peaceful. Upon arriving, she would “go in peacefully and respectfully, I’m not going to be banging on doors, yelling or screaming everywhere, at all. I’m not bringing a whole contingent to be noisy,” she told The Daily.
Rockman, who is “just a regular, everyday Canadian,” told The Daily that her action was meant as a wake-up call for other non-Aboriginal Canadians. “I have the feeling that Canadians need to wake the hell up, and really need to take a stand and be heard and fight,” she said.

On Valentine’s Day, 14 activists from Divest McGill – a student group responsible for orchestrating the fossil fuel and tar sands divestment campaign at McGill – gathered outside the Shatner building at 1 p.m. with large neon pink hearts and smaller hand-written humorous notes breaking up with unclean energy industries. They marched across campus, ending their walk on the steps in James Square. At 1:30 p.m. short skits were performed and a dance party ensued. The demonstration dissolved at 1:45 p.m.

Missing Justice raises awareness about missing and murdered Indigenous women
Around 250 people gathered outside the St. Laurent metro station on Thursday for the march for missing and murdered Indigenous women. The march, organized by Justice for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, a working group of the 2110 Centre for Gender Advocacy, is part of a nationwide movement that has been active since 1991.
According to the Native Women’s Association of Canada, approximately 600 Indigenous women have been murdered or found missing within the last three decades in Canada. 2110 Centre Programming and Campaigns Coordinator Bianca Mugyenyi told The Daily in October that proportionally, this number is huge.
“[If you] extrapolated that [number] to the general Canadian population, even just with 583 cases, that would be the equivalent of 20,000 people that had gone missing. That would be all over the news – 20,000 women missing, it’s an epidemic, right?” she said.
Mugyenyi said that Indigenous activists put the number of murdered women closer to 3,000. She said the discrepancy could be attributed to incomplete police records.
Amnesty International Canada reports that Indigenous women in Canada are five to seven times more likely to die of violence than their non-Indigenous counterparts, but that the majority of these cases go unreported.
The march, which had a higher turnout than previous years, began at the corner of St. Laurent and Maisonneuve with a series of speakers and performances, including the Buffalo Hat Singers, a group of contemporary pow wow drummers.
Melissa Dupuis, a representative of Idle No More, Quebec, noted during the opening ceremony that the government was not doing enough to deal with the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women.
“Harper needs to understand there is an ongoing crisis in the Canadian territory where basic human rights are being neglected and taken away,” she said.
On February 13, Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international human rights group, released a damning report denouncing a lack of action by the government. The report included testimonies from over fifty Indigenous women who had been roughed up, strip-searched, Tasered, pepper-sprayed, raped, and threatened with death at the hands of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in British Columbia.
Despite public outrage, the Conservative government has so far been dismissive of the findings. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was reported in multiple news outlets to have said that anyone experiencing abuse should go to “the appropriate police so they can investigate.” They should “just get on and do it,” he said.
The Human Rights Watch report is the latest in a string of non-governmental initiatives to address the systematic abuse of Indigenous women.
Online hacker group Anonymous released a map on February 5 that traces missing and murdered Indigenous women. The map, which uses public data from police crime maps, allows people to fill in gaps in formal information by anonymously reporting cases.
Nina Sigalwoitz, a caseworker at Chez Doris, a women’s shelter in Montreal, spoke at the march about her experience giving workshops at Montreal schools. That morning, she had witnessed a complete lack of awareness among students when she discussed her experience as an Indigenous woman.
“These students didn’t even know that Indigenous people exist! They thought there weren’t any in Quebec,” she said to the assembled crowd.
Mirha-Soleil Ross, a representative from Action santé tranvesti(e)s et transsexuel(le)s du Quebec (ASTT(e)Q), was also invited to speak. Ross gave a speech on her experience as a trans* Indigenous person, explaining how reports about missing Indigenous women are suppressed by people in positions of privilege and power.
Prominent Mohawk activist Ellen Gabriel was last to speak before the march began. Gabriel pointed at authority figures as facilitators who perpetuate racist ideologies toward Indigenous people. She noted the pressing need for educational reform that fully acknowledges the Indigenous history of Canada.
Gabriel called for an end to the ongoing colonialism, which she feels is currently put forth by the Harper government and sustained by corporations.
“These tyrants do what they need to do to make a profit. They answer to companies, profit making oil companies, and ignore their people,” she said.
Once the march got underway, it wended its way up St. Laurent, ending at the Parc des Amériques on the corner of Rachel and St. Laurent. The evening closed with musical and spoken word performances, and a closing prayer by Indigenous leader John Cree.
