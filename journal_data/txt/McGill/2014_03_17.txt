AGSEM seeks to further represent teaching support staff
The Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) has recently begun a campaign to unionize all teaching support staff that are not currently unionized. This includes graders, tutors, and undergraduate course assistants.
According to Benjamin Elgie, AGSEM Teaching Assistant (TA) Bargaining Chair and Daily Publications Society Chair, the campaign stems from a growing need for union protection of currently non-unionized teaching support staff.
“Graders and tutors have both seen greatly increased use,” Elgie wrote to The Daily in an email, “but while they do very similar jobs as TAs, they get paid quite a lot less, and enjoy none of our protections in terms of hiring, leave, the ability to file grievances, etc.”
Over the past several years, TAs have seen increases in their salaries, and a decrease in the amount of work they do. Elgie noted that it was possible that the increased use of graders and tutors, along with the decreased use of TAs for doing almost the same job, may be the University’s way of decreasing the amount that it pays its employees.
According to Elgie, AGSEM had made two previous attempts to include graders in their union: first in 2001, and then again in 2008, when invigilators were added.
“But because the original 1993 unionization drive had excluded graders, the province ruled against us,” Elgie told The Daily in an email. Currently, AGSEM represents only invigilators and TAs.
“Unions can only officially bargain on behalf of those bargaining units (groups of employees such as ‘graduate Teaching Assistants’ or ‘casual non-academic employees’) for which they have been legally accredited,” AGSEM Invigilator Grievance Officer Jamie Burnett told The Daily in an email.
To represent these positions, AGSEM must apply to a provincial labour board to become accredited as a union that represents the currently non-unionized teaching staff. This means it must receive membership forms from at least 50 per cent of each employee group it hopes to represent, or, if it wins a union election, between 30 per cent and 50 per cent in order to prove that their bargaining is in the interests of the employee groups in question.
AGSEM also hopes to reach out to the undergraduate teaching staff, a population that has grown significantly since 1993. As of now, this would be against its collective agreement, which states that TAs are graduate students.
“But [the exclusion of undergraduate teaching staff] comes from 1993,” said Elgie, “when it was extremely rare for undergrads at McGill or elsewhere to work as TAs. The practice is much more common now. And again, undergraduate course assistants/TAs lack union protections, are paid much less for doing the same work, etc.”
Though the campaign only recently became public, it has already garnered support from various groups.
“We’re planning on unionizing teaching support staff as a unit of AGSEM,” Elgie told The Daily. “At the moment that means we’re working on this project ourselves, but we’ve had some unofficial indicators of support from some campus groups, and we’ll be receiving assistance from our affiliate the Confederation of National Trade Unions.”
As AGSEM’s campaign will be completely public, affected employee groups will have many opportunities to determine whether or not they would like to be unionized under AGSEM.
“We chose to make the campaign public partly because we think it will make it a lot easier to reach potential members,” said Burnett, “but we also think that it gives teaching support employees a clearer, fairer choice about whether or not they would like to be represented by AGSEM.”

Commissioners connect residential schools to violence against Indigenous women
On March 13, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) visited McGill, as part of a conference entitled “Whose Truth? What Kind of Reconciliation? The Importance of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions for Promoting Democratic Good Governance,” sponsored by the Institute for the Study of International Development.
The Canadian TRC, established in 2008, aims to document the legacy of the Canadian Indian residential schools system, and the lived experiences and histories of those affected by it. Residential schools, the last of which closed in 1996, were notorious for their brutal treatment of Indigenous children, who experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of caretakers.
Children also suffered the more insidious effects of forced assimilation and separation from their families and native cultures. At least 4,000 children died while attending the schools.
Commissioners stressed the longstanding, intergenerational effects of the school system, and emphasized the need for healing, mutual understanding, and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians.
“Recognition, for us, is about changing this history of oppression and negativity, and allowing Canadians to relate to each other in a more positive way,” said Murray Sinclair, Chair of the Commission, and former judge.
Marie Wilson, another one of the commissioners, implicated Canadian culture and society as a whole, and stressed that the residential schools system was a product of Canadian policy, and not solely an Indigenous issue.
“It says right here, in the agreement, that reconciliation is ongoing – it’s individual and collective, and it names all the parties to the agreement – and it also names the people of Canada,” she explained.
“How will we get that word out there, and how will we make it so that the people of Canada register that this belongs to us all?”
Commissioners also noted that many of the challenges facing Indigenous people today are reflective of the damage incurred by the system, not only on the survivors of abuse, but also, through them, on their families and their communities.
One audience member, who identified as an Aboriginal woman, asked commissioners about the need for action regarding missing and murdered Indigenous women.
“While the government doesn’t see a commission on Aboriginal women as a necessity at this time, could you please find some safeguards for Aboriginal women on our behalf? Because we trust in your vision, we believe in your mandate, and all we want is pretty small compared to what the world offers,” the audience member said.
Research has shown that while Indigenous women make up approximately 3 per cent of the Canadian population, between 2000 and 2008 they represented 10 per cent of all female victims of homicides.
“I think that the fact that [the Commission] is given the trust as widely as they are and given a justice mission, that we have to respect that opportunity,” the same audience member later said to The Daily. “They’ve asked us to care and to be involved, and so caring and being involved means asking them to consider ideas that matter to us, that we suffer silently around.”
Chief Wilton Littlechild, another one of the commissioners, agreed with the audience member, emphasizing to The Daily not only the urgency behind growing numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women, but also the connection of the issue to the residential school system.
To illustrate the connection, he related a story to The Daily in which he attended the funeral of a murdered woman, who turned out to be the daughter of classmates of his from his time in the residential school system.
Littlechild also pointed to the recent release of a report by Members of Parliament on the Special Committee on Violence Against Indigenous Women that failed to recommend a public inquiry into the problem – a move that advocates have long pushed for.
“Our first sacred teaching that we use in our hearings and our national events is respect,” Littlechild said. “What I’m seeing here now, through the parliamentary committee, is a lack of respect for life.”

Researchers call for increased social support
On March 13 and 14, speakers ranging from undergraduate researchers to PhD candidates came together to discuss their research on equity and health at the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Equity Committee’s annual Equity Conference.
“The goal of the conference is pretty simple: it is to create a forum of discussion and education on the subject of equity and health,” Farah Momen, the Conference’s coordinator, told The Daily. “I think the conference is good not only for the people who are already interested in these issues, but also people who aren’t familiar with them.”
During the Conference, researchers presented on a wide array of topics. Sarah Berry, a course lecturer in the Sociology department at McGill, spoke about the intersections between poverty, mental illness, and homelessness.
According to Berry, increased access to social welfare, healthcare, and mental health services are all needed for Canada to tackle homelessness. However, Berry also insisted that a cultural change is needed as well.
“There is a lot of fear around [homelessness, poverty, and mental illness] – fear of violence – and this assumption that you are so fundamentally different from somebody who experiences those things,” Berry told The Daily. “Poverty and homelessness, and exclusion and marginalization can be invisible to other people, or the humanity of someone who is experiencing those things can be invisible to you.”
Anvita Kulkarni, a U3 Political Science and Physiology student, presented research on the “taxi driver MD” phenomenon. According to Kulkarni, international medical graduates are often seen as a solution to a lack of physicians in rural areas in Canada, but this often can mask the various issues they face, such as licensing. 
“I was motivated to research this topic because I have had a lot of personal experience in knowing people who have immigrated to Canada as physicians, and [knowing] the barriers they faced in getting a license and being able to practice in Canada,” Kulkarni told The Daily.
Rania Wasfi, a PhD candidate in the Geography department at McGill, presented research on the link between active transport, health, and the environment.  
Wasfi explained that when people use active transport – such as walking, biking, and public transport – they can often meet the World Health Organization’s recommended 30 minutes of daily physical activity.
Wasfi also emphasized that accessible active transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions and asthma rates, and is important for people who may not be able to drive, such as seniors.
Overall, Momen hoped that the diverse range of topics covered at the conference will help frame the McGill community’s discussion of equity issues.
“Around campus, lately, there’s been a sort of negative feeling towards equity, and equity issues. While it’s important to criticize constructively, I think it’s important not to dismiss equity, and to look at the ways in which equity has meaning in different fields,” Momen said to The Daily.
Kulkarni expressed similar views, telling The Daily, “I think it’s really important for people to keep an open mind, and I think that framing the conference [in terms of] health and equity is a very good way of getting people to think about how equity intersects with a lot of things.”
Berry hoped that the conference would help push students from apathy to active interest beyond campus politics.
“[A conference] is different than a formal lecture – people have to be [at a lecture], they’re doing it for credit. There is a different level of interest and enthusiasm in actually doing things if you go to a conference,” Berry told The Daily.
“It is important to break [the invisibility of equity issues] down. We have to be intentional about it and actually make changes and work against it.”

Society’s purpose reconsidered at annual general meeting
McGill’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its annual general meeting (AGM) on March 12, during which members discussed various amendments to the Society’s bylaws and the approval of a new auditor for the past fiscal year.
A motion to amend the bylaws to change titles of officers could not be discussed, as it was subject to approval from PGSS Council, which had voted against it during its meeting just before the AGM.
Under the Quebec Companies Act, corporations like PGSS need to have a president of the Board of Directors, according to Graduate Law Students’ Association (GLSA) president and PGSS’ GLSA councillor Juan Camilo Pinto. Currently, the secretary-general of PGSS acts both as the president and the secretary-general.
“You have the title secretary-general – slash – the president. I don’t know about you, but it sounds confusing to me. Especially because one is a legal term, and the other one is a term that was brought as a way of saying [that] we don’t have a hierarchy in the PGSS, but in fact we do,” Pinto told The Daily.
“It is a very weird thing to have a dual title,” said PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney in an interview with The Daily. “On the one hand, almost no other group within McGill uses the term secretary-general, which looks a bit odd. On the other hand, it’s used in the francophone associations. So there are arguments in favour of both.”
Another motion concerned expanding the purpose of PGSS to include the promotion of “freedom of association within the student movement.”
Presenting the motion, Mooney explained that the amendment to the bylaws was a statement directed at the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), with which PGSS has been in legal conflict since 2010.
“It’s our purpose as a corporation to promote freedom of association, and we want to work with all the student associations across Canada to make sure that they have a right to choose who they affiliate with,” Mooney said at the AGM.
Guillaume Lord, PhD candidate in Economics and former PGSS councillor, said in response that the wording of the motion would make PGSS sound more like a purely political association than a student association.
Some attendees proposed to amend the motion, so that the wording could be made clearer. Rachel Schwartz, the speaker, explained that since the motion was approved by Council, the AGM only had the power to ratify it, and could not amend it.
The AGM finally voted to refer the motion back to Council.
“I didn’t like how this motion was set out because it wasn’t about the members,” Lord told The Daily after the AGM. “It was about the general purpose of defending freedom of association. Now that, without debate, is a good purpose. We need to keep in mind that we are an association that is here for members, not for defending some various political virtues.”
“Now, I understand where the [secretary-general] came from, and that we are in a context of fighting a legal battle against CFS,” Lord added. “Actually, I am in favour of making a strong statement about this, I just don’t think this is the appropriate way to make it.”
Mooney admitted that the motion may have been too broadly defined.
“I think that what we’re going to have to do is to take a look at all the different issues that were brought up, and try to find a wording that more appropriately reflects the principle that we’re trying to achieve,” Mooney said to The Daily.

Protest ends with large-scale kettling
The 18th annual anti-police brutality march ended this Saturday not long after it started, with riot police descending on the scene and kettling demonstrators under bylaw P-6. According to CTV, nearly 300 demonstrators were handed fines of $638 for participating in the demonstration that was declared illegal merely minutes after its start.
“This is a paramilitary response to a completely legitimate anti-police demonstration,” community organizer Jaggi Singh told The Daily while observing the line of riot police. “There’s a pattern that the police have established with this particular demonstration on March 15 where they try to shut it down right away, they did last year and they’ve just done it right now.”
“Obviously the police will treat a demonstration that targets them directly differently than other demonstrations,” Singh added.
“They’re trying to establish a pattern where people are going to be be scared and stay away from these demonstrations. […] We have to show people that we’re not scared and that we’re going to continue to show up.”
A little after the protest’s 3 p.m. start outside of the Jean-Talon metro station, the march was declared illegal under bylaw P-6, which requires organizers to give the protest’s itinerary and route to police 24 hours in advance.
Riot police, including some mounted officers, from the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) and the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) pushed around 150 protesters onto Chateaubriand and Jean-Talon, where they were kettled for the duration of the protest.
“There [were] two people who had banners, they went into the street and said, ‘À qui la rue?’,” a protester who identified only as Cécile told The Daily, referring to a popular protest chant. “Then the cops just smashed [them], took the banners out, and pushed everybody, [on the] sidewalk and street, to Chateaubriand.”
A group of protesters quickly regrouped, and faced off against the riot police controlling access to the kettle. One protester seen confronting riot police was subsequently arrested and placed in a police cruiser.
The group of protesters was eventually dispersed by a line of riot police who charged at the crowd.
“This is a paramilitary response to a completely legitimate anti-police demonstration.”
Passengers inside Jean-Talon metro station were kept in the station by police during the protest, and an announcement from the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) blamed interrupted service on an “incident.”
Along with the hundreds kettled and fined, five people were also arrested at the march. Those in attendance pointed out to The Daily the unequal nature of the police intervention.
“The police […] intervene quickly, and I think that they’re pretty merciless,” said Vincent Roy, a protester who told The Daily that he was attending the march for the first time. “There are definitely more armed police officers, ready to attack, than there are protesters.”
Commenting on why many people don’t come to the protest, Roy said, “I think that most of us aren’t ready to get beaten with a nightstick, or get arrested, or receive an impossibly expensive ticket, for a cause that doesn’t concern us directly.”
“I think it is important for there to be a demonstration every year against police brutality, it’s a clearly established reality,” Singh said. “I hope this year is a tipping point where folks that are perhaps more mainstream, and not necessarily folks that will come out to a demo like this, will say that it’s totally inappropriate for these demonstrations to be shut down.”
“They’re trying to establish a pattern where people are going to be be scared and stay away from these demonstrations. […] We have to show people that we’re not scared and that we’re going to continue to show up.”
The protesters largely dispersed by 5 p.m., two hours after the beginning of the protest. The kettled protesters were processed and released by 6 p.m..
