On January 14th, the Russian LGBT Network released a statement confirming a new wave of persecution of queer people in the Russian republic of Chechnya. As of January 15th, there have been reports of at least 40 people detained, and two confirmed dead from injuries sustained through torture. The recent resurgence of what some have called a “queer purge” is part of an ongoing crackdown of LGBTQ+ people that was initially reported in January 2017. 
Much like in 2017, these purges are being carried out by state agents. Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, has denied his involvement in the purges as well as the existence of queer people in Chechnya entirely. In December 2017 he was listed under the US Magnitsky Act for supporting extrajudicial killings, which has allowed the US to impose sanctions. 
Until now, the persecutions have targeted mostly gay and bisexual men. It appears this most recent crackdown has expanded to target women as well. In addition, recent reports have described authorities destroying victims’ passports and pieces of identification in an effort to prevent them from leaving the country. 
Andrea Houston, Communications and Development Officer for Rainbow Railroad, a Toronto based organization that works directly with the Russian LGBT network in Chechnya told the Daily, “with this new wave of arrests, it’s not just the people themselves; it’s their entire families, their networks. They’re finding LGBTQ people on social media, they’re confiscating their cell phones and looking for people’s names. They’re torturing people until they give up the names of other community members. To top it off, many of them are being taken to their families where they are being told to kill them.”
While understanding the motivation for the purges is merely speculative, Andrea Houston suggests that “it’s an ongoing terror campaign and that seems to be the motivation: to instill terror and invoke fear in the LGBTQ population.”

McGill Administration and CPDO Unveil New Campus Plan
On January 17, representatives from the McGill Administration and Campus Planning and Development Office (CPDO) invited student press to learn about McGill’s new Master Plan. Interim Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Fabrice Labeau, Executive Director of the CPDO Cameron Charlebois, Director of Stakeholder Relations Dicki Chhoyang, and Interim Director of Communications James Martin answered questions about the upcoming changes to campus.
The “Master Plan” is a living document that sets the course for short, medium, and long term changes to campus. McGill’s master plan asserts common goals of campus living and addresses issues of transportation, landscaping, building, and space requirements.  Charlebois explains that ìa master plan can be many different things. You lay out what needs you think youíre going to have in the future for buildings, classrooms, research labs, student communal spaces, and outdoor spacesî.
The Master Plan also puts forward strategies to address McGillís space issues. Some of McGill’s buildings are not ideal spaces for classrooms, and are often inaccessible. Charlebois explained that McGill is renting 36,000 square metres of property, mainly on Sherbrooke, to accommodate student and staff needs. He also mentioned how McGill does not receive government subsidies for rental space, citing the extreme cost as an integral reason why McGill needs creative spatial solutions. 
“How do you dispose of the building assets that youíve got?” he asked, “what do you do with these [buildings] that are old and need to be refurbished? Some should be gotten rid of [so] new development can take place.”
Charlebois also touched on the Royal Victoria Hospital project, explaining that McGill purchased part of the hospital with plans to use the structure for extra classroom space. Estimations say the first classrooms will be ready around 2028. On the topic of campus expansion, Charlebois maintained that ì[McGill] won’t have more students and professors, “we will just have more space so we can move people into those buildings and move people from these rental buildings to campus. It’s going to be a lot cheaper.”
Members of the CPDO were also asked about how concerns of accessibility will factor into their renovation plans. “Any new construction has to be fully accessible,” Charlebois stated. He also elaborated on the struggle of updating existing buildings on campus. Most buildings, he says, have “severely constrained” renovation options because of their heritage status with various governments. according to Charlebois, “existing buildings, which are difficult for accessibility, are going to be worked on one at a time.” He drew attention to the efforts to improve accessibility at the Athletics Complex and at Redpath library.           
The CPDO is also making the cultivation and creation of communal space a priority, emphasizing that this is one of the main areas where McGill lacks infrastructure. “We’ve heard through other consultations that communal space is very important. It’s very important for students who don’t live near campus but have classes all day long. Where do they go if there’s five [or] six hours in between classes? […] We want to hear what the spaces are that people like, [such as] places to socialize or eating areas,” said Dicki Chhoyang.
Additionally, the CPDO is stressing their desire for, and the general importance of, student input on the Master Plan. Even though most of these projects will not be brought to fruition for almost a decade, the CPDO wants to hear from current McGill students. Chhoyang explained that “[the CPDO] realizes that when we ask students for their input and their thoughts on the spaces that they like or don’t like, many will have graduated by the time the project materializes […] We are appealing to the students’ wish to contribute towards a legacy for future generations of students based on your experience. What do you want to say so that the space is better for the next generation of students?”
Chhoyang continued, “we want to create a platform for them to let us know if they have a favourite indoor/outdoor space for studying, learning, research, socializ[ing], and relax[ing]. What do they like about that space? If they have a least favourite space what is it, why, and how can we make it better?”
The CPDO has a short survey available online, and will be tabling across campus the week of January 28, with more information about the Master Plan.

Three federal by-elections are set for February 25, as called for by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this year following several vacancies in parliament.
Tom Mulcair, former NDP leader and MP for the riding of Outremont, retired on August 3, 2018, leaving the riding without representation.
The riding was almost exclusively Liberal until Mulcair’s victory in 2007; Outremont has belonged to the NDP since.
On January 20, Julia Sánchez kicked off her campaign as the NDP candidate at her offices on Park and Bernard. Despite the snowstorm, the room was filled with supporters. 
Before running as the NDP’s candidate in Outremont, Sánchez worked in international development for 25 years. She is also a McGill alumnus.
In her address to supporters, Sánchez discussed how she has been “fighting for human rights, the rights of Indigenous peoples, and of women,” and feels that this campaign is a “natural progression” of her work. Sánchez said that she sees “a lot of broken promises” from the Liberal government. Sánchez is sympathetic to what she sees as Canadian’s “disillusionment” with current the Trudeau government and is motivated to be a part of changing that: “we need to push the government to do more, and do better.”
In her speech, Sánchez affirmed her commitment to representing the riding, recognizing the people of Outremont’s “own fights, their own battles,” and committing to them herself. 
Combating climate change is a key issue for Sánchez. She shares her constituents
 concerns that the “government is not doing enough to get on top of this huge issue.” She said that “people are worried for the future, for a future for their children.”
Wanting to move away from the discourse that the NDP is “negative” and “unhappy” with the status quo, Sánchez said that “we are angry, [but] we are also acting. We are taking action, finding solutions. We believe that there is a better future possible, we want to contribute to that, and we have hope. That’s what motivates me.”
MPs Alexandre Boulerice (Rosemont–Petite-Patrie) and Hélène Laverdière (Laurier–Sainte-Marie) also spoke, affirming their support of Sánchez and discussing their optimism for the race ahead.
Other candidates running in Outremont are Rachel Bendayan for the Liberals, Jasmine Louras for the Conservatives, and Daniel Green of the Green Party. The People’s Party of Canada, the Bloc-Quebecois, and the Libertarian Party have also expressed intentions to run in the by-election, but no candidates have been named. 
Coming so close to the federal election in October, this by-election race is crucial for both the Liberals and the New Democrats, as the parties struggle to gain ground and seats ahead of this fall. Any gains for the Liberals in Quebec this fall could offset losses accepted elsewhere in the country and could help sustain a majority for Trudeau. 
Predictions like these, as well as rumours that a concentration of efforts into NDP leader’s riding Burnaby South will leave other ridings such as Outremont underprepared and undefended, do not faze Sánchez.  Addressing this dispute, Sánchez pushed back against the notion that this race will be a “shoo-in for the Liberals.” While admitting that “it’s going to be difficult, we’re not taking anything for granted,” but stated that she’s “never shied away from challenges.”
