Attendees voice concerns and discuss paths forward
On Monday October 16, The Students’ Society of McGill Undergraduates (SSMU), held an open forum for the development of a gendered and sexual violence policy.
Approximately ten people attended the forum. These individuals were mostly members of student groups such as the Sexual Assault Centre of McGill’s Student Society (SACOMSS) or representatives from campus media. Connor Spencer, the SSMU VP External, was the sole representative of the SSMU executive in attendance. A livestream was provided by TV McGill (TVM) and the video is available on their website.
Spencer, who led the forum, began the discussion by acknowledging Indigenous land rights and discussing the events that transpired last year which catalyzed the campaign for a Sexual and Gendered Violence Policy within SSMU. Spencer referenced the allegations made against former SSMU President Ben Ger and former VP External David Aird, which resulted in their respective resignations.
Spencer made it clear that she wanted the forum to serve as a space for people to air their concerns, discuss rape culture on campus, and explore possible routes SSMU could take moving forward to develop a Sexual and Gendered Violence Policy.
“How are folks feeling about the conversations that are happening on campus? How are they feeling about the conversations that are happening at the [administrative] level? How are they feeling about the conversations that are happening at the grassroots level?” Spencer asked. “Where [does SSMU] fit in between that and how can we construct what we do next around addressing those feelings and concerns?”
Advocating for survivors of gendered and sexual violence has always been a student-led movement at McGill. This work has been done on a volunteer basis, most often by marginalized students.
“Almost always this labour that is done around sexual violence is unpaid, and the folks that are doing this labour are majority women or non-binary folk, and often of color,” said Spencer. “The delegitimization of labour that goes into this work is something SSMU has been complicit in in the past and I really, really hope that moving forward we can find a way to not be complicit.”
“Almost always this labour that is done around sexual violence is unpaid, and the folks that are doing this labour are majority women or non-binary folk, and often of color.”
One attendee raised concerns about the difficulty involved in mobilizing the student body on these issues, and the limited participation by a select group of students.
“The challenge that I see is often in these conversations it’s the same people over and over again,” continued the attendee in question. “A lot of these people have a lot of experience, […] and that’s really great, but something I worry about in these conversations [is] how we get students to actually say what they need, because to me that’s basically what informs us.”
On October 12, SSMU passed a motion acknowledging that rape culture is present on McGill’s campus and within SSMU. According to Spencer, who submitted the motion, she felt it necessary that student union members be conscious of the real impact rape culture has on campus.
“We read the motion, it was voted on, no one had anything to say. That terrifies me,” Spencer continued. “I think the movers and I were a little surprised [by] that, and the speaker did a really great job of [saying] ‘Not just questions or debate about this motion, but would anyone like to make any statements?’ And it was just silence. That showed me that we need to address more [of] the specific things that we as elected student representatives can be doing.”
One member of the audience expressed frustration with the recent defunding of events like Culture Shock and Social Justice Days, suggesting that SSMU should continue to provide funding for programs and events that provide education and mobilize the community.
“The challenge that I see is often in these conversations it’s the same people over and over again.”
Spencer noted that “ideally students will be offered a choice in pursuing a report process when the SSMU policy is put into place.” She continued, “There will be issues in making a policy [due to] lack of resources and a lack of expertise. […] The student executives do not have as much information as other campus groups which are dedicated to gender and assault issues.”
Spencer further contended that SSMU has a responsibility to its constituents, especially because some of its drinking-oriented events pose a particular risk for sexual violence. Some smaller measures have been implemented, namely a blacklist for events. Should a student report to an event organizer that he or she was made to feel unsafe by an individual, or if an event organizer finds that an individual behaved inappropriately at an event, said person would not be allowed at future events.
Dorothy Apedaile, a U4 science student, raised concerns about this issue. “[Something] to keep in mind when looking at these large events is [that] often we come in with the attitude of how we [can] change the entire event, coming in from the outside and not realizing the work that is happening within these circles to combat sexual violence.” She continued, “I worked very closely with the frosh community this summer to bring in new policies for them […] I think there is a lot of movement within these communities to address violence, sexual violence, and the issues that come up [at these campus events]. […] I think they’re sometimes an easy target when we talk about rape culture […] I think it needs to be looked at in the bigger picture, besides just these events on campus.”
“I worked very closely with the frosh community this summer to bring in new policies for them. […] I think they’re sometimes an easy target when we talk about rape culture.”
SSMU has only recently begun to discuss adopting a formal procedure for handling allegations of sexual violence. As it stands, the only resource is a short sexual harassment policy in the SSMU employee manual. Currently, SSMU provides no resources to help members of the student union manage recovery from sexual assault or violence.
Continued discussion on the policy will occur throughout the year in the form of focus groups, forums for survivors, and another open forum.
“The hope is to continue consultations throughout this semester and into next semester, once we get a baby draft,” said Spencer. “We’re still figuring out what that process is going to look like and it’ll largely be informed by what the students tell us.”

Case reveals institutional barriers to accountability for sexual violence at McGill
Content warning: sexual violence
Further information has emerged regarding the ongoing case of an Islamic Studies professor publicly accused of sexual violence. More students have spoken out condemning both his behaviour and the lack of a robust institutional response, as the situation feeds mounting criticism of McGill’s sexual violence policy.
 
Allegations of abuse
Roughly a month ago, stickers began appearing in washrooms across campus, alleging sexual violence perpetrated by a certain professor in McGill’s Institute of Islamic Studies, whom they explicitly named. Noting that the professor is up for tenure this semester, the stickers urged students to send testimonies of abusive behaviour on the part of faculty and staff to zerotolerance@riseup.net. 
The professor in question agreed to make a statement to The Daily, on the condition that his name would not appear anywhere in our coverage. After consultation with affected parties, The Daily decided to comply with his request. In his statement, he called the allegations against him “categorically untrue,” adding, “I am deeply committed to doing my part to make every student feel safe in my classroom and on McGill’s campus.” He has not responded to further requests for comment from The Daily. 
This professor, whose behaviour was described as “predatory” by a former student in a statement to The Daily, was the subject of an open letter sent to Robert Wisnovsky, Director of the Institute of Islamic Studies, during the Winter 2017 semester. Written by the 2016-2017 executive team of the World Islamic and Middle East Studies Student Association (WIMESSA), the letter was signed by roughly 50 other students at the Institute. It accused the Institute of failing to take the situation seriously, stating that the professor had repeatedly “violated [the] student-professor contract” through his abusive behaviour.
“It is disconcerting that such an abuse of power appears to be going unreprimanded,” read the open letter. “As it stands, women are at a disadvantage within the Islamic Studies department, and this inequality needs to be corrected. For these reasons, WIMESSA vehemently encourages the impending tenure committee to deny [the professor] tenure.”
 
Institutional barriers to accountability
Following an article published in The Daily on October 2, which reported the above facts, this year’s WIMESSA executive team posted a statement on Facebook. While refraining from naming the professor concerned, they expressed solidarity with their constituents, and frustration at the institutional barriers which effectively shield the professor from public scrutiny.
“We have taken steps to consult former executives, speak with legal experts, and meet with Institute administrators to discuss what actions we can take as students and student representatives to help address this ongoing situation,” read WIMESSA’s statement. “What we have been consistently met with, however, is nondisclosure agreements and red tape.”
The statement also claimed that consent training had been provided for the Institute’s faculty in September. However, when The Daily tried to find out more, we drew a blank: Wisnovsky did not respond to requests for more information, and the McGill administration was unable to provide details, or even confirm that such training occurred. Isabelle Oke, VP University Affairs of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), said that she hadn’t been informed of the training either, and that such a thing would be highly unusual within the McGill context.
“This situation is definitely an anomaly,” Oke told The Daily. “There aren’t any other faculties that I know of that have this training, and if ever a faculty is offered a training workshop it is voluntary.”
The Daily spoke with the WIMESSA executive team to clarify the situation, but they too proved unable to provide further details. In essence, it emerged that an administrator had suggested to the executives that consent training would occur at some point in August or September, without letting them know whether the training would be mandatory, who would facilitate it, what material it would cover, and when exactly it would occur. At the time of publication, The Daily has not received clarification from Wisnovsky or from any other departmental administrator on any of these points.
In addition to an acute lack of concrete information from administrators, WIMESSA has been fraught with internal controversy. It recently emerged that the President of WIMESSA is employed as a Research Assistant by the professor accused of sexual violence. Furthermore, the President failed to disclose this conflict of interest to most of her fellow executives (except the VP Internal); indeed, they were unaware of it until The Daily contacted the executive team on October 11 to inquire about this matter. Since then, she has removed herself from all meetings and discussions regarding the professor concerned, though she retains her role on the executive team. The professor in question did not reply to an email from The Daily asking whether or not he had been aware of the WIMESSA President’s position on the executive before offering her a job. The President herself also declined to comment on the record.
Roughly two weeks ago, meanwhile, as the Institute reeled from the impact of the allegations on its community, WIMESSA’s former VP Finance Sarah Shamy resigned from her position. In an interview with The Daily, Shamy explained that her resignation had been largely a product of frustration over the handling of this professor’s behaviour, both by the rest of the WIMESSA executive and by the Institute.
“I believe the administration’s refusal to address the issue directly and their lack of transparency has inspired fear among the [WIMESSA executives],” she said. “The way they see it is […] ‘if upper administration, people whose main duty and responsibility is to address students’ concerns, aren’t engaging in any thorough and effective actions, then why does the burden fall on us?’”
Regarding the Institute’s actions, Shamy was sharply critical.
“The Institute will only care insofar as their reputation is at stake,” she said. “As far as I know, in past years […] the Institute did not respond appropriately [to complaints about the professor in question]. I would not even be able to characterize their efforts as minimal or ineffective because that would imply the presence of efforts when there are none. A few years ago, what we had was a professor who used his position of power in order to perpetuate abusive behaviour. Today, we still have the same professor who uses his position of power in order to perpetuate abusive behaviour. That is all that needs to be known.” 
One factor in this perceived inaction on the part of McGill and the Institute is that the professor concerned has never been the subject of a formal complaint lodged through the University’s Office for Sexual Violence Response, Support, and Education. He has, however, reportedly been the subject of allegations brought to Institute administrators by at least one student.
Given that the professor concerned will be considered for tenure this semester, The Daily reached out to McGill’s administration to find out how students can participate in the tenure process. According to Angela Campbell, Deputy Provost (Policies, Procedures, and Equity), “student input usually finds its way into the tenure dossier through teaching/course evaluations, which are included as part of the teaching portfolio.” Disciplinary actions taken against a given professor are also included in their tenure dossier, but “disciplinary investigations and sanctions are only possible through reports of misconduct which, by definition, cannot be anonymous.”
In short, there is no way for students’ allegations of sexual violence to be included in a professor’s tenure dossier if they remain anonymous. This serves as a deterrent for many, who opt to remain silent rather than face potential reprisals should they put their names to accusations of abuse.
 
A long-term problem
In the course of The Daily’s investigation into this situation, in addition to receiving first-hand accounts of the professor’s predatory behaviour, we also heard from several students who were unsurprised by the public allegations against him.
“I have known about [these allegations] for years and have managed to avoid taking a course with [the professor concerned], but most students do not have this information,” said Chantelle Schultz, a U3 WIMES and East Asian Studies student and former editor at The Daily. “The University has kept it from them, despite efforts from WIMESSA executives and students. Is this professor’s reputation and career more important to the administration than the safety of the young women who have made complaints? The fact that our university still has no policy stopping professors from having relationships with their students is not an accident – the administration is well aware of this problem, and its silence keeps the University from being responsible.”
Indeed, McGill’s recently created Sexual Violence Policy does not address professor-student relationships specifically; a student could use it to file a complaint of sexual violence against a professor should they wish to, but it does not define student-professor relationships as inherently non-consensual due to the inevitable imbalance of power between the two parties involved. McGill’s Conflict of Interest Policy does recognize such relationships as constituting a conflict of interest, but it doesn’t acknowledge them as non-consensual and harmful, or set out any meaningful consequences for professors who engage in them.
Niyousha Bastani, a former WIMESSA executive and editor at The Daily, explained that students within the Institute had been speaking out about this particular professor for years.
“To my knowledge, WIMESSA executives were raising these concerns with the department as far back as the fall semester of 2015,” she said. “The University didn’t call for a meeting with WIMES students to address our very real concerns about safety until the very last day of exams in the April 2017. […] They gave us four days notice for that meeting, scheduled it on the last day of exams by which date many students had already left the city, and even though it had taken them at least two years to respond, the Dean of Students did not even make the effort to be present in person and skyped in. The meeting was held off the records, […] but I can say that we as students were offered no recourse, only countless reminders that what the University can do is limited by the law and that formal processes are available to us.”
The meeting in question was advertised to all students within the Institute, and led by Campbell. She reportedly refrained from referring to the professor involved or specifics of his case, only citing McGill policy in general terms.
“How are WIMES students supposed to trust the University when they are constantly pushed to secrecy, repeatedly reminded that naming the accused professor can be libelous?” continued Bastani. “When they can only look out for each other through informal channels, quietly passing around letters or petitions to collect signatures? The University has not used its institutional power to protect its students, instead, it has shamelessly chosen to protect its reputation by sweeping their concerns under the rug for over two years.”
 
Moving forward
According to the current WIMESSA executive team, their main goal for the moment is to organize an event at which students from the Institute will be able to voice their concerns in an open and honest dialogue with administrators. Such an event would stand in contrast to the April 2017 meeting with Angela Campbell, which left students feeling frustrated and silenced.
“Basically we’re planning an open forum […] where students can directly communicate their thoughts to the administration,” said a member of the executive, “because from what we’ve seen, people have been voicing those concerns and there hasn’t been a response from the institution. […] So that people know that the department knows how they feel in a direct way, and so students can get out their frustrations. […] This has just been something that students coming into the department eventually hear about – rumours and that kind of thing. We’d like it to become more of an open discussion rather than an open secret, and to involve the department in that discussion as well.”
The Daily also reached out to Zero Tolerance, the anonymous group of students carrying out the stickering campaign which drew public awareness to this situation. According to the email we received in reply, Zero Tolerance is run by students from outside the WIMES program who wish to “stand in solidarity with [their] peers in the Institute.”
“For over two years, students in the Islamic Studies department (primarily women of colour) have been trying to get McGill’s administration to hold [this professor] accountable for his unacceptable behaviour toward his students,” wrote Zero Tolerance. “Their concerns were [minimized] and deemed insufficient by the McGill administration. […] Therefore, we at Zero Tolerance decided it was time for us to take on this labour […] by using stickers and other direct action tactics to inform the student population of his behaviour in order for his female-presenting students to be able to protect themselves. […] We are calling on students to raise their concerns with [this professor] to the head of Islamic Studies Robert Wisnovsky, and the Dean of Arts, Antonia Maioni by email, phone, and in person.”
In their email to The Daily, Zero Tolerance confirmed that they have received several student testimonies of abusive behaviour from faculty since beginning their campaign. They did not reveal whether they have plans to escalate their campaign by using more direct action tactics, but they included an uncompromising message for all McGill professors who engage in predatory behaviour towards their students: “We know your names. We are coming for you.”
Editor’s note: The above article was amended on October 27 to redact the name of the President of WIMESSA in accordance with her wishes, and to clarify that she notified the VP Internal of her conflict of interest, as well as choosing to remove herself from all discussions relating to the Professor for whom she works.

Student littering disrupts residents
Milton-Parc, the neighbourhood located adjacent to McGill’s downtown campus, encompasses the area between Sherbrooke and Pins (north/south) and University to St Laurent (west/east). Often referred to as the “McGill Ghetto,” the neighbourhood was inhabited by an estimated 1,500 McGill students in 2010, and continues to be occupied by students, who reside in the community as temporary residents. While most inhabitants of Milton-Parc are permanent residents, many of its historical locales have been dominated by student associations and groups, such as fraternity and sorority houses.
These student associations, along with the plethora of individual student inhabitants, produce a problematic amount of waste in the Milton-Parc area. The community has struggled with waste management largely because of student negligence for years, especially during move-out seasons. Permanent residents have expressed criticism over the poor handling of unwanted furniture and garbage, littered in disorganized piles on the streets. The issue is caused, in part, by students unaware of community regulations such as waste pick-up times, and apathetic about proper waste management the community.
The Student’s Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Milton-Parc Citizens Community (MPCC), and the Dean of Students Office of McGill University have had an agreement on acquiring and enacting “good neighbour” practices since 2009. This pact, titled the CARE(Community Action and Relations Endeavours) agreement, details various activities and programs intended to improve the relationship between permanent residents and students.
SSMU VP External Connor Spencer explained to The Daily, “There are two big ways that [respect] impacts [Milton-Parc]. It’s the relations between the community and the students during frosh and other large-scale events, and it’s the respect when it comes to waste disposal. Those have been the two main concerns of the community when it comes to living next to a large student community.”
Hélène Brisson, a Vice President of the MPCC, commented on how this lack of respect for proper waste disposal affects the quality of life in the community, such as “the physical safety of those who walk in them,” and “the public health issues raised by garbage left for days in streets.”
Brisson mentioned how student “indifference to the cleanliness of streets” causes a strain the relationship between students and permanent residents, “generally speaking, the neighbours [permanent residents], shed the most unflattering light on how some students can be unpleasant neighbours,” said Brisson.
“Generally speaking, the neighbours [permanent residents], shed the most unflattering light on how some students can be unpleasant neighbours,” said Brisson.
Littering in the streets of Milton-Parc is a recurring problem for the community, especially during move-in and move-out seasons.
Tristan Best, a fourth year student at the Schulich School of Music, told The Daily, “there’s often broken glass all over the sidewalks, along with broken furniture and rotting garbage that gets in the way while walking and smells quite unpleasant. Students are living here only temporarily, but create enough of a mess to disrupt the lives of the residents of the Milton-Parc area. It’s extremely disrespectful, unsanitary, and reflects poorly on the University.”
Best mentioned that like many students, he “do[es] not know the schedule [for waste collection],” so “the superintendent of [his] apartment takes care of [the] trash.” Best believes that the lack of knowledge and action in the trash collection systems may be addressed with an intervention by SSMU, and that a “campaign to make the garbage collection schedules better known, and to make students aware of proper places to dispose of waste” would be beneficial.
“Students are living here only temporarily, but create enough of a mess to disrupt the lives of the residents of the Milton-Parc area. It’s extremely disrespectful, unsanitary, and reflects poorly on the university.”
SSMU’s Community Affairs Committee is responsible for addressing such issues as part of the VP External portfolio. Currently, SSMU VP External Connor Spencer and the Community Affairs Commissioner Julien Tremblay-Gravel are working on creating a large-scale waste management campaign. Spencer has engaged in conversations with Alex Norris, city councillor for Jeanne-Mance (the municipal district containing Milton-Parc), about getting more bins for the community, but he has yet to confirm any action.
The campaign has two parts, education and refurbishment, both designed to reduce student waste. The first part will focus on educating the students living in the Milton-Parc community about the specifics of waste collection by giving them hard-copy schedules of their building’s collection days and times in English, a service currently not offered by the city of Montreal. The second part is a larger refurbishment program.
This specific program involves collecting unwanted houseware items during the move out period in late April, and reselling them in the fall. The first part of the campaign, designed to educate students on proper waste disposal, is expected to be made public by the end of October. The refurbishment program will likely begin marketing in the winter, in time for the move-out season in spring.
Community Affairs Commissioner Julien Tremblay-Gravel explained over an email statement that “[SSMU hopes these initiatives] will reduce the large amounts of waste that are observed during that peak period of the academic year, increase waste diversion from landfill as well as provide students with a more sustainable and affordable option from which to source the household items when they arrive at McGill.”
Tremblay-Gerard elaborated on the importance of the initiatives, and their effect on the community, “I have lived in Milton-Parc for three of the five years I have been at McGill and have found it to be an extraordinarily vibrant community. I hope that these programs will decrease the negative footprint that is attributable to a minority of students in Milton-Parc and help demonstrate that students in general can be a force for good and behave as responsible citizens. ”
Brisson added, “My view is that garbage disposal, recycling, etc. is an issue that concerns all who live in Milton-Parc. […] We must work together.”

Robyn Maynard explores anti-Blackness and state violence
This week, critically acclaimed writer and activist Robyn Maynard launched her debut novel, Policing Black Lives: State Violence in Canada from Slavery to the Present. The spirited book launch, hosted at the Grand Bibliotheque, opened with a poem written and performed by Black poet and activist Shanice Nicole. The 600 people attending then listened intently to the speech delivered by Maynard, and the following Q&A session where she discussed the details and nuances of her work.
Robyn Maynard, a Black, Montreal-based feminist and Black-rights activist, has spent the past decade working in frontline harm-reduction outreach work, along with administering training sessions for health and social service providers on the harms created as a result of institutionalized racism. Her interest lies in racist and state-based violence, which she has been carefully documenting and reporting.
“The criminalization of Black people’s lives has always been a major part of policing in Canada,” she explains. “Policing has always been extremely racialized.” In her book, Maynard also discusses how anti-Blackness manifests across different institutions. “Today anti-Blackness, the surveillance and punishment of Black people of all ages and genders, is embedded within all major institutions.”
Maynard describes Policing Black Lives as “unapologetically intersectional,” critically investigating how we decontextualize anti-Blackness and disconnect it from the network of factors which impact its manifestation. She insists that we look beyond anti-Blackness itself, at how it’s experienced differently by different Black people depending on gender, class, ability, and other overlapping factors of identity. She says that these components are often not taken into account and are not part of the narrative, hindering our ability to fully understand how individuals experience racism.
Maynard explains what this lack of context means for her: “Being a young Black girl in Canada meant, for me, learning no context about the harms that have been enacted since time immemorial on people who look like me, nor the important role that the government had played in this.” She goes on to say, “I was given no historical context that would help me understand what I was experiencing, nor to realize how many tough, subversive Black women before me had stood up to racism over the past 400 years.”
In her 40-minute speech, Maynard addresses this deliberate erasure of the history of anti-Blackness. “How do we fight a problem that is widely believed not to exist?” She demonstrates how Black people are working and living in a climate that invalidates their experiences in Canadian society, presenting anti-Blackness as a problem that is foreign to Canada.
“We’re educated within universities, and in our pop culture, to learn about racism through an American lens. There is a distinct impression that Canada will be a more welcoming place for immigrants, that Canada, unlike the U.S., is a welcoming haven from Black terror. However, this is untrue. There are institutions of formal and informal anti-Blackness.”
Maynard’s book details the implicit anti-Blackness in our governmental and societal framework, drawing attention to the manipulation of the education system and the absence of Black people’s narratives and histories. “There was no mention of the fact that slavery was practiced here for over 200 years. In fact, there was no acknowledgement that Black people had ever existed in Canada.”
The lack of acknowledgement of both the struggles that Black people faced in Canada due to slavery and racism, as well as the ongoing state violence, is what drove Maynard to finally draw attention to the problem.
She asserts that anti-Blackness is foundational to state violence: the rate at which Black people are incarcerated, which is three times higher than white people, demonstrates the fundamental, inherent anti-Blackness present in policing.
“Black women, since slavery, have been subject to intense violence and policing of their movements; policing was fundamentally made for Black people.”
She says that this broad dehumanization shows us the nature of anti-Black violence and the different ways that it manifests, from state-sanctioned surveillance, to disproportionate incarceration, to criminalization and racial-profiling.
“There is this idea of crime being attached to certain people: Black criminality. It’s a racialized conception of who is a risk and who isn’t, allowing these ongoing horrors that continue to permeate Black people’s lives in Canada.”
Policing Black Lives is now available for purchase online, in paperback or digital format. Visit Fernwood Publishing or Robyn Maynard’s website to find out more.

SSMU compiles list of far-right groups in Montreal to watch for on campus
Content warning: white supremacy, racism, colonialism.
Early last week, white supremacist posters were put up around Milton Parc on behalf of a group called “Generation Identity.” The posters advertise a book called “Canada in Decay,” encouraging anti-immigration sentiments. The subtitle of the book references the “ethnocide of Euro-Canadians.” Similar posters were found in Milton Parc and on campus in September. These earlier posters also advertised Generation Identity and featured the slogan, “defend your freedom,” in the context of multiculturalism.
Generation Identity is a group that started in France in 2002 and began organizing in Canada in 2014. They claim that ethnically European Canadians are “losing their identity” to immigration and diversity. On their Facebook page, they write, “Canada is a nation of conquerors and colonizers. […] We refuse to spit on the names of our ancestors and those who sacrificed everything to build this beautiful country only to protect the decaying ideals of political correctness and ‘diversity.’”
In an interview with The Daily, the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP External, Connor Spencer, discussed why the dissemination of these posters has been isolated to the area around McGill. Spencer stressed that while it is unlikely that these posters were put up by students, they are clearly meant to recruit the McGill population. Moreover, the posters haven’t been posted on Concordia’s campus, which implicitly reveals that the McGill campus was perceived as more tolerant to white supremacist ideals. This exposes flaws in the way in which McGill has addressed white supremacist organizing in Montreal.
She argued, “There aren’t really widespread tools or conversation platforms about these kind of ideologies being on our campus and around our campus. So I think one of the first things that we have to do is include ourselves in the conversation,” said Spencer. “Concordia is much farther ahead than we are in talking about the alt-right as it happens in Montreal. […] They have workshops, they have info-sessions, they have a much more active and mobilized network and they have student groups that are specifically about addressing that, which we don’t really have, or at least we don’t have visibly. […] McGill students are talking about it, but not at a platformed level.”
In response to this lack of visibility, Spencer is organizing workshops in collaboration with the “Grande manifestation contre la haine et le racisme,” an anti-racist demonstration taking place on November 12. These workshops will focus on identifying the language of white supremacists, and discussing ways to combat the spread of their movements.
“There’s an alt-right toolbox, and you don’t necessarily need to be an alt-right group to use alt-right tools,” said Spencer. “I think that’s why it’s really important that we have those spaces where we can discuss that and teach each other what those tools are so that we can identify them, because things are a lot less scary when you can identify when someone is […] reworking arguments or using certain ways of coming at topics to confuse people or make them feel like they’re crazy.”
Spencer also stressed the connection between white supremacist groups in Montreal and the recent passing of Bill 62, which denies public services to women who cover their faces. This law proports to further “religious neutrality,” while targeting Muslim women who wear niqabs and burqas.
“There’s a lot of under-stirrings of the very Quebec mentality [that] neutrality is [synonymous with] white Christian, […] or white Catholic,” said Spencer. “The underlying racism within that sentiment is getting stirred all back up again with Bill 62.”
“Those kinds of sentiments that we see get reoccurred, they’re always hashed out by legislation,” she continued, “It’s not that police are going to go onto buses and force every woman to unveil, but now it’s going to empower citizens to feel like they are able to confront women who wear veils on public transportation, […] that they have that within their right, and that’s what’s terrifying.”
In response to this recent mobilization of white supremacist groups on both the local and provincial levels, Spencer is working with Matthew Savage, a SSMU Councilor from the Faculty of Social Work, to condemn harmful groups and ensure that they don’t have a platform on campus.
“The councilors gave me a mandate to bring this conversation up again and to prepare a list of the kind of alt-right, far-right groups that are active in the Montreal area to this council, which is tonight, and that’s exciting because hopefully we can actually address some of this,” said Spencer.
In an interview with The Daily, Savage raised concerns about these groups’ use of vague language, such as ethno-state, which allows them to disseminate dangerous ideas under the guise of free speech.
“Anyone that says they believe in an ethno-state shouldn’t have the power to assemble,” said Savage. “Just because you’re giving hate speech politely, still makes it hate speech. When you use terms like ‘ethnocide’ or we want to ‘peacefully assemble to create an ethno-state’, what are you saying with that? You’re saying that anyone that isn’t of European descent has less claims to the land than you. […] And then when you do achieve the power, what happens to people that have lived here for generations? What do you do with them then? Where does that question lead? You have two choices: you’re either going to have to force people out or you’re going to have to do something worse. Either way you’re using violence and just because you’re saying it politely doesn’t make it non-violent.”
Spencer and Savage are compiling a list of white supremacist groups that are active in Montreal. The list includes groups such as La Meute, Quebec’s largest white supremacist group, and Atalante, a group that “advocates openly for a ‘renaissance of the neo-French in Quebec,’” according to a January 2017 article in the CBC.
As of now, SSMU’s plan is to openly condemn these groups, making it difficult for them to assemble on campus. “If something isn’t said in policies, or in student conduct, or in any of those contracts between the faculty and students,” said Savage. “Then you can find a way in, and that’s why I really want to close these gaps.”
