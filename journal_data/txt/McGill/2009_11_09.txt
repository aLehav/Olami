Expected changes include transportation and transparency
The past weeks have been tumultuous for Montreal politics, as charges of corruption inundated the Tremblay administration and Vision Montréal, its traditional competition, on the eve of the election. Though Tremblay will soon begin his third term as mayor, and his party, Union Montréal, won key positions throughout the City, the up-and-coming third party Projet Montréal saw a considerable growth in popularity.
Headed by Richard Bergeron and espousing a policy of “sustainable urbanism,” Projet Montréal increased their share of the vote for mayor from 8.5 per cent in 2005 to over 25 per cent this year. On City Council, its presence increased from one to 10 seats, while it gained four additional borough council positions.
When asked about Projet Montréal’s electoral gains, Militza Jean, political attaché of Bergeron, felt there were many reasons her party did well. “Projet Montréal seems to be more in touch; it is the party of the future,” she said.
Jean also noted  that recent corruption scandals within Union and Vision may have played in improving her party’s popularity, as well as some practical measures it took to remain accountable – which included the high profile involvement of the Honourable Justice John Gomery, who headed an investigation into Quebec’s sponsorship scandal in the nineties.
“Along with Gomery, [the chair] of fundraising, we put in place five principles regarding funding. We were different from the others because we financed through the people,” Jean said.
Though the party gained seats in six of Montreal’s boroughs, its biggest sweep was in Plateau-Mont Royal, where it held two incumbent positions and wrested the five remaining ones from ruling Union.
A popular component of Projet Montréal’s platform was a push toward more sustainable transportation. In early 2007, founder and party leader Bergeron, who holds a doctorate in planning from Université de Montréal, unveiled an ambitious plan to introduce a wide-reaching system of tramways across the island.
Alex Norris, a recently elected city councillor from the Mile-End, said that while elected officials could not discuss specific plans until they were sworn in, transportation would be a likely priority.
“We have a mandate to clamp down on traffic in residential areas and will be more aggressive than previous administrations. More than 80 per cent of cars in the Plateau are just passing through and don’t stop, using our main commercial streets as freeways,” Norris said.
He cited small and concrete steps his party hoped to take, such as installing stop signs on some streets, which the previous administration resisted until “citizens finally put their foot down,” according to Norris.
Norris also spoke about his party’s goal of creating a more transparent administration. “The previous administration had, for example, eliminated the televised proceedings of the council online. That is something we want to restore very quickly. As a grassroots party, we have to be true to our principles in a way that isn’t costly,” he said.
Devin Alfaro, former SSMU VP External and current Projet Montréal volunteer, who also sits in the Borough Coordinating Committee Association, said other planned actions include “pedestrianizing streets, creating more walkable public spaces, and reducing the amount of traffic” around the Plateau.
But Alfaro also pointed out that despite the increased presence of the party in City Council, “The powers of the borough are very limited, so the scale of action will be very local.”

Off-Campus Eye
Roughly 280,000 cars drive through the Turcot Interchange every day. Built in 1967, the interchange has been crumbling for several years, and in 2007 the City announced that it would be reconstructed. Dozens of groups in the adjacent community of St. Henri have voiced their opposition to the plan currently supported by the Ministère des Transport du Québec (MTQ), which would increase the interchange’s traffic capacity by 18 per cent, and require the demolition of about 200 neighbouring houses. Ministère du Développement Durable, de l’Environnement et des Parcs is expected to announce his recommendations on the project later this week.

Students lobby for votes, hope to reach quorum
Voting for SSMU’s fall referendum will run from November 6 to 12, and is now open online and at polling stations around campus. The “Yes” committees for the three referenda questions presented their arguments to a room full of First Year Council hopefuls and student press Friday in the Shatner building.
Speaking first was Jonathan Glencross, U3 Environment, on behalf of the Sustainable Projects Fund. If passed, the fund will provide the University with a large sum of money to distribute to projects aimed at making McGill more sustainable, especially, Glencross said, at culture-changing, behaviour-changing projects.
The administration has committed approximately $1.3 million to the project, but only so long as the students vote to match these funds. The referendum will create a non-opt-outable 50-cent fee on every credit (capped at 15 credits per student), toward this goal.
Glencross left immediately after speaking, hurrying off to lobby other student groups to support the question.
“There are thousands of not currently engaged, but not necessarily apathetic, students at McGill who are literally gleaming when I talk to them in class – they’re so excited,” Glencross said. “Yet, in the past three months leading up to this, a lot of the people actively involved were very concerned about the student perception – how the money was going to be spent. Clearly, they’re not representative of the average student.”
The next speaker was SSMU President Ivan Neilson, who addressed the audience on behalf of VP Clubs and Services Sarah Olle, in support of the “Ambassador Fee,” a one-dollar opt-outable fee that would create a fund for groups to travel to academic and extra-curricular competitions.
“Trips are still able to happen, but they’re just not as accessible to all students because the cost is more, and we would like to [help out] with that,” Neilson said.
The final speakers were Kelly McMillan and Charles Gauthier, law students who help run the McGill Legal Information Clinic (MLIC). As per the Administration’s new policy, groups such as the MLIC, who have a Memorandum of Agreement with the University, have to go to referendum every five years to maintain their funding.
The speakers emphasized the legal information and advocacy services the MLIC has provided to students and members of the Montreal community since 1976, and that they are the only organization on campus providing legal assistance to students.
McMillan and Gauthier were frustrated by the time and energy running a referendum every five years has taken away from their work, but stated that this proces was a good opportunity for students to learn about and show their support for the service.
Neilson and Glencross both said that it is important for students to vote, as the 2008 fall referendum did not reach quorum.
The Daily’s referendum endorsements
Sustainable Projects Fund: Yes
This large fund for sustainable projects has been the result of months of planning and lobbying, and presents a real step for the McGill student body and administration. The fund will be overseen by a committee made up of equal parts students and administration appointees, and will decide which student or University proposals should receive money. The 50 cents levied per credit are no big thing, but can create big change (especially because the administration will be matching student contributions). Let’s get a whole bunch of YES votes tallied to show the administration that students really care about this issue.
Ambassador Fee: Yes, with reservations
This one-dollar opt-outable fee will enable a more active student life for those clubs that travel. Currently, these clubs do so largely without assistance, but this fee will enable them to lower their costs and make these trips more accessible. While we support this motion, we encourage transparency from the committee that will ultimately decide which groups will receive this funding.
MLIC Fee Renewal: Yes
The McGill Legal Information Clinic (MLIC) is an invaluable resource for students and members of the Montreal community – as well as a practical learning tool for students in McGill’s Law Faculty. The MLIC must now go to referendum, putting their funding up to a vote every five years, so an overwhelming yes vote would prove that students value these resources.

Montreal slowly catching up on sustainable design
The fight for Montreal’s environmental future has recently reached new heights, as various environmental groups in the city promote the installation of energy-efficient green and white roofs.
Green rooftops, or rooftop gardens, are becoming more and more popular in Montreal, while white rooftops, flat surfaces with a white polymeric membrane stretched across, are just starting to be introduced.
In spite of the trend, though, Tim Murphy, green projects coordinator for Santropol Roulant, said that the City could be doing a lot more to promote sustainable design.
“Montrealers are behind in rooftop gardening,” he said.
Murphy did, however, note the presence of community and collective gardens around Montreal, including a community garden in Milton-Parc, as evidence of their growing popularity. There are also rooftop gardens on the Maison de la culture and the library in Côte-des-Neiges, the Quebec RCMP Headquarters in St. Henri, and the McGill Life Sciences Complex.
The environmental benefits of such rooftops are hard to ignore.
“Green roofs reduce the amount of energy needed to cool down a building,” said Patrice Godin, the project manager for the Urban Ecology Centre’s (UEC) “Cool Island” Greening Project.
Murphy, who worked with McGill’s School of Architecture to develop the green space outside Burnside Hall this fall, also commended the efficiency of green roofs.
“They prevent storm water runoff and improve water filtration,” he said. “It also has psychological benefits. It’s soothing and relaxing, and it can help people escape.”
These rooftop gardens are a pricey escape, however: a green roof costs from 10 to 15 dollars more per square foot than a normal roof.
“The green roof is not without issues,” said Dennis Fortune, director of McGill’s Office of Sustainability. “You have to include maintenance in the operations. After a while, someone will have to maintain it.”
That person would be Eric Champagne, the horticultural supervisor for buildings, grounds, and special events in university services, and his staff.
“We have to pull the weeds out before they get too big, and the seeds are so lightweight, they fly on top of tall buildings and grow fast,” said Champagne. “This is on top of everything else we’re doing. We have all the grounds to take care of.”
Champagne did acknowledge that the first year of managing a rooftop garden is the hardest, and that maintenance responsibilities should decrease annually.
“We used [perennial] plants that don’t require much care, [and] once all the weeds are weeded out, it will be easier to maintain,” Champagne said.
The economic burden and time commitment of rooftop gardens has Fortune looking to white roofs as a cheaper, comparatively effective alternative. White rooftops can be constructed using white gravel, or by painting the rooftop with a special white primer.
By increasing the reflectivity of a roof, preventing excess heat from being trapped inside the building, they can lower the heat of urban centres and reduce a building’s use of air conditioning.  And by contrast to the steep price of a green roof, a white roof is only likely to cost two to three dollars more per square foot.
“It changes the microclimate of large buildings,” said Fortune. “They also make indoor occupants more comfortable. [They can help] people with breathing problems.”
McGill and the Office of Sustainability have already started testing white roofs on campus, installing white membranes on the roofs of the student residence at 3471 Peel and the Strathcona Music Building. A McGill report on the effect of the membrane showed that it could lower the heat of the building by 15 degrees Celsius. White roofs, however, also have their shortcomings, especially in comparison to rooftop gardens.
“Green roofs are more effective in terms of cooling down [a building] than white roofs, [but] they don’t have the same benefits in terms of water management,” said Godin.
At the centre of the roof question is the “heat island effect” – the occurance of warmer temperatures in urban landscapes compared to rural areas resulting from the retention of solar energy on constructed surfaces.
Last year, former McGill Engineering student Philip Sawoszczuk presented a report to the Office of Sustainability describing the heat island effect for McGill’s downtown and Macdonald campuses. The report showed that urban construction and waste heat could raise temperatures by almost six degrees Celsius in downtown Montreal. The report identified flat-roof membranes like the one on 3471 Peel as a means of reducing the temperature build-up on campus.
“We have to look at what’s best for this place,” said Fortune. “We’re looking at reducing the heat island effect on roofs and hard surfaces [like terraces]” at McGill.
Montreal’s municipal government doesn’t seem to be climbing on the rooftop ecology bandwagon, however, and local environmental groups like the UEC and Santropol Roulant are struggling to promote the new energy efficient solutions without government legislation and economic incentives.
“The City hasn’t done a whole lot to promote green and white roofs in terms of policies and economic incentives,” said Godin.
Godin cited legislation passed in Toronto as an example of how far behind Montreal is. According to Godin, newly constructed buildings in Toronto with more than 1,000 square metres of roof space have to set up a green roof on at least half the area. He also said that Toronto has created an economic incentive for developers to build green roofs, with the municipal government subsidizing five dollars per square foot for people who develop green roofs on their properties. Godin added that this however, is just one small contribution to creating an environmentally sustainable city.
“The green roof is one part of the global strategy to fight urban imbalance,” said Godin.
