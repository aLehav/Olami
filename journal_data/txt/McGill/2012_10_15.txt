Vice-Principal of Development and Alumni Relations (DAR) Marc Weinstein sat down with The Daily, Le Délit, and the McGill Tribune to discuss Campaign McGill, the University’s five-year, $750 million fundraising campaign set to wrap up this April. Issues discussed also included University financing more generally, as well as McGillLeaks, the anonymous website which leaked confidential donor profiles from the DAR office last March.
Weinstein emphasized the use of a donor-centric approach to fundraising during the campaign, which allowed donors to earmark their donations to specific departments, goals, or programs.
The $230 million raised and earmarked for student support – which can include anything from scholarships, fellowships, internships, and advising – represents the largest fundraising unit, according to Weinstein.
“It’s been our most successful piece of the puzzle to date,” he said.
DAR Director of Communications Derek Cassoff also noted that since the beginning of the campaign, 154 new scholarships, 94 new bursary programs, 118 fellowships, 77 new academic prizes, 24 new athletic awards, and 56 new internships awards have been created.
Total enrolment at McGill has gone up by 13.8 per cent since 2006, and some funding opportunities – such as the research grants available to undergraduate Arts students – have dried up or downsized in recent years.
The Daily asked whether, given these facts, student aid was more or less accessible in spite of Campaign McGill.
Weinstein pointed to figures which showed that philanthropic giving had helped minimize the gap between doctoral funding at McGill and other research-intensive Canadian universities, but admitted, “I don’t know if on the aggregate we are – I mean, I presume we’re making a difference […] but I don’t have those numbers.”
Weinstein also attempted to address concerns about the corporate influence at the University.
“There is a feeling, depending on who you talk to…that this is somehow corporatizing the University, and to set the record straight, corporate giving represents less than 15 per cent of our total raised to date.”
Le Délit asked whether or not donations made by prominent members of corporations were accounted for in this figure. Weinstein explained that they were not, and that only gifts made explicitly by corporations were recorded as corporate gifts.
“At the end of the day, it’s who writes the cheque, if we’re going to be really crass about it,” he said.
The Tribune asked how these numbers compared to other Canadian universities, and Weinstein replied that because universities do not record donations in a consistent manner, accurate comparisons could not be made.
However, he did say that “McGill is extremely strong on raising philanthropic dollars from individuals compared to some of our sister universities across Canada and especially in Quebec.”
Le Délit asked if McGill’s reliance on private donations made it more susceptible to economic downturns, and, while Weinstein did not directly address whether or not a reliance on philanthropy made McGill more financially vulnerable, he did note that the 2008 recession marked an important shift in the character of philanthropy at McGill.
“People are a lot less concerned about the long-term than the short-term now, so we’ve seen a shift in the donor community wanting to move away from endowment to more direct-funded programs,” he said.
Endowed money is not immediately spent, but is instead invested to create a steady income in perpetuity, paying out a limited amount every year while principal grows.
Director of Internal Relations Doug Sweet also noted that “an abnormally long period of time for low interest rates” had also adversely affected McGill’s endowment.
In the final minutes of the interview, Le Délit asked how McGillLeaks had affected Campaign McGill’s fundraising efforts.
Weinstein and Cassoff explained that the immediate priority of the office had been to relay information to donors – especially those who had sensitive information leaked – and that this had been a successful tactic.
“Well, we knew about it, and that it would get in the media the next day, and we said let’s get emails out to our donor community tonight, we don’t want anyone to have to pick up the newspaper in the morning…and hear about this and wonder,” said Cassoff. “I don’t think we lost a single penny of potential donations.”
The University threatened The Daily with legal action after it published an article on March 5 about McGillLeaks, which included a link to the now-defunct website.

Report emphasizes effects of housing prices, unemployment
Released earlier this month, the Foundation of Greater Montreal’s annual quality of life report, “Vital Signs,” found that economic inequality in Montreal has been steadily increasing.
Vital Signs is a “community check-up” that “measures the vitality of our communities, identifies major trends, and assigns grades in a range of areas critical to our quality of life,” according to its website.
According to the report, Montreal’s poverty rate based on after-tax income is about 14 per cent, a rate 5 per cent higher than the national average and 4 per cent higher than Toronto.
This escalating disparity is also reflected in the city’s housing trends. In the past two years, the average rent has increased from $643 to $708 per month, accompanied by a decrease in rental vacancies and the overall cleanliness and safety of housing conditions. The Régie du logement received 1,638 complaints about unsanitary housing conditions in the last five years.
Marina Boulos-Winton, President and CEO of the Foundation of Greater Montreal and a McGill graduate, attributed some of these housing issues to the aging population.
In an interview with The Daily, Boulos-Winton explained that the aging population has a greater demand for condominiums than rental apartments. As the population grows, the limited number of rental units becomes problematic.
She also attributed the complaints of unsanitary conditions to the age of the majority of rental buildings.
“Many rental buildings in Montreal are very old and are starting to show their wear and tear,” she said. “It is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain these buildings.”
According to a McGill Off-Campus Housing representative, much of the building damage in the Milton-Parc area is due to the nature of lease transfers, which often do not give landlords time to facilitate the necessary repairs between tenants.
The shifts in housing pricing and quality have hit those of lower socioeconomic status particularly hard, as reflected in Vital Signs’ focus on the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor in Montreal.
Suzanne Bourret, intervention coordinator at Montreal women’s shelter La rue des Femmes, told The Daily that there has been a significant increase in the use of shelter services as a result of increased rent pricing.
The recent rise in food prices has also led to a growing demand for La rue des Femmes’ food bank services.
“We are very worried about the situation in Montreal,” said Bourret. “We can see misery and despair in these women coming in to the shelter.”
Unemployment remains a major issue for non-Quebec residents.  According to Vital Signs, Quebecers with foreign surnames looking to work in Montreal face a discrimination rate of 35 per cent, and one in three are excluded from the interview process.
“A candidate with a French surname and equal skills and competencies has at least a 60 per cent chance of being granted a job interview, compared to someone with an African, Arab, or Latin-American surname,” the report found.
Bourret noted that immigrants have been hit particularly hard. “When they come in from other countries, they are vulnerable,” she said. “They start with no money and look for work, but it’s hard to find appropriate work.”

Francophone television commercial a “major success”
Correction appended October 15, 2012.
As universities across the province continue to search for sources of additional funding, students from Quebec are increasingly becoming the target of university advertising campaigns.
Universities in Quebec receive their funding based on the number of enrolled students. McGill receives $2,421.90 per student, regardless of whether the student is a Quebec resident, a non-Quebec Canadian, or an international student. The remainder of the tuition goes to the government.
But for Quebec students, McGill receives an additional grant on top of the original $2,421.90.
According to McGill Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet, “After the government has clawed back some of the per-student grant for the Quebec loans and bursaries program, we get a bit less than $8,000 per undergrad, on average, plus Quebec tuition.”
“This is a very broad number that shouldn’t be considered exact,” he added.
The University spent $2.318 million on advertising between 2009 and 2010 and $2.322 million from 2010 to 2011, according to the Office of the Vice-Principal of Administration and Finance.
One of the University’s most significant advertising efforts was a thirty-second commercial that aired in the previous two years on primetime francophone television. Sweet described the initiative as a “major success.”
“[The commercial] cost us less than an average of $300 per spot, much of which was on prime-time shows such as Tout le monde en parle,” Sweet told The Daily. “This is remarkably good value for the money we spent, which was about $200,000 per year in the media buy, plus an average of a bit more than $40,000 per year in creative costs.”
Sweet added that as far as he could remember, the commercial was the first television ad McGill had run.
The Université de Montréal – the most prolific spender in Quebec – allocated roughly $3.9 million to its advertising budget from 2009 to 2010, according to the Ministry of Education.
Together, Quebec universities have spent approximately $80 million in the past five years, a 19 per cent increase, according to La Presse.
In March, Fédération étudiante universitaire du Quebec (FEUQ) President Martine Desjardins criticized promotional spending.
“It’s gotten out of hand,” she told La Presse in French. “Universities are fighting one another only to get more money from [the government].”
Determining a single number for McGill’s advertising costs is complicated. Every faculty at McGill conducts its own advertising, and the sum total is calculated by the Office of the Vice-Principal of Administration and Finance.
The advertising budget for 2011-2012 has not yet been released, but Sweet expects that it will be less than in previous years.
“Universities compete,” said Sweet. “They compete for the best students, the best professors, donors, and leaders. They need to be visible.”

Legitimacy of Arts and Science students’ votes questioned
The recent by-elections for an Arts representative to SSMU have been called into question following allegations that Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) bylaws were violated.
The by-elections occurred after former Arts representative Sean Phipps resigned from his post earlier this semester. AUS Council elected President Devon LaBuik as the interim representative to SSMU on September 19 by secret ballot.
The election results released last Wednesday showed that Claire Stewart-Kanigan won the by-election with 408 votes.
The election started on October 4, when ballots were released to Arts students by email. On October 6, the online ballot was released for students enrolled in Arts and Science, despite last year’s creation of a position on SSMU Council to represent students in Arts and Science.
Arts and Science representative to SSMU Victor Lam told The Daily, “Last year there was a constitution change, so Arts and Science students are no longer eligible to run for Arts representative to SSMU.”
“The thing about this year is that during this by-election, Arts and Science students could still nominate and vote for Arts reps to SSMU although technically they are not supposed to because in the spirit of who is represented at SSMU Council…after being elected by just Arts and Science students I am the dedicated Arts and Sci Rep,” said Lam.
According to Bachelor of Arts and Science Integrative Council (BASiC) VP External Kate Sheridan, the ability of Arts and Science students to vote was due to a loophole in the AUS by-elections.
Lam also referred to the fact that ballots for Arts and Science students were released after those of Arts students.
“When the ballot got sent out to all students, Arts students for some reason got the ballot earlier than Arts-Sci students did,” said Lam.
AUS President Devon LaBuik told The Daily that after going through the by-laws and noting these discrepancies, AUS sought to make sure Arts and Science students could vote for five or six days.
BASiC sent an email to Arts and Science students immediately after their ballots were sent that stated: “while you are entitled to vote, we want to reiterate that the winner of this election is not responsible for representing you at the SSMU Legislative Council sessions.”
LaBuik explained that the AUS constitution was not changed last year to reflect the new Arts and Science seat in council because of an oversight.
“We tried to change [the by-law] during the electoral period but our constitution explicitly states that we are not allowed to make changes during the electoral period. We tried to change it and it will take place immediately after these elections,” said LaBuik.
A motion to change the by-law that allows Arts and Science students to vote was passed by AUS Council on October 3, and will be enforced following this by-election.
“This will be the last Arts rep to SSMU that Arts and Science students will be able to vote for,” read the email sent by BASiC.
Lam said that the AUS Elections Chief Returning Officer (CRO) should have “[sent] out more information to actually inform everyone through the special listserv, saying that technically students are allowed to vote but in the spirit of having created an [Arts and Science Rep] last semester through the SSMU referendum, Arts and Science students should not be voting in this election,” said Lam.
However, LaBuik told The Daily that it “was absolutely not the fault of our CRO. She was carrying out what was stipulated.”
Lam told The Daily that he is currently trying to invalidate the votes by Arts and Science students.
“Right now I’m drafting an email to ask Elections AUS to ask whether it would be possible to invalidate the Arts and Sciences votes, but I’m not entirely sure if it is allowed in the constitution or in the bylaws,” said Lam.
Lam also said he is considering the possibility of filing a Judicial Board case to invalidate the votes.

Provost portfolio to remain largely unchanged following consultation
Correction appended October 16, 2012.
The search is on for Morton Mendelson’s replacement, as the newly minted advisory committee charged with the task meets for the second time today.
The term of the current Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) ends in August 2013, and a recently created committee chaired by Provost Anthony Masi will meet at least four times between now and mid-November.
Details of what the committee will actually discuss are bound by confidentiality.
Created in 2006, the position of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) is, by design, a liaison between students and administration.
As such, Mendelson has often been the target of student anger surrounding administrative decisions. Last February, Mendelson’s office was occupied for several days by students protesting the decision not to recognise the results of an existence referendum for QPIRG and campus-community radio station CKUT.
The occupation came weeks after a university-wide consultation process, which resulted in the leaders of 11 student associations signing a letter to Masi raising concerns about the size and scope of Mendelson’s portfolio.
According to a statement from Masi’s office, no major changes are being made to the portfolio, which currently oversees the Office of the Dean of Students, the Student Services Office, Enrolment Services, Food and Dining Services, Athletics and Recreation, University Residences, and the Office of International Education.
“Any minor changes would await the appointment of the new incumbent,” the statement read.
As per University Statutes, the new advisory committee is composed of three representatives from the Board of Governors, four from Senate, and two students. Of the four Senate representatives, three are professors.
Music Undergraduate Students’ Association (MUSA) VP External Katie Larson is one of the student representatives to the committee. She was a signatory to a document sent to Masi last year suggesting that changes be made to the Deputy Provost’s portfolio.
Larson’s name was put forward by SSMU VP University Affairs Haley Dinel, who said she chose Larson because of her familiarity with Mendelson’s office through activities like helping organize Frosh and as a MUSA executive.
The other student representative is Elizabeth Cawley, a PhD candidate in Psychiatry and the Member Services Officer at the Post-Graduate Students’ Society.
School of Nursing professor and committee representative Madeleine Buck said that the position requires a “balanced sensitivity to student issues,” and that any candidate must meet that criterion.
Buck added that because of the evolving nature of the position, the exact criteria are in flux.
Alex Popp, a special advisor to the committee from the McGill Association of Continuing Education Students, told The Daily that he values a candidate that is “open [and] wants communication.”
Asked if she would like to see the new hire come from within the University, Cawley said, “there’s something to be said for experience and a knowledge of McGill’s history, but whether or not that means they have to come from within, I don’t think so.”
The advisory committee’s suggestion will ultimately be subject to the approval of the Board of Governors.
In an email to The Daily, the Provost’s office said that it has hired a headhunting firm that will “[provide] the Committee with all the necessary information it will need to determine the best candidate for the position.”
An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to SSMU executive Haley Dinel as VP Internal, she is in fact VP University Affairs.

Society to hold series of roaming councils
Thursday’s SSMU Legislative Council meeting was held at  Macdonald Campus as part of the newly implemented “Roaming Council” initiative.
Developed in a joint executive meeting between SSMU and the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS), the Roaming Council initiative seeks to increase the visibility of SSMU and expose the councillors to the greater University community.
According to SSMU President Josh Redel, “The SSMU Legislative Council makes decisions on a regular basis that impact student life across the University, and I think it is a shame that we operate out of a single building.”
“By going to different places across campus, it allows councillors to gain perspective of other students at McGill and allows other students to…ask questions at Council in the comfort of a familiar environment,” he continued.
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser added, “We hope that this will encourage people who wouldn’t normally come to Council to pop in and see what their student government in action actually looks like.”
With the exception of in-camera, or confidential, sessions, SSMU Legislative Council meetings are opened to the members of the gallery.
Council’s trip to the Macdonald Campus was the first in the Roaming Council series.
“Since [MCSS] operates inside the same university as us and since many of their students partake in SSMU clubs and services and spend at least some time in their academic career at the downtown campus, I thought it would be great for the councillors to gain perspective of the challenges Mac students face,” said Redel.
“Future [Roaming Council] locations will include residences, faculty, student areas, and certain interesting venue across campus,” he added.
Council will not meet outside of the University.
MCSS VP Finance Nicolas Chatel-Launay concluded the Council meeting with a short presentation on the Macdonald Campus constituency. SSMU executives were also invited to tour the Macdonald Campus’s student spaces after the meeting.
“In terms of having relationships with SSMU, our goal is to work together when we tackle issues that affect both our memberships such as University-wide policies,” said Chatel-Launay. “We also organize some social events – including frosh events – in common, where both our members attend. Our goal is to make this sort of relationship a bit more efficient than it is right now.”
MCSS does not currently have any plans to attend the SSMU Legislative Council at the downtown campus.
Twenty-one councillors and Chatel-Launay attended the meeting, which included a presentation by SSMU Sustainability Coordinator David Gray-Donald.
Council was also joined by newly elected Arts Undergraduate Society representative Claire Stewart-Kanigan, Inter-Residence Council VP External Sarah Southey, and Medical Students’ Society Representative Pedram Mossallanejad.
The councillors voted on the “Motion Regarding Referendum Question Regarding Increase of the SSMU Base Fee Towards the McGill Student Emergency Response Team,” which passed with 21 approvals, two oppositions, and one abstention.
The first SSMU General Assembly of the academic year takes place today.
