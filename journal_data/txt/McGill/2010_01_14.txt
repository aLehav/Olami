McGill’s Associate Vice Principal of University Services Jim Nicell presented upcoming changes and renovations within the University’s five-year master plan to a packed McConnell auditorium Tuesday.
Nicell described the master plan – which was designed in 2001 – as the University’s long-term development strategy to “accommodate a carefully directed growth in enrolment.”
He emphasized the project’s flexibility throughout the presentation, stressing the need to keep the plan adaptable in order to address the interests of the McGill community.
“[The master plan] isn’t as simple as, ‘Here’s the plan; here’s where we’re doing for the next 30 years,’” Nicell said. “It must be flexible to the McGill community’s changing needs, priorities, and opportunities.”
He also stressed that the objective of long-term sustainability underlies every part of the implementation plan.
Nicell spent the bulk of the presentation detailing over a dozen of the plan’s impending projects, including renovations of Stewart Bio, the Bronfman Building, the Lyman Duff Building, the Otto Maass chemistry labs, and the mechanical engineering undergrad teaching lab.  He also discussed the University’s plans to build a bioengineering facility on the northwest corner of McTavish and Docteur Penfield, as well as to eliminate parking spaces on lower campus by May.
Daniel Herscovitch, U3 Civil Engineering, said that the plan seemed to represent the McGill community’s best interests. He was the most excited about the plan to make McTavish Street more of a student-exclusive domain.“I think [this] is the best project, especially for students,” Herscovitch said.
U3 Civil Engineering student Owen McGaughey, a member of the environmentalist civil engineering group Pre-Serve, said that the energy reduction clauses of the implementation plan were a step in the right direction.
“I think most staff and students are interested in seeing a more modern campus that…treads more lightly on the earth, and I think the master plan suits those desires well,” McGaughey said.
McGaughey added that he would be downloading the new master plan to look over it more closely and encouraged other students to do the same.

La Presse recently reported that the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) has spent $11.3 million since 2003 to clean up Montreal’s graffiti, which STM spokesperson Isabelle Tremblay has called “un fléau” (a scourge). But David Proulx, the founder of l’Association Graff-X, says Montreal graffiti is more complex.
   “I don’t think [graffiti] is a fléau – it is and it isn’t,” said Proulx. “It depends on what graffiti you are talking about. There is bombing art and talented art.” L’Association Graff-X seeks to give youth a creative outlet through graffiti workshops and a legal graffiti wall – which Proulx says is an important resource.  
   “The kids want to have walls, and the City keeps knocking down the walls to put up condos…. There is a fléau, but at the same time it’s an art in development – what can you do? Frankly, I think it’s kind of sad that people don’t realize that it would be best to stop doing vandalism and focus on murals,” Proulx said.

Liberal leader condemns Parliament’s prorogation and discusses coalition politics
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff spoke at Concordia on January 12 and fielded students’ questions on prorogation – as well as the tar sands, the war in Afghanistan, and the seal hunt – as part of a cross-Canada campus tour.
Ignatieff, speaking about Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s decision to prorogue Parliament, for the second time in two years, from December 30 until March 3.  Critics have viewed the move as an attempt to postpone a vote of no confidence and escape censure regarding recent political controversies.
A majority of Canadians, 53 per cent according to a Toronto Star-Angus Reid online poll, oppose prorogation.
Ignatieff expressed that Harper’s sudden decision is an affront to Canada’s democratic norms.
“Mr. Harper gambled on the cynicism of the Canadian public,” said Ignatieff. “He thought no one would care if he shut down Parliament. He gambled wrong…. In our idea of democracy, it is Parliament that’s sovereign, not the prime minister…. Any prime minister with respect for democracy must use [prorogation] in the most sparing way possible.”
Despite his criticism, Ignatieff has no power to remedy the present situation. Since Harper’s Conservatives retain more parliamentary seats than any other party, he is constitutionally authorized – with the consent of the governor general – to postpone the reopening of Parliament.
“This system works when the prime minister accepts that his power is constrained,” said Ignatieff.
In order to reverse prorogation, the Liberals would have to topple the government by forming a coalition with other parties.
However, after his ascension as the leader of the Liberal party last year, Ignatieff refused NDP leader Jack Layton’s proposal to form a coalition against the Conservatives. “What I felt missing was political legitimacy,” said Ignatieff, speaking on his decision.
According to Robert Tesolin, co-president of NDP Concordia, Ignatieff’s decision to support Harper’s government last year following his first prorogation of Parliament may have emboldened the prime minister to once again suspend it.
“To a certain extent, [Harper has] acted with impunity because he’s seen that it works. He thinks that his adversaries will let him get away with it,” Tesolin said.
However, Lawrence David, VP External of Concordia’s Political Science Student Association, supported Ignatieff’s decision to avoid forming a coalition with other parties. David argued that the creation of a coalition during the 2008- 2009 crisis would have formed a weak and unstable government due to its  necessary alliance with the Bloc Québécois – a party he felt would necessarily undermine the coalition’s agenda by rejecting anything contrary to a sovereingtist position.
“The Liberal party felt it was to their benefit to form a strong party on their own. By forming a coalition, they would empower lesser parties in the eyes of their constituents,” said David. “Their priority is to build a power base.”
As recent polls suggest a decline in popularity for the Conservatives, the question remains as to whether Ignatieff will be able to capitalize on popular discontent to rally support for his party.
David indicated that widespread outrage against prorogation offers “the perfect opportunity and launch-pad to do so.”
Certain students, however, remain pessimistic about the possibility for a revival of political interest in the Liberal Party. “They’ll be forced to tacitly or openly support the government,” said  Tesolin. “There’s no way they can come close to forming their own govern–ment…. [Ignatieff] is at the helm of a sinking ship.”

Arts Senator Nick Wolf criticizes SSMU, wants to choose his successor
SSMU lost two senators at the beginning of winter term, with the resignation of Arts Senator Nick Wolf in early December and Medicine Senator Hana Thomas in early January. Both senators resigned because they will not be able to allocate time to their positions, as Wolf is leaving McGill and Thomas will start a more demanding segment of her program.
Wolf’s resignation caused some controversy when he voiced concerns over SSMU Council’s absence of long-term goals and the inefficiency of its meetings in his resignation email.
Wolf’s criticism, addressed to SSMU VP University Affairs Rebecca Dooley, came as a surprise to the executive. “He never participated or voiced any of these concerns. It is very much the senator’s responsibility to bring concerns to the table,” Dooley said.
In his criticism, Wolf singled out the manner in which SSMU handled the controversial Choose Life event “Echoes of the Holocaust” held in November. Debate surrounding the event culminated in the suspension of the club’s status by SSMU, after the club proceeded to hold the event in spite of an earlier Council censure of its contents.
“Instead of fighting for the rights of the minority, which in this case was the Choose Life group, they fought to suppress a perfectly valid viewpoint,” Wolf wrote. “[Student councillors] were mocked on the floor of Senate by the administration for limiting free speech at McGill, and they were entirely correct.”
What has brought attention to his resignation, however, has been the way in which Wolf has tried to bypass official procedure – which involves a faculty call-out for applications and a caucus selection. Rather, the former senator has irked some of SSMU by trying to find his own replacement.
Wolf expressed concern for a conservative minority whose voice he felt has been silenced by radical political agendas at SSMU or AUS. “I wanted to find someone to give a slightly more conservative voice on AUS Council…. The current Arts Senators represent the centre and the far left,” he said.
The former senator also viewed the event as an opportunity to confront students with the current challenges the Senate is facing. “I hope my resignation is a wake-up call to how Senate was being run. I know other Senators agree with my statements, although they won’t say so publicly,” Wolf said.
However, such an interested selection, Dooley said, is explicitly discouraged among SSMU members. According to SSMU bylaws, when a senator resigns from their position, the seat is reallocated to the largest faculties in SSMU. Following a public application call-out, applicants are reviewed and recommended by faculty associations, and selected by the Senate caucus.
Dooley also said that although she took his points to heart, she is not worried about the resignation’s publicity. “It might spark some debate, which I think is a healthy thing. We represent all students: students with mainstream and less mainstream views,” Dooley said.

Religious Studies and Law professors invited to give expert testimony in Iowa, and likely in California
Two McGill faculty members may be called to testify as expert witnesses in a landmark California Supreme Court case that will determine whether California’s current prohibition on equal marriage is unconstitutional.
The case, which began last Monday,  will challenge Proposition 8, or the California Marriage Protection Act. The legislation reinstated a ban on equal marriage in the state when it was approved by 52.3 per cent of California voters in November 2008.
A plaintiff’s witness list includes Katherine Young, a professor in the McGill Faculty of Religious Studies, who “purports to be knowledgeable in comparative religion and on what universally constitutes marriage.” Paul Nathanson, a researcher in the same faculty, is also included on the list and is described as someone who “purports to be knowledgeable about religious attitudes toward Proposition 8.”
Both may be called to the stand to present academic testimony on the effects of legalizing equal marriage. But if history is any indication Young and Nathanson may not make it to the witness box.
The expertise of the two academics on equal marriage was called into question in 2007 when they testified with McGill law professor Margaret Somerville in the  Iowa district court case Varnum  v. Brien – which paved the way for equal marriage in the state.
Polk County Judge Robert Hanson rejected their testimonies because he found that neither Nathanson, Young, nor Somerville met the criteria for the admission of expert testimony.
In a written statement, Hanson pointed to their absence of expertise in sociology, child development, psychology, or psychiatry. “Though they may have expertise in certain areas, such expertise is insufficient to qualify Ms. Somerville, Dr. Young and Dr. Nathanson to answer the particular questions that they are asked.”
Hanson further explained that Young’s testimony was disallowed, since she claimed to “[pull] together factors from many academic disciplines, including sociological, economic, political and religious factors, though she does not profess expertise in these areas,” and Nathanson’s for failing to support his observations empirically. Somerville was also prevented from testifying on the grounds that she “eschews empirical research and methods of logical reasoning in favor of ‘moral intuition.’”
Hanson went on to state that “The views espoused by these individuals appear to be largely personal and not based on observations supported by scientific methodology or based on empirical research in any sense.”
Somerville admitted that as a specialist in the field of ethics, she did not have any expertise in the areas of child development and psychology when asked by the plaintiff’s lawyers.
“They asked me about all the things I didn’t have,” said Somerville. “It is perhaps unfortunate that it was so out of context, but I take it very seriously that you must be very truthful…. [They] set me up to get that answer, and that is good lawyering on their part and bad luck for me.”
However, from an academic’s tandpoint, Nathanson, Young, and Somerville are considered controversial within Canada. Young and Nathanson have been criticized for their methodology in their writings on misandry, where they argue that men are victimized by various forms of feminism and popular culture. In 2006, faculty at Toronto’s Ryerson University turned their backs on Somerville at a ceremony granting her an honorary doctorate in protest of her opposition to equal marriage.
Young declined to comment on her testimony in Varnum v. Brien and on her involvement in the California case.

Administrators scramble to provide compensation for closed dining hall
The Royal Victoria College (RVC) council is considering calling for a partial rent refund for their building’s residents, citing the prolonged renovations that have kept the hall’s cafeteria closed since the summer.
Director of Food and Hospitality Services Mathieu Laperle sent a letter on December 18 notifying residents that the cafeteria “[would] not be opened and fully operational in January as…originally anticipated.”  In the letter, Laperle expressed hope that the cafeteria will be open by the middle of this semester, but could not specify a date.
The council responded by sending an email survey asking RVC residents if they would sign a petition calling for rent reimbursement.  They also included a message claiming Food Services had broken a promise to have the building’s dining hall up and running by October 2009, expressing frustration with “the way the project has been managed, and the lack of information provided by Food Services prior to the…letter.”
One hundred seventy-eight individuals of a possible 266 – some leaving their names, others voting anonymously – have responded to the survey. All one hundred seventy-eight voted in favour of a petition.
The survey signals growing dissatisfaction among RVC residents over renovations that have lasted several months, slowed by bureaucracy, bargaining, and outdated infrastructure.
Susan Campbell, manager of McGill’s residence dining halls, pointed to the building’s plumbing as an early and unexpected hindrance to construction.
“All of the plumbing had to be changed, and [contractors] didn’t know that until they actually got in and started to tear things apart,” Campbell said.  She also noted problems with excavation and ventilation that appeared during construction. “They couldn’t predict these things when they were first looking at the project,” she said.
Campbell added that contractors seldom give clients firm completion dates.  “We had hoped [the cafeteria] would be ready for September, then October, then November…. It’s the contractors…. They can only [say] ‘This is what we’re hoping for.’”
Grab and go someplace else
When choosing residences in early 2009, students were unaware of the renovations or the possibility that the project could last through the fall semester.
Hélène Thorel, VP External of RVC council, was upset administrators did not communicate with students more effectively.
“Part of the reason that we pay such high rent is that we have a seven-day meal plan,” Thorel said, pointing to RVC as among the most expensive of McGill’s residences.
Incoming students were formally notified over the summer of the ongoing renovations.
Some of the building’s dons were unaware of the construction until their orientation at the end of the summer.
“You wouldn’t rent an apartment without a kitchen…. It’s kind of a fact of life now, but I’m still pretty upset about it,” said Kelly Stephens, an RVC don.
In lieu of an open cafeteria, Food Services granted RVC residents the freedom to spend all of their money at any McGill-managed cafeteria on campus. Typically, students must spend 85 per cent of their money at their home cafeteria, with the option to spend the remaining 15 per cent elsewhere.
A “grab and go” snack bar was also constructed in the building’s lobby. Students were able to purchase mainly cold and some hot food until the early afternoon. The snack bar was also open on weekends from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
This semester, Food Services extended the snack bar’s hours, and added a greater number of dishes.
Laperle sees this added flexibility as reasonable compensation for RVC residents and says it coincides with Food Services’s goal of increased variety for all students in residence.
“Our goal and our vision was…offering more and more options,” Laperle said.
Campbell agreed. “Once we realized it wasn’t going to be open in January, we knew we had to kick it up a few more notches,” she said.
Though it is a provisional measure, Campbell said she has received positive feedback regarding the snack bar and increased flexibility.
“If you were to take students…at the end of [this year and last year] and say which was the better experience…I think they’d be fairly close,” Campbell said.
Marlene Benavides, president of RVC council, said students appreciate the effort, but won’t be completely satisfied by anything short of a fully functional cafeteria.
“We’re extremely happy to see that the grab and go has been improved from last semester. But it’s still not a cafeteria,” Benavides said.  “I suppose the definition of ‘variety’ is based on personal opinion…. They don’t have to live here and eat these meals.”
Stephens also said that during finals last semester, many residents opted to skip dinner rather than travel to other cafeterias after the snack bar had closed.
Long term vision, short term problems
The problems extend beyond what Benavides and others see as a lack of variety. Students view the closed cafeteria as a detriment to the communal aspect of residence life that first-year students look forward to.
“Community building has been a much bigger challenge…. Last year, the cafeteria was a big meeting place,” Stephens said. “Because everyone’s constantly out of the building for meals [this year], it hasn’t come as easily.”
The slowed renovation process may be indicative of a vision for food services that is too broad to conform to neat timetables.
“We don’t want to have something similar [to] what is available [at other universities],” Laperle said.  “We’d like to create something different…. When you go to Douglas Hall you [should] feel there is something different…versus Bishop Mountain Hall, versus RVC, New Rez, and Carrefour Sherbrooke,” he added.
Still, some wish more discretion had been used in making a major decision at a time of significant changes for McGill residences.
“Among other things, the prolonged construction could be a result of them having to take on too much at once, with major construction in both Carrefour Sherbrooke and RVC, at the same time as dealing with all of the challenges of serious administrative changes,” Stephens said.
With colder temperatures and hot meals hard to come by, the call for rent reimbursement promises to be a persistent one.
“It’s getting darker and colder and [rent compensation] would make us feel a little bit better about the situation,” Benavides said.
