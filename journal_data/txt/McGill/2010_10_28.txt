Admin alleged to have lied to student groups about exclusivity contracts
Several dozen students gathered in Norman Bethune Square yesterday, chanting, “Student voice for student choice!” and, “Bullshit!” in protest of the Concordia administration’s impending signing of a renewed exclusive beverage contract with Pepsico.
“This [current] contract is ending,” explained rally organizer Cameron Stiff, “and there’s another contract on the desk of the VP Services to be signed. And we’re saying, ‘Don’t do this.’”
Roughly forty students staged a sit-in outside the office of food service contractor Hospitality Concordia as the protest wore on, after attempting to occupy the negotiation meetings and being locked out by Concordia security guards.
The student anger stems in part from the lack of consultation between the administration and students on the deal, which will affect all beverages sold in vending machines and cafeterias on campus. Marc Gauthier, Executive Director of Finance and Business Operations at Concordia, met with students from campus environmental groups over the summer to discuss the beverage contract.
According to Concordia student Alex Matak – who was not at the meeting but part of TAPThirst,   members of which were in attendance – Gauthier misled students. “He said there would be no negotiations until student representatives had met with Pepsi,” she said, calling his claim “an outright lie.” TAPThirst is a campus group that advocates against privatization. There have been no meetings between student representatives and Pepsico to date.
According to students, the deal also ignores the recommendations of Concordia’s own environmental advisory committee. “How can you plan to be a leader in sustainability if you put money above all other objectives?” said Laura Beach, a rally organizer who spoke at the protest. “And second, what is the use of an environmental advisory committee if you don’t listen to their advice?”
The committee had four primary recommendations: first, that any contract make Concordia bottled water-free; second, that the contract be open to competitive bidders; third, that negotiations be transparent and democratic and include student input; and fourth, that the contract not be exclusive.
Stiff explained that exclusive contracts with large companies are harmful not only to the student body, but also to local food services. “We want to give organic companies and local companies the option of selling their products here on campus,” she said. “And the way the contract is right now, they can’t do that.”
A handful of members from the fledgling Mobilization McGill, which has been active around the closing of the Architecture Café, attended the rally. Much like some of the student activism taking place at McGill, Concordia students are looking to confront the issue of food on campus on more than one level.
“This contract, this thing that they’re doing on Friday, is the tip of an iceberg,” said Matak. “It’s not like this is the only exclusivity contract that Concordia has. It’s probably not the only one they’re ever going to have. This year we’ve signed at least two exclusive contracts with ad companies at Concordia. We have an exclusive contract with Chartwell’s over all of our food. Tuition is being increased and more and more we’re seeing corporations granted exclusive rights over our space, our lives and our money.”
Dana Holtby, a student activist at McGill and a member of TAPThirst, who attended the protest, said Concordia’s food services policy has a lot in common with McGill’s. “We see the same kind of processes…especially with a lack of student consultation,” she said.
Holtby also accused administrations at both schools of behaving as if “the school’s bottom line comes before student needs.”

Guantánamo detainee faces stiff challenge to repatriation
After eight years of legal wrangling and delays, Omar Khadr’s military sentencing hearing is finally underway at Guantánamo Bay. On Monday, Khadr pleaded guilty on five charges – including murder, espionage, and supporting terrorism. A military panel of seven officers will conclude proceedings that have come under fire as both illegal and flawed.
Khadr, the first child soldier to be tried for war crimes since the Nuremburg trials after World War II, and the first terrorism suspect to be charged under an Obama-led military commission, has vehemently denied all accusations in the past. His reversal has been attributed to news of a plea bargain that would see him serve an eight-year sentence, and allow him to seek repatriation to Canada after one year.
Wayne Marston, NDP Human Rights critic and MP for the Ontario riding of Hamilton East–Stoney Creek, was hesitant to call the plea bargain an improvement in Khadr’s case.
 “It depends what you call progress. … He had two choices: eight years or life in prison. There was no third option. What would you have done?” said Marston, adding that in the U.S. plea bargains are used as a matter of expediency to keep the number of cases to a minimum.
According to Marston, Khadr’s admission of guilt could not be used to overlook the illegality of Khadr’s detention at Guantánamo Bay and of the military proceedings.
“When you take a plea bargain you have to acknowledge the facts of the plea bargain. You have a young man saying he is guilty, who may or may not be. But put all this discussion aside, and you come down to one thing. He was a child combatant protected under the Conventions on the Rights of [the] Child, and the Harper government failed drastically on this fact,” said Marston.
 According to Marston, Canada’s behaviour toward Khadr has not only cost him eight years of his life, it has also impacted the perception of Canada within the international community.
 “We just lost a seat at the United Nations. Do you mean to tell me that when the [UN] Secretary General asked Canada to repatriate Omar Khadr, and Canada refused, that that doesn’t have an impact on our seat at the UN?” asked Marston.
“The United Nations will look at how you support UN Resolutions and Conventions. We clearly weren’t abiding by them. … He is [a] Canadian citizen, and the government had an obligation to provide him with consular support, to protect his rights,” he added.
The U.S. State Department indicated this week that it would support a future request by Khadr to be returned to Canadian custody. The Canadian government has not acknowledged the existence of an agreement, or that negotiations are underway. A statement issued by Canadian Foreign Affairs minister Lawrence Cannon addressed the matter as one “between Mr. Khadr and the U.S. government.”
It has been widely reported, however, that Cannon and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are involved in negotiating an agreement that would see Khadr returned to Canada.
Sukenya Pillay of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association speculated on the existence of an agreement, insisting that the Canadian government ensure that any future transfer of Khadr be conducted smoothly.
“We expect that the Canadian government should do nothing to obstruct a smooth transfer. We have been saying all along that the Canadian government should repatriate him and they should not do anything to thwart that,” said Pillay.
“Moreover, they should do everything possible to rehabilitate him, and they should provide him with adequate remedy as the Supreme Court of Canada has said, for the breach of his Charter Rights,” she added. 
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled last year that the Canadian government was complicit in violating Khadr’s human rights under the Charter, and basic standards on the treatment of detained youth. Khadr was subject to abusive interrogation practices while detained at Guantanamo.
According to McGill Law Professor François Crepeau, if repatriated to Canada, Khadr and his lawyers could apply on these grounds to have the U.S. military court sentence reduced or overturned completely.
“It is difficult to make predictions, but since the U.S. Supreme Court and Canadian Supreme Court have said the military commissions are not appropriate for Omar Khadr…[he] and his lawyers may apply to have the whole proceeding quashed, arguing that he was tortured, detained as a child soldier, and should not have been treated as an adult,” said Crepeau.
Canadian public opinion may be the greatest obstacle to federal action on Khadr’s file. Recent media coverage has indicated a clear opposition to Khadr’s right to repatriation. 
Crepeau attributed the division to a number of factors: the Conservative belief that individuals are responsible for their actions abroad, the total confidence of some Canadians in the American judicial system, and the belief that Khadr and his family are not deserving of Canadian citizenship.
“It’s not really racism I think, but if the person were blonde, blue-eyed, and called Tremblay, the situation would be different,” commented Crepeau. “The fact that he is Omar Khadr means that he should not be called Canadian, and not only should we not be calling him Canadian, but that we could strip him of his citizenship. The fact that he was born here does not matter,” he added.

Province consolidates research money, faces criticism
The provincial government’s new strategy for research and innovation is facing intense criticism from certain members of the scientific research community, who fear that cost-cutting measures targeting research funding may debilitate scientific development in Quebec.
In its last budget in March, the government announced plans to merge its three existing research financing organizations – specializing in the fields of nature and technology, society and culture, and health – into a single new one called the Quebec Research Fund. Despite the criticism, the new plan has been acclaimed by parts of the entrepreneurial and scientific sectors.
A “chief scientist” will be appointed to oversee the new organization’s administration and serve as a spokesperson for scientific research in Quebec. The government intends to implement this restructuring by April 2011. The final outcome of the entire plan has yet to be determined as it first has to be passed by the National Assembly.
Mawana Pongo, the Director of Policies and Analysis for the Ministry of Economic Development, Innovation and Export Trade, explained that the government’s goal to reduce administrative costs was key to this restructuring.
“The decision [to combine existing funding agencies] into one organization was made in the context of the government’s efforts to achieve a budgetary equilibrium, so greater efficiency in terms of governmental administration,” Pongo told The Daily in French.
This decision is just one feature of Quebec’s strategy for research and innovation (SQRI) for 2010 to 2013, announced by the Ministry of Economic Development, Innovation and Export Trade in June. The Ministry based its decisions on the recommendations of a special consulting group. The group – consisting of about twenty specialists from various sectors, including universities and businesses – worked for almost a year to come up with strategies to update Quebec’s current research program.
The SQRI’s other major initiatives include supporting the marketing of innovations, providing more university scholarships, and launching five major developmental projects – including an electric bus – to stimulate research. The government intends to spend $1.039 billion for these projects.
The business community has welcomed the overall strategy’s emphasis on channelling innovation toward increasing industrial productivity.
“I think that for once, the government has understood that innovation is supposed to make us more productive than our competitors, and has created the necessary harmonization between innovation, marketing and the needs of our businesses,” Daniel Audet, the first Vice-President at the Conseil du patronat du Quebec, told The Daily in French. “Too often, innovation was perceived as researchers doing work in their labs. It can be that. But it must be followed by commercialization, and answer our actual needs. Innovation in a sealed environment is not very useful.”
Some scientists have also spoken in favour of particular features of the SQRI. For example, Executive Director of Genome Quebec Jean-Marc Proulx told La Presse that he was “very happy” with the strategy because it identified genomics as a strategic sector for development.
However, student groups and left-wing policy experts have criticized increasing government investment in market-ready university research. Eric Martin, a researcher at the Institut de recherche et d’information socio-économiques (IRIS), said the process contributed to a “knowledge economy,” which is turning universities into “patent-producing” factories. “The knowledge economy is the worst thing that has happened to knowledge,” Martin said in a talk at McGill Friday. “People think, ‘Great, there will be knowledge everywhere.’ No, there is economy everywhere.”
PGSS VP External Ryan Hughes, speaking at the same event Friday, echoed Martin. “We are in danger of creating a Canadian version of an industrial-educational complex,” he said.
However, the merging of Quebec’s existing research financing agencies has provoked heated contention. Members of the scientific community have voiced concerns over the haste with which the government made this decision, and feel that they were insufficiently consulted.
Martin Doyon, the Coordinator of University and College Research at the Ministry of Economic Development, admitted that administrative restructuring had not been specifically brought up during the consultation period.
“The consultations for the SQRI were launched in June 2009,” Doyon told The Daily in French. “But the announcement of the regrouping of the three funds itself occurred on March 30 with the budget. It was something that had been discussed before, but it was not brought specifically as a point of debate during the consultations for the SQRI.”
Another concern is that the creation of the Quebec Research Fund might harm each existing fund’s level of financing and specificity.
“The three councils have distinct mandates and serve Quebeckers and their research communities well and they operate efficiently, so it’s difficult to see any savings,” professor and chair of McGill’s department of Biochemistry David Y. Thomas wrote in an email to The Daily
However, Doyon stressed that this restructuring will only occur on the administrative level, as there will exist three separate research boards within the Quebec Research Fund to represent different areas of research.
“There are three sectoral boards planned for the Quebec Research Fund,” said Doyon.
“Three budget envelopes will be granted for the three research areas… Currently, the three financing organizations receive grants from the government. In the SQRI, these funds will once again be given in a distinct manner, according to the field of research.”
“It will be the same mechanism as now… If you take natural science and technology as an example, there will be a board made up of people who best know this field. Same thing for health, same thing for society and culture. Knowledge of the field will be there. … The real difference is that there will be a central administrative council and a chief scientist who will have a more central vision.”
Nevertheless, scientists remain concerned about the future of research financing at McGill and in Quebec.
“We are all concerned as [the restructuring] doesn’t make any sense,” said Thomas. “Certainly the FRSQ [the provincial agency responsible for financing in health research] is a unique organization in Canada and much admired by researchers in other provinces.”

Safety commission says risks are low; city disagrees
Last week, the City of Montreal announced that it will not allow a shipment of 16 decommissioned Bruce Power nuclear generators to be transported through Montreal on the St. Lawrence.
The shipment is one of the biggest of its kind to be transported in Canada. The 16 generators were to be shipped from the Bruce Power plant in Tiverton, Ontario through the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence to a nuclear recycling plant in Sweden. Each of the generators are approximately the size of a school bus.
After receiving the transportation request from Bruce Power, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) investigated the safety of the generators and found that thus far, the proposed transportation method is safe and there would be a minimal amount of contamination if there is spillage from the shipment. The CNSC will make a final decision on the request after it can hear from citizens. In an interview with The Daily, Marc Drolet, Public Affairs and Media Relations Representative for the CNSC, said that the commission should reach a final decision by mid- to late December.
Despite the research carried out by the CNSC, the city of Montreal still has doubts about the safety of the shipments. According to Valérie Desgagné, spokesperson for the city, Montreal’s main concern is the risk of contamination as the “shipment’s radioactive waves would be fifty times higher than the international limit.”
If the CNSC accepts Bruce Power’s request and allows the generators to be shipped through Montreal, then the city could simply prevent the ships from docking in Montreal’s harbour.
Montreal’s decision comes shortly after municipal governments across Ontario voiced their opposition to the shipment. In September, Sarnia, Ontario mayor Mike Bradley stated his concern that a possible spill from the shipments would affect residents’ drinking water.  In addition to the municipalities, the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility has argued that allowing these generators through will set a precedent for turning Canada’s lakes and seaways into highways for nuclear product transportation.
If the CNSC decides to grant Bruce Power’s request, the power of municipalities to block the shipment’s transportation will be called into question.

Critics say ruling doesn’t go far enough
Last Friday, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a ruling clarifying the legal procedure surrounding a journalist’s right to protect confidential sources. The case involves Daniel Leblanc, the Globe and Mail journalist who broke the “sponsorship scandal” in 2004, and Le Groupe Polygone Éditeurs Inc., an advertising agency implicated in the scandal, which was demanding that Leblanc reveal his sources.
Leblanc wrote several articles and a book on the scandal, which relied heavily on information provided by an anonymous source, known only as “Ma Chouette.” As one of the companies implicated in the scandal that saw one-hundred million dollars awarded by the federal government to Liberal-affiliated sponsors, Polygone was hit with a $35-million federal lawsuit in 2005.
Polygone, which received forty million dollars in government funds during the period of the scandal, asked Leblanc to testify to the Quebec Superior Court in order to expose the identity of Ma Chouette in hopes that the source would have information that could help Polygone with their lawsuit.
“We were appealing the Superior Court decision in which the judge asked me to answer questions on my source,” Leblanc told The Daily.
“We were objecting to the kind of fishing expedition in which they were…asking questions to 22 people to see if they were one of my sources,” he said.  “That’s how [my case] ended up in [Supreme] court.”
Before being given standing in the Supreme Court, the case passed through the Quebec Superior Court, where Justice Louis-Phillipe Grandpré ruled that Leblanc would have to answer questions regarding his source. Had it stood, the ruling would have been a “catastrophe for investigative journalism,” said Brian Myles, president of the Fédération professionelle des journaliste du Québec (FPJQ).
Leblanc claimed journalists have a “class privilege” that allows him to protect Ma Chouette.
“The courts have recognized this kind of privilege can exist,” confirmed Dean Jobb, professor of legal journalism at King’s College in Halifax. However, “It still hasn’t said definitively when [the privilege] does exist,” Jobb added.
Jobb went on to express his disappointment in the Friday ruling, saying the Supreme Court did not really answer the fundamental question of whether or not Leblanc’s source could be protected.
Myles explained the limits of the Supreme Court’s ruling: “It’s on court-by-court basis that the court will decide if a source is granted protection or not.”
“[W]e don’t see it as a major victory. It’s a confirmation of the status quo for reporters. The threshold is high for reporters to be forced to reveal their sources, but it’s still a possibility.”
FPJQ was listed as an intervener in Leblanc’s Supreme Court case. Interveners become involved in court cases at the discretion of the judge, because he or she thinks a third party can add something to the case. Other interveners in Leblanc’s case included Astral Media, La Presse, Médias Transcontinental Inc., Groupe TVA, and CBC.
Myles explained FPJQ’s motivation to become involved in the case.
“It was the clearest case where you could argue that protection of sources was essential to the conduct of the investigative story of Daniel Leblanc,” he said.
“If you cannot protect your sources in something like the sponsorship scandal, you cannot protect them anywhere else,” Myles continued.
Leblanc’s case will now be heard in the Quebec Superior Court again, where the criteria established by the Supreme Court on Friday will be in place throughout the proceedings.
“After all of this, really the case goes to square one but with some very good rules and some very good, very strong tests that one hopes will protect Leblanc as he goes forward,” Jobb noted.
Despite his charge that the Supreme Court ruling did not go to the heart of the issue in the case between Leblanc and Polygone, Myles acknowledged that the ruling was related to the bigger issues surrounding the case.
“The Supreme Court went as far as it could given the state of the affairs in reporting today where anybody can enter and exit the business,” Myles stated, pointing to the blurry definition of what a journalist or reporter is.
“Everybody who claims so, can pretend to be a reporter. There’s no clear-cut border between who is a reporter and who’s not,” Myles explained.
From Leblanc’s perspective, the Friday ruling will at least clarify the rules for journalists dealing with sources.
“It makes it clearer for journalists when sources ask for it to be protected that you can say exactly what the rules are and what the limits are,” Leblanc explained. “You can never offer blanket-protection, but you can at least say, ‘Here is the process.’”

Candidate disqualified for campaign infractions, charges election officer of bias
Last night, Patricia Tao was elected the Arts Undergraduate   Society (AUS) VP Events.  Tao ran acclaimed, and achieved 90.1 per cent of votes in favour of her acclamation. Tao said she was “incredibly grateful” to be elected.
The election struggled to meet quorum, scraping by with 24 more  votes cast than the requisite 574, or eight per cent of Arts students.
“It’s been quite the year for the AUS. It can only go up from here,” Tao added.  Her acclamation was marked by controversy, however, as her only opponent, Joseph Stonehouse, was disqualified from the election for multiple breaches of AUS election by-laws.
AUS’s Chief Returning Officer (CRO) Sophie Goss announced Stonehouse’s disqualification just prior to the campaign debate, at 6:30 p.m. on Monday.  Goss announced that Stonehouse had “received his third campaign infraction” for failing to turn up to the debate on time, and was disqualified. Goss added that Stonehouse was “fine with this.”
This disqualification also meant those who had already voted would have their votes reissued, and the question would be re-cast as a simple approval or disapproval of Tao’s acclamation.
In an email to The Daily, Stonehouse said that he “believed that Sophie Goss put the democratic process behind following [the] by-laws,” and that he had “no idea why [Goss] could not wait ten minutes” for him to show up to the debate.
“If she had looked beyond the context of the debate, and broadened her perspective, she might have seen reasons that would have allowed her to forgive my lateness,” Stonehouse continued.
“Frosh was almost ruined because a 19-year-old second-year student ran for VP Events unopposed,” he said, referring to the financial disorganization overseen by Tao’s predecessor, Nampande Londe.
A seperate email from Stonehouse to Goss and AUS President Dave Marshall, obtained by The Daily, revealed that he was not convinced that Goss was an “unbiased” adjudicator.
The email claims that Goss and the rest of the AUS council attended a thanksgiving dinner Tao hosted during the nomination period. He wrote that the attendance of the AUS executives did not “bother” him, as Tao was the interim VP Events at the time. “However,” Stonehouse continued, because the dinner was hosted by “a potential candidate for an election, [Goss] should have remained absent.”
Stonehouse also claimed in the email that he had “zero control over [his] tardiness” because he “needed to sign a commercial contract,” and that “a reasonable and unbiased CRO would have considered this, rather than giving a zero-sum ultimatum.”
Goss pointed out that this was Stonehouse’s third election infraction, and that AUS electoral by-laws stipulate that upon a third infraction, candidates should be disqualified by Elections AUS, unless disqualification is deemed too severe a penalty.
“It was crystal clear to me that because he wasn’t showing up for an important debate which he had known about since the release of the nomination kit [October 4], he had to incur an infraction,” Goss stated.
She acknowledged that Stonehouse did let AUS know at around 4:45 p.m. on the day of the debate that he may be late, and that the next they heard from him was a phone call at 6:25 p.m. letting them know he would be ten minutes late.
Stonehouse also sent an email to Goss at 6:12 p.m., but Goss did not check her inbox until after the phone call.
Stonehouse’s first infraction was for failing to notify Goss that he would not be attending a mandatory meeting on October 15. His second was for failing to supply Goss with a correctly formatted campaign images, despite Goss extending the deadline for him.
Stonehouse also made it known that he is unhappy with the first infraction, and thinks AUS should have reprimanded Goss for taking 36 hours to respond to an email prior to the mandatory meeting he was absent from. Goss claims to have not received the email.
The controversy has overshadowed Tao’s win, and will once again put AUS under the spotlight, as it comes less than two months after the organization recorded a $30,000 deficit from its Frosh. The controversy surrounding that financial loss caused several AUS councillors to consider impeaching the previous VP Events, Nampande Londe, before she resigned citing personal reasons.
In response to the new financial scrutiny AUS will be under, Tao promised to act responsibly with regard to finances, to “not spend where we don’t need to.” She said that “a new tradition” is needed within the AUS, so that lessons learnt could be passed on from council to council each year, something she hopes will prevent future financial disasters.
Stonehouse wished to make it clear that he considers Tao to be “more than qualified” for the job, but that “AUS should have hired a neutral party” because having Goss “working with [Tao] every day” opens up the possibility of electoral bias.
“More importantly,” he continued, “[Goss] should have weighed up ten minutes versus a one-person election. I think the latter is more important to students.”
