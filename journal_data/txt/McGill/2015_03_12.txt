Right to sell sandwiches central to AUS’s negotiations with University
SNAX employees, students, and supporters gathered on March 11 in the Leacock building to protest the McGill administration’s current position against sandwich sales at the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS)’s food stall, and to visibly assert that student-run spaces are an essential and valuable aspect of campus life.
A cease-and-desist order on sandwich sales has been in effect since November, when AUS received notice from the administration that it was violating the terms of its Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by selling the sandwiches. Since then, the subject has become a site of conflict in AUS’ ongoing MOA negotiations with McGill.
The sit-in, attended by roughly fifty participants, was organized with the intention of attracting the attention of both the administration and the student body at large.
“We want the administration to know that there are other people [than SNAX employees] on campus who think that this is something that’s important,” SNAX Assistant Manager Emma Meldrum told The Daily.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens hosted a “meet and greet” style lunch in Redpath’s Première Moisson during the sit-in hours, but did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment about the sit-in or to tweets from the sit-in directed at him under the hashtag #SaveOurSandwiches.

Meldrum told The Daily that the inclusion of sandwiches in the official list of things that AUS is allowed to sell is the only change that SNAX is seeking from the negotiations.
“I think our goals remain the same, and I think the sandwich issue has kind of compounded and reminded us of the goals of SNAX,” said Meldrum.
“We are a service for students, so we’re trying to think of how we can give better service for students, and the sandwich issue has reminded us that part of our role is offering an actual meal to people; they don’t just need snacks, they need an actual, affordable meal that suits their dietary needs,” continued Meldrum.
The initial concern presented to AUS and SNAX by the administration highlighted liability concerns linked to the potential dangers inherent to SNAX’s nature as a food provider and the potential costs the University could incur if something went wrong.
“It just takes one for us,” Dyens told The Daily in an interview. “If somebody gets sick by eating some food, then most people will go after the bigger pockets, and the bigger pockets are McGill’s.”
AUS President Ava Liu denied the claim that SNAX might become a risk to the University.
“First of all, it’s just plain not true. AUS is a non-profit corporation, we have our own corporate status in the Quebec government, we have our own insurance policy. So that’s not true, and he knows that.”
In response to the initial concerns raised about liability, the SNAX team completed Quebec’s health inspection and certification process and compiled evidence to indicate that liabilities had never been an issue in the past.
Liu noted that the certification process is intended for those involved in the preparation of food. “We don’t make food, we don’t even serve food. All we do is sell food,” she said.
Dyens also cited issues other than liability. “I don’t have an issue with student-run business, but then they have to work with our current business structures.”
Liu has occupied a primary seat at the table since the MOA negotiations began in the fall, and has been working with McGill’s Director and Senior Policy Advisor Vilma Di Renzo-Campbell, the University representative in the MOA negotiations.
“[The administrative stance] really is evolving,” said Liu. “At first, it was liability and health. Then it was competition, and then it was ‘slippery slope,’ [regarding] how they don’t want any increases of any rights.”
A recent statement from AUS notes that during negotiations, “The University has now outlined a hard-line policy against the ‘expansion’ of student-run food services […] based on the argument that concessions to one group will open the door to others making similar requests.”
When Dyens was asked about the whereabouts of this policy, he stated that there was “no policy on student-run services.” When asked to clarify the circumstances presented by Campbell, he said this unwritten policy is “something the University is presenting during these negotiations.”
Liu also alleged that Campbell had said things like “we do not support any increase in the rights for student-run services” during negotiations.
According to Liu, Campbell has also alluded to AUS representatives that AUS is “lucky” to have held on to SNAX for this long. “There was a lot of that – [Campbell] kept saying, ‘we support you existing, that’s why you still exist, this is a good deal, don’t make it bigger than it is, don’t make it worse.’ She kept saying the University could be really creative with the space […] and she’s said that many times.”
Dyens described SNAX as “pushing the envelope constantly.” He later said, “If students don’t want us to take a hard stance, then they have to respect the terms of the agreement.”
Dyens also said he was concerned about how SNAX might affect the University’s overall budget, and noted that revenues from traditional food service providers benefit the University.
“Why is student autonomy so bad? Why [is the administration] linking this to the whole slippery slope argument?” said Liu.
She continued, “The position the University is in looks very petty, and to be honest I think that we look petty too, because now this is about sandwiches, and obviously this is ridiculous. Obviously the bigger issue at stake is the issue of autonomy, especially when given proof that there is no issue of liability or risk.”
“It’s not SNAX per se, it’s opening the door to something,” Dyens told The Daily. He later said, “the fact that SNAX is such a big issue tells me that this is something that students want to do with other food things on campus.”
Meldrum touched on this point as well. “In my mind, [greater choice] is not a problem, of course, because it would be wonderful if other outlets on campus could sell anything that they thought that students needed and weren’t getting from Food and Dining Services.”
Both Meldrum and Liu clarified some common misconceptions surrounding McGill’s motives and stance; namely, correlations between this incident and the Arch Café closure in 2010 and pressure from other food service providers on campus.
“I think we’re in two very different situations,” said Meldrum, noting that the Arch Café had experienced financial issues, unlike SNAX.
Regarding competition from other food service providers on campus, Liu said that McGill’s Senior Director of Student Housing and Hospitality Services Mathieu Laperle and Food and Dining Services executive chef Oliver De Volpi had debunked allegations of increased competition from SNAX fare, comparing it to an extra samosa sale.
“They really don’t care. They said, ‘that’s between you and the University, it’s negligible.’”
Laperle and De Volpi did not respond to The Daily’s requests for comment.
Liu noted that, in her personal opinion, the administration has not necessarily been acting out of bad intentions. “I think that, at this point, they’re just unprepared with negotiations, and they’re not really taking it seriously and that’s why they’re going back and forth between these positions.”
Meldrum spoke to SNAX’s future plans. “Clearly we can’t make guarantees about the next management teams,” she said, “but we’re doing our best to have that included in the contracts that they sign, and the training packages that we’ll give them at the end of this year.”
Liu said that their next goal for negotiations is to meet directly with Dyens. “No more meeting with Campbell – meet with [Dyens, and] ask ‘What do you really think, do you really care about this? why is this happening? Tell us what you really think, and we’ll go from there.”’

Renowned Atlantic writer inspires McGill crowd with charismatic address
Ta-Nehisi Coates’ talent for writing has carried him to a senior editor position at the Atlantic, and has made him perhaps the most influential public intellectual on race in the U.S. today. Last Friday, at the invitation of the Black Students’ Network, the McGill Debating Union, and other groups, he spoke about race and violence, and read passages from his upcoming book.
The event was billed as a follow-up to the contentious “Discourses of Race: The United States, Canada and Transnational Anti-Blackness” panel in February, where Montreal historian Frank Mackey reportedly made racist remarks. Mackey had replaced Coates, who had to cancel his appearance on short notice.
On Friday, Coates explained that he was “emotionally devastated” after writing an award-winning Atlantic feature arguing for slavery reparations to the black community. He wanted to express this devastation, as well as his horror at the slew of police killings of black people, in literary form.
“When you see these events, it’s just not a surprise to you,” he said, referring to the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. “This [book] is my attempt to tell my son why he should not be surprised [by these events], why he can’t afford to be surprised, and why he has to understand the country that he’s living in.”
“You can use these abstract, academic terms: ‘redlining’ and ‘debt peonage,’ [but] don’t ever forget that at the end of the day you’re talking about violence. You’re talking about the destruction of somebody’s body.”
Coates spoke positively about the anti-racist protests sparked by Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson and Eric Garner’s death in New York City, but emphasized that, for him, this kind of racial violence is commonplace.
Prompted by host Rachel Zellars, Coates pointed to the hypocrisy of people deploring ‘violent’ protest. He also drew links between violent protest and the violence inherent to racism.
“While I think that non-violence has its own kind of moral arguments in its favour, I find that very often the people who are making those arguments are people who are okay with dropping bombs on Muslim wedding parties,” he said, to applause.
Coates also argued that academic discourse can paint the black liberation movement as non-violent, but that this reflects “a desire to avoid the reality of struggle.” He explained that academic reluctance to clearly tackle the issue obscures violence from the analysis of race.
“When you say something like ‘white privilege,’ it’s abstract,” said Coates. “What you’re really talking about is the right to go upside somebody’s head.”
“You can use these abstract, academic terms: ‘redlining’ and ‘debt peonage,’ [but] don’t ever forget that at the end of the day you’re talking about violence. You’re talking about the destruction of somebody’s body.”
Drawing vocal approval from the crowd, Coates emphasized that “race does not produce racism,” and that white identity cannot exist without power.
Whiteness is a “dream of immortality, a dream of godhood,” he explained. “[It’s] just one tool in the toolbox of plunder.” He compared this with black identity, which he argued exists in itself because it is formed around a common experience of oppression.
Coates said further that one of most troubling aspects of white supremacy in the U.S. is that most people are ignorant of black experiences, and unwilling to learn about them. “These people are lost in a dream,” he said. “These people are not awake, they’re not conscious.”
After answering questions from the audience, Coates received a standing ovation. Helen Ogundeji, a U2 Sociology student, spoke to The Daily after the talk.
“I thought it was really eloquent and thought-provoking, and I’m going back with a lot of thoughts and discussion topics,” she said.
In response to a question about the value of the talk at McGill, Ogundeji told The Daily that “McGill students are a very particular type of people, and I think that a lot of [them] either know this [already], or of course can benefit [from the talk], and will.”
“But I come from a place where I know many people that are, like [Coates] said, asleep – and probably could have used this conversation more than the people I came here with.”

PHOTO ESSAY
Protesters gathered at Norman Bethune Square on March 8 to demonstrate against the austerity measures and neoliberal policies of Quebec’s Liberal government as part of a series of global actions to mark International Women’s Day.
The demonstrators, representing a wide range of activist groups and communities, called out the disproportionate effects of these measures on minority groups, including women, and especially women of colour. “We also denounce the laws and policies in Canada and Quebec, attacking the rights of immigrant and refugee women and their families, temporary workers who will never get permanent status, creating a permanent class of sub-citizens,” the event page stated.
The event was also meant to oppose Islamophobia, and the specific impact it has on Muslim women.
The protest was organized by Women of Diverse Origins, a grassroots anti-imperialist women’s organization which has been coordinating an annual International Women’s Day march in Montreal since 2002. International Women’s Day was created by women’s movements in the early 1900s in the U.S., and was first recognized as an international event by the United Nations in 1975.

Protesters call for a general strike against cuts to social services that disproportionately affect women.

Activists and ecofeminists march in solidarity with Indigenous women and girls.

Interim Board of Directors elections procedure adopted
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Council convened on February 26 to adopt a set of standing rules for the upcoming Winter 2015 General Assembly (GA), and to discuss procedural changes for elections to the Board of Directors. Councillors also voted to support Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill’s proposed fee increase in the group’s 2015 referendum.
At its previous meeting on February 12, Council approved a motion to draft standing rules for the Winter 2015 GA, which will be held on March 15. At its most recent meeting, Council discussed the proposed rules, brought forward by SSMU President Courtney Ayukawa, VP Internal Daniel Chaim, and VP Finance and Operations Kathleen Bradley.
The rules consisted of four key points: a default speaking time of one minute will be enforced, ‘friendly’ amendments will be incorporated to the relevant motion without a vote, the speaker will state all voting options and their outcomes prior to each vote, and all members waiting to enter the room will be given voting cards before any vote deemed “substantive” takes place.
The term “substantive” prompted considerable debate, with some councillors expressing concern over which motions it would cover. Various solutions to this ambiguity were proposed. Physical & Occupational Therapy Representative Yasmine Nadifi suggested that the term be defined, and VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan argued that because a primary concern of councillors and their constituents would be motions to postpone debate indefinitely, these should be explicitly included in the definition of “substantive.”
After a lengthy discussion, the rule in question was amended to “any motions deemed substantive by the chair.” The motion to approve the standing rules passed unanimously.
After a substantial period of discussion, councillors voted unanimously in favour of a motion to support a “yes” vote in the QPIRG-McGill 2015 referendum. The referendum question, which passed successfully last week, proposed a $1.25 increase to QPIRG-McGill’s opt-outable $3.75 fee, bringing it to a total of $5.00 per student per term.
“I see this fee as important because it institutionalizes QPIRG funding and makes it a sustainable option, whereas we can’t rely on government grants, especially in a climate of austerity.”
Medicine Representative Joshua Chin expressed concern about the possible negative ramifications of this increase. “I’m wondering if by […] endorsing this fee increase, would that not de-incentivize QPIRG members from more proactive […] searching for [government] grants or fundraising?”
Arts Representative Lola Baraldi disagreed. “I see this fee as important because it institutionalizes QPIRG funding and makes it a sustainable option, whereas we can’t rely on government grants, especially in a climate of austerity.”
Stewart-Kanigan concurred, noting that the application process for such grants is complex and extremely time-consuming, and creates what she termed a “climate of uncertainty” within organizations seeking this type of funding. She spoke strongly in favour of the motion, calling QPIRG-McGill “an excellent resource on our campus.”
Cadence O’Neal, a QPIRG-McGill board member and a member of the “yes” committee for the fee, explained the reasoning behind this motion in a message to The Daily.
“QPIRG has been around since the 1980s, but has only had its fee increased once since then. […] Since [the fee] has been static for the most part, we’ve become unable to maintain our amazing programs,” said O’Neal. “We’ve also been unable to adequately improve the physical accessibility of our space and resources. With this fee increase, we’ll be able to ensure the sustainability of our existing programs, while also making QPIRG more active and accessible for McGill students.”
The fee referendum, which ran from February 26 to March 2, passed at both SSMU and the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS).
Council also discussed a motion pledging SSMU’s support for the expansion of childcare services for the McGill community.
“This has been an ongoing challenge on the McGill campus,” said Stewart-Kanigan, who motivated the motion. “This is a stance that would not only be supportive of SSMU’s advocacy efforts […] but it would also be a stance in solidarity with those other groups on campus who are also pushing for more childcare possibilities.”
A motion regarding interim changes for the SSMU Board of Directors (BoD) elections process was also approved. The motion temporarily modified SSMU’s bylaws to allow councillors to be elected to the BoD in April, to ensure that the positions are filled during the summer months.

Major reforms to the Quebec healthcare system under harsh criticism
In November 2014, Quebec Minister of Health and Social Services Gaétan Barrette proposed a major overhaul to the current healthcare system. The changes, including Bills 10, 20, and 28, are intended to make healthcare accessible to more people, and will affect major sections of the health system, including bureaucracy, doctors, treatments, prescriptions, and pharmacies.
The three bills brought some concerns from the populations likely to be affected by them; however, it is Bill 20 that is currently holding national attention as it is now under review.
Bill 10, which restructures the bureaucracy of the health sector, passed in the National Assembly on February 7. The bill will abolish the boards of individual health institutions by merging them into 28 regional boards representing multiple institutions. This change posed a concern for some anglophone institutions, as it might negatively impact their representation on the boards.
The ministry attempted to address these concerns with amendments that secure at least one position for a representative of the anglophone community on each board. The amendments led to a largely positive response, though some professionals remain opposed. Sara Saber-Freedman, president for the MAB-MacKay Rehabilitation Centre told CBC, “What Bill 10 does to achieve [healthcare streamlining] is totally, totally unnecessary and very damaging to our institutions and to our community.”
Bill 28 is most relevant to pharmacists, allowing them to renew common prescriptions such as birth control, aspirin, and vitamin D supplements, which would save the government an estimated $133.5 million per year. Jean Thiffault, president of the Quebec Association of Pharmacy Owners, expressed worry that this bill might result in reduced pharmacy hours and job losses, telling Global News, “Pharmacies will close, store hours will decrease, pharmacists will have to cut some staff.” The bill went to hearing on January 23 and is currently under review.
“We believe that working in a group would be much more effective to meeting these needs of the population.”
The most controversial of the proposed changes is Bill 20, “An Act to enact the Act to promote access to family medicine and specialized medicine services and to amend various legislative provisions relating to assisted procreation.”
Bill 20 focuses on two things: an increase in patients for family doctors in Quebec, who would have to take on a minimum of 1,000 patients or face a 30 per cent pay cut; and reducing funding of in vitro fertilization (IVF), which Barrette argues to be a non-essential service.
Barrette introduced Bill 20 based on the premise that 60 per cent of doctors in Quebec work less than 25 weeks a year, which is far less than doctors in Ontario, for example. He told Global News: “We would not have to table Bill 20 if doctors were working full-time and were adapting their practices to satisfy the needs of the population.”
However, Louis Godin from the Quebec Federation of General Practitioners contested this statement. “The family physicians in Quebec spend more time in the hospitals. […] The workload of a family physician in Quebec is 50 per cent higher than the workload of a family physician in Ontario or elsewhere in Canada.”
The faculties of medicine at McGill, Université Laval, Université de Montréal, and Université de Sherbrooke have expressed opposition to the current form of the bill, due to concerns with how it will impact the amount of time that practitioners can devote to teaching.
McGill Dean of Medicine David Eidelman told The Daily in an interview that he is concerned about the lack of accessibility of the current health system. “There are changes that are needed to our healthcare system to increase access, and certainly we are ready to work with the Ministry of Health to try and promote that.”
Despite these accessibility concerns, however, he was not supportive of Bill 20. “We have concern about Bill 20 in the way that it is currently structured, in that it doesn’t recognize the role of physicians as teachers. And we depend on community practitioners for a very large part of our teaching, especially in family medicine.”
Julie Miville-Dechêne, president of the Conseil du statut de la femme, also noted that the bill could exacerbate gender inequality. She argued that, because female doctors already earn less than male doctors, “the quotas will penalize women more,” according to the Montreal Gazette.
Eidelman added that, in many universities in Quebec, the number of women medicine graduates is “disproportionately high.” In order to protect the interests of these women and also any other doctors from potential pay cuts, he suggested a model used in Ontario – known as ‘capitation’ – instead of quotas.
“Capitation is where a group of doctors is paid to look after a group of patients, not just individuals,” said Eidelman. “We believe that working in a group would be much more effective to meeting these needs of the population. […] Different people, whether they are women or men, work at different times during their career […] and this can be dealt with by working as a team in a group, rather than trying to look at individuals.”
Another aspect of Bill 20 that the Conseil du statut de la femme opposed, calling it “paternalistic,” is the restrictions that will be imposed on IVF. Quebec was the first province in Canada to completely include this treatment into its healthcare services in 2010, a progressive step that was nationally and internationally recognized. The initial cost of this provision in 2010 was $32 million, but was estimated to rise to $80 million per year. The current cost of the program, slightly below the estimate, is $70 million per year.
Instead of leaving IVF treatment up to the discretion of the doctor, the bill would restrict the treatment to women between the ages of 18 and 42 who have passed a psychological evaluation. Further, the bill would require patients to have undergone a minimum number of months of unprotected sexual intercourse and intrauterine insemination before being eligible for IVF.
Commenting on these restrictions, Eidelman said, “I think what you’re seeing in the bill is an attempt to put some sort of guidelines and limits on what can be done to try and balance different competing legitimate issues.”
Barrette has said that some exemptions would be added to the bill for women who tried other therapies but failed to conceive. While these exemptions are unclear, they will not include “women who have had a tubal ligation, men who have had vasectomies, or a parent or parents who already have one child,” according to the Montreal Gazette.
Single mothers, as well as gay and lesbian couples, would largely be excluded from access to IVF funding. Mona Greenbaum, director of the LGBT Family Coalition, commented to CBC, “The phone has been ringing off the hook this morning with single lesbians and lesbian couples who are very worried about this and feel specifically targeted.”
Bill 20 is currently under review at the Quebec National Assembly.

First town hall held on executive mandate restructuring, constitutional updates
On February 26, the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) held a town hall to discuss potential changes to the EUS executive structure. The suggested restructuring is part of EUS 2020, an ongoing project aimed at creating new, innovative ideas for making EUS more current and accessible to students.
Last year’s EUS President Carlos Capriles explained the motivation behind the project. “EUS should be shaped over time with the students’ needs – and students’ needs change, […] the people who come to McGill change, and the organization should be shaped along with it,” he said at the town hall.
The proposed changes would remove the position of VP Clubs & Administration and add the position of VP Student Life, meant to broaden “the scope of our activities to encompass the changing needs and growing diversity of our faculty,” according to the presentation. The VP Student Life would not only work on social events, but also address issues of inclusivity and mental health. Moreover, they would work more closely with the EUS Equity Commissioner, who currently works intimately with the president. The changes also include eliminating the VP Services position and redefining the existing executive portfolios.
To accommodate the loss of an executive position, the plan would create directorship positions, about two or three per VP, to support the executive by heading committees and taking charge of the smaller tasks that the VP currently performs. According to the presenters, the proposed restructuring is similar to changes made at other student government organizations, such as the University of British Columbia’s Undergraduate Engineering Society.
This is the first time that the proposal of the EUS 2020 team has been presented at a public event, and the vision is subject to change. The presenters expressed a desire to hold multiple events over the course of the next year, in order to have as much input from engineering students as possible before drafting changes to the executive mandates in the EUS constitution.
“EUS should be shaped over time with the students’ needs – and students’ needs change.”
“It’s time to change some things in the constitution […] so I want to spread the word and try to get people to voice their opinions so that the changes go in the direction that is the best for everyone,” said EUS 2020 member Stéphanie Breton at the town hall.
Indeed, many at the forum took issue with the proposed changes. Some of the people present showed concern over the elimination of the VP Services, considering that the current EUS executives are all “stretched thin” and do an overwhelming amount of work.
One audience member noted that managing the General Store (G-Store) and Frostbite, student-run businesses overseen by EUS, is a big part of the Services portfolio. He argued that because these services are so vital to EUS, they should merit their own VP.
“[There are] so many managerial aspects – that [in itself] is [a] reason why we have VP Services and removing it would be a loss to the Society.”
Another widely held concern was allocating a large amount of responsibility to directors, who might not be as motivated as VPs to stay on top of their work. An employee at the G-Store voiced concern about potential implications the restructuring might have on constituents’ abilities to access VPs.
After the meeting, Breton clarified that the submission of these changes will be delayed until the next academic year.

“Solidarity can be subversive,” says activist Laith Marouf
Four activists from widely varying backgrounds came together to share their experiences and offer advice on methods of resistance during a panel discussion called “N(oh), Canada: Intersectional Perspectives on Canadian State Violence,” hosted by Demilitarize McGill. The event, held on February 25, attracted a diverse group of roughly forty students and sparked a lively conversation that lasted over an hour.
“We wanted to create a platform where different voices could challenge the dominant narrative we hear about the state,” explained a member of Demilitarize McGill in an email to The Daily. “This narrative – that the state exists to protect us – directly contradicts the lived experiences of many communities.”
The panelists – Mutatayi Fuamba, Clay Nikiforuk, Laith Marouf, and Delilah Saunders – represented four such communities.
Fuamba, Montreal’s Youth Ambassador to the Canadian Council for Refugees and MC and songwriter of Congolese origin, offered insight into the problematic impact of Canada’s immigration laws. He highlighted Bill C-31, which, since being passed in December 2012, has made it significantly more difficult to receive refugee protection in Canada.
According to Fuamba, prospective immigrants are liable to face deportation should they be found guilty of any criminal offence during their application process, however minor. “[Bill C-31] affects a lot of people,” he explained, adding that the criteria according to which someone could be deported are “really subjective.”
“Every night, they’d come directly to me and pepper spray me in the eyes while filming.”
Nikiforuk, an activist and writer who specializes in gender issues and Canadian sex work legislation, also spoke at the panel. She explained the negative ramifications of Bill C-36, passed in December 2014, which criminalizes the act of buying, advertising, or profiting from the sale of sexual services.
By driving sex work underground, she said, the bill puts those who participate in the industry – a community already vulnerable to many forms of violence – even more at risk. “I don’t think [it reflects] Canadian values, and I think instead it [plays] on […] sex trafficking fears,” said Nikiforuk. “The bill [is called] ‘The Exploited Persons Act,’ conflating sex workers with trafficked persons, which is very dubious.”
Marouf, a multimedia consultant and producer who launched and hosted CKUT’s Palestinian community radio program “Under the Olive Tree,” and has worked with Indigenous and Palestinian solidarity activists across the country, spoke to the audience about freedom of speech in Canada.
Marouf denounced the newly introduced Bill C-51, also known as the Anti-terrorism Act. “It basically says that undermining the Canadian government and territorial integrity of Canada are [considered] terrorism. That’s a very dangerous thing.”
This legislation, Marouf argued, would restrict freedom of speech, silencing journalistic voices judged to be subversive, and repressing Indigenous activists who challenge Canada’s territorial sovereignty.
Marouf also shared his experience with police brutality during the 2012 student strike. Marouf organized a live broadcast of the strike from the streets of Montreal, facing repeated assaults from riot police. “I was targeted directly by the cops,” he said.
“Every night, they’d come directly to me and pepper spray me in the eyes while filming,” he said. “They broke my ribs one night […] and that was in front of all the viewers, the Canadian public, the judicial system. […] The truth is, there is no freedom of speech.”
Saunders, the fourth panelist, is an Inuk blogger and activist. Last year, while Saunders researched Canada’s history of violence against Indigenous women, her sister, Loretta Saunders, was murdered. During the panel, Saunders stressed the need for more aggressive attitudes toward domestic and gendered violence from politicians, law enforcement officers, and the Canadian justice system.
Saunders also decried the dearth of infrastructure and basic necessities available to Indigenous communities in Labrador.
“With a lot of Native communities who have suffered the intergenerational impact [of colonial occupation], they don’t have the resources, or the funding, [or] therapists. They don’t have even […] basic medical care,” said Saunders. “How can you make sure that you’re not psychologically defeated if you’re not given the tools […] or the language to persevere?”
Despite their diverse backgrounds and areas of experience, all four panelists stressed the importance of intersectionality and mutual support between marginalized groups.
“Solidarity can be subversive sometimes,” said Marouf.
In a message to The Daily, one audience member, U0 Arts student Sean Nossek, expressed his appreciation of the discussion.
“I think what this panel did well was highlight the intersectional nature of state violence,” Nossek said.
“Whether you’re someone who’s struggling against racial discrimination and police harassment, the destruction of Indigenous territory, violence against women, or any of the manifold ways in which the state tries to hurt us, our struggles do not exist in isolation and we can only fight them through solidarity and coordinated action,” he said. “Demilitarize McGill knows all too intimately how connected we are to state violence as university students, and I don’t think any group on campus could have organized this event better.”
