Concerns raised over student consultation and corporate involvement
At the first 2012 meeting of Senate yesterday, plans concerning McGill’s involvement in the creation of an “innovation district” in Montreal’s former industrial centre, known as Griffintown, were presented publicly for the first time.
The project, known as the Quartier de l’Innovation (QI), aims to create a “collaborative ecosytem” that will impact economic development in the district, innovate academic and professional programs, and serve as the site for part of McGill’s downtown campus.
McGill’s partners in the QI include the École de technologie supérieure and the Quebec government.
Announced in May 2011, the QI’s internal planning process began last summer and culminated in a final report submitted to Rose Goldstein, Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations) in October.
Professor and Interim Director of the Montreal Neurological Institute, Phil Barker, chairs the QI’s internal planning process, and presented recommendations to Senate on Wednesday with Goldstein.
Barker spoke to the project’s emphasis on creating a neighbourhood in the former industrial centre. In her presentation of the project, Goldstein described the area as “beaten down,” and noted positive feedback she has received from staff and students thus far.
The report recommends the QI become a focal point for programs in areas like health technologies, social innovation, and innovation and entrepreneurship.
The report states that “corporate partners are anxious to have access to [McGill’s] pool of highly trained individuals. We recommend that QI-based businesses be given unique access to this pool.”
Corporate access would include job fairs, new innovation internship programs, and on-site interview infrastructure.
SSMU President Maggie Knight raised concerns regarding corporate social responsibility among potential corporate partners named in the QI recommendations, such as Bombardier, Google, and Monsanto.
“There’s a lot in that document about giving back to the community and the society and to the principles of sustainable development, and prosperity and so on,” said Knight. “But there’s also talk about relationships with some corporations that perhaps don’t obviously deeply value those same principles.”
“There needs to be some sort of ethical process,” she added.
PGSS President Roland Nassim pointed out the lack of student involvement in the project’s planning. Barker accounted for the lack of student input by stating that the process “unrolled quite quickly,” and was conducted over the summer at a “high level.”
“We recognize we need student input,” Barker added.
“This is McGill and they know better – that students want to be involved,” Nassim told The Daily. “It’s a good project but we’re going to have to see how students can be integrated. This is about students’ futures and careers in general, and not just about the people involved in the renovations.”
Knight noted Goldstein and Barker’s commitment to engaging students in the future, however, she added that “it was a little surprising to see something of that magnitude come to Senate for discussion before the students have been talked to. I think that’s not generally seen as best practices for engaging students.”
“I hope that we’ll engage in a productive conversation [from] this point forward,” said Knight.
The development of QI will undergo further consultation, with an aim to create a preliminary business plan by the end of March 2012.

Breaking the McGill administration’s silence on Dean of Law Daniel Jutras’ report on November 10, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum has announced that the administration accepts the report and intends to implement all recommendations.
“Before confirming the plans for implementation, and as I committed to do in December, I will await the benefit of hearing the discussion at Senate,” wrote Munroe-Blum in her memorandum prior to Senate.
Jutras introduced his report and said he was “quite confident that the text of the narrative is correct [due to] the plurality of perspectives with respect to each account of the event.” Jutras said he hoped the report would serve as a starting point.
Arts senator Matthew Crawford requested that the McGill administration acknowledge the lack of evidence of violence on the part of the 14 student occupiers in the James Administration building. Crawford is one of the 14 individuals who occupied the fifth floor.
Darin Barney, senator and associate professor in Art History and Communication Studies, said that protestors explained their intention of a peaceful occupation from the start of their action. Barney continued to state that based on Jutras’ report, within eight minutes of the occupation’s beginning the students’ political intentions were known.
Barney stated that subsequent contact with the police, and, in particular violence outside the building, was “…[an] unjustifiable response to a justifiable political action.”
“Any university that doesn’t know the place it must make for political activism has already lost its way… University is supposed to be a place where political activism, and its dissent, should, uniquely, be allowed,” Barney added.
After the meeting, Munroe-Blum told The Daily that “a lot of different views were expressed and a lot of different recommendations came into play.”
“I’m meeting with the student leaders coming up… This should not be the only formal administrative response to the Jutras report – there will be other undertakings that will happen,” she added.
SSMU President Maggie Knight spoke to student input in the implementation of Jutras’ recommendations and other recommendations not in the report.
“We don’t have a concrete idea of what that looks like, or how we’ll be involved,” she said. “We’ll be following up with the administration to try to clarify that.”

CKUT and QPIRG may face second referendum
The McGill administration has informed CKUT, McGill’s campus-community radio station, and the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG), that the results of their fall existence referendum questions will not be observed.
The organizations are required to go to existence referenda every five years. In the fall 2011 referendum, both CKUT and QPIRG’s questions proposed changing the system of opting out of fees to an in-person process rather than online through Minerva.
The organizations must pass their existence referenda in order to begin negotiating their Memorandum of Agreement with the University.
Kira Page, a member of the QPIRG Board of Directors, said that the organizations met with Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson in December, “wherein [it] was firmly suggested that [rejecting the referendum results] would be the decision of the administration.”
In a press release from CKUT and QPIRG, a letter from the administration is quoted as saying that referendum results were “unclear.”
According to Mendelson, “[the administration] only saw the questions when they were published for the referendum – too late to suggest changes to improve clarity.”
Before being presented to students, referendum questions must either pass through SSMU Council, or gather 500 student signatures, as well as undergo a review by Elections SSMU (formerly Elections McGill).
“Elections SSMU found the questions to be very clear,” said Rebecca Tacoma, chief returning officer of Elections SSMU, in an email to The Daily. “We did take note of the fact that some students expressed both questions to be a difficult choice between voting ‘Yes,’ for continuing to support the student group in question through a fee that is not opt-outable on Minerva, or voting ‘No,’ for not continuing to recognize the group in question as a student group that collects fees.”
“However, just because the questions may have presented options that were difficult for some students to choose between, this cannot be confused with the actual clarity of the question,” Tacoma wrote.
In an email to The Daily, Mendelson said that, in the past, “some fee referenda have not been implemented, because they also lacked clarity.” He did not offer specific examples.
SSMU released a letter directed to Mendelson addressing the decision. “We are naturally concerned that a democratic decision by the student body – and, by  extension, SSMU’s democratic processes in general – are being declared invalid, and would appreciate a response to these concerns,” wrote SSMU President Maggie Knight.
Page said that the administration has told CKUT and QPIRG to run a second referendum with questions that they approve.
“[The organizations] can also ask a separate question on whether the fee should be non opt-outable, on the understanding that the administration cannot be bound by a referendum on the method of opting out,” wrote Mendelson.
Voting for the winter referendum period will occur from March 8 to 14.
Page pointed out that running a second referendum question would forestall negotiations with the University.
“We’re definitely looking into other options…we had very clear student support from that fall referendum campaign, and [we are] using that to pressure the administration into accepting the results and looking into our other options in negotiations,” Page said.
J-Board
Students Zach Newburgh and Brendan Steven have filed a case with SSMU’s Judicial Board (J-Board) requesting that the results of the fall 2011 referendum question regarding the existence of QPIRG be invalidated.
According to J-Board Chief Justice David Parry, the public hearing for the case will be on January 30, in the Lev Bukhman room. Quorum for J-Board is three justices.
The students’ 64-page case file – which includes evidence gathered from emails, Facebook activity, SSMU Council minutes, and campus publications – accuses the QPIRG ‘Yes’ committee of numerous infractions.  The case claims that campaign rules were enforced irregularly, and challenges numerous decisions of Elections SSMU Chief Electoral Officer Rebecca Tacoma.
After requesting access to the SSMU membership list in late September, Newburgh used his access to check the membership status of the signatories to the petition for the QPIRG referendum question. A list of 12 students who are deemed to be non-SSMU members is included in the case file.
Steven distributed a press release about the case two days after the distribution of a press release from CKUT and QPIRG, which detailed the refusal by the McGill administration to recognize the referendum results.
In a letter to QPIRG and CKUT, the administration cited concerns over the “unclear” referendum question. Similarly, Steven and Newburgh’s petition references a quote by Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson, in which he describes QPIRG’s question as “convoluted.”
The case file focuses only on the constitutionality and clarity of QPIRG’s question, despite the nearly identical structure of the fall referendum question regarding the existence of CKUT.
Tacoma, Newburgh, and Steven are not granting interviews regarding the case.

Interim representative to SSMU elected; date for General Assembly discussed
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) held its first meeting of the semester Wednesday night. Items on the agenda included enacting a new voting requirement, discussing the recent outage of the AUS website, and electing an interim Arts Representative to SSMU Council.
A large portion of the meeting revolved around voting to add a new by-law to the AUS Constitution that would require ten per cent of the Arts student body to vote on AUS referendums regarding student strikes.
After lengthy debate, Councillors voted in favor of the new by-law. The decision comes as students are beginning to mobilize to support a general Quebec student strike this semester in opposition to impending tuition increases.
A student petition for AUS to hold a second General Assembly on January 24 was submitted last week for Council to consider. Despite wording in the document that specifies a date, Council set a tentative date for January 31, which coincides with the next AUS Council meeting.
In light of the AUS website having been down over the past several weeks, Matthew Chung, VP Communications, explained that this outage was due to an unpaid fee for the web server. As of Tuesday night, the issue was resolved and the website is back up and running.
To replace Arts Representative to SSMU Micha Stettin, Council elected Justin Fletcher as interim representative. Fletcher is currently the East Asian Studies Students’ Association representative to the AUS. Stettin resigned his position at the end of the fall semester.
Orientation Week Theft
The AUS Executive revealed to Council near the end of the fall semester that $12,000 of Orientation Week money was stolen from the AUS office. VP Finance Marlene Benavides discovered the theft on September 1.
Benavides said that AUS is “aware of small thefts, especially during Orientation Week, but not to this magnitude.”
She described the time around Orientation Week as “extremely hectic, and where we have an unusually large amount of cash in the office, which makes us an easy target for theft,” as well as a period of “high traffic in and out of the office.”
McGill Security and the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal conducted an investigation into the theft. Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson said that the administration is unable to comment due to the investigation.
According to Benavides, AUS has taken the steps of purchasing a new safe and changing an alarm code for the office.
Despite the theft, Benavides reported that AUS made a profit of approximately $6,000, a significant change from 2010 Frosh, which posted a $30,000 deficit.

The first in a series on faculty association presidents
It’s hard to believe that Dave Fortin was once a science student at McGill. The current Management Undergraduate Society (MUS) president has also served as VP External of MUS and VP Sports of the Jeux de commerce, a case and sports competition between Quebec business schools.
However, the many successes did not come without challenges, the most controversial of which was the referendum on the proposed five-dollar fee increase to the MUS student fee.
“I think anytime you ask someone for money you might get some push-back,” he admitted. Nevertheless, the referendum passed in November.
In addition to the student fee increase, the MUS implemented a universal ten-dollar membership fee for any MUS-affiliated club. Fortin said that the old system, where some clubs were free and others cost as much as $25 to join, “didn’t make sense.” Now, regardless of their interests, students pay the same for each club. “It’s fair across the board, so anyone can participate,” he said.
MUS’s corporate relations team came under fire this year because few funds were raised outside of the MUS agenda and Frosh, leading to the team getting downsized from roughly twenty students to seven. The idea for a corporate relations team began when Fortin attended the National Business Schools Conference and saw the University of Manitoba’s Commerce Students’ Association’s success in generating funds. “In practice it was difficult, because we were very ambitious with it,” he said. “Setting it up is the bulk of the work.”
Another controversy involved Desautels Career Services asking recent graduate Khaled Kteily to remove a database of consulting recruitment resources on his website, themcn.ca (Management Consultants Network). “I have the utmost confidence in Career Services,” he explained, adding that he did not want the database to prevent students from seeing an advisor.
Career Services’ new mentorship program offered to U3 students is one way the faculty is improving its resources and reputation. Competitiveness is one of MUS’s three goals for the year, and, to celebrate the faculty’s success, a secondary trophy case has been created on the second floor.  Another objective – environmental sustainability – has been achieved through a new recycling campaign, as well as a waste audit of Bronfman. Finally, the MUS budget was published online to help improve accountability.
Fortin grabbed headlines early last semester when it broke that he was spearheading a review of SSMU governance with other faculty association presidents.  When asked about SSMU, Fortin had good things to say. “I communicate with [SSMU President] Maggie Knight fairly frequently. We’ve worked on a number of projects together,” he said.
Fortin has high hopes for the future, encouraging the Board of Directors and Executive to write detailed exit reports. He maintained that turnover, a problem in other student associations, is “not a huge issue.” The MUS has had to fill one vacated position this year for the Math/Statistics representative, who resigned from the position in order to pursue an actuarial internship.
The MUS will hold its Annual General Meeting on January 30.
