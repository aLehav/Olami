Letter details McGill’s past and present relationship with Quebec asbestos industry
Correction appended Feb. 4
A letter signed by 76 international health experts and academics makes two requests of  McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG): that they cease inviting Roshi Chadha – who is involved in exporting asbestos from Canada – to sit on the BoG, and to cease using and promoting the use of asbestos.
The letter states that McGill “has a long history of serving the interests of the Quebec asbestos industry,” including an “alliance” between the Quebec Asbestos Mining Association (QAMA) and former McGill professor John Corbett Macdonald in 1966.
According to a recent episode of CBC’s The National, QAMA provided Macdonald at least $1 million between 1966 and 1972 for research into the health effects of chrysotile asbestos.
The letter states that Macdonald “had significant influence around the world in putting forward information…that was favourable to the industry’s interests.”
Bruce Case, a professor in McGill’s Pathology department, co-authored a 2001 study on asbestos fibres in the lungs of miners and millers that was partially funded by the J.M. Asbestos Corporation, according to the documentary.
The CBC documentary claims that the asbestos industry continued to fund research at McGill until recently – research that the federal and Quebec governments have used to justify continued asbestos production and export.
In a statement addressing both the letter and CBC’s documentary, David Eidelman, chair of McGill’s Department of Medicine, said the University “has the highest standards of research ethics.”
“The integrity and scientific value of research carried out at the University is of primary importance.  When concerns are occasionally expressed about research ethics, we rely on a rigorous process of investigation,” continued Eidelman.
The letter to BoG members also criticized the use of asbestos-cement storm pipes in the ongoing construction of the McGill University Health Centre.
“It is particularly cynical that McGill is using asbestos-containing materials in a hospital building,” states the letter, adding, “McGill will serve as a priceless ‘poster child’ for the asbestos industry, whose marketing in developing countries will likely feature McGill’s new state of the art hospital.”
Fernand Turcotte, lead signatory of the letter and professor emeritus of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at the Université Laval, said in the letter that “McGill has regrettably chosen to play the role of acting as a business card for the asbestos industry.” The letter notes that much of Chadha’s donations to McGill have “likely come from asbestos profits.”
Chahda announced she was taking a leave of absence from the BoG last Thursday.
Abby Lippman, a McGill professor in Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health and co-signer of the letter, said she was pleased Chadha took a leave of absence.
“I hope she will seriously consider resigning from the Board,” she said.
Kathleen Ruff, senior human rights adviser for the Ottawa-based Rideau Institute, also signed the letter.
“I didn’t expect to be fighting McGill. I thought McGill would be on our side,” she said. “I thought McGill would be on the side of knowledge and health, but it isn’t, apparently.”
The letter also referred to Principal Heather Munroe-Blum’s observation of a straw vote by roughly 1,000 epidemiologists at the Third North American Congress of Epidemiology in Montreal last year calling for Canada to cease the use, mining, and export of asbestos, as “quite puzzling,” in light of the University’s history with the industry.
Munroe-Blum is a professor in McGill’s Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health.
SSMU President Maggie Knight, one of two student representatives on the BoG, voiced concern over the McGill’s potential connections to the asbestos industry.
“Obviously if [the accusations] are fully true, that’s really concerning, and I would hope that the University will take fast action, as we don’t want our academic reputation sullied by such events,” said Knight.
 
Fast facts: Asbestos
• Popular form of insulation throughout the 1900s
• Inhalation of fibres can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma
• The European Union has banned all use, manufacture and export
• Asbestos is banned from being used in 50 countries around the world
• Commercial mining of asbestos began in the Eastern Townships
• Asbestos, Quebec is home to the world’s largest asbestos mine
In the printed the version of this article it incorrectly states that the letter was addressed to three senior members of McGill’s BoG; in fact the letter was addressed to all members of the BoG. The Daily regrets the error.

Union appealing administration’s decision from before strike
McGill announced it will be paring back benefits for non-academic retirees, two months after MUNACA concluded a semester-long strike.
According to Lynne Gervais, associate vice-principal (Human Resources), as of 2016, MUNACA retirees will be responsible for paying 70 per cent of their medical costs, and 100 per cent of their dental costs. Currently, all MUNACA employees and retirees split these costs 50-50 with the University.
The proposed changes will also affect retirees in the other unions represented on the Staff Benefits Advisory Committee (SBAC), which is comprised of four unions – including MUNACA – and totals roughly 5,000 McGill employees.
According to Gervais, the idea for the changes dates back to 2008 and Provost Anthony Masi’s Administrative Task Force on Dealing with Economic Uncertainty.  In an email to The Daily, Gervais added that the proposal formed part of the recommendations from a working group on cost efficiencies within the Strategic Reframing Initiative (SRI), which launched in October 2010.
In an interview with The Daily, MUNACA President Kevin Whittaker reviewed minutes taken at the July 27, 2011 meeting of SBAC. According to Whittaker, the committee was told at the meeting that Dean of Management Peter Todd, chair of the cost efficiencies working group, had presented the recommended cuts to the SRI Steering Committee.
“That was passed to the senior administration for approval,” Whittaker said. “And then it was to be implemented.”
Whittaker said MUNACA filed a grievance in July.
“They did not consult us. They simply informed us that this is what has been done, and that’s not the process,” he said.
“We will definitely challenge it,” he continued. “I’m sure we’ll be in court at some point.”
Pierre Moreau, executive director of Planning and Institutional Analysis and lead  of the SRI Project Management Office, said the proposal is “not on my radar.”
“We’re trying to…look into some of the things that were announced already by the [Board of Governors],” said Moreau.
“So the only thing that the SRI’s doing about those decisions is just trying to help with the methodology to deliver on them. But this has not been part of the SRI,” he said.
Gervais said the change had originally been scheduled for last month.
“It is important to note that the administration has reconsidered, and that for current retirees, up to June 1, 2016, there will be no changes. Thereafter, the 70-30 medical cost-sharing will apply, along with the 100 per cent dental,” she wrote in the email.
The changes were affected by independent talks between the administration and the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT), one of the constituent employee groups of the SBAC.
MAUT President John Galaty  said the July announcement of the cuts “raised some major issues about how we govern our financial matters, and what kind of voice employee groups…have in these changes.”
“When it first was proposed, it was going to apply, right now, to all the people who are already retired. So we fought that desperately, and we’ve made representations, arguments,” he continued.
“What the University argues is that [the cuts were] done last summer,” said Galaty. “So we feel we’ve done something positive by rolling it back.”
Whittaker said he understood and appreciated MAUT’s efforts. However, he added, “That is not how we should be conducting ourselves.”
“If there is something that impacts on all the groups, all of the groups should be involved with the discussion,” said Whittaker.
“I don’t know if [the change is] something that MAUT proposed, or is that something that came out of the talks? Nobody knows because we were not present, and I think all the groups that this impacts on should have been involved in that discussion, which is the purpose of the SBAC,” he continued.
On October 24, 2011, the SBAC voted unanimously to reject the administration’s proposed cuts.
Whittaker said MAUT’s amendments made the proposal “less painful…but it’s still a cut to those that will feel it most.”
Ron Critchley, president of the McGill University Non-Academic Staff Association (MUNASA) – one of the SBAC unions – echoed Whittaker’s sentiments.
“Sometimes people don’t realize that $1,800 spent at the dentist’s office is a considerable part of a pensioner’s income,” he said.

The first in a multi-part series on University security
The first in a multi-part series on University security
 
Over the course of the fall semester, numerous incidents, including the treatment of non-academic staff on strike and the events of November 10, transformed the public image of McGill Security in the views of many and made security on campus a regular topic for discussion.
Dean of Law Daniel Jutras noted, in his report on the events of November 10, that several submissions he received referred to the “securitization of campus.” The report also states that “for some people on campus, security agents were the outward manifestation of the injunction [against MUNACA].”
The Independent Student Inquiry into the events of November 10 noted that a common theme throughout its 33 testimonials was “a strong sense of disapproval and disappointment at McGill Security’s response [to November 10].”
Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell stated in an interview that relations between Security Services and students have been damaged – “there’s no question about that.”
“It doesn’t take many incidents to tarnish the image, at least in the views of some,” Nicell added.
In an email to The Daily, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa stated that the University has the “utmost confidence in the qualifications and experience of those who manage our Security Services.”
Agent breakdown
McGill Security contracts its agents from a private security agency, Securitas.
According to the Jutras Report, under regular circumstances at McGill’s downtown campus, there are up to 12 agents on duty. Due to construction projects, between 15 and twenty additional agents are on duty in order to secure the construction sites.
Last semester, additional agents were assigned to “strike-related duties.” On November 10,  six agents were performing such duties.
Agents on “strike-related duties” amounted to a maximum of twenty additional agents, according to Jutras’ report.
Five McGill employees are responsible for managing Security Services’ operations and have managerial authority in circumstances necessitating a response or intervention.
Training
Securitas agents who regularly work at McGill receive between 64 and 144 hours of on-site training in specific operating procedures, depending on their position.
All McGill employees within Security Services are trained in non-violent crisis intervention. Since last June, training on social diversity and equity issues has also been provided to these employees.
Securitas agents are subject to the Private Security Act, which establishes regulations and standards for Quebec’s private security industry. The Act applies to private security activities, which are provided to a client for a fee and generally occur on the client’s property.
To obtain an agent license in Quebec, an applicant must demonstrate to the Bureau de la sécurité privée, the body enforcing the Act, that they have the professional and practical skills necessary – an interview and/or examination process may be instated at the Bureau’s discretion, along with meeting the requirements specified in the Act.
The Act requires an applicant to be of “good moral character,” to never have been convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code (unless they have been pardoned), be a minimum of 18 years old, and have completed the required training.
For security guards, required training is the completion of a 70-hour training course offered by a private security guarding program, which provides a transcript of marks issued from the school board. The course costs about $500. However, the Bureau will also accept applicants whose “level of knowledge and skills [are] equivalent to the training required.”
The Act states that, in a context like McGill where private security is not the University’s “business,” only persons whose main activities are private security activities are required to hold an agent license. Under the Act, the immediate superior of a security agent, who must hold an agent license, is not required to have undergone any training, as long as they personally do not carry out any private security activities themselves.
Nicell explained his role in incidents involving security at McGill.
“Security Services are a people that are trained to respond to an emergency situation, mobilize in a very short term. In some situations, what they require is authorizations or they may require input, advice on how to react. This is not about a protest per say,” he said.
On November 10, Nicell said that he immediately went to the scene “to be a resource person.”
It is unclear if McGill employees within Security Services – in particular, the seven employees who are deployed in the event of a security intervention or response – or their superiors, are required to hold agent licenses. Security Services declined multiple requests to comment on this article, citing an interview as “premature” in light of Principal Heather Munroe-Blum’s forthcoming plans to implement recommendations from Jutras’ report.
 
Perceptions of McGill Security
Josh Redel, president of the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), said EUS has worked closely with McGill Security’s community relations team on events like Open Air Pub and Frosh.
The team was created about a decade ago to emphasize prevention and community relations. Two McGill employees are responsible for the team.
Though Redel described the community relations team from past years as “very polite, very approachable – good at what they did,” he noted a recent change in EUS’s relationship with the team.
Redel described EUS’s interaction with McGill Security on November 10. Redel was inside the entrance of the McConnell Engineering building when two Securitas agents arrived on the scene, searching for the EUS office.
“They were instructed to search EUS and all other student lounges in the building to see if we were housing protestors,” he said.
The agents searched the EUS lounge and found no protestors.
“That’s really offensive to send Security to search our office. That’s really not okay with us, especially [since] we have a really good relationship with them,” Redel added.
Nicell explained his view on changes to the operation of the community relations team.
“It used to be that there was one person, [who] just kept visiting place after place after place.”
“We want to broaden it a little bit because it’s not about an individual – it’s about communicating. It’s about every person in a responsible position constantly trying to renew and maintain good relationships,” he continued.
Nicell said McGill Security’s community relations team is “probably less overt than it used to be, but it’s not a dead issue, that’s for sure.”
“We’ve been shifting our resources here and there because of the limited resources. I think what we’re going to try to do is beef it up a little bit more,” he said.
The “human-on-human approach”
McGill Security does not have a complete monopoly on campus security. In the Shatner building, SSMU employs its own security force that operates separately from McGill Security.
SSMU Security Supervisor Wallace Sealy explained that, “There used to be a time when I would solely report to McGill, but over the years I’ve broadened that to have a better relationship with the police. So we do more communication with the police than we do with McGill, but we do advise them of anything that’s going on that’s detrimental to the students.”
The SSMU security force consists of five agents that report to Sealy. SSMU agents receive different training than McGill’s agents, being trained directly by Sealy in what he calls the “human-on-human approach.”
“Since I’ve been at SSMU, I’ve made it one of my top priorities that anybody that works for this department understands that we’re providing a service,” Sealy explained.
When Sealy started working at SSMU in 2004, he explained that both McGill administration and students were looking for a change in security operations at SSMU.
“The only problems that we do get into [are] when we’re using outside companies and they’re dressed in our shirts,” Sealy said.
SSMU, like McGill, contracts private security agents from external companies for special events when additional personnel are required. All of SSMU’s agents are holders of agent licenses as recognized under the Private Security Act.
SSMU executives are also incorporated into Shatner’s security operations. SSMU President Maggie Knight explained that executives receive training from Sealy at the start of their term.
“We are part of that team…because we know the building well, people will know us, and hopefully recognize us as some people who are supposed to know what’s going, who are supposed to be able to direct things,” Knight said.

Media scrutiny over her and McGill’s role in the Quebec asbestos industry led to Roshi Chadha’s decision
Roshi Chadha, member-at-large on McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG), took a leave of absence last Thursday as media scrutiny mounts over her and McGill’s role in the Quebec asbestos industry.
Chadha is director of the export company Seja Trade Ltd., which exported asbestos – primarily to India – from the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec for 16 years, until the mine suspended operations last fall.
The company is a subsidiary of Balcorp Ltd., which is owned by her husband, Baljit Chadha. He sits on Concordia University’s Board of Governors.
Balcorp is seeking a $58-million loan from the Quebec government to re-open the Jeffrey Mine.
Roshi Chadha also took a leave of absence from her position on the Board of Directors of the St. Mary’s Hospital Foundation, and resigned from the Canadian Red Cross’s Board of Governors over two weeks ago.
Chadha said in a statement that she is proud of her contributions to the various boards, and that she expects to contribute again in the future.
“I have worked tirelessly in public institutions that are important to me, and I appreciate the many supportive messages that have demonstrated appreciation for my efforts,” she said.
“I do not want my personal and professional life to interfere with the governance and performance of institutions that are important to me and to society. My values, principles, integrity, and professional interests remain intact,” she continued.
Chadha has sat on McGill’s BoG since 2003 . Her second and final term as a member-at-large ends in 2013.
In a statement, Chair of the Board Stuart Cobbett said, “Mrs. Chadha is a distinguished senior volunteer in the McGill community, and has given years of sustained service to the University through a range of important roles and contributions.”
“We respect her wishes, though reluctantly, and look forward to her return,” he continued.
Ron Critchley, BoG administrative and support staff representative, said, “I’ve been extremely impressed by [Chadha’s] loyalty and dedication to the University.”
Kathleen Ruff, senior human rights advisor with the Ottawa-based  Rideau Institute, said she was surprised at McGill’s continued support of Chadha, citing international scientific consensus on health threats posed by asbestos.
“If you [play] a key role in an academic institution, you should show a commitment to the clear science, and to the clear scientific facts,” said Ruff. “Someone who is on the Board of Governors of McGill should be supporting the public interest.”

Article updated Feb. 6, 2012
At last Thursday’s Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) Council meeting, President Akshay Rajaram confirmed that SUS will be holding its first General Assembly (GA) for undergraduate science students.
Rajaram told The Daily that the major motivations for the GA are issues that students are facing, namely tuition hikes and the possibility of a general student strike. The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) has held two GAs this year; both have dealt with similar issues.
The upcoming GA will be the first in SUS history. Rajaram claimed that it had not previously been necessary for the SUS to hold its own GA.
In reaction to the failures of the recent SSMU and AUS GAs to reach quorum, Rajaram expressed his concerns.
“You really can’t predict the way that the GA will turn out. It really matters on the issues being discussed,” said Rajaram.
“At this point, I really can’t comment on what motions are going to be. And until we know what the motions are, we can’t predict the attendance of the GA,” he continued.
Cyrille Lavigne, VP External for the Department of Chemistry, said Science students are “strongly apolitical in general.”
“Science people don’t usually read the news and keep informed about politics,” he said. “I don’t go to [SSMU] GAs, personally.”
“I feel if there is [an SUS] GA, it would be the same thing, and I think most students will still not care. Having a forum is important, but then you need people to talk in that forum,” he continued.
On the other hand, members of the Science Mobilization Committee (SMC), an unofficial student organization mobilizing against tuition hikes, believe that having an SUS GA is important.
Matthew Henry, a U2 Mathematics student and a member of the SMC, said, “Because we’ve realized that we don’t have much mobilization power yet, that’s why we need to get things going. The first thing we need to is to get the GA started, and then have a general mandate against tuition hikes.”
Another member of the SMC, Aidan Drake, added, “A GA should happen every semester, at least once a year, to consult the students.”
During the meeting, the GA bylaws were also amended to only take motions submitted two weeks before the GA. Rajaram explained that this is necessary to make sure everything discussed in the GA is within the scope of SUS.
After The Daily went to press, SUS Speaker Matthew Dolson confirmed that the GA will be held February 29, with motions due two days before.
At least 125 students must be present to make quorum, and at least fifty students must be present to constitute a consultative forum.

Administration sends mass email as demonstration approaches campus
Last Thursday, around 100 students marched from Concordia to Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) to protest impending tuition hikes.
Protestors stopped at McGill and Cégep du Vieux Montréal to gather more students. The march was organized by members of the Concordia and McGill Mob Squads.
When the march reached McGill, protestors chanted outside of McLennan library, marched through the Shatner building during the Public Service Career Fair, and outside of the James Administration building. A banner was dropped from the top of the Arts building reading, “même menace, même lutte.”
Escorted by police, the march ended at UQAM, where another banner was hung.
McGill students were notified of the march by an email sent by Associate VP (University Services) Jim Nicell. The email described the march as “peaceful” and promised that “more information will be sent to you when available or as needed.”
Nicell was not available for comment on why the administration deemed the email necessary, less than a week after VP (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa sent an email to all staff and students warning of a demonstration that never took place.
Largely organized by Concordia students, the demonstration is part of the lead-up to a province-wide demonstration against tuition hikes on March 22.
Last month, the Concordia Student Union (CSU) called for a strike vote on March 7.
After CSU called for the vote, Concordia Provost David Graham sent an email to students clarifying the administration’s position on the call for a strike vote.
“Regardless of the outcome of the March 7 vote, Concordia intends to continue operating as usual… The university has a responsibility to provide services that are part of its agreement with our students, even if some of those students decide not to attend class as a form of protest,” the email read.
The CSU isn’t worried about the administration’s response. “There was no backlash against this letter. It was a predictable move. We see it as a positive thing because they are afraid and are trying to pre-empt and prevent [the strike] with fear-mongering,” said CSU VP External Chad Walcott.
Concordia administration did not show a strong response to Thursday’s march, according to Walcott. “We were only notified that banners had been dropped and that we could come and pick them up,” he added.

SSMU’s Board of Directors discusses constitutional changes
The highest authority in SSMU met last Thursday to vote on recommendations about the future of the Judicial Board (J-Board).
The meeting followed the SSMU Board of Directors’ (BoD) decision on January 26 to suspend all J-Board activities pending a review of its structure within the SSMU Constitution.
The recommendations aimed to ensure SSMU’s compliance with the Quebec Corporations Act and the province’s Accreditation Act by constitutionally recognizing the BoD as the highest governing authority of SSMU.
Concerns over J-Board’s relationship to the BoD were raised in light of the current J-Board case, filed by students Zach Newburgh and Brendan Steven. The case contests the results of the QPIRG referendum question. Both students were present in the gallery at the BoD meeting.
The ad hoc Bylaw Review Committee met on January 30 to decide how to move forward. Its goals included protecting SSMU from liability while ensuring “a fair, unbiased method of addressing complaints/petitions.”
The committee decided it was in the best interest of all SSMU members for the J-Board to resume activity as soon as possible, and to hold hearings for current cases before reading week.
Members also agreed that the BoD must submit a question during the Winter Referendum period that would clarify the relationship between the BoD and J-Board.
The motion, debated Thursday by BoD members, sought to reinstate activities of the J-Board immediately, with consideration of the recommended constitutional changes. The motion passed with eight BoD members in favour, one against, and three abstentions.
Constitutional recommendations put forward by the J-Board – which were then reviewed by the Bylaw Committee – include amending the current provision that J-Board is “the final authority” on the interpretation of the SSMU Constitution and By-laws of the Society to J-Board having “the authority to adjudicate” on those matters.
Gabriel Joshee-Arnal, a law student and legal advocate in the current J-Board case, was in the gallery and asked for clarification regarding the motion’s application to the current case.
In response, VP External Joël Pedneault proposed an amendment and explained that the motion is only in effect until the Winter Referendum period is complete. The amendment read, “With the additional provision that decisions made by the J-Board which are unreasonable, or contrary to its procedures, may also be overturned by the SSMU BoD.”
Pedneault said that he hoped this would “keep the logic that the BoD can overturn a decision of the J-Board for clearly demonstrable reasons,” and maintain compliance with Quebec law as soon as J-Board activities resume.
During debate on the amendment, Newburgh said that he was “concerned about ‘unreasonable’ and whether it can be used to overturn a decision for political reasons.”
Arts Representative Isabelle Bi also expressed that she was “worried about the use of the term ‘unreasonable’,” but Joshee-Arnal clarified that it is a standard legal grading.
The amendment passed, along with one put forward by Arts Representative Jamie Burnett, which called for SSMU to create a working group “to investigate democratic avenues of resolving issues of constitutionality” in the spirit of placing SSMU’s general membership at the foreground of decision-making processes.
Review of the SSMU’s Constitution and Bylaws is ongoing. “The goal is to have a full by-law review done by the end of this year,” said SSMU President Maggie Knight.
Newburgh and Steven’s case will be heard Monday.

A handful of McGill administration, SSMU executives, and students met to discuss student space on Friday during the latest SSMU strategic summit.
Some of the topics at hand included the lack of usable student space, informal spaces for students to work, and campus greening.
SSMU President Maggie Knight led the summit with SSMU VP Clubs and Services Carol Fraser. Knight asked the group at the beginning to consider what is student space – and what is non-student space – on campus. The issue came up throughout the afternoon, as the Shatner building itself is not owned by students, but rented from the University.
The small size of the gathering gave students the chance to come up with ideas on how to tackle the issue of student space and brainstorm ideas with administrators on how to improve already existing spaces.
Katie Larson, president of Music Undergraduate Student Association (MUSA), spoke to concerns within her faculty.
“Space is always a big concern in music, as we always have so many small groups going on and individuals who always need space on campus,” she explained.
The main issue was the need for space for students outside of class time. Jim Nicell, Associate Vice-Principal (University Services), told The Daily, “Students are looking for more informal space. A lot of their day-to-day life is not just inside a classroom.”
Nicell said that McGill is working to convert under-utilized space into areas that can be used by students.
“Think of Cybertheque: that used to be dry storage, and now it’s one of the most occupied spaces at in the entire university,” he said.

Police repression and student movements were the topics at this year’s first graduate colloquium in the Department of Sociology. Université du Québec a Montréal (UQAM) Political Science professor Francis Dupuis-Déri, discussed the relation between the police, student movements, and ideological considerations.
The question session that followed alluded to attitudes and roles of university administrations, police forces, professors, and student bodies at McGill, UQAM, and elsewhere.
According to Dupuis-Déri, the student movement incurs the strongest police crackdown. “In Quebec, in the last 20 years, there have been at least 1,000 arrests targeting the student movement, making, I believe, the student movement the most repressed,” he said.
Dupuis-Déri claimed that the police apparatus and its ideological base tend to fall along specific class lines. “As a student, what you are supposed to do at university is to study, to get a job. In the eye of the cops, you are privileged. The cop is a worker,” he explained.
What makes a “legitimate” protestor in the eyes of the police was one of the questions Dupuis-Déri sought to address.
“In a nutshell, a ‘legitimate’ protestor is a white, employed, middle-class father,” he argued.
Reasons for this include the political perception of the average police officer, demographics amongst the police forces, as well as the simple degree to which an officer identifies with the participants of a demonstration.
Another topic discussed was the idea of university campuses as unique sites of political expression with some degree of intellectual immunity, acting as sanctuary from the use of corporate heavy-handedness and police violence. In Greece, for instance, police are not allowed to even set foot upon a university campus. The incident of riot police on McGill’s campus on November 10 was raised.
One student at the colloquium shared the following anecdote: “A friend of mine who was pepper sprayed on November 10[at McGill] asked the police officer: ‘Hey, aren’t you supposed to be protecting humans and students?’ The police officer replied, ‘Yeah, but also private property’.”
Much of the subsequent discussion concerned the role of academic literature to further understanding of student movements, interaction between the police and university administrations, and how to implement change within the police institution.
