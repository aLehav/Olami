Agreement comes after four years of negotiations
After several years of negotiations, the McGill administration and the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) signed the lease of the student union building last week. The agreed-upon lease spans ten years, from 2011 to 2021, and ascribes one quarter of utilities expenses to SSMU, a cost previously taken on entirely by the University.
The signed lease sees an increase in rent costs with SSMU paying $130,000 in rent for the current academic year, as well as $100,000 in energy costs. Rent will continue to increase by $5,000 a year up to $165,000 in the 2020-21 academic year, and energy costs will increase yearly according to inflation.
Under the newly-signed lease, SSMU will pay a total of $230,000 for the 2013-14 year, whereas it paid a total of $110,000 in 2010-11, the final year covered by the previous lease.
The Society will seek to cover these increased costs by introducing a non-opt-outable student fee of $6.08 per semester for full-time students and $3.04 per semester for part-time students. The fee would also be indexed to a rate of 5.6 per cent to cover yearly increases in rent and utilities. The implementation of these fees, however, is up for approval by undergraduate students in the upcoming winter referendum.
Throughout the negotiations, the duration and financial responsibilities of the building’s utilities were the main points of contention.
SSMU VP University Affairs Joey Shea told The Daily in an interview that “most other student associations within Canada pay a symbolic $1 for their rent, or their structure is different and they don’t pay anything.”
According to Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) (DPSLL) Ollivier Dyens, the University asked SSMU to assume the utility costs due to constraints in McGill’s financial situation.
“It’s just because it’s very expensive. We are still paying for three quarters of the utility costs, and we are having budgetary issues, same as SSMU. We have to be responsible to our constituents, the university, the way SSMU has to do the same thing with its members,” Dyens told The Daily.
Shea also said that the way McGill chose to negotiate with SSMU delayed the signing of the lease. Following various instances of miscommunication between the two parties, Shea and SSMU President Katie Larson decided to negotiate with the Deputy Provost directly.
“The most important decision that we made this year was asking McGill to send the DPSLL and not a proxy from McGill Legal to the negotiation table. Having a more clear line of communication definitely made it easier to come to agreements. It is clear to me that being able to talk to the DPSLL directly made it easier to get SSMU’s concerns and points across, since they were not going through a third party,” Larson told The Daily in an email.
The first public impasse in negotiations came in 2011, when SSMU signed the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) – a document that outlines McGill and SSMU’s legal rights and responsibilities to each other – but decided against signing the lease. At the time, then-SSMU President Maggie Knight expressed financial concerns over a structure that required SSMU to “take over the responsibilities of the utilities.”
The 2012-13 SSMU executive, led by then-President Josh Redel, also publicly expressed concerns when it drafted a letter stating, “These negotiations could vastly affect student fees by mandating a significant increase to the SSMU base fee in order to maintain continued operations.”
“We understand that running a building costs money, but this is a contribution to the entire McGill community that SSMU needs help with in order to operate. Student life on the McGill campus has a massive value for the University, and we ask that McGill acknowledges [sic] this in ways more tangible than philosophical agreements,” the executive wrote.
Despite these disagreements, both Shea and Dyens stated that a major part of the negotiation was done in the previous years by different teams of executives and administrators.
Shea commented on the difficulty of the negotiation process, despite being satisfied at the completion of the process after four years.
“You reach a point where you realize that there is a huge power differential between SSMU and McGill and no matter what we are going to be in this building and they are pretty much setting the terms of the negotiation,” Shea said. “After four years of negotiations there comes a point where you have to sign something.”

Post-grads endorse Library’s plan to go smoke-free
During its February session, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Council approved a motion to endorse the McGill Library’s plan to designate the McLennan-Redpath terrace as a smoke-free environment. The plan, which has also been endorsed by the University Health and Safety Committee as well as the Senate Committee on Physical Development, will be reviewed in one year to determine whether or not the designation should be continued.
The motion was brought to the table by PGSS Academic Affairs Officer Adam Bouchard. “I motivated the motion by describing how the redesigned space funnels all users through a single entrance that was being heavily used by smokers,” Bouchard told The Daily in an email. “In addition, the cigarette waste generated was killing all the plants, as the butts were not being put into the ash trays.”
Bouchard has been involved in discussions with the Library’s administrative staff, who have been trying to devise a strategy to decrease the amount of smoking on the terrace since it opened for use in January. “Student input helped define the size and scope [of the smoke-free area], in addition to the timeline,” wrote Bouchard. “We were quite involved.”
The Library began its initiative after receiving dozens of complaints about smoking on the terrace. “Because we now have one entrance and exit for the main library […] almost anybody who has to come in from the door has to walk through where a lot of people are smoking,” Trenholme Dean of Libraries Colleen Cook told The Daily. “We got an enormous number of complaints from students about smoking and about having to walk through [crowds of] people who are smoking, as well as staff and other users.”
According to Cook, complaints have also been made about the large number of cigarette butts that litter the library’s entrance.
According to Diane Koen, Senior Director, Planning and Resources for the McGill University Library, the Library has been discussing the issue with McGill Health and Safety, the Dean of Students, the Head of Facilities, and security, as well as student organizations such as the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), Sustainability McGill, and PGSS.
The Library hopes to officially launch the terrace as smoke-free on May 1, according to Merika Ramundo, the Library’s Communications Officer. Students and staff smoking on the terrace will be unaffected until the end of the Winter term.
When told about the initiative, smokers outside McLennan seemed surprised but accommodating. “It would be annoying, but we’re used to smokers getting less space to smoke,” said an IT Technician who works for the Library.
Zine, a U3 Political Science student who was smoking on the terrace, noted that he did not understand why the entire area should be smoke-free.
To accommodate those who would normally smoke on the terrace, the Library will establish two designated smoking areas just outside the terrace: one to the north beside Morrice Hall and the other in front of Redpath Library. The Library will put up signs to distinguish smoke-free areas and areas designated for smoking.
When asked how the smoking zones will be enforced, Cook told The Daily that, “There is no big enforcement, there’s no way that we could do that anyway. This has to be a cultural change. […] It’s a very gentle recognition that we have a problem and it’s everybody’s problem, and hopefully we can create something and keep it very nice for everybody.”

Annual International Women’s Day sees strong support in Montreal
Every year, March 8 marks International Women’s Day, which draws attention to social and institutional gender inequalities across the globe. In Montreal, the day is celebrated with citywide events and demonstrations, such as the annual march, which has been organized since 2002 by the March 8 Committee of Women of Diverse Origins.
“There has been a very strong tradition of celebrating Women’s Day in Montreal,” Dolores Chew, President of the South Asian Women’s Community Centre, told McGill’s community radio station CKUT after the march. “We started organizing [the March 8 demonstration] because we felt that minority women – [meaning] women who were minorities either because of race, of language, age, any reason – were not getting out [to the demonstrations].”
Despite Montreal’s strong participation in International Women’s Day, for some it has not been without skepticism. “I think that [International Women’s Day] is often a thing that is co-opted by a lot of white Western women,” McGill student and staffer at the Union for Gender Empowerment Nicholle Savoie told The Daily.
“There’s this idea of solidarity in a woman’s experience, but this idea of a woman’s experience really often means a white, middle-class, Western woman’s experience,” Savoie said. “I’m not totally convinced of this idea of women as a whole, because I think that can often really [hide] difference of oppression.”
The theme of this year’s March 8 demonstration in Montreal was solidarity against precarity. According to Chew, the theme was meant to encompass the structural barriers that women, particularly minority women, face.
“It’s about the precariousness and insecurity of the lives of many women. [These can be] caused by things like economic austerity measures taken by governments that hit hardest the most vulnerable populations, [which are] usually women and other minorities.”
“The theme is on precariousness with regard to issues of health, reproductive health, [and] sexual violence,” Chew added. “We felt that more than ever we needed to draw attention to the precariousness of women’s lives.”
The day’s events began with a public meeting held at Dawson College, followed by the march. The march hosted speakers from different community organizations in Montreal, including the Filipino Women’s organization PINAY.
“[Since the typhoon] many women are still living in migration centres, or makeshift tents in their communities, which exposes them to greater health risks and gender-based violence,” a representative from PINAY told the crowd of demo attendees. “After the aftermath of the typhoon, a number of rape incidents were reported, and because of the lack of work and livelihood, many women are prone to [being trafficked].”
The subtitle of this year’s theme was “smash the glass cage.” Chew explained that despite people believing that there is legal equality and the public recognition of official women’s rights, in many parts of the world, there “are so many factors that keep women down, keep them back. So it’s a glass cage; it’s there but it’s not always as evident.” She added that often people’s experience was very different than legal forms of equality.
This year’s Women’s Day event also drew attention to the Charter of Values proposed by the Parti Quebecois (PQ), which seeks to ban all religious symbols for public employees in Quebec.
“The PQ’s Charter of Values was topmost on the minds of many of us [on the committee],” Chew said. “Not because we felt there is a problem with secularism, but we were really opposed to the way the government was using the notion of secularism to target vulnerable populations, particularly Muslim women and making an issue where there wasn’t and generating so much racism and xenophobia.”

McGill researchers find a partner in defence agency
Research at McGill is helping the Canadian military develop drone software for use in combat operations, according to documents obtained through the Access to Information (ATI) Act. Since 2011, the University has received more than $1 million in defence contracts from the Department of National Defence.
Inna Sharf, a professor of mechanical engineering at McGill who leads the school’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) research group, has been awarded three such contracts since 2004, exceeding the sum of $500,000. The sponsor, Canadian research facility Defence Research and Development Canada in Suffield (DRDC-Suffield), previously worked with Sharf on the development of the Platform for Ambulating Wheels (PAW), a four-legged ground robot developed at McGill.
Sharf’s current project, a contract entitled “Autonomous Support for UAVs” valued at over $380,000, intends to provide UAVs with the ability to land autonomously on static and moving targets, thereby reducing the operator’s workload and enhancing their capabilities for “data collection and surveillance missions.” The research is part of an overall plan by DRDC to develop “small, highly maneuverable UAVs for deployment in urban environments.” DRDC has been fostering intimate ties with universities, including their “academic partners from McGill University.”
DRDC-Suffield’s request for proposal, under which Sharf secured the contract, reads, “[UAVs] must not compromise operator safety but provide battle-space awareness that provides a force multiplier to the dismounted soldier unit.” Once completed, UAVs equipped with this technology will be able to “track and intercept” moving targets for autonomous navigation purposes.
Preliminary flight tests were carried out indoors in the Aerospace Mechatronics Laboratory, located in the Macdonald Engineering building, and the software was developed using computers from the Centre for Intelligent Machines Laboratory in the McConnell Engineering building. Fields at Macdonald campus were suggested as a potential outdoor takeoff and landing site due to their “access to a hangar, secluded open areas, and low rise buildings.”
In an interview, Sharf denied the military applications of her research. “My work focuses on making landing and taking off for UAV vehicles more autonomous,” she said.
While the technology could be applied to any type of UAV, Sharf emphasized the potential of her work in the civilian world. “There’s many applications: fire surveillance, harvest surveillance […] Police forces are using UAVs to help them with search and rescue operations. A couple of years ago, there was a successful use of UAVs to locate a person that had a car accident and that went out into the woods,” she said. “Without UAVs, they wouldn’t have found them.”
The research is still at an early stage, and the technology, Sharf noted, is not yet ready for outside use.
“I’m hoping more civilian companies will make use of this research. […] The commercial development of UAVs is still nascent, and we don’t have big companies in Canada that would be interested in funding this research, but ultimately, they will be the beneficiary of this research.”
Under the terms of the contract, the federal government owns the intellectual property rights to the work performed at McGill. Sharf, and the team under her supervision, can only use the product of their research for publication and academic purposes. DRDC-Suffield is not responsible for the potential applications of the technology it develops, and only the Canadian Forces can determine how the research is used. But Sharf, along with Michael Trentini, a DRDC-Suffield researcher who is listed as the contract’s technical authority, have written about the potential applications of unmanned vehicle research.
In 2006 Sharf and Trentini co-signed a paper addressing the utility of Unmanned Ground Vehicles “if they are to be used in military relevant roles and environments.” “[Unmanned] Ground Vehicles will be called upon to enter unknown city blocks to keep soldiers out of harm’s way,” they wrote. “[Unmanned Ground Vehicles] will contribute to homeland security, search and rescue, and peacekeeping roles abroad.”
At McGill, professors and graduate students are responsible for initiating the majority of the school’s research collaborations.
“Research contracts, on the other hand, can be initiated by third parties – often because the third party is seeking university researchers’ input to solve a problem or issue,” Rose Goldstein, Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations), wrote in an email.
“In all cases the researchers have complete freedom to decide if they want to engage in a research collaboration project or a service contract,” she wrote.
“McGill researchers conduct research with integrity and adhere to the highest ethical standards,” Goldstein said.
Two weeks ago, a group of protesters blocked the entrance to laboratories in the Macdonald Engineering building. The action was part of the ongoing Demilitarize McGill campaign, an effort by students to disrupt military research on campus. Last year, members of the group filed several ATI requests to obtain information on the University’s defence research.
In October, the Commission d’accès a l’information ruled against the University in a legal dispute in which the University alleged that it had been subject to a “complex system of repetitious and abusive requests” by students and journalists.
The ATIs remained unanswered for over a year until January, when the University settled with the respondents.

Communication, transparency, and student relations discussed
On Wednesday March 12, all 11 candidates for Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) executive positions faced off in a series of debates covering their past experiences and future plans. The debate was also livestreamed by Elections SSMU.
The debate held amongst the four candidates for the position of SSMU President, Tariq Khan, Austin Johnson, Aaron Friedland, and Courtney Ayukawa, largely emphasized improving SSMU-student relations.
“I think my lack of experience […] actually helps,” stated Friedland, whose experience largely extends to floor fellowing and facilitating Rez Project. “I understand the various barriers to enter into SSMU. I understand why students don’t enter SSMU […] so I can help ensure that they join.”
“I think the approach that we need to also take in the future is to educate [the students] on the policies,” added Khan. “How many people know about the Equity Policy? How many people know about the decisions [SSMU makes]?”
A member in the audience voiced their skepticism about the candidates’ promises to bridge the disconnect between the SSMU executive and undergraduate students. “One of the biggest disappointments I have with student politicians is that […] you’re running around different places and you pretend to care about everyone, and everyone sees your […] announcements. But as soon as you are in office, you disappear.”
In response, Ayukawa acknowledged the importance that SSMU actively engage with and give voice to the student body if she were to become president.
“I think it’s really important that the SSMU executives and myself [… do] not hide behind the door of that executive office. […] I have experience with going to my constituents and hearing their voice and I also recognize that I have personal opinions. But that doesn’t matter when I am SSMU President. The things that matter when being president [are the opinions] of my constituents,” said Ayukawa.
Johnson outlined how he would go about interacting with students through social media. “[The fact that] I would like to engage with students is something that I have reiterated [… with] micro-blogging and hopefully individual Twitters, things that students can [use to] reach out to me.”
“How would you address situations in executive meetings where you have to make decisions that, from a legal standpoint, will act as a corporation and not as a student union?” asked a participant.
“If you want this position […] it’s not easy. It’s not going to get easier and easier for the next person that does this job. […] It’s just the nature of this position. It is a business and it needs to be successful for it to be there,” said Johnson.
The VP External debate between Amina Moustaqim-Barrette and Enbal Singer showed the platform divide between the two candidates. Moustaqim-Barrette is focused on political campaigns, while Singer plans to further unite the McGill community with surrounding neighbourhoods, and work with the municipal government.
Both candidates expressed concern toward the outcome of the upcoming election and potential problems SSMU will face with a PQ majority.
Singer said that she hoped to work more closely with the municipal government, insisting, “I think that a lot of students don’t realize that municipal governments can act as a sort of a buffer for provincial legislation that could potentially impact the city.”
In contrast, Moustaqim-Barrette stated that she wanted to align McGill with other Montreal universities in a coalition, saying that she has “been in contact with Concordia, UQAM, and UdeM and they’re all willing and wanting to work with us on these issues.”
The issue of French language skills was brought up in the context of communicating with Montreal and Quebec universities. While Moustaqim-Barrette is bilingual, she pointed to Singer’s lack of bilingualism as a potential problem.
Kathleen Bradley is running unopposed for VP Finance and Operations. Bradley has experience as the Head Chef of The Nest, the student-run café, and spoke on her vision for the future of the café. “[The Nest] was always meant to be a physical space for community engagement and right now we’ve only been able to really realize the food service aspect of it,” said Bradley.
When asked about the financial impact of SSMU’s new lease for the Shatner building, Bradley told the audience, “We’re definitely going to have to incur a lot of energy expenses, which we’ve been planning for the last two years. Both [the VP Finance and Operations] this year and last year have been planning for the uncertainty of the lease negotiations, and have been budgeting fairly conservatively.”
J. Daniel Chaim is running unopposed for VP Internal. When asked for his strategies to better engage students, Chaim responded with his plan to implement a SSMU calendar that could contain “SSMU events, faculty events, groups events, and I’ll keep in constant contact with VPs to keep it updated.”
He also expressed that “a lot of people don’t use social media as much as we think they do […] finding more mediums is another thing I’d like to research and work on.”
Despite briefly stating concerns about equity in his platform, Chaim failed to address equity in an substantive manner or give any concrete suggestions to reform Frosh.
Stefan Fong, the incumbent candidate for the VP Clubs & Services position, and Sandhya Sabapathy, discussed issues such as funding for clubs, accomplishments, and plans for improvement.
Fong pointed to Activities Night, where the space was expanded to better accommodate all clubs and services who wanted to participate, as one of his accomplishments over the past year.
As part of her platform, Sabapathy brought up ‘Clubpedia’, an idea originally pushed by former VP Clubs & Services Allison Cooper, which would function as a Wikipedia for all the clubs and services available at McGill. This project, according to Sabapathy, would cut down on the learning curve and help smoothen the transition between club executives.
The two candidates also discussed the transparency of funding for clubs and services. Sabapathy pointed to a lack of understanding among clubs, along with a lack of transparency, and asserted that they both created confusion. To combat this, Sabapathy suggested laying out a full plan by the beginning of the year and holding information sessions.
The timing of applications and approvals was the major barrier to transparency in Fong’s eyes. “I want to change the clubs timeline [for funding] so that clubs can apply a lot sooner, and get answers sooner about when they’re getting their money.”
The VP University Affairs position is also uncontested. During the debate, the sole candidate, Claire Stewart-Kanigan, answered questions related to equity, mental health, and academic policy.
Joey Shea, the outgoing VP University Affairs, asked Stewart-Kanigan several questions regarding academic policy ­– the largest part of the portfolio – as well as the new mental health policy that was established this year.
Stewart-Kanigan spoke to the importance of implementing the Academic Assessment Policy, saying, “We do have a really great […] policy that exists in the university. For example, the academic policy promoting student mental health by not allowing profs to have exams […] worth over 75 per cent – making sure that these kind of policies are actually adhered to will make a big difference in the day-to-day lives of students.”
Regarding the to-be-formed mental health committee, she said, “I think the mental health committee is going to provide a very excellent forum for bringing groups across campus together to discuss issues that are important to them […] having that body to consult with on a regular basis as well as having [the new mental health coordinator].”
Stewart-Kanigan also said that, regarding this year’s tensions with SSMU’s Equity Policy, she said that she would have taken the opportunity to discuss equity in a more productive manner, especially with the potential for revisions to the policy.
“I think that connecting students with the research that’s already going on with the equity policy as soon as possible would have been a good step.”

Heated discussion over upcoming Midnight Kitchen referendum question
The Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its second hustings of this election period on Tuesday at Thomson House. Executive candidates, as well as chairpersons for referendum question committees, debated and answered questions in front of a crowd of around 40.
Many of the candidates’ platforms noted the necessity of ending PGSS’s ongoing legal battle with the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS). PGSS has been involved in the court case since the CFS refused to recognize the result of a disaffiliation referendum held by PGSS in 2010.
When asked for their position on the issue, all of the candidates reiterated their commitment to leaving the federation. “I personally think that the CFS is one of the most corrupt organizations I have ever encountered, and the sooner we can leave, the better,” said Nikki Meadows, Financial Affairs Officer candidate.
Internal Affairs candidate GeSa and Member Services candidate Brighita Lungu raised mental health as a major issue for graduate students. Current Member Services Officer Elizabeth Cawley asked the candidates what they would do in their position to improve students’ mental health.
“We need to sit down professors and staff at McGill and tell them: we do have a problem,” said Juan Camilo Pinto, Secretary-General candidate. “We need an honest debate on how professors are handling this issue with their students. Are they actually aware that there is a huge problem at McGill?”
Jennifer Murray, one of the candidates for Academic Affairs Officer, spoke to the necessity of raising awareness and destigmatizing mental health. She emphasized her desire to work on improving student-supervisor relationships to ensure that students are “academically engaged, happy, and able to complete their work on time in the way that they want to.”
In the debate period, Murray’s opponent Behrang Sharif cast doubt on Murray’s level of preparation for the position, noting that her first PGSS Council attendance was “last month.”
Murray countered later that, while new, she has the necessary enthusiasm and leadership experience for the position.
All other candidates – who are all running as a slate, which has a common platform – did not take part in debates, as they are running unopposed for their respective positions.
McGill Graduate Association of Political Studies Students representative Lorenzo Daieff urged PGSS members to vote in favour of a fee levy of $0.50 per semester to allow the Midnight Kitchen collective to expand its operations. The Midnight Kitchen provides free daily vegan lunches to around 250 students, and is currently exclusively financed by an undergraduate fee levy of $3.25 per semester.
Jonathan Mooney, current Secretary-General and chairperson of the ‘No’ committee for this question, objected to the fee levy on the grounds that the Midnight Kitchen, as a SSMU service, is not accountable to PGSS. He contrasted it with other services like CKUT, where PGSS members sit on the board of directors.
Daieff responded that some members of the collective are, in fact, graduate students.
An audience member expressed surprise at the intensity of the debate, remarking that the fee only amounts to $6 after a six-year PhD program. Daieff added that the fee would also be opt-outable. “If you don’t want to pay $6 dollars over the course of your PhD because you want to use that for research funding, you can.”
Adam Bouchard, current Academic Affairs Officer, recommended that PGSS members approve a non-opt-outable $3 dollar per semester fee to the Athletics Building Improvement Fund, which would help finance a turf improvement project on the McTavish Reservoir.
Cawley voiced her support for the project, but spoke against the fee levy, asserting that the Athletics budget is mismanaged. According to Cawley, graduate students should oppose the fee levy as a tactic to send the message that McGill Athletics “should look at their budgeting.”
The PGSS election and referendum period runs from March 13 to 21.
