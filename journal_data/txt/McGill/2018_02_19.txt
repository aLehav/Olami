Ahed Tamimi’s trial began at the Ofer Military Court on February 13 behind closed doors, as an Israeli military judge banned media from entering the court. Tamimi’s trial has been deemed illegal by United Nations human rights investigators, who stated that it violates her rights under international law. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also condemned Tamimi’s detention. Tamimi garnered international media attention in December, after a video of her slapping and hitting Israeli soldiers went viral. Every year, the state of Israel detains and prosecutes 500 to 700 Palestinian children as it continues to illegally occupy the Palestinian West Bank.

According to a report published in December 2017, the economic, social, and economic crisis in Venezuela has caused more than one million people to leave the country between 2014 and 2017. Of the entire population of forced migrants, only 103,000 have requested refugee status, in the region and in Spain. In 2017, 17,130 demands for refugee status were registered by the Brazilian Federal Police. Brazil and other neighbouring countries are reinforcing police and military presence on their border with Venezuela, boxing in the country’s citizens to face famine and social unrest.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported that ethnic violence has pushed over 22,000 people to flee from the north-east of the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) to Uganda. In total, 34,000 people have fled the province of Ituri since the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of the month, thirty people have been killed following fighting between Hema herders and Lendu farmers of the province. In December 2016, President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his term coming to an end, leading 120,000 to flee the country in 2017. Domestic and international fear of a new civil war in the DRC increases as ethnic clashes continue in the central African country.

The establishment of “Modicare” was announced at the Indian union budget meeting for 2018-2019. The program will allow about half of the Indian population to gain access to health insurance. While the government has described the scheme as “the world’s largest government funded health care program,” the government has come under criticism. The programme is described as an initiative to court poor rural voters in next year’s general election, as many of them struggle with high healthcare costs. India currently is one of the world’s lowest spenders in public health, with only about one percent of its GDP being invested in the sector. The country is also plagued by a shortage of hospitals and doctors, but the government has taken steps towards making health services more accessible.

On Monday February 20, around twenty protesters gathered in front of the Parc Metro station to denounce a luxury apartment project at Plaza Hutchison. The group shared testimonies in front of the Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension city hall, then marched along Hutchison with banners reading  “Parc-Ex stands up for dignity,” all accompanied by five police vehicles. 
The building in question, located at 7300 Hutchison, was purchased by the BSR Group last year, illegally pushing out residents with 32 days’ notice to vacate the building, as well as many associations. The 70 unit apartment complex will be listed according to housing “market prices.” Housing prices are  expected to increase with the opening of the new Université de Montréal campus in 2019. In response, community groups in Park Extension have mobilized against the gentrification of the community and eviction of residents. 
“Some places didn’t even have heating for months, […] no maintenance, no garbage collection, […] tenants started to have mice and rat problems.”
Intimidation and eviction of tenants
While the BSR group currently lacks a permit for construction work on the building, community members have alleged that Ron Basal, the project manager and BSR director, has been illegally evicting tenants to pave way for the apartment project since last year. 
“There’s a lot of people in the community that are very concerned because of what is going on with the 7300 Hutchison […] He started intimidating people into leaving, and evicting them without respecting the leases,” stated  Bernadette*, a member of Parc-Ex Contre la Gentrification, a group opposed to the redevelopment. 
Tenants who had  a lease agreement with the previous property owner were not informed of the transaction by BSR. On March 8, 2017, the building was registered under Baruch Basal in the Quebec business registry. Since then, the BSR Group has claimed to have changed the terms of leases that now run on a monthly basis. 
“People sometimes don’t know what their leases are, […] what their rights are,” said Bernadette. “Tenants have been evicted by various methods. They were called, and asked to leave the building.”
Residents received eviction letters and were told to vacate the space by construction contractors. Maintenance of broken amenities have stopped, further pressuring the tenants to leave. The freight elevator, which broke down after a basement flooding last March, was not repaired, forcing elderly tenants to leave the building. 
“They weren’t going to climb four, five flights of stairs to go there [to the upper floors],” said Bernadette. 
This January, the landlord threatened to cut off water, gas, and electricity for tenants who refused to leave. Currently, there are only a few residents left in the Plaza building, who will be forced out in July, when their leases terminate. 
“By actually not even providing the basic services in the building people pay for […] some places didn’t even have heating for months, […] no maintenance, no garbage collection, […] tenants started to have mice and rat problems,” said Bernadette. 
City response to illegal construction
The Montreal Police has halted BSR’s construction twice, with notices and fines, ranging from $1000 to $2,800 under Quebec law. However, according to John*, a Parc Ex resident, Basal broke leases, and circumvented authorities by working at night. 
“As a neighbour […] it makes me very mad that something like that can happen and the authorities are okay, and giving him a permit to [continue].”
Bernadette told The Daily that the fines do little to halt construction, and that the BSR are expecting permits from the city soon. 
“He had fines, but they’re such small fines for him it doesn’t mean anything,” told Bernadette. 
Adeel Hayat, a resident of Parc-Ex criticized the city’s inaction in response to the construction and BSR’s treatment of residents.
“The city is going to do what? […] put a little sticker on his door saying, ‘Hey, here’s a fine of a few hundred dollars, please don’t do that.’ What does this say to the people here? […] that people who buy this place can break the rules and do whatever the hell they want? […] and even the people who […] enforce those rules won’t say anything! What does that say?”
Hayat also expressed anger over the amount of policing during the protest: ten police cars surrounded the area, with five accompanying the march. 
“Instead of giving us any idea of what they could do to help us, […] they deployed this many police [officers],” said Hayat.
Hayat emphasized that the Plaza Hutchison is located in eye’s view of the borough city hall, where the Comité Consultatif d’Urbanisme’s (CCU) meeting discussing Basal’s permit request was taking place. 
“In the matter of few months, the new owner who bought the building […] he really feels like he can […] he can do construction in eye’s view […] from the building that gives permits right across the street.”
“We want to send a message to all developers that […] projects like this are not welcome here and that we will resist them wherever they show up.”
CCU meeting 
A recommendation for a permit by the CCU will pave way for it to be potentially adopted at the next borough meeting, allowing further construction. The meeting held on February 13 was closed to the public. Bernadette told The Daily: “the CCU, the identity of its members, the agendas […] are absolutely not transparent. […] What we’re not comfortable with is the fact that […] their meetings are not public.”
The day of the protest, the city hall doors were guarded by police officers to prevent entry. After being individually patted down, protesters were allowed inside. Eventually, Bernadette was allowed to speak to the council, but noted that the document elaborating the communityís position to the council was not adequately considered.
During the meeting, Bernadette asked Sylvain Ouellette, the councillor for the Francois-Perrault district, whether the council had read the community report. According to Bernadette, Ouellette mentioned that he had given ‘the big lines’ of the document to the council instead of distributing the full, 4 page report.
“Are you serious?” said Bernadette, “urbanism is not only about bricks and tiles […], it’s also about the usage of the community.”
“We think that the borough should take responsibility for what’s going on,” said Bernadette. “It’s right in front of their door, they know exactly what is happening, they see the tenants being evicted one after the other, they […] see the demolition and construction without permit.”
Concerns over gentrification
“We want to send a message to all developers that […] projects like this are not welcome here and that we will resist them wherever they show up,” said Amy* a spokesperson of Parc-Ex Contre la Gentrification. 
Amy put forward the negative impact of the building’s closure on marginalized communities, such as immigrants who depend on the Carrefour de Liaison et d’Aide Multiethnique (CLAM), one of the last associations left in the building. CLAM is an immigrant and refugee resource centre offering French-language courses for newcomers. 
“Parc Extension [has] historically been a place where many […] recent immigrants and low income people of colour have tended to settle,” they explained. “Parc-Extension is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada. […] Basically, what Ron Basal is planning to do is to build small luxury apartments that are far too expensive for most people in the neighbourhood to live in.” The 2013 Centraide survey confirms that Parc-Ex is one of the most underserved communities in Canada. 
The plaza has been an informal community centre housing various associations for over twenty years, which are now mostly relocated or closed down due to eviction. 
“Plaza Hutchison has been a community space, it has housed community organizations, and language schools, and radio stations, and religious spaces, and small businesses for many decades,” said Amy. “We believe that […] these kinds of projects are not at all what Parc extension needs, and we will fight to keep them out of the neighbourhood.”

Trial verdict reflects failure of Canada’s criminal justice system 
On Tuesday February 13, a crowd of about 200 Indigenous and non-Indigenous people gathered at Norman Bethune Square in Montreal near Concordia University to commemorate the life of Colten Boushie and raise awareness about the injustice in the trial following his death. Boushie, a young Cree man from Red Pheasant First Nation, was killed by Gerald Stanley, a 56-year-old white man, in Saskatchewan in August 2016. Last week, on February 9, despite overwhelming evidence indicating Stanley’s guilt, an all-white jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder.
Across the country, the verdict served as a stark reminder of the failures of Canada’s criminal justice system for First Nations, Inuit, and Metis people. The decisions made during the process of this trial reflect Canada’s lasting colonial justice system. The vigil, co-hosted by the Native Women’s Shelter of Montreal , was planned before the release of the verdict.
During the vigil, a powwow singing group, The Buffalo Hat Singers, and the drum carrier, Norman Achneepineskum, a member of the Cree nation, began the ceremony. Many individuals in attendance brought candles and signs of protest, emphasizing the two pronged message behind the vigil. These signs depicted a picture of Colten in his graduation gown, captioned Justice for Colten. The event was accompanied by approximately twenty police officers. Near the centre of the crowd, people wore black armbands embroidered with “Justice for Colten” in white. Opening the vigil was co-chair of the Montreal Urban Aboriginal Community Strategy Network, Vicky Baldo. Baldo is a survivor of the Sixties Scoop; a practice of the Canadian government during the 1960s that placed Indigenous children in adoption centers and white foster homes.
Another speaker, Clifton Ariwakehte Nicholas, discussed Canada’s treatment of young Indigenous men, highlighting this with his personal experiences of loss. “Last year [my nephew] Clint killed himself. He could not live in the world for the modern Indian man […] since [Colten’s] verdict came down, it feels as if that was my child that was shot down.” He continued, “I don’t want [my] rage to translate into more violence, I want it to translate into change.”

McGill’s Have a Heart Day raises awareness about gaps in indigenous health and education conditions in Canada
On February 14, for Valentine’s day, Have a Heart Day McGill took place in Chancellor Day Hall. This reconciliation event consisted of a Valentine card writing campaign, presentations, and a panel discussion. It was organized by students, in collaboration with the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (the Caring Society). The purpose of the letter writing campaign at McGill was to send a message to Parliament in support of Indigenous children’s rights to education, health, and identity in Canada.
Have a Heart Day sought to bring awareness to McGill students on the contemporary nature of Indigenous issues.
Speakers at the event included Dr. Cindy Blackstock, the Executive Director of the Caring Society, Alanis Obomsawin, a member of the Abenaki Nation and one of Canada’s prominent documentary filmmakers, Dr. Samir Shaheen-Hussain, a social-activist, Stephen Agluvak Puskas, the co-founder and former producer of Nipivut, Montreal’s Inuit community radio show and representatives from the McGill Law Aboriginal Human Rights Initiative.
Obomsawin’s wore red clothing as a symbol of support for missing and murdered Indigenous women.. She explained: “I am wearing everything in the colour red to acknowledge the missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada.” Her groundbreaking work in the field of Indigenous and feminist filmmaking, directing Christmas at the Moose Factory, Our People will be Healed, and most famously Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance, has granted her the status of officer of the Order of Canada Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts Member of the Order of Canada.
Dr. Cindy Blackstock chooses not to label herself as a social worker, activist, or scholar, stating: “I don’t want my job to exist.” Her rationale is based on the belief that her position should not exist in the first place, as Canada should be able to properly provide for its Indigenous people without there needing to be a person like her advocating on the behalf of marginalized children. Blackstock, filed a complaint pursuant to the Canadian Human Rights Act [CHRA] on the basis that Canada discriminates against First Nations children by consistently under-funding child welfare on reserves. Her dedication led to her being placed under surveillance for “caring for First Nations children,” by the Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC).
The tribunal ultimately concluded in 2016 that the Canadian Government discriminates against 163,000 First Nations children on the grounds of race and national and ethnic origin. Obamsawin worked to cover the process in her documentary We Can’t Make the Same Mistake Twice, which premiered with critical acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).
Dr. Shaheen-Hussain currently works in the Pediatrics wing of McGill University Health Centre. He does research in Public Health, Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine. His current advocacy focuses on changing Quebec’s policy on medical evacuation flights, which does not allow for a caretaker of the patient to be present. This disproportionately affects Indigenous children, who are often airlifted from northern Quebec to hospitals in Montreal or in Quebec City.
After Dr. Shaheen-Hussain’s advocacy, along with leading Canadian pediatric associations at the Valentine’s Day event, the provincial government now says it will allow parents to accompany their children on medical evacuation flights.Dr. Shaheen-Hussain commented to the CBC that “[the change in policy] warrants cautious optimism, in the sense that our government lamentably has a history of broken promises to Indigenous communities. This very well may fit into that history as well.”

University professors raise awareness on anti-Indigenous racism in law
On Friday, February 16, the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC) held a talk on anti-Indigenous racism and the law, following the Stanley verdict delivered the week before. Gerald Stanley is the white Saskatchewan farmer who shot and killed 22-year-old Colten Boushie, an Indigenous man from Red Pheasant First Nation, in August 2016. Boushie was murdered after he stopped at Stanley’s farm with some friends to ask for help with a flat tire. At the trial, Stanley pleaded not guilty, presenting a defense that the gun went off by accident. He was acquitted of all charges by a visibly all-white jury on February 9, 2018. In the aftermath of the verdict, Indigenous activists and allies all over the country expressed their grief at the anti-Indigenous racism and colonialism in Canada’s legal system.
The talk, titled “Anti-Indigenous racism and justice in Saskatchewan: challenges and impediments to reconciliation,” was given by Professor Veldon Coburn as an extension of his course “CANS 306: Issues in Native Studies.” Coburn is mixed-race Algonquin from Pikwakanagan First Nation, currently in his first year of teaching at McGill, after having previously worked in both the public sector and at the Conference Board of Canada, one of the country’s largest think-tanks.
“This seems to me very obviously something Canadians should be talking about,” said MISC director Elisbeth Heaman to The Daily. “We don’t live in an ivory tower: when people are really concerned and upset and debating things, there are times and places where the MISC cannot not notice that. We have to help people think through these things. We have to speak to people’s concerns.”
The contents of Coburn’s lecture weren’t originally created for the context of the Stanley verdict, but happened to suit the current political backdrop, focussing specifically on anti-Indigenous racism and violence in Saskatchewan. The talk was attended by students and community members alike, and was tailored to be accessible to those with even a basic level of knowledge on Indigenous issues. Coburn wanted audiences “to understand the pernicious and heinous atmosphere that Black, Indigenous, and people of colour live in every day,” he said in an interview with The Daily. “Not just […] formally through the justice system — – in more than just the legal domain, in everyday life.”
The talk explored an idea inspired by the work of Charles Taylor: the tension between the “two solitudes” apparent in the country, that of settler and Indigenous nationhoods. It also centered on understanding justice as greater than the law alone. “Justice as recognition,” Coburn said, is “recognising one another in our difference, and not demanding homogeneity.” He explained that Indigenous peoples need to be acknowledged as nations, as people, and as a people, in the context of a state built on the dehumanisation of Indigenous people, from the legal system to social media platforms and everything in between.
“Justice as recognition […] is not demanding homogeneity.”
“Our view of justice was somehow thrown into doubt because of the verdict delivered by the jury, but that’s the most narrow perspective on Colten’s life,” Coburn said. “Long before he was born, his family, his community, his nation was subject to a system of domination and oppression under colonialism. […] Four years […] into adulthood he’s dead, and it’s not just the trial in the aftermath of his death, but an entire existence where he was less than equal. He wasn’t recognised as someone who was worthy and deserving of equal concern […] and respect.”
Boushie is one of many Indigenous people killed by racist Canadians, Coburn reminded the room. He brought up the cases of Barbara Kentner, Neil Stonechild, Dudley George, and the violence at Mercier bridge during the “Oka crisis.” This resistance took place over the course of 78 days, leaving a decades-long legacy in its wake. Indigenous protesters, the police, and the Canadian army began the standoff following Quebec government’s authorization to expand a golf course and develop luxury condominiums on disputed land that included a burial site in Kanesatake. These incidents, all violent and racist crimes, are reminders of the way the white-supremacist settler state has been and continues to be responsible for devastating violence against Indigenous peoples.
These cases also illustrate that anti-Indigenous racism is not limited to Saskatchewan alone. Through an analysis of pre-election polls taken in 2015, Coburn concluded that between 20 and 50 per cent of settler Canadians in settler-majority provinces expressed unfavourable sentiment towards Indigenous peoples. “These are nameless people who live in our neighbourhoods,” Coburn said, referring to the widespread and common nature of this racism. Amidst tensions, especially now with the Stanley verdict and the discussions it has re-opened, reconciliation seems near-impossible.
“In [the] two years [since the final Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report], whatever ‘justice’ transpired between white Saskatchewan and Colten Boushie really drove a stake through reconciliation,” Coburn said to The Daily. “My own view is that it’ll be another generation before we begin talking about it more meaningfully.”
He added that the circumstances around Boushie’s life and death are a microcosm of settler-Indigenous relations in Canada. “He never experienced substantive justice — justice as equality, justice as fairness, but also […] justice as recognition,” he stated. “It’s emblematic that that recognition has eluded Indigenous peoples.”
Coburn emphasised that the process of reconciliation, if even possible, would be a long and difficult one. When asked what settlers needed to do to moving forward, he reminded us that, “long before you were born, you were instrumentalised by the crown.”
“Acknowledge us as individuals with national identities, and a shared colonial history. […] Resist racism, understand difference and respect it,” he continued to The Daily. “Reconciliation is hinging on true justice — justice as recognition.”

QPIRG holds workshop discussing “white allyship” context of Islamophobia in academia
On February 15, QPIRG-McGill held a workshop in the SSMU building titled “Boomerang Effect: Islamophobia and Mental Health in Academia,” as part of their annual Social Justice Days event series. The workshop covered definitions and origins of Islamophobia, developments of Islamophobia in the post-9/11 and Trump era, its place in academia, and its effects on mental health. The speakers were Sarah Abdelshamy, a U2 Joint Honours student in African Studies and World Islamic Middle East Studies and VP Finance of McGill World Islamic and Middle East Students Association, and Rawda Baharun, a U2 student in Psychology and the former President of Black Students’ Network at McGill.
The “boomerang effect” of Islamophobia
Abdelshamy began by explaining the “boomerang effect” of Islamophobia,  which occurs when people label those who do not share their privilege as ‘dangerous,’ without acknowledging that they, as privileged people, are the ones threatening the marginalised.
“White supremacy taught white people that all people of colour are threats, regardless of their behaviour,” said Abdelshamy. “The white person who has been educated and moulded by all those thinkings and all these privileges, looks at the other and perceives them as a threat, when in reality, they are the threat.”
 She continued to explain that the term “Islamophobia” itself is problematic. By removing agency from the person responsible for it, the perpetrator is portrayed as the victim. In fact, Islamophobia is not merely fear; it masks irrational hatred towards Muslims.
“We coin these terms, like Islamophobia, as if it is a fear and it is something that can be cured; it’s an illness, right? It’s something you cannot control,” said Abdelshamy.
Islamophobia in academia
According to Abdelshamy, academia is inherently colonial and designed to exclude those from whom academia does not benefit. She compared academia to the prison-industrial complex, pointing out similarities between the two concepts.
“If we think of prison as an institution, in this case an educational institution like McGill, the prison only inflicts violence on prisoners, but not all prisoners are criminals and not all criminals are prisoners. If you’re Muslim, you are a prisoner even if you’re not a criminal. White folks are part of the prison, but [are] not prisoners. They’re part of the prison as the infrastructure, not as individuals. And they might be criminals, but they will never be prisoners,” said Abdelshamy.
During the discussion, Baharun pointed out that Western-directed initiatives to study Islam fail to acknowledge the real-life experiences of those who practise it. As a result, the rich life experiences and human capacity of Muslims are neglected, in the name of academic objectivity.
“If we think of prison as an institution, in this case an educational institution like McGill, the prison only inflicts violence on prisoners, but not all prisoners are criminals and not all criminals are prisoners.”
Islamophobia and mental health
The two speakers also  discussed the effects of Islamophobia on mental health. Abdelshamy pointed out that anger is a common emotion that Muslims feel, and can be both troubling and rewarding.
“There is no way you can walk through McGill without feeling that rage,” said Abdelshamy. “Our anger is always going to be read as something that is violent, something to be censored and eradicated because our anger is ‘unjustified.’ […] I think we forget what anger is. […] Anger is our ability to feel, and I think that’s necessary because one, it’s a reminder that you are alive, and two, [it’s a reminder] that you are humans and thus [shows that] we are refuting the idea of dehumanizing Muslims and […] others.”
Possibilities of white allyship
To Abdelshamy, white allyship should not be seen as the panacea to Islamophobia. She maintained that it is dangerous for Muslims to rely on others, especially those who are responsible for marginalizing the Muslim community, to seek social justice, especially concerning an inherently violent cause.
“What I want is for people of colour to walk out of this room and say, ‘I am allowed to be angry’ because anger is sacred; it’s important and it’s needed. […]  I want white folks to walk out of this room and be like, ‘She’s angry because of me,’ and that’s fine because [white folks]  can also stop the apparatus of anger,” said Abdelshamy.
As for Baharun, she thought that students could start being allies by inspecting their own internalized Islamophobia, and by speaking up in the classroom.
“It’s up to each and every one of us to unpack our own biases, and understand what [we] have internalised already and what [we]  have yet to internalize,” said Baharun. “I have been in a classroom where students talk about, or write articles, on how much of an ally they are, they stand in solidarity with people of colour. But when it comes time to allowing problematic rhetoric to go on in that classroom space, they are nowhere to be found. Even just [in terms of] offering some [emotional] support they are often absent. Being present and communicating [are] absolutely fundamental to being an ally.”
“It’s up to each and everyone of us to unpack our own biases, and undersand what [we] have internalised already and what [we] have yet to internalise.”
Islamophobia and McGill
During the Q&A session, participants discussed specific manifestations of Islamophobia at  McGill, and the different degrees to which it manifests on different parts of campus.
“[Islamophobia] is more superficially visible in the Arts faculty because it makes up parts of class discussions. […] People have more of a platform to express views that are Islamophobic. But in the Science faculty, Islamophobia is somewhat hidden. It’s hidden in the way that many scientists at McGill are personally responsible for aiding in the development of technologies that are used against people of colour,” said a participant who asked  to remain anonymous.
Participants also discussed  solutions to reducing Islamophobia and agreed that there are no easy solutions, since Islamophobia is based on irrational fear and hatred, rather than sound reasoning. However, a participant asserted that communication and education was a good starting point.
At the end of the event, Amy Darwish, the working group and community research coordinator at QPIRG McGill, expressed her support for the event:
“In the context of the one-year anniversary of the January 29th shooting at the Grande Mosque in Quebec,  the passing of Bill 62, and the climate of growing Islamophobia, I think it is very important to have a space for people to talk about Islamophobia and the way in which it operates.”
QPIRG’s Social Justice Days, with the theme “Coming In From the Cold,” started on February 7 and wraps up on February 19.

Asbestos contamination prompts immediate relocation during Festival
On Monday February 12, the McGill Drama Festival was forced from its office during their second week of performances. The Players Theatre was found to be contaminated by asbestos, a material used to insulate and fireproof buildings, prompting the immediate relocation.
Gretel Kahn, the McGill Drama Festival Coordinator, said in an interview with The Daily: “The theatre was seized from us on Monday. […] we didn’t know what we were going to do. […] We still had the hope that they [were] going to fix whatever was wrong with the theatre, […] but […] yesterday we [found] out that we were going to do [the play] [in the SSMU cafeteria].” Kahn said that executives found out that day when they went to the office only to find the locks being changed.
“Yesterday we [found] out that we were going to do [the play] [in the SSMU cafeteria].”
The Players Theatre holds the McGill Drama Festival annually, showcasing “entirely student-written, -directed, -produced, and -performed shows on campus.” The event is usually held between March and April; however, Kahn stated that she purposely scheduled the festival in February this year in order to work within the restrictions of the SSMU building closure.
In October of last year, McGill announced the closure of the University Centre building, which was scheduled to start in March 2018. The closure is due to repairs needed on the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system, the rebuilding of the electrical system, and asbestos abasement, among other repairs.
Jemark Earle, SSMU’s VP Student Life, stated to The Daily in an interview that all student organizations were notified of the building closure in July 2017, which despite being a fairly short notice, gave groups such as the Players Theatre enough time to schedule their showtimes accordingly. Earle says that an email notifying organizations was sent out “to let [all McGill organizations ] know that someone is going to be entering their space to conduct tests [on the condition of the space] not that […] it could possibly result in [their space being closed down].”
Ahead of the building repairs, environmental companies have tested locations within SSMU to see where asbestos is concentrated and whether certain rooms have been “disturbed.” The term “disturbed” refers to when the toxic fibers of asbestos are released into the air, contaminating not only the location, but the contents of the location.
The Players Theatre, situated in room 309 on the third floor of SSMU, was found to be disturbed and subsequently closed off to the public, as well as members of the Players Theatre by the General Manager of SSMU, Ryan Hughes.
In an interview, Earle stated that, “as soon as we know or are aware of anything like [rooms being disturbed] we are going to close down the area. We don’t want to put any of our students or people at risk. That’s not what we’re going to do.”
“We don’t want to put any of our students or people at risk. That’s not what we’re going to do.”
Due to the closure of the theatre, set pieces and costumes left within the room were deemed “disturbed.” Therefore, cast and crew were unable to access much of the equipment essential to their performance and set up, such as sound and light equipment and light cues used to illuminate the stage.
Many personal items, including instruments belonging to students in the Faculty of Music were also left in the room. When asked by the Daily how the administration will respond to the loss of such belongings, Earle said that, “McGill’s supposed to cover the cleaning cost right now […] and so I would assume that McGill would [compensate] students for everything that they […] lost if it’s not […] recoverable or even if it is recoverable.”
According to both Kahn and Earle, SSMU’s Security Supervisor Wallace Sealy was immediately in communication with the Players Theatre, and helped them with the relocation of the space for their upcoming performances.
Earle also said to The McGill Daily that he and Hughes spent all of this past Monday through Thursday trying to coordinate with Concordia University and other theatres within Montreal, in order to secure a space. They also tried working with McGill’s Savoy Society because the Society have Moyse Hall booked. However, Earle and Hughes were ultimately not able to find an alternative place for the performance.
The SSMU cafeteria was secured and booked for the use of the Players’ Theatre until Saturday, February 17, the last day of the festival. However, the group had to cancel their show on February 14, because an alternative space had not been found in time. The cast and crew were unable to carry out a full technical run in the new space due to the short notice concerning the relocation.
The cast and crew were unable to carry out a full technical run in the new space due to the short notice concerning the relocation.
Kahn stated to The McGill Daily, “[we] have people coming from Toronto, New York, [and] Philadelphia that come to see their children act, that come to see the plays […] so obviously cancelling was not an option for us.”
Earle explained to The Daily that “[McGill] is […] contracting out jobs […] they’re deciding who’s going to […] take the project right now and so I think it’s just kind of like they’re getting the basic stuff done so that they can give that information to the contracted employees.”
“Cancelling was not an option for us.”
Earle further stated that he is waiting on the report regarding the extent of the asbestos contamination. He noted that further information cannot be sent out to the public regarding the safety and accessibility of rooms, due to SSMU not yet receiving such reports.
When asked what the SSMU has planned in response to potential health issues that may arise, Earle stated, “I personally would say that it’s a McGill’s building so […] when […] SSMU is made aware of that [asbestos contamination] I would think that we would make the request to McGill and then it would be their prerogative to get someone in here as soon as possible to fix the situation. I don’t that that’s how it plays out in reality, though because […] I don’t know where their priorities lie.”
“It should be McGill’s responsibility, but I think SSMU does do a lot [of that work].”
