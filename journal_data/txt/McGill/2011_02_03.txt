Both students and staff are hopeful that the new Staff-Student Mentoring Program launched Tuesday will foster stronger ties between faculty and students.
According to its statement of intent, the program’s main goal is to “facilitate informal out-of-classroom conversations between staff and students with the ultimate goal of enriching the University experience for all.”
It also hopes to “help close gaps, foster connections and build networks, as participants discover new opportunities and share knowledge and exchange insights about a wide variety of topics and interests.”
The program is currently in an exploratory period, throughout which it will receive feedback from participants based on evaluation criteria that are still in development. It is expected to use this feedback, and continue to evolve over the next couple of years.
“The program targets all undergraduate students. While we don’t specifically target first-year students, I think this could be particularly beneficial for them,” said Amara Possian, student Senate representative for the Faculty of Arts, who helped develop the project. “Once you have an informal conversation with a professor or administrator and realize they’re human, it makes everyone else much more approachable”
PGSS senator Alex Deguise brought up the possibility of mandatory mentoring for at-risk students during Senate’s committee discussion on mentoring and advising. There are currently no plans to make the program compulsory. However, both Possian and faculty senator from the Faculty of Science David Harpp – who also collaborated on the program with Dean of Students Jane Everett – mentioned that they were looking into the idea of retired faculty mentoring at-risk students.
To join the program, staff and professors create profiles on the program’s website. Students then log in and fill out a mentee application form from which they will be offered a choice of two possible mentors.
Once they’ve made their selection, the Office of the Dean of Students contacts the mentor and the mentee. It is then up to the mentor to contact the student.
Possian added that there has also been a lot of interest in using the program to match undergraduate students with graduate mentors.
“The PGSS could easily take our template and modify it to create their own mentorship program,” she said. “What we’re ultimately trying to do is create a culture of mentoring at McGill where members of the community are continuing to learn from each other.”

Criticism over lack of transparency mounts before Council session
A controversial motion to hold a referendum abolishing the biannual General Assembly (GA) and replace it with an Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be debated tonight at SSMU Council.
The AGM, unlike the GA, is a consultative forum and would not provide an opportunity for students to vote. The motion, authored by SSMU President Zach Newburgh and moved by VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew, VP Internal Tom Fabian, and Athletics councillor Emilie Leonard, has caused a visible split among the SSMU executives. The process by which the motion was brought forth to councillors is also being criticized. Leonard did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment.
Abolishing the GA
Members of both the SSMU executive and council are upset by the proposal to abolish the GA without first exploring a means of reform.
VP Clubs and Services Anushay Khan highlighted the benefits of the GA. “I feel that a lot of really great things have come out of the GA,” she said, citing SSMU policies regarding corporate influences, opt-outs, and room bookings. “The GA is a great forum to really have students come out and have their concerns be heard.”
VP External Myriam Zaidi also came out in favour of preserving the GA. “I think we should empower SSMU members in directing their student society,” she said.
“The fact that for decades students have come together and made important decisions as a whole, as opposed to 35 councillors, I think [that is] why a GA is critical to a healthy democracy that is representative of students,” Management councillor Eli Freedman said in defence of the GA. “The fact that we’re considering giving that up is crazy. I think that we haven’t looked at workable ways of reforming it.”
Newburgh has a different view on the GA, insisting on the necessity for change. “The debate ultimately comes down to whether the SSMU is willing to uphold an undemocratic General Assembly that limits voting to those who do not have class, work, and are among the first few to attend – or whether voting should be open to the entire student body.”
Fabian pointed out other flaws of the GA. “It’s just that people come out to vote on their issue, and they bounce. They don’t really care about the well-being of everything, and for that reason, a lot of people bring in some pretty stupid motions,” he said.
“I’m very open to change,” said Drew, clarifying his reasoning for adding his name to the motion. “We’re trying to find innovative ways to make sure that all voices are being heard, and not just the loudest or the ones with the biggest mob.”
He spoke to the inaccessibility of the GA’s structure. “It’s very complicated, unless you’re in student politics, to understand the process which the GA uses,” he said, referring in particular to Robert’s Rules of Order that structure GA debates.
Despite his protestations regarding the motion’s presentation during the last Council meeting, VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki displayed a more neutral stance when discussing the motion’s content.
“It is okay for there to be a difference of opinions, both within Council and the executive, and I think enough people have taken the time to make their views known about the GA,” he wrote in an email to The Daily.
Lack of Consultation
In addition to clear divisions of opinion over the future of the GA, some executives and councillors were vocal about their disappointment regarding the amount of consultation leading up to the motion’s presentation at Council.
Freedman voiced his concerns about the steps Newburgh took in soliciting feedback from his peers prior to submitting the motion.
“The process [by] which this has come into light corrupts the political system… Zach needs to understand that the executive is non-hierarchical. You don’t have a president above the rest of [the executives] and have them respond to his actions, and he creates the vision for the society, because that’s false,” Freedman said. “[Newburgh] has made it clear that his preferences are not to consult with students – not to reform the GA, but to abolish it,” he added.
Fabian and Drew both defended the way in which the motion was introduced to Council.
“I think too many people worry about consultation and process,” said Fabian. “The GA is in Zach’s portfolio; it is underneath him. All of us executives, we don’t consult each other on every single topic.”
Drew echoed his statements, pointing out that, “Executives have their own working schedules…you can’t consult everybody about everything. [Newburgh] could have been sneaky and pushed this through student-initiated referendum, and not have any consultation.”
Zaidi, however, disagreed. “Three out the six executives were never aware that this motion was being created, or was even being brought forward, even though we see each other every day,” she said. She went on to emphasize the divisive nature of the issue, stating, “The people that brought this motion forward knew that the GA was an issue that the executive had different views on.”
Town Hall
After considerable criticism over the seemingly minimal amount of communication between councillors and executive, Newburgh held a consultative town hall last week, in hopes of seeking student feedback.
Arts Senator Tyler Lawson referred to the meeting as “a great step forward in trying to ameliorate the circumstances.”
However, Councillor Maggie Knight claimed that the organization of the effort felt a bit “too little, too late.” She did concede, however, that the meeting prompted discussion that gave rise to new ideas.
Advertising
Newburgh dismissed concerns that promotion for the Winter GA has not been as visible as in previous years. “No matter how well the General Assembly is advertised, individuals will only attend if they are interested in the motions,” he said.
Advertising for the GA, which is set to take place February 10, has been limited to online promotion and ads in campus publications. Council decided against printing handbills to publicize the event, due to environmental concerns.
Confusion has arisen among SSMU councillors and executives, however, over the use of posters in advertising the GA. Despite confirmation from Dallas Bentley, SSMU’s Communications and Publications Manager, that posters are not currently being printed due to environmental concerns, Drew was under the impression that there would be no deviation from the usual practice of postering. “We should be postering around the faculties…and [posters] should have all the listings of the motions coming forth,” Drew said. “We’re planning to do that, so I don’t see any change in that.”
Knight and Lawson expressed confusion at the lack of postering on campus. “I suggested that we should use posters, [but] I don’t think that was taken up,” Knight said. Lawson also noted “posters are pretty much a staple of promotion in all aspects of SSMU, and should have been utilized.”
“You can question the amount of advertising,” Abaki remarked. “Perhaps we can agree that it’s been half-hearted.”
Khan and Zaidi advocated for a more interactive form of advertising, aiming to inform students about the value and technicalities of the GA. “I feel like it’s about educating students about the importance of the GA, before talking about the mechanism as a whole, because if people don’t know the value of it, then obviously you’re not going to value it,” Khan said.
Zaidi added that understanding the process of writing motions is crucial to the success of the GA. “We could’ve definitely done more in terms of the motion writing promotion, and I believe that the quality of a GA really depends on the motions that are submitted.” She went on to criticize confusion surrounding the deadline for the submission of motions for the GA.
Khan addressed the current divide among the executive as inevitable. “We run as individuals, and at some point in time, we will be divided on some issue. And this is that issue.”

Administration says it won’t effect negotiation process
On January 25, McGill’s three biggest campus unions signed a statement of solidarity to share respective bargaining agreements and support collective action. The three unions, the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), McGill’s Union of Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), and the Association of McGill Undergraduate Student Employees (AMUSE), represent about 5,000 campus workers. They signed the statement of solidarity, nicknamed the “founding document,” as all three head into bargaining agreements with McGill in the coming months.
“The administration has taken quite a hard line with the unions on campus the last several years,” said Michael Rozworski, AGSEM VP External. “We figure that if the unions agree to share information and formalize our relationship a bit more, we could be in a better position vis-à-vis the aggressive stance of the administration.”
Rozworski said representatives from each of the unions have been in informal discussion about a statement of solidarity since the fall, but agreements accelerated as each union drew closer to beginning their bargaining negotiations with McGill.
“[AGSEM’s] contract expires in June, MUNACA’s expired in November, AMUSE – as a casual workers union – is just negotiating their first contract,” said Rozworski. “The fact that we’re all entering negotiations with McGill kick started the process.”
MUNACA President Kevin Whittaker, who is currently helping negotiate a new collective agreement with McGill, said that solidarity between campus unions could help present a united front against the University in contract negotiations.
“In the past there have been things going on in other units that not everyone has known about,” said Whittaker. “We don’t want them to pit us against each other, and give one group things and not others.”
The statement articulates that all signatory unions will share information “relevant to union activity at the University…[that] is not necessary to keep confidential.”  However despite the emphasis on greater communication, collective action, and information sharing, Rozworski said the statement maintains the autonomy of each union.
“The idea behind this is to have it be quite a simple agreement, and one that’s relatively non-committal in some kind of deeper sense,” said Rozworski. “There’s no attempt at deeper integration, I don’t think there are any risks associated with this at this stage, in the form it is now.”
Both Robert Comeau, McGill Employee and Labour Relations Director, and Lynne Gervais, McGill Associate Vice-President (Human Resources) – two of the University’s primary negotiators with campus unions – were unaware of the unions’ statement when The Daily approached them for comment.
“This is not going to impact our negotiations at all,” said Gervais. “We negotiate with each other individually.”
“They [the unions] already talk to each other as it is,” she added.
AGSEM recently clashed with the University after attempting to incorporate sessional course lecturers into their union. They are hopeful that this statement of solidarity will help further this cause.
“That’s another area where the administration has taken a hard line, and where we need all the support we can get,” said Rozworski.
“I’m especially happy also because – as AGSEM representing academic workers, working together with the non-academic staff – that shows that interests are the same across…the different employee groups across campus,” he added.

Hastily scheduled roundtable attracts a hundred faculty and students
On Tuesday night, around 100 students and professors filled Arts W-215 to attend a roundtable discussion entitled “Recent Events in Egypt and the Middle East: A Conversation.” The event was organized by professors in the Institute of Islamic studies. Jamil Ragep, director of Islamic studies, moderated the discussion.
According to Ragep, the idea to hold a discussion in response to the recent events in Egypt came from Islamic Studies professor Prashant Keshavmurthy, who also participated in the discussion.
“It had to be done very quickly…and we wanted to be topical about it,” said Ragep. Efforts to organize the panel and find professors to speak began last Friday.
Department professors Malek Abisaab and Khaled Medani opened the discussion with lecture style comments and analysis on the protests in Egypt and Tunisia.
Abisaab began his comments by reading the poem Mohammed Bouazizi wrote for his mother. Bouazizi was the Tunisian street vendor whose self-immolation in December, and subsequent death, catalyzed the nations uprising and overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January.
In later remarks, Medani touched on the number of myths that recent political events across the Arab world – from Tunisia and Egypt to Yemen and Jordan – have been “punctured”.
“Is it a result of a spontaneous uprising? I think it isn’t, it is really a three decade transformation of political and economic changes. … There is a great deal of hope, not only for Egypt and Tunisia, but for those other countries,” Medani said.
Professor Setrag Manoukian and Keshavmurthy responded to audience questions during a question period that lasted over half an hour.
The role of social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook in the uprisings were of particular interest during the question period. Manoukian said that attributing the events in Tunisia and Egypt to technology alone is “presumptuous.”
“You have to consider how that enters into a broader dynamic in the sense that maybe technology is the most concrete sign of the way in which political communication works in a particular moment, but there has always been political communication…there have always been mechanisms to spread the news very quickly that now seem to us maybe outdated,” said Manoukian.
Several questions were directed toward the popular comparison of the Egyptian protests to the Iranian Revolution of 1979. “Comparisons are good to think with but they are always very limited,” Manoukian responded.
Medani expanded on the Iran-Egypt comparison, saying, “This is not a revolution…it is a popular protest and part of a social movement. … These people are asking for reform in the present institution and within the Egyptian constitution.”
Medani said he also enjoyed the student participation in the discussion.
“My impression was that it would be more interaction with the students…and that’s what it was like in the end. It was very good because it was more participatory than doing a lecture series,” Medani told the Daily. “It is very nice to see everyone so engaged in this region. It’s really important.”
During the panel Medani noted that the protests have been “surprisingly peaceful…given the amount of people on the streets and the potential for violence.”
Since the panel on Tuesday night, violence between supporters and opponents of embattled Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak intensified Wednesday morning and, according to the BBC, gunshots were heard in the area of Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo.

Board of Governors yet to approve contract amid legal challenges facing Sweden-based security company
McGill’s new contract with Swedish-based security agency Securitas came into effect Tuesday, despite allegations that the firm is involved in poor labour practices.
Securitas have been at McGill since mid-May after the University cancelled their existing contract with their former security company, the Bureau canadien d’investigation et d’ajustement. The Executive Committee of the Board of Governors (BoG) first approved the companies new contract on December 14, after the firm sent in a bid in reply to McGill Procurement Service’s call for tender.
Securitas Canada has been criticized since August 2010 for sending letters to its Halifax workers dissuading them from unionizing.
These letters violate the international agreement Securitas signed with Union Network International, and with the Swedish Transport Workers Union in 2006, in which it promised to aid employees in forming unions.
Dave Bush, an employee of the Service Employees International Union in Halifax, is working with Securitas employees on a campaign to get Securitas to honour this agreement.
Although reluctant to be quoted, as the campaign is still in its early stages, he spoke of the general proceedings.
“Basically we’re sitting on a list of violations [of the international agreement],” he said over the phone.  “But we want to wait for the right time. …My hands are tied.”
Elise Graham, Chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students Nova Scotia, commented on the importance of unionization for security guards on university campuses.
“I am part of the student union at NSCAD [Nova Scotia College of Art and Design], so obviously we believe that unionized workers and unionized students are stronger together than they are un-unionized,” she said.
“Here at NSCAD we have 24-hour access to our campuses so students can go into our studios and work in our studios and use the equipment for school.  So we have security guards during the evenings and we know that having unionized workers would mean more stability in their jobs, we’d be seeing the same workers time and time again, and we could develop a relationship with them,” she added.
When asked whether the labour allegations affected McGill Security Services’ decision to employ Securitas Canada, Pierre Barbarie, Associate Director of Security Services, said, “We look at the company on how best they can provide the services we need, and that’s how we base our decisions.”
Barbarie said that the reason for choosing Securitas rested on its scale.
“Securitas is a renowned company all over the world,” said Barbarie. “It has contracts all over the world, agents all over the world. … So in order to attract the best possible candidates in terms of agents, they’re definitely a huge player in that.”
Barbarie and Security Services chose Securitas in conjunction with McGill’s Procurement Services department. The BoG has not yet officially approved the decision, as they have not met since the contract was awarded.
SSMU President Zach Newburgh anticipated that the contract would be brought up for review at the next BoG meeting, as the Executive Committee would be required to submit a report.
In an email to The Daily, PGSS president and BoG member Alexandra Bishop wrote, “The basics of the contract were presented to the BoG Executive Committee by Michael Di Grappa, Vice-Principal Administration and Finance on December 14 and approved. Previous consultation included the Selection Committee involved with the public call for tender, Legal Services and Procurement Services.”
“I do not know what will be in the report to the BoG beyond the basics that the Executive Committee recommended the approval of the contract,” she continued.
She also stated that Securitas’s was the only bid received.

Young Palestinians pressure the Palestinian ambassador to the UK for free and fair elections
On the January 27th, about 20 students from the Palestinian diaspora met in the offices of Palestine’s general delegation to the United Kingdom to voice their concerns to the ambassador. Lé Délit, The Daily’s sister publication, interviewed one of the protestors, Merna Azzeh.
Le Délit: How did your group organize the sit-in at the embassy?
Merna Azzeh: Everything was more or less organized the day before. About 12 students were there from 1:00 pm, but most students came later in the afternoon. We all came from different universities in the UK (LSE, UCL, SOAS, Oxford, Notthingham). The majority were of Palestinian origin (living in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, the West Bank, Europe). Even if I only knew two people in the group before the sit-in, we all wanted the same thing: to reclaim representation and direct elections.
LD: What triggered your initiative? The Palestine Papers? The social unrest in Tunisia and Egypt?
MA: It was a bit of both, but we didn’t want to make a direct link to these events. We spoke about representation with the ambassador. No matter the corruption (because yes, there is corruption!), we asked for more democracy. This was our call for direct elections to the Palestinian National Council (PNC). We were conscious of the limits of our demands at the sit-in, but we wanted our actions to be a wake-up call to the Palestinian youth. In other words, this was the launch of a campaign for elections and a new body of representatives for the Council. The fact is that this isn’t done regularly. Some have been in office since 2006 and the PNC is very important because it is the main body that gives authority and strategies to the PLO.
LD: How did everything proceed?
MA: Well, we didn’t invade the embassy. We simply wanted to get our voices heard in the most civilized way possible. Some students were sitting in the reception area while others were in the ambassador’s empty office. We said that we wouldn’t leave until he came and spoke with us. When he came, we shared our point of view and asked him to take action, but he answered that everything was out of his control. We continued discussing until the police arrived after they heard about it in the media. The ambassador, insisted that we should stay, and that we were welcome guests in our embassy. We left at around 8:00 pm. Even if the ambassador agreed with our demands, I remain skeptical. Maybe this was just a utopian effort. But this is about people’s rights to choose their representatives, and we all knew that before the Palestine Papers. Moreover,  being a refugee, I need to worry about my future and my people. I think it was a good start for our campaign.
LD: Have you done this for the youth or for all Palestinians?
MA: We did it in the name of the youth, because we are the future of the country. We however called for democracy for all Palestinians, especially those in the diaspora: we called for direct elections, and it is the right of all of our people no matter where they are to take part in the process. At the end of the day, we talked about what we wanted to do next. I hope that it was a spark that will be transmitted to Palestine, because it is quite hard to protest over there. It’s the launch of a campaign: we need other initiatives of this kind in order to promote these goals of representation and democracy.

Stiff opposition cites possible intellectual property violations
A federal private members bill to improve Canada’s ability to export low-cost AIDS medications faces numerous roadblocks as the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to cause millions of deaths annually in Africa.
Bill C-393, which aims to decrease the red tape around Canadian production and exportation of low-cost generic AIDS medications, has reached its third reading in the House of Commons, after being introduced in 2009. After this reading the bill must pass through Senate.
Winnipeg North NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis, who stepped down in April 2010 to run for mayor of Winnipeg, first introduced the bill. Windsor West NDP MP Brian Masse then took over as sponsor of the bill, but recently handed the bill over to Ottawa Centre NDP MP Paul Dewar.
In an interview with The Daily, Masse said “I’ve handed over the bill to Paul Dewar in response to the criticism that I [already] introduced a private member’s bill over the last year.”
MPs are generally encouraged to only introduce one private members bill a year. The Conservatives finally gave their approval to allowing Dewar to be the bill’s new sponsor yesterday. A new sponsor must be approved by all MPs.
One of the bill’s key clauses was the one-licence system, designed to reduce red tape regulating drug exportation. The one-licence system requires generic companies to have just one license to export drugs to countries specified as being in need of affordable medications without a strict quota on the number of drugs.
Under the current system, companies are required to obtain multiple licenses to export drugs. The House Standing Committee on Industry, Science, and Technology, which includes Liberal critic and Westmount-Ville Marie MP Marc Garneau, removed this clause in December.
In a canada.com article, Garneau stated that this approach “would give generic companies too much freedom.”
Rachel Kiddell-Monroe, Pres-ident of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM), member of Médecins sans frontières (MSF), and founder of MSF’s Ottawa advocacy office, defended the one- licence clause in an interview with The Daily in December.
“For the developing countries, they would have known that once they received the license they would receive the drug…For the generic companies they know they don’t have to go through years of litigation and negotiations with the pharmaceutical countries,” said Kiddell-Monroe. “It is also a much faster system than the current legislation.”
Other organizations advocating for the passage of Bill C-393 and the one-licence system include the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and the Stephen Lewis Fund’s Grannies to Grannies Campaign.
The McGill UAEM Chapter has been raising awareness of the bill on campus. Chapter coordinator Rachel La Selva said in an email to The Daily that some of their members “attended rallies in Ottawa…gave announcements to our classes, and [encouraged] people to sign postcards” to their MPs.
According to Masse, “most of the opponents to Bill C-393 have been pharmaceutical companies,” despite the fact that, according to a statement released by the HIV/AIDS Legal Network, “the entire continent of Africa…represents less than two per cent of global pharmaceutical sales” due to developing countries’ inability to afford patented medicines.
Other opponents of the bill criticize it for potentially violating international intellectual property rights. Heather Hume, spokesperson for Industry Minister and Parry Sound-Muskoka MP Tony Clement, said in an email to The Daily that Clement is opposed to bill C-393 because it “would revoke intellectual property rights” outlined in the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). This is 1994 agreement set minimum standards for international intellectual property regulation.
However, Section Four of the WTO’s 2001 Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health also states that, “While reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members’ right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.”
