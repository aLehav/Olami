Exec hopes to reverse his decision
Post Graduate Students’ Society VP External Ryan Hughes resigned this past Friday due to “ethical issues” that surfaced in a recent executive committee meeting.
Hughes stated that legal obligations restrict him from disclosing information pertaining to his resignation.
“The reason is I have ethical issues,” he said. “The disclosure of my resignation wouldn’t be…good for the PGSS. My resignation…still stands, but I can’t go beyond that point”
Hughes said he had told other PGSS executives that he was considering resignation, but officially resigned Friday.
“I had a conversation with the President [Alexandra Bishop] and I had a conversation with some of the staff at the PGSS, and I just made the decision that I don’t want to continue on with it,” said Hughes.
“Basically now it’s just extricating myself from the PGSS,” he added.
Bishop said Hughes was resigning because he didn’t agree with one of the motions passed at the PGSS Executive Committee meeting yesterday. She added that the executive is reconsidering the motion because they feel they did not have enough information at the time to make an informed decision on the issue.
According to Bishop the decision to reconsider was not related to Hughes decision.
“We are currently reconsidering it, I don’t know what effect that will have on Ryan’s position,” she said.
“I’m hoping that because we are reconsidering this motion, and taking it very seriously, that we can work things out, because I’d rather have a strong executive the rest of the year, but obviously his faith has been damaged. There’s not much that can be done,” she continued.
One PGSS executive has already resigned this year. There has been an executive resignation every year for the past four years.
PGSS VP Finance and Daily columnist Adrian Kaats said Hughes’ resignation could be more tied to burn-out than opposition to the executive committee motion.
“He said he had a problem with the motion that we passed. We undid the motion, but he is maintaining that he doesn’t want to finish his term,” said Kaats.
“So far he doesn’t seem to be changing his mind,” he continued. “He’s sticking to his guns, which indicates to a lot of us that it really doesn’t have much to do with the motion per say. It’s more just that he’s exhausted.”
“I do hope we will have open communication and resolve the issue,” she said.

Open letter accuses federation of mismanagement and questions leadership
The Engineering Undergraduate Society of McGill (EUS), along with the Engineering Societies of Queen’s University and the University of Toronto, co-signed an open letter on February 18 accusing the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES) of poor management and calling for imminent reform.
CFES represents 60,000 engineering students across Canada and offers services such as an annual congress focused on leadership development, a national student magazine, technical skill competitions and complementary education courses.
The letter points to the decision to hold the 2012 CFES Congress in the Yukon as a chief example of poor management.
“The cost of sending delegates to such a remote location will make the conference unaffordable for some schools…the executive made no effort to steer the organization away from such a careless action,” reads the letter.
Leading the complaint against CFES is EUS President Daniel Keresteci, who initiated the letter to CFES and contacted Queen’s and U of T after the 2011 CFES Congress.
The choice to hold the 2012 CFES Congress in the Yukon was headed by the “bloc” of ten schools in the Western Engineering Student Societies’ Team (WESST), including student representatives from all the accredited Western Canadian engineering schools.
The different WESST member schools under the umbrella of the made up University of Yukon will hold the congress cooperatively. This is the first time the congress will be hosted by a group of schools as opposed to just one, and the first time it will be held in Northern Canada.
“[This congress will] allow for cooperation between the different WESST member schools,” states the congress website.
According to Kevin Siu, president of the University of Toronto Engineering Society, the WESST’s decision will alienate universities with smaller budgets.
“Taking delegates to the Yukon for next year’s scheduled conference at a premium is counter-productive…the imaginary ‘University of Yukon’ joke was way past the point of being humorous,” he said.
Keresteci agreed, noting that the event in the Yukon is far too costly. “It is a waste of people’s money,” he said.
The CFES, however, maintains that the resolution to hold the congress in the Yukon was decided democratically by the members of the body, and therefore was in no position to reject the decision.
“They questioned our leadership in allowing the selection of Yukon to host CFES Congress, but this decision rests squarely in the hands of the members,” wrote CFES President Rob Stalker, in an email to The Daily. “The members voted in favour of Yukon.”
The letter also charges the CFES with failing to properly lobby the National Council of Deans of Engineering and Applied Science (NCDEAS). The letter states that the CFES has unique access to the NCDEAS, which it should use on behalf of engineering students across Canada.
In a statement released on Wednesday, the CFES denied that they are the only body with access to the NCDEAS.
“While we certainly have regular contact with these groups, we by no means run a monopoly on their time or lines of communication,” reads the statement. The CFES added that lobbying is currently out of its mandate.
All three universities agree that major changes must be made in the CFES if they are to remain in the organization. Both Keresteci and Sui believe that the CFES is long overdue for reforms.
“[At] no time in my memory was the CFES a successful organization,” said Keresteci, “It’s reached a watershed moment, and we must act now.”

Rue Frontenac allowed to continue publishing under final agreement
“We lost everything,” said Pascal Filotto, the Secretary General of the Syndicat des travailleurs de l’information du Journal de Montréal (STIJM) and former journalist with the Journal de Montréal. His sentiment is shared by many of the workers affected by the lockout at the Journal de Montréal. The two year strike finally came to a close last Saturday, when the 253 locked out employees voted 64.1 per cent in favour of the latest deal proposed by Quebecor Media Inc., the corporation that owns the Journal.
The lockout began January 24, 2009, making it the longest media labour dispute in Canadian history. Many have blamed the length of the conflict on Quebec’s anti-strike-breaker law.
The conditions of the negotiations state that 62 jobs will be restored, 42 of which will be in the newsroom. Those whose jobs are not restored will receive a severance package worth a collective total of $20 million. It is expected that the final details of the back-to-work policy will take several weeks to sort out.
In the final stages of negotiation, Quebecor agreed to withdraw a demand prohibiting employees from working for competing publications for six months following the closure of the deal. A demand for the discontinuation of Rue Frontenac, the newspaper started by the locked-out journalists, was also withdrawn.
Many union members, like Filotto, remain unimpressed with the negotiation process. Further anger was sparked when news that the deal had been accepted appeared on Twitter before it was officially announced to union members.
“I think it’s a horrible deal,” said Filotto. “I voted against it. I’m really sorry we had to cave like this at the end. I thought we were finally putting a dent in Quebecor’s resolve and I thought there were still things we could do before we gave up. But I also understand the despair and how hard it was for a lot of people.”
Filotto spoke to the variety of people who were involved in the lockout besides reporters. “A lot of these people were close to retirement, so they were never going back to the Journal. They supported us because there were some principals involved.” He added, “It was a lot to ask of people close to retirement to postpone it to protect certain things that we thought we needed to protect.”
Filotto continued by saying he “respected the decision” of those who voted for the deal.
“I can understand both sides,” said Rue Frontenac coordinator, Jean-François Codère. “We’ve been fighting for a long time and we’re tired.”
Others such as André Forté, an adviser at the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), the parent union of STIJM, feel that while the settlement is disappointing, there was simply no other way.
“We’ve been to trying to fight them for two years and trying to have more force towards the negotiations, but it was never going to happen,” said Forté.
Quebecor, a media conglomerate that owns Vidéotron and Sun Media Corporation, is one of the largest newspaper publishers in Canada.
Despite their credentials, the corporation cited financial concerns as the motivation for their decision to lay off 75 office workers at the Journal, the decision that initially sparked the conflict leading to the lockout.
“As far as I know, Quebecor initially wanted to fire 75 people. Now about 190 have lost their jobs,” said Codère.
Filotto described how Quebecor wanted to cut costs and began to target office workers since “you can’t just get rid of entire departments” in which other employees worked. He explained how reporters supported their colleagues and Quebecor management took advantage of that.
“They were never having financial problems. They foresaw possible problems in the future and they overplayed that to try to get us to cooperate.”
“Quebecor got what they wanted. It’s a huge loss for us,” said Filotto.
Obstacles to lockout solidarity
“Even during the boycott campaign, the readership didn’t go down. They never lost any money; they actually made even more money,” said Forté. “We had no hope against such an adversary. They could have continued in a conflict like this for years.”
“Quebecor is a huge machine,” said Filotto. “The habit of reading that paper was so strong.”
J.Serge Sasseville, Quebecor’s Vice-President of Corporate and Institutional Affairs commented on the agreement via email.
“We do not intend to give interviews following last Saturday night’s vote,” wrote Sasseville. “We limit our comments to the following declarations: We are pleased with the results of the vote by the members of the union STIJM; we accept the recommendation made by the mediator Jean Poirier; we will be sitting down with the union soon to discuss the terms and conditions of the back-to-work protocol. We do not wish to make further comments at the present time.”
Quebecor has become known for its model of convergence, where content from QMI Agency, their newswire service, is available to all of their publications. By using wire content from QMI, Quebecor was able to continue the publication of the Journal during the lockout. QMI was created shortly before the lockout began.
“The anti-scab law…allows the publication of content which comes from other sources and allows newspapers to be filled with articles that come from all over the place,” Forté explained. “[Quebecor] were able to fill the newspaper with articles that came from all kinds of other papers.”
Union members also expressed concerns with Quebecor’s business model, and claimed that its corporate interests were compromising their professional morals. “There were some principals we did not agree with, such as the convergence of media sources and the increased corporate presence in the newsroom,” said Filotto. He described how reporters had begun to feel “more and more like mercenaries.”
Editor-in-chief of the Journal, Lyne Robitaille, is also the executive Vice-President of Operations Eastern Canada and Sun Media Corporation – both owned by Quebecor. During the lockout, Robitaille spoke on radio saying, “We no longer talk about journalists now. We are talking about producers of multimedia content.”
Filotto disagreed. “Nobody really knows what the media landscape is going to be,” he said. “A bunch of models have been coming up…but I’m sure that reporters running around with video cameras trying to make bad TV is not the way. The solution is to showcase what journalists do best – writing and taking pictures – in the best possible way. That’s what we hope to do with Rue Frontenac.”
Rue Frontenac moving forward
Although attempts by the STIJM to boycott the Journal during the lockout were largely unsuccessful, both Codère and Filotto have high hopes for the future of Rue Frontenac.
With ninety days to dissociate itself from the STIJM and the Journal, Rue Frontenac is currently seeking investors willing to support the paper as a workers’ co-op.
“There are a lot of people who seem interested,” Filotto said. “During the lockout,  Rue Frontenac eventually stopped being seen by the public as ‘the newspaper of the locked out journalists’ and began to be seen as simply another news source. … They appreciate that Rue Frontenac is offering a newer, fresher voice.”
“I have enormous hopes that it will work,” said Forté. “We’ve already had such a good response from many people. It would be phenomenal to have a media source that could continue independently like that with quality workers.”

Legislation faces criticism for denying refugees rights and protections
More than eighty human rights and civil society groups across Canada have come out in force against an anti-smuggling bill proposed by the federal government, calling for the legislation to be defeated in an upcoming session of Parliament. The bill received its second reading in the House of Commons last week.
The Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR), a non-profit umbrella organization that has taken a lead in opposing the bill, has said that the legislation does not target smugglers, but rather the vast number of asylum-seekers who arrive in Canada with their aid.
Bill C-49 would make participation in “human trafficking events” a criminal offense. Individuals arriving in Canada by irregular means could be detained for up to one year without review, and denied permanent residency status for up to five years, even if recognized as a refugee by Canadian officials. Individuals would also be denied the right of appeal if their refugee claim were rejected.
Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews introduced the bill to the public in October last year, while standing in front of the Ocean Lady, a rusty freighter carrying hundreds of Sri Lankan asylum-seekers that docked in Vancouver last August. The migrants were held in a Vancouver jail for several months before being released and permitted to file refugee claims.
Jessica McDonald, media spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Safety told The Daily in an email that the bill “reduces the attraction of coming to Canada by way of an illegal human smuggling operation,” and would send a clear message to smugglers that “Canada will not tolerate your criminal activities.”
Liberal MP Justin Trudeau criticized the logic of Bill C-49 as a deterrent to smuggling, and accused the federal government of increasing the barriers facing legitimate refugees.
“[This bill] doesn’t fulfill any practical purpose of cracking down on illegal smuggling. It only aims to make the Conservatives look tough on crime, and anyone against this piece of crap legislation appears soft on human smuggling, which we are not,” said Trudeau.
“We have a process for refugees; they are evaluated by the IRB [Immigration and Refugee Board], and it is established whether they are legitimate…and anyone who is simply trying to immigrate to Canada for economic reasons gets sent back,” he added.
CCR Executive Rick Goldman viewed the bill as a direct attempt to crack down on the individuals seeking asylum in Canada.
“It is impossible for many people from refugee producing countries to get here through a legal method. So the vast majority have to use illegal methods at some point,” said Goldman.
“This is accepted by the U.N. High Commission as normal, and not normally held against refugees. So the government is really attacking something that is an accepted reality; that refugees need to have recourse to false documents in order to get to somewhere far from their country of origin,” he added.
According to Goldman, the proposed legislation is also a clear contravention of the U.N. Refugee Convention, which prohibits states from imposing penalties on the illegal entry of refugees facing a well-founded fear of persecution.
“The good refugees are those who wait 15 to 20 years in a camp, with only the hope that maybe one day they will be resettled. … But we also have an obligation towards the ones who come here. They are entitled to rights. They get to stay if they are real refugees, and that is our obligation under international law,” added Goldman.
More than 12,000 refugees were welcomed to Canada last year. As of December 31, however, 51,000 refugees claims remain pending before the IRB of Canada.
McDonald also stated that while Canada remained committed to providing a safe haven for legitimate refugees, the federal government would cut down on the abuse of the immigration system.
“Every sovereign country has a responsibility to protect its borders,” wrote McDonald. “Bill C-49 sends the message that it is unfair to those seeking to come to Canada through legitimate, legal means when others pay human smugglers to jump our immigration queue.”
However, according to Trudeau, effective legislation on this issue would target migrant transit countries, such as Thailand, and working with these states to increase their refugee acceptance rates and to crack down on trafficking companies, as well as with source countries to help move individuals facing threats of death and torture.
Goldman expressed dismay at the federal government’s characterization of asylum-seekers as “queue jumpers.”
“There is no queue for refugees. There is a queue for people who want to come here as skilled workers, but there is absolutely no queue for refugees,” he said.
Trudeau points out that this rhetoric was to rally electoral support among first-generation Canadians and immigrants by equating refugees to economic migrants.
“This is probably one of the most insidious elements of how they [the federal government] have decided to spin this bill. It is meant to make first-generation Canadians and immigrants turn against this bill [by saying] that a refugee is the same as an immigrant, and while new arrivals have to wait five or ten years to come to Canada, these new arrivals are jumping the queue,” added Trudeau.
Goldman also believed that the legislation is an attempt to shore up Conservative support in the run up to any future election. He drew attention to the fact that the federal government has continued to promote the legislation despite the fact that all three opposition parties have heavily criticized it.
“It’s dead in the water as a serious piece of legislation, so why continue to talk about it? They are still having press conferences, and photo ops, so it is really for electoral purposes,” added Goldman. “They continue to whip up anti-refugee hysteria in order to win election votes.”

Food collective expanding operations ahead of fee increase referendum
The Midnight Kitchen (MK), in cooperation with SSMU clubs and services, has opened a student lounge area in Shatner’s room 302. The lounge will be open weekdays from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m., except on Fridays. MK currently serves out of the room Monday to Thursday.
The decision by MK to expand their services to the supervision of a student space was introduced in conjunction with their upcoming fee increase referendum. MK is proposing to increase their levy by $1 per semester, amounting to $4.50 per year.
Student levies are required to be renewed via student referendums every three years. Carol Fraser, MK’s volunteer coordinator and a candidate for SSMU VP Clubs and Services, said, “We are always just operating within budget, but we have all these ideas to expand.”
Besides investing in the lounge space, Fraser said the fee increase will contribute significantly to improving serving capacity, which is “mostly what we are interested in doing with the money.”
Another member of the collective, Alex Briggs, spoke to working with SSMU on the project.
“Hopefully [302] will be a more permanent space next year. That requires working out with SSMU,” he said.
Both Fraser and Briggs stated their desire for 302 to fall further under the jurisdiction of MK, and to show that student initiatives can work and that they, according to Fraser, “provide a better alternative for students.”
SSMU’s position is that space in the Shatner building needs to remain as multi-purpose as possible. Anushay Khan, SSMU VP Clubs and Services, noted, “There is an increasing lack of space [on campus] as a whole.” She added that campus space is either being taken up by the administration’s needs or is being cut into by increasing enrolment.
“As a building manager for the Shatner building I am always faced with the issues of student space,” said Khan.
“Whether it is services wanting more space or clubs wanting more space, space is an issue because this is the only building on campus where we can really have our say and allocate it to our maximum ability.”
“It is really about the MK working with other groups,” Fraser said, “We still want it to be used by everybody else, in the spirit of multi-purposeness.”
Briggs stated that the closure of the Architecture Café in September has created a need for a new student space.
According to Fraser, the objective is to have a real cafe space offering an alternative model, where students can go without having to buy anything.
“This anti-capitalist idea [is] in line with what the MK is already – a space that doesn’t exist on campus that is for students to hang out,” she explained.
MK’s popularity with the student body, and their fee levy – which is independent of SSMU fees – have been helpful in moving the project forward.
“We have bargaining power,” Briggs said. “As the administration ramps up their pressure and pushes students’ rights out of the University, I think it is important that students organize around the institutions that we have left and do have control over – such as the kitchen.”
Some other ideas brought forward for MK’s operations expansion include the possibility of a breakfast service and permanent tables for student bake sales. Briggs also mentioned ideas of purchasing a sound system for music, poetry readings or shows, or the possibility of buying a projector for film screenings.

VP External hopes policy will be starting point for negotiations
A new policy on Quebec tuition fees was presented to the Post-Graduate Students’ Society Council Thursday night by VP External Ryan Hughes. The policy calls for the elimination of tuition fees for graduate students who are Quebec residents, and a freeze on current tuition levels for out-of-province and international graduate students.
Hughes, who has been working on the policy for about ten months in collaboration with a writer-researcher and members of the PGSS External Affairs committee, said the proposed freeze on out-of-province and international tuition would be corrected for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index.
“The previous PGSS tuition policy wasn’t a policy on tuition fees…it was a policy on the [1994] tuition freeze,” said Hughes. “It was mandated to me back in April that a new tuition policy should be reviewed. It took quite a few months.”
The 13-year freeze on Quebec tuition expired in 2007, at which point the Liberal government instituted a policy that increases tuition $100 per student per year for five years. In the preamble to the new policy, the PGSS notes the Quebec government’s interest in “significantly raising tuition fees in 2012” when the current policy expires.
The preamble also describes how the Conférence des recteurs et des principaux des universités du Québec, of which McGill is a member, has advocated for an increase of $1,500 over three years, ending in 2015.
SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi said Hughes used the existing SSMU tuition policy, which was adopted four years ago in light of the 2007 defreeze, as a model for the new PGSS policy.
“Their policy was not changed since 1994,” said Zaidi. “He looked at our [policy] and found that it was a good one. Ours had a long-term vision.”
Zaidi said the SSMU policy differed from the PGSS policy in that SSMU is opposed to tuition fees for all students, not just Quebec residents.
“If you stand for the elimination of tuition for Quebec residents you should do so for out-of-province and international students as well,” she said.
The SSMU policy does not refer specifically to graduate student tuition – only to tuition fees in general – something Zaidi was supportive of.
“[McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum] said she would increase tuition for undergrads in order for free tuition for grads,” said Zaidi, “so I’m glad they didn’t specify tuition only for grads.”
The PGSS policy recognizes that “there are alternative sources of governmental revenue that can be used to fund higher education instead of raising tuition fees,” and that “the burden of financing tertiary should not fall upon Quebec resident graduate students, who are among the most economically vulnerable groups in Quebec.” Zaidi was also in favor of these features of PGSS’ new policy.
Regarding student consultation concerning the new tuition policy, Hughes said a formal survey was disseminated to graduate students regarding tuition fees.
“It was not scientific, just informative,” said Hughes.
When the policy was debated in council, Hughes said concerns where raised as to whether the policy would bind the hands of the PGSS when it came to negotiations over tuition fees. He responded to these concerns by clarifying the purpose of the policy.
“A policy is a starting point for negotiation; it lays out student desires,” said Hughes. “Students don’t want to have to pay much, or anything at all.”
With the new policy, Hughes said the PGSS will “have a point to place ourselves in the negotiation, and so we can reach a decent compromise.”

Critics hope the Committee will shed light on BoG
Concordia’s Senate unanimously passed a resolution to hold an independent inquiry of the university’s governance on February 18. The review comes after dozens of departments passed motions expressing non-confidence in Concordia’s Board of Governors (BoG) as a result of the surprise resignation of the university’s president, Judith Woodward, in December 2010.
Woodward is the second president in the last three years to leave the University before serving half their term. A number of other senior administrators have also abruptly resigned from their positions at the University over the last two years.
After her resignation Woodward stated that it was not her choice to leave. This has raised concerns that the Concordia’s BoG is violating Concordia’s bylaws. The bylaws state; “The Board of Governors shall have a superintending and reforming power.”
However, many students and faculty fear that the BoG is inserting itself in the day-to-day affairs of the university. A committee of at least three people will be formed to investigate these concerns over the next few months. Media Relations Advisor at Concordia, Fiona Downey, said that the personnel of the Committee and its mandate are not yet finalized. None of the Committee members will have any links with Concordia.
Student and faculty groups led the calls for the inquiry after becoming frustrated with the BoG’s lack of transparency.
Robert Sonin, a Concordia student activist, called the inquiry a “very small step in the right direction,” and added that many of the problems have been caused by the “total failure” of the BoG to adhere to the principles of collegiality, openness, and fairness.
“We do not know what the actual reasons for the departures have been, though it appears that the departures of senior administrators has cost us over $10 million,” Sonin said.
Sonin was also skeptical as to whether the BoG will even adhere to the Committee’s recommendations, as Board members are seen to “feel entitled to play with the University as if it were their toy.”
He argued that the Boards’ priorities are “drawn from the corporate world” with the BoG’s priorities being “overtly hostile to all other functions [of a University].”
“The problem is as much a set of bad habits and reflexive postures as it is bad structures,” He continued. “No one can have an opinion worth anything because nobody knows what actually went on [during the dismissal of Woodward].”
Sonin would like to see the Committee investigate the situation to determine which board members pressured whom, and how. He would also like extensive student, faculty and staff consultation during the process.
However, Downey told The Daily, “The Committee is not meant to be a representative committee of the different constituencies but rather a committee of experts.”

Student Society politics returns to routine post-Reading Week 
Questions resulting from the recent controversy surrounding SSMU President Zach Newburgh’s involvement with the social networking upstart Jobbook continued throughout council’s Thursday meeting.
After struggling to meet quorum, council was finally called to order about an hour after the meeting commenced. In the interim, council speaker Raymond Xing called an informal question and answer period for the councillors that were present. Clubs and Services Representative Max Zidel asked about the progress of the creation of a committee to review and amend SSMU’s conflict of interest policy.
Newburgh, having planned to address this issue during his executive report, responded to Zidel. “I would like to make the policy a lot more specific and less ambiguous, and I think it would be really great to refer this to a committee,” said Newburgh. “Since I am the only student who has ever been charged for a breach of the conflict of interest policy, I think my perspective on this issue would be a valuable one.”
VP External Myriam Zaidi expressed similar concerns about the policy and agreed it needs to be reviewed. “The people who need to review it need to be people who uphold the most ethical standards ever. What I have envisioned is an ad hoc committee that would include student advocates from the student advocacy center,” said Zaidi.
Once quorum was met, there was a continuation of the conversation about the procedure to release the minutes from the confidential session during the February 3 council meeting.
Zaidi proposed a motion to suspend Robert’s Rules of Order to release these minutes. “The SSMU constitution comes before Robert’s Rules of Order, and doesn’t it provide for us to be as democratic and transparent as possible? Shouldn’t we be excellent in leadership, representation, and service? Shouldn’t we provide this service to the students and not keep everything confidential from them – especially in a situation like this?” she asked.
Clubs and Services representative Maggie Knight called for a compromise in which all members of council could go through the minutes and black out anything they personally said that they do not want released. The motion was postponed to next council, which will be held on March 16.
Lastly, in response to a previous attempt by Red Thunder to levy an opt-outable student fee, council passed a motion that will preclude any SSMU club’s ability to levy an independent fee. The new by-law reads: “No club or interest group may obtain a fee levy since all clubs and interest groups are internally funded.”

Building sustainable products is an excellent business decision, according to both keynote speakers at last week’s “Awake,” McGill’s Business Conference on Sustainability.
About 70 delegates from universities across Canada attended the conference, where they participated in workshops with industry leaders, listened to two speeches, and attended a sustainability fair with campus groups.
In his opening keynote Thursday, Steven Guilbeault – a founding member of Equiterre, a Montreal based-environmental organization,and former Greenpeace spokesperson – said that the effects of human-induced global climate change on the Earth could be even greater than scientists previously anticipated.
“It’s entirely up to us as a global society to decide how much climate change we are willing to live with, along with the consequences,” he said.
According to Guilbeault, humans need to immediately attack the root of the problem – greenhouse gas emissions – to adapt solutions to address the global rise in temperatures that 150 years of carbon emissions have already locked in.
“Adaptation is an important thing, but there are those people who say all we can do is adapt,” he said. “I’d like these people to go and explain to the population of Miami how they should adapt to a two-metre sea level rise.”
Praising the developments of renewable energy and sustainable transportation initiatives around the world, Guilebeaut reminded the audience that even greater shifts in thinking must take place in order to substantially cut global greenhouse gas emissions.
“Even if everyone is driving a hybrid in 2011, there will be 9-million of us then. That’s a lot of cars, and that’s a lot of metal,” he said. “We have to rely on more transit; we have to rethink the way we build our city.”
On Friday night, Robert Weese, the Vice President of Government and External Relations at General Electric Canada (GE), presented his company’s “ecomagination” program, which outlines measures to help GE and its customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other impacts on the Earth.
A central tenet of that program is to raise GE’s annual revenues from “ecomagination” products to $25-billion by 2013. According to Weese, his company’s primary motivation for researching and building sustainable products is its financial incentive.
“Green is green, and we don’t make any apologies for that,” he said, referring to the returns made on green products. “We’re not in this business because it’s a responsible thing to do…. We wouldn’t be in it as a company if we couldn’t make money out of it.”
The company’s program also includes goals to reduce company-wide absolute greenhouse gas emissions by one per cent and use of water by 20 per cent by 2013.
Weese stressed that his company’s ability to adapt to a constantly changing market has allowed it to survive for over 130 years.
“I think ‘ecomagination’ is our latest adaptation to a changing world,” Weese said.
The annual conference was organized by a team of students from the Management Undergraduate Society.
