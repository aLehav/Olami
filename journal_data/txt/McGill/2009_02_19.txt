Students push to scrap cap on aboriginal postsecondary education funding
An ongoing petition by the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation Community and the First Nations Education Council is asking Parliament to remove its cap on funding for aboriginal postsecondary education.
While the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) – a national student lobby group – and its member union at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) have not officially endorsed the petition, they are working for similar results.
“Even though aboriginal people are a growing demographic in Canada, the funding stays at this two per cent cap. It’s not enough funding for all the people who want to attend postsecondary institutions,” said Melissa Penney, director of advocacy for the MUN Students’ Union and regional aboriginal representative for the CFS.
Penney is also Newfoundland and Labrador’s representative on the National Aboriginal Caucus (NAC), a CFS caucus that acts as a voice for aboriginal students in Canada. She said the petition has been on NAC’s radar, and it is starting to get materials together to push a similar campaign of its own.
Penney felt putting more money into aboriginal education would mean increased enrolment and higher success rates among Canada’s First Nations Peoples.
“There’s not a lack of aspirations keeping people from attending post-secondary studies,” she said. “There’s no lack of interest; there’s a lack of funding to go.”
The petition, expected to reach 10,500 signatures this month, calls for the removal of Parliament’s two per cent annual growth cap for the amount given to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada – the federal ministry that funds aboriginal education through the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP).
After PSSSP gives the money to the individual bands, they are then given the responsibility of deciding where the money must go.
“Some bands are facing really hard decisions, like: ‘Should we fund everyone in their last year of education, or should we give so much to each student and then they don’t have enough money for rent and food?’” Penney said.
Last year, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Development published a report titled “No Higher Priority: Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education In Canada,” which recommended dealing with the extension of postsecondary support to non-status First Nations and Métis students.
In the Conservatives’ 2009 budget, funding for on-reserve aboriginals and schools was directed to infrastructure projects alone, while also directing $200-million for skills training to help reduce unemployment rates.

Bidding blackwood, jumping to two no-trump, and ruffing in dummy: these are all standard card game terms to the over 200 members of the McGill Bridge Club, four of whom qualified earlier this month for the Educational Foundation Collegiate in Washington D.C., to be held this July.
Bridge is a four-person, trick taking card game modelled after Whist and similar to Hearts that involves intense strategy and technique. Contrary to the widely-held belief that most bridge players are seniors, a significant proportion of the estimated 60- to 100-million bridge players worldwide are spry, young enthusiasts.
Christopher Chalcraft, the current president of the McGill Bridge Club, explained that the variety in play is what keeps him playing.
“I like how intricate bridge is,” Chalcraft said. “The more you learn about bridge, the more addictive it becomes.”
While the basics of bridge can be taught in an hour, players are constantly learning new techniques, and playing with new partners and opponents.
“It’s not something that you figure out once and then it’s done,” said Shaz Taslimi, a former president of the club who has been playing for five years. “It does require analytical thinking. You do need to visualize the cards you can’t see.”
But while the game can satisfy the curiosity of the mind, many enjoy playing because of the friendly atmosphere.
“A lot of people start playing because it’s a social activity,” said Julia Evans, one of the four team members who qualified for the Collegiate tournament, who explained that meeting new friends at the table from nearly every McGill faculty has increased the value of the game.
The attraction of the friendly atmosphere is echoed by Paul Linxwiler, the managing editor of the Bridge Bulletin, the monthly magazine of the American Contract Bridge League.
“Bridge is the greatest game because of the partnership element,” Linxwiler said. “Trying to maintain communication between the partnership…that’s an art.”
Linxwiler also remarked that each game being a new experience has helped the game survive in its current form for nearly 100 years.
“Any game you could learn in five minutes is unlikely to hold your attention for a lifetime,” Linxwiler said. “It has an internal complexity and an internal beauty that keeps people playing.”
Chalcraft added that the supposed demographic skew is probably due to the stereotypes attached to the game by people who have never tried it, and that people need only need a few hours to get hooked.
“Bridge is a game of all ages. The reason most elderly probably play it [as opposed to youth] is because they have more time on their hands.”
The McGill Bridge Club meets Thursdays at 6 p.m. in the Trottier cafeteria. They can be contacted at mcgillbridgeclub@gmail.com.

Human Rights Watch director weighs in on the role of the international community in Rwandan and Sudanese genocides
International politics nullified domestic law in Sudan and Rwanda, sites of Africa’s most recent genocides, argued Georgette Gagnon, Executive Director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch (HRW), at a lecture held by the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism yesterday.
“In our experience, politics trumps law every time,” Gagnon said. “Our advocacy at Human Rights Watch is about taking that into account – not giving into it, but to address it and give our recommendations credibility.”
HRW is working in Africa to make politics accountable to law, thereby ensuring that human lives are not sacrificed in a larger political game. The organization performs strategic investigations to uncover human rights violations and hold oppressors accountable for their crimes.
Gagnon suggested that political forces were at work in the international community’s reluctance to label the mass killings of nearly one million Rwandans in 1994 as a genocide. She listed Rwanda’s lack of political muscle, oil, gold or other resources; the United States’s recent withdrawal from Somalia; and an overriding sense of racism of the western world as possible causes for international apathy.
A similar situation exists with the crisis in Sudan, according to Gagnon, who said United Nations Security Council members from China and Russia have perpetuated the crisis in Sudan because they have a political stake in the oil and arms business in the country, respectively.
Gagnon criticized the international community’s impulse to deploy troops to conflict zones when alternative, non-violent methods could be more effective. She suggested that radio jamming – disrupting the signals that in Rwanda were used to spread racial hate and to communicate violent commands to troops – could have been a practical and effective method of intervention. The Pentagon ruled against the tactic, claiming the cost – $8,000 an hour – was too expensive.
A law student voiced a concern commonly expressed in developing countries: that non-governmental organizations like HRW hand down universal principles, failing to account for unique political situations. HRW is currently criticized for urging the redress of current Rwandan ruler Paul Kagami, who they claim is keeping the region stable.  Kagami’s government killed 30,000 people in its early years after the genocide.
“We don’t interfere with political decisions. All we can say is, impartially, if he is committing war crimes then he should be brought to trial,” Gagnon replied.
Gagnon noted that HRW does work with grassroots organizations.
“In Africa there are vibrant local human rights communities that are pushing for the same things we are – universal human rights – and we always try to reach out and connect to those.”
She also acknowledged that politicians are forced to choose between peace and justice.
“The law should be applied impartially. Our job is advocacy and redress, but the more practical and realistic we are, the more likely [our policies will be effective],” Gagnon said. “Thus we should acknowledge our compromise. We say there is no durable peace without justice.”
A member of the audience noted that the work of human rights organizations is mainly reactive and reports violations, asking how groups work to prevent human rights abuse.
“Everything we do is preventive. It’s corruption, lack of access to resources, nepotism, social and economic violations of rights which lead to this kind of genocide,” Gagnon said.
 Economic and social legal violations are predictors of political abuse, she added, which is where HRW can help.

Defense lawyer criticizes post
Paul Skolnik, a high-flying defence attorney at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and McGill alum, articulated his dissatisfaction with court proceedings to a small but captivated audience of about 30 at Chancellor Day Hall Monday.
Skolnik discussed the malpractice he witnessed at the ICTR while he represented Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, former Cabinet Director to the Rwandan Defence Minister and mastermind of the genocide, as well as Gratien Kabiligi, the Chief of Military Operations in the Rwandan Armed Forces.
He described the trials as “scandalous,” and recounted numerous breaches of what he called the fair trial concept: one judge was found to be living with a woman on the prosecution; thousands of arrest warrants were issued without evidence; and the right to a trial without undue delay was not respected.
Erfrat Shemesh, a McGill Law student specializing in human rights who attended the event, called for universal recognition of human rights for all those present in a court of law.
“[As future lawyers], we must do our best to ensure that human rights are respected globally, and granted not just to the victims, but also to the perpetrators,” Shemesh said.
Skolinik was also appalled that Kabiligi was held for 11 and a half years before he was acquitted of his charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.
“The only people who worked under [Gratien Kabiligi’s] command worked in offices making war plans, like for every nation,” he said, explaining Kabligi’s direct role in the genocide. “He did not have any subordinate combat troops.”
When asked about the purpose of genocide trials, Skolnik said that it should “promote national reconciliation,” adding that proceedings must be conducted in the name of humanity.
However, he felt, that national reconciliation had not yet been achieved in Rwanda.
“The only thing preventing the conflict from exploding again is the country’s extremely oppressive dictatorship,” he said.
The Rwanda genocide started on April 6, 1994. The Hutu militia conducted mass killings of the country’s Tutsi population for over 100 days, by which time over 800,000 individuals had been murdered.
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, held in Arusha, Tanzania, is the third in history, after the Nuremberg trials post-World War II, and the ICT for Yugoslavia, at The Hague in 1993.
Skolnik was invited to speak at the Faculty of Law by McGill’s Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism (HRLP). The event was co-sponsored by the student-run Human Rights Working Group.

Reporting independently from the frontlines of war is an increasingly rare engagement for journalists working for major international media outlets. From Iraq to Afghanistan, reporters are increasingly embedded in advancing western forces on the front lines, making it challenging to maintain an independent voice.
When Israeli military forces launched an invasion into the Gaza Strip, international journalists were barred entry into the territory by the Israeli government. Major international media outlets, including CNN and the BBC, reported on Gaza from hilltops in Israeli controlled territory, kilometres away from the actual conflict.
Reporting from the Middle East, British journalist Robert Fisk has offered decades of fiercely independent accounts of the region’s conflicts. Stationed in Beirut, Lebanon, Fisk reports for the U.K.-based Independent newspaper, which has a large global distribution. Fish spoke recently with local journalist Stefan Christoff, offering comments on the media response to the recent war in the Gaza Strip.
The McGill Daily: Historical context is often not included in daily reporting on the Middle East. Could you offer some historical perspectives to the recent war in Gaza?
Robert Fisk: In 1948, when the Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes – 750,000 is the figure widely accepted – those in the north, in the Galilee area of what became Israel, fled into Lebanon; those in the Jerusalem area fled east toward what we now call the West Bank; those in the south of what became Israel fled south into what we now call the Gaza Strip.
For example, in 2000, after the Israelis finished their final withdrawal after 22 years of occupation [in Lebanon] and went across the border back into Israel, many Palestinians in Lebanon went down to the border and looked across, not because they were looking at northern Israel but because they were looking at the northern part of Palestine as they had known it. Some could actually see the villages that their parents or grandparents had come from in 1948.
So there is this whole Diaspora around the state of Israel who can’t go home because our home is on the other side of the border, and this reality revolves around the whole issue of United Nations General Assembly resolution 194 on the right of return, [which stipulates that] these Palestinian refugees have the right to return to their homes.
Well over half of the people living in Gaza are families, either survivors or descendants of Palestinians, who lived only ten or 12 miles in what today is Israel. So when you hear the Israelis say “the terrorists are firing rockets into Israel,” the Palestinians in Gaza can in many cases say “well my grandson is firing a rocket at my town because before 1948, these areas would have been Palestinian property.”
MD: What were your perceptions on media coverage during the latest war in Gaza?
RF: The international press allowed for their own humiliation: Israel told the press that they couldn’t go into Gaza and they didn’t really try to, so the press sat outside Gaza and pontificated from two miles away. Israel wanted to keep the international press out of Gaza and they were kept out; that was that.
It is instructive to note that no major western media outlet had a reporter based inside Gaza who would have been there when it started. Clearly after the kidnapping of a BBC reporter, who was based in Gaza, it is not surprising that the international news agencies were hesitant to base reporters in Gaza. However, it is also instructive to note that it was the Hamas government that had the BBC reporter released, which is not often mentioned now.
Faced with the fact that the only journalists left inside Gaza were Palestinian reporters, the major networks were forced to hand over their reporting to Palestinian Arabs, who in many cases were refugees inside Gaza.
This meant that you had Palestinian reporters on the ground talking about their own people, unencumbered by western reporters cross-questioning them, or trying to put 50 per cent of the story on one side and 50 per cent of the story on the other side.
Al-Jazeera came out as the heroes of journalism because they had both their international service, their English service, and also their Arabic service fully operational from offices inside Gaza.
Individual Palestinians working for western news organizations showed that they could be competent journalists and the western journalists who sat outside Gaza looked as pathetic as their reporting on the Middle East is becoming.
Palestinian reporters were telling their own stories.  In the case [of the Independent], our Palestinian reporter inside Gaza had his father killed in an air strike – his father who was a pro-Palestinian Authority, English-speaking, well-educated judge, killed in his orchard. So the Independent had on our front page, this terrible and tragic story of this innocent man destroyed, atomized into pieces of flesh by an Israel air strike in his orchard, a story reported by his own son in our newspaper.
So this was the kind of journalism from Palestine that we hadn’t seen in the major [western] press, so there was an upside to the [international] press being banned from Gaza. However, the work of the international reporters was truly pathetic.

Middle-aged users are now the social networking site’s largest demographic
With 36,908 Facebook users on the McGill network, it’s not surprising that an increasing number of professors are turning to this and other social networking devices, such as MySpace and Gmail, to communicate with students.
Dr. Paul Wiseman, an associate professor in the department of chemistry, was introduced to Facebook in 2004 by one of his students.
“An undergraduate research student and later a graduate student in my lab added me to Facebook, and told me that it was a Harvard study to examine degrees of separation,” Wiseman wrote in an email to The Daily. “I had no idea what it was morphing into, as far as a social network site.”
Wiseman, who commonly teaches over 1,000 undergraduates per year, and has a Facebook network of over 1,300 friends, says that he accepts almost anyone who adds him – assuming that they’re former students.
“What is interesting is that now almost all of my requests come from high school or university friends, which shows how ubiquitous Facebook has become, and how it has changed,” Wiseman added.
In five years, Facebook has undergone a rapid evolution, with the middle-aged its largest growing age demographic. From its initial start as a social network available only to Ivy League college students, it is now accessible to everyone with Internet access, and hosts over 175 million active users.
Wiseman said Facebook could be used for academic purposes as well as social ones, explaining that a Nigerian science writer who volunteers in a malaria clinic added him after Wiseman’s lab developed a new way to detect malaria infection in blood cells.
When asked about using the limited profile function when accepting students’ “friend” requests, Dr. Jim Kanaris, a professor from the Faculty of Religious Studies, was unconcerned about what his students learned through his profile.
“There really isn’t anything on Facebook that students wouldn’t discover by spending time with me during office hours,” explained Kanaris, a self-described social bug. “Students like to know their professors are more than they seem: automata.”
Kanaris added that he often “friends” students from his smaller classes, and communicates with them via Gchat over Gmail.
Students don’t seem to have a problem with their professor’s Facebooking.
U2 International Development Studies student Olivia Perdana said she didn’t mind political science professor Rex Brynen being privy to her personal information, having had him from a first-year class in Leacock 132.
“I don’t think I ever checked his profile and I doubt he’d be interested in checking mine…. Even if he did, it wouldn’t really matter since I doubt he’d know who I was anyway,” Perdana said.
U3 Physiology student Dan Beamer had no problem having Dr. Paul Wiseman as a friend on Facebook.
“He was [my] chemistry professor in first year. Good guy, one of the best teachers I’ve had here. I’ve run into him at hockey games [both] at the Bell Centre and McGill.”
While both Kanaris and Wiseman continue to use more standardized forums like WebCT to communicate information to their students, they expressed that Facebook is just another means of communication.
“I’m always on the look out for new technology,” Kanaris said. “Call me crazy, but I consider it a valuable medium of communication.”
