With its huge turnout, the GA was a highlight of Courtney Ayukawa’s first semester in office. Ultimately, despite some initial problems and delays, she was able to handle the challenging logistics of the GA. As President, Ayukawa made progress on the review of outdated bylaws, partially prompted by a Judicial Board case against SSMU which she helped to resolve. She also oversaw the successful hiring of a new General Manager for SSMU.
For the most part, Ayukawa’s enthusiasm for sustainability, as highlighted in her campaign platform, has not yet translated into tangible improvements. However, she has undertaken consultation efforts with respect to a new sustainability policy. Although Ayukawa regularly intervenes in defence of students’ interests at Senate, she has been less visible at the Board of Governors, finding her role as the sole SSMU representative there challenging.
Ayukawa has attempted to open negotiations over SSMU’s Memorandum of Agreement, which outlines its legal agreement with the University, hoping to avoid timing and transparency issues, but the McGill administration has not been receptive to her efforts. She has also begun planning a joint summit with PGSS, which would determine budget priorities in light of recent provincial cuts and present the results to the administration.

Kathleen Bradley’s term started off on an uncertain footing, with the previous SSMU executive’s failure to pass the SSMU building fee leaving the Society’s budget at risk of devastating cuts. According to Bradley, working around this uncertainty to pass a new building fee was both one of the most serious challenges and one of the greatest accomplishments of her term. While the new fee was unpopular with some, it has allowed SSMU to continue to operate effectively and meet its mandate to students.
Another of Bradley’s significant projects has been The Nest, the student-run cafe which opened last year. As could be expected of a new business, The Nest has been operating at a loss, with its main priorities – providing food that is both low-cost and locally-sourced – appearing to conflict. Despite this, Bradley told The Daily that budget projections for the cafe are better than originally expected.
Bradley has also made a commendable effort to communicate important information, such as clarifications regarding the budget, to both the press and the student body as a whole.

Claire Stewart-Kanigan has shown exceptional initiative and leadership in her mandate so far, consistently supporting and advocating for students through a range of channels. She has overseen the successful launch of SSMU’s new mental health department, including the hiring of a coordinator and the planning and execution of Mental Health Awareness Week, and has been heavily involved in the student-led effort to draft and implement a sexual assault policy at McGill.
Stewart-Kanigan has assumed a strong leadership role in the SSMU Senate caucus, helping to make it a vocal, coordinated, and effective team that consistently advocates for students, and submits at least one question to a member of the administration at every meeting. She has also made an effort to pressure the administration in other ways, notably by bringing to light student funding of 24-hour library access.
Within SSMU, Stewart-Kanigan has made an effort to incorporate equity into event planning, and has begun a process to revisit SSMU’s equity policy. She has also held a public forum on weapons development, and will continue to work to extend and solidify SSMU’s policy on military research.
As VP Internal, Daniel Chaim oversees communication and events for SSMU. Frosh, one of his main portfolio items, was a success, and missed breaking even by a marginal 0.35 per cent of its $250,000 budget, a substantial improvement over last year’s $21,000 deficit. Chaim has also been receptive to concerns about equity at Frosh: Frosh and Orientation Week staff saw enhanced training on alcohol and consent, and Frosh coordinators also underwent equity training. Chaim noted a significant effort to mitigate the strain that Frosh puts on the Milton-Parc community’s relationship with McGill, although he recognized a need for continued improvement. He was pleased with this year’s 4Floors event, and with the effectiveness of SSMU’s costume campaign in particular.
The Old McGill Yearbook, which has been costing SSMU roughly $20,000 annually in recent years, due to declining sales, will pose a challenge to Chaim this semester. Emphasizing the historical importance of the yearbook’s continued publication, Chaim has suggested the implementation of a publications fee to support it. He also hopes to facilitate communication within SSMU through the recently created ad-hoc Communications Committee, and to improve the structure and timing of Orientation Week planning.
In her first semester as VP External, Amina Moustaqim-Barrette reinvigorated the position with increased political involvement. She made climate change action a priority, taking a leading role in the Étudiant(e)s Contre les Oléoducs (ECO) coalition after SSMU passed a motion to join it at the GA. The External portfolio has provided support and funding for the ongoing Divest McGill campaign, and Moustaqim-Barrette was also involved in organizing the Fossil Free Canada climate convergence..
While her dedication to the issue of environmental justice is admirable, we’d like to see Moustaqim-Barrette broaden the focus of her mobilization efforts, especially in the context of a growing province-wide movement against austerity. Moustaqim-Barrette has made some progress in solidifying SSMU’s relationship with other Quebec universities through involvement with ECO; however, the fact that SSMU has remained an independent student union since leaving the TaCEQ student roundtable last year may have hindered collaboration and mobilization efforts.
To counteract the backlash from those students who don’t see SSMU as a political body, Moustaqim-Barrette has indicated to The Daily that she intends to better communicate the purpose of the External portfolio to students this semester. She also aims to propose an alternative to TaCEQ by the end of her term.
Occupying the Clubs & Services position for a second consecutive year, Stefan Fong has had the opportunity to continue working on his long-term projects, although progress on these has been relatively slow. Two significant endeavours – the reorganization of the fourth floor of the Shatner building and the creation of a club management portal known as the Club Hub – are currently stalled, as it is unclear what clubs’ precise needs are. A comprehensive survey has been designed, and will be distributed to clubs early this semester. Focusing on data collection for the moment, Fong aims to leave concrete action plans for his successor.
In day-to-day operations, Fong has put greater emphasis on workshops for clubs, which have seen increased attendance. The construction on McTavish created difficulties for Activities Night, due to fire safety regulations, but no major problems arose aside from a lack of volunteers. Fong told The Daily that, due to high demand, responding to clubs’ inquiries in a timely manner remains a challenge – a fact that he hopes to address by giving clubs more autonomy when the Club Hub project comes to fruition.

So far, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) executive’s greatest achievement has been the resolution of the long-drawn-out legal battle with the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), which began in 2010. Although its confidence in Secretary-General Juan Camilo Pinto appeared low after the PGSS Board of Directors passed a motion of censure against him on December 3, the executive appears to have restored its cohesion to a working level.
Juan Camilo Pinto has prioritized the updating of PGSS bylaws and governance documents, notably implementing a reform of the PGSS Judicial Board. He has also helped to move the CFS case forward, and has worked on student life initiatives such as the development of an intramural sports grant and the revamping of the Post-Graduate Student Life Fund.
Pinto has not been very active on the Board of Governors or at Senate, although he contributed to the passing of a set of regulations on graduate student advising and supervision, which clarified the student-supervisor relationship. Pinto indicated to The Daily that he has “started a conversation” with members of the administration to defend graduate students’ interests in the event that the university acquires the Royal Victoria Hospital.
The PGSS Board of Directors’ censure of Pinto was a major drawback to the fulfillment of his mandate, and points to a broader dissatisfaction with his leadership. For example, some PGSS councillors have expressed concern that Pinto had signed a statement on behalf of PGSS without consulting Council or the executive.
Julien Ouellet has been very active at the level of the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), with which PGSS is affiliated. He has contributed to FEUQ’s lobbying efforts for cheaper international student health insurance, and has also worked on co-hosting the GU15 forum of pan-Canadian graduate student associations. Additionally, he promoted FEUQ’s campaign to reconfigure the provincial student loan program for increased accessibility.
Ouellet told The Daily that lobbying the provincial government for changes has been particularly difficult, given its emphasis on austerity measures. In this context especially, PGSS would stand to benefit from increased mobilization and activism beyond the relatively narrow framework defined and endorsed by FEUQ. Ouellet has, however, worked with graduate student associations outside FEUQ, and he plans to increase collaboration with Concordia during the semester.
As Academic Affairs Officer, Jennifer Murray has strived to represent graduate students’ interests on University committees and at Senate. For example, she assisted PGSS members in bringing their concerns to Senate regarding the move of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre to the Glen site superhospital. As a member of the Senate Nominating Committee, she also contributed to the addition of another Senate seat for PGSS.
Improving graduate supervision has been a priority for Murray. She contributed to the reforms, passed at Senate in October, that increased accountability in graduate supervision. As a result, said Murray, this issue should be taken more seriously by the administration and by faculty. She also collaborated with Pinto in reviewing PGSS’ activities manual and bylaws. Murray noted that reaching the entire PGSS membership had been a challenge for her, as the graduate student body is not entirely concentrated on campus.
According to Nikki Meadows, changes to the Post-Graduate Student Life Fund are among her most noteworthy successes. These reforms allowed the numerous departmental associations, as well as postdoctoral fellows, to access their own finances and budget with less oversight from PGSS as a whole.
Changes to the grants program, emphasized by Meadows and the rest of the slate during last spring’s campaign period, have also been implemented. These include the removal of minimum and maximum grant amounts, as well as the creation of a more impartial grant allocation process.
One of Meadows’ main challenges has been dealing with PGSS’ various legal entanglements with CFS, and the substantial legal costs they incur. While such costs are all but unavoidable, and are, in fact, critical to PGSS’ ongoing struggle to leave CFS, Meadows expressed regret that the money involved could not be used to fund other deserving projects.
Meadows has also been closely involved in lease negotiations with the administration for Thomson House. While there has been no sign of major discord in the negotiations so far, Meadows and the rest of the PGSS executive have insisted on keeping them confidential. A lack of transparency could severely harm student trust, as was the case with the SSMU building lease last year.
Gesa’s term as Internal Affairs Officer has been a busy one so far. He told The Daily that the PGSS Internal Affairs Committee, over which he presides, has doubled in size compared to last year. This has provided the opportunity to plan a dense social calendar for PGSS members, including upcoming trips to Ottawa and Quebec City, a widely-anticipated laser tag event, and a love and sex week in February with events such as queer speed dating.
Like some other PGSS execs, Gesa mentioned CFS troubles as one of the main challenges of his term so far. Noting the lawsuit which he filed as an individual against CFS and won, Gesa expressed regret over the energy that often had to be diverted toward CFS issues instead of other initiatives. However, Gesa is hopeful that, pending the results of the upcoming disaffiliation referendum, the resolution of PGSS’ legal and financial disagreements with CFS will liberate resources and allow him to expand the implementation of his portfolio.
As the Member Services Officer, Brighita Lungu has maintained mental health as a high priority for PGSS through active involvement in Mental Health Week and the Students in Mind conference. Lungu has also pushed for new mental health initiatives, including the development of a services map in conjunction with the PGSS equity committee to help students access mental health resources more easily, and the production of a testimonial-based mini documentary about grad students’ experiences with mental health, which should be completed this semester.
Given that roughly 1,000 PGSS members have children, childcare has been another priority for Lungu. PGSS currently offers monthly “Study Saturdays,” providing babysitting services, snacks, and activities for members’ children, giving the parents time to study. Lungu is also seeking government approval for PGSS to open a private daycare, but her efforts have so far been unsuccessful due to the low zoning priority given to childcare services in the downtown area.

Trans activists argue proposed implementation still harmful
Correction appended January 26, 2015.
On December 17, the Liberal government drafted regulations to put Bill 35 into effect, more than a year after the bill was passed into law by the Quebec National Assembly on December 6, 2013. Bill 35 struck down several requirements of the Quebec Civil Code for trans people who wish to legally change their gender marker on official documents.
Prior to Bill 35, legislation required a person who wanted to change the name and gender markers on their official documents to publish their old name, new name, and civic address in a local newspaper and the official Gazette of Quebec, and to undergo surgical gender reassignment.
While Bill 35 legally eliminated these requirements, they are still effectively in place pending the implementation of new regulations – and these newly-proposed regulations still pose challenges to individuals wishing to change the gender markers on their official documents.
“We are in a crunch right now. We have between now and January 31 to make our voice heard. We need all the support we can get.”
The new regulations require that an applicant for a gender marker change must declare that they have “lived under the appearance” of the gender they want reflected on their documents for at least two years, and have this corroborated by an affidavit from a person who has known them for at least two years. Further, the application must also include a letter from a physician, psychologist, psychiatrist, or sexologist that “confirms that the change of designation is appropriate.”

According to Gabrielle Bouchard, Peer Support and Trans Advocacy Coordinator at the Centre for Gender Advocacy (CGA), these new regulations pose serious harms to trans people.
“The government is essentially saying that we promise you two years of discrimination before we will allow you to change your gender marker. It means that trans people will be the only group in Quebec that will be forced into a gender norm, forced into a femininity and masculinity,” said Bouchard in an interview with The Daily.
Bouchard also noted that the requirement to have an affidavit from someone who has known the applicant for at least two years could be difficult to satisfy or even unsafe for some trans people, who often cut ties with people in their lives who do not accept their transition.
“Now the government is saying that you’d better stick to people even if they are not nice to you, because if you don’t stick to them, then you won’t have anybody proving that it has been two years. And your two years will be delayed until you are actually in a place in your life where you can actually have this person that will be willing enough to find you worthy of their affidavit,” said Bouchard.
Furthermore, the requirement for a person to explicitly present themselves as a gender that does not match their documentation for two years poses its own difficulties. Not having a gender marker changed on one’s birth certificate means that one cannot have access to one’s right gender on Medicare cards, drivers’ licences, school documents, or student permanent code.
“[The regulations] will force people to live under the appearance of a gender without being able to defend their identity with a document. These people are exposed to harassment and violence,” said Caroline Trottier-Gascon, founder of the Groupe d’action trans at Université de Montréal, in French in an interview with Metro.
“[…]People just coming out of school are trained to believe that trans issues and trans lives are pathologies. So how can we think that those people will actually be there to help trans communities, to give them possibilities to have legal status?”
Trottier-Gascon noted that having documents that do not ‘match’ one’s appearance can make finding housing and employment particularly difficult.
Bouchard also pointed out that the medical professionals authorized by the legislation are trained to believe that being trans is a medical condition.
“Now there are some people who are trying to deconstruct this knowledge. But people just coming out of school are trained to believe that trans issues and trans lives are pathologies. So how can we think that those people will actually be there to help trans communities, to give them possibilities to have legal status?”
Particularly frustrating to members of trans communities has been the unfruitful dialogue with the government. “A year ago they [the government] came to us with those ideas [in the proposed regulations], and we told them what was wrong with it. They’ve known for a long time, yet they have decided not to listen,” Bouchard told the Daily.
In order for the new regulations to be put into effect, they must be published in the Gazette of Quebec for 45 days, during which time the public can raise any concerns they have with them. Bouchard pointed out that the new regulation to Bill 35 was published during the holidays, when news like this tends to go under the radar.
“We are in a crunch right now. We have between now and January 31 to make our voice heard. We need all the support we can get.”
An earlier version of this article stated that prior to Bill 35, legislation required a person who wanted to change the gender markers on their official documents to publish their old name, new name, and civic address in a local newspaper and the official Gazette of Quebec. In fact, that was a requirement for a name change. The Daily regrets the error.

Provost warns to expect additional cuts in 2016-17
In what Principal Suzanne Fortier called “a full experience of our Senate,” the December 3 Senate meeting saw some confusion over rules of procedure in the discussion of a proposed policy on late course withdrawals in exceptional circumstances. Provost Anthony Masi also gave a presentation on budget planning for 2016-17.
Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures & Equity) Lydia White moved to approve a policy on late course withdrawals as part of the report of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). With the goal of setting “accurate, fair and compassionate guidelines to address difficult situations,” the proposed policy would allow removal of the courses and grades for an entire term from the official transcript if the student withdrew from all classes under exceptional circumstances.
A lengthy discussion ensued, in which numerous student senators emphasized the necessity to similarly allow for removal of individual courses from the official transcript, as a student under duress may wish to concentrate on one or two classes instead of withdrawing the entire term.
“To have [the motion] withdrawn showed an unwillingness to have open and honest debate in Senate.”
White indicated that the APC had decided against extending the policy to individual courses, as “it would be very difficult to determine on what basis one should be allowed to withdraw from some courses and not others.”
Students raised concerns that this ‘all-or-nothing’ approach would create a difficult situation for students wishing to partially withdraw from a term. “I fear that this [policy] might be harmful, because we’re telling students, ‘You can lose all the work you’ve done, or accept the Ws,’” said Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Medicine Senator David Benrimoh.
Arts Faculty Senator Catherine Lu argued that “manual curing” of the transcript could jeopardize its credibility, and that grades of W don’t necessarily penalize the student in admissions. “[The presence of Ws] indicates that the student had a legitimate reason to withdraw, and that actually makes us discount the [other] lower grades that the student received in that term,” said Lu.
Dean of Students Andre Costopoulos countered that Ws are in fact harmful for admissions, especially in medicine and law. While a W is not defined by McGill as a punitive notation, “in effect, we have seen over the years that it has become punitive,” he said.
SSMU Law Senator Dan Snyder shared his experience of facing invasive questions from employers after taking a term off for health reasons and receiving Ws. “Putting people on the spot for future employment again and again, that’s something we need to avoid,” he said.
Seeing no consensus, White indicated that she had “no objection to withdrawing the motion.” With consent from Engineering Faculty Senator David Covo, who had seconded the motion, it was withdrawn.
Benrimoh, who had attempted to put forth an amendment moments before the motion was withdrawn, then moved to suspend the rules and reconsider the motion in order to amend the policy to include a mandatory review clause. The vote, which required a three-fourths majority, failed, but the reconsideration motion will be voted on again at the next Senate meeting on January 21.
“I was shocked, frankly, that the motion was withdrawn,” Benrimoh told The Daily in an interview. “[The motion] doesn’t quite go far enough, and it does present certain difficulties, but not enough that it’s worth completely shooting down.”
“We were really disappointed,” added Benrimoh. “To have [the motion] withdrawn showed an unwillingness to have open and honest debate in Senate.”
In giving the budget planning presentation, the first of three this year, Masi emphasized the continued uncertainty of government funding, with about $20 million in provincial cuts having been announced mid-year. An additional $5 to $6 million in cuts are expected for 2016-17 based on preliminary indications, Masi said.
Noting that “austerity measures will not lead to successful future for McGill and its community” in the presentation, Masi indicated that community consultation will be required to perform “strategic cuts” weighted more heavily toward certain units.
In her opening remarks, Fortier indicated that the Board of Governors had approved the appointment of a new provost at its December 2 meeting. Current Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi will replace Masi in the role effective July 1.

ECOLE project gains access to potential fee levy with new status
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council convened for its final meeting of the year on December 4. Council granted ECOLE independent group status, discussed ways to engage constituents with SSMU, and passed a motion against police brutality and racialized law enforcement in solidarity with the protests in Ferguson.
Council passed a motion giving the ECOLE project Independent Student Group status, and thus an official tie to SSMU. ECOLE is a community and research centre that aims to promote sustainability and to be a model for sustainable living, according to ECOLE facilitator Emily Boytinck.
SSMU helped to set the project in motion last year, and ECOLE’s new status will help solidify its relationship with SSMU, Boytinck told Council.
“Institutionalizing ECOLE’s relationship with SSMU was crucial to the long-term sustainability of the project,” said Arts Senator Kareem Ibrahim, a member of ECOLE’s board of directors, in an email to The Daily. Ibrahim, along with two other councillors, abstained from the vote due to involvement with the ECOLE project.
Ibrahim also noted that this new status would allow ECOLE to secure funding through a fee levy when its current funding, provided by the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF), ceases at the end of the academic year.
Several councillors brought forth a motion to ask that representatives invite their constituents to certain Council meetings, so that students could take part in discussions and engage with SSMU.
“Most students don’t know what SSMU Council is or what it does,” said Ibrahim, one of the movers. “[Students] should come to SSMU Council in a proactive way, rather than a reactive way.”
However, other councillors were critical of the motion. “I don’t see how students sitting and watching us talk for four hours is really an active, engaging, two-way communication relationship,” said Arts and Science Senator Chloe Rourke.
“If most of the public doesn’t know what SSMU Council is or how to access it, we’re far from fulfilling our roles as representatives and informants.”
President Courtney Ayukawa argued that the motion was unnecessary, as encouraging students to attend Council meetings was already in councillors’ mandates.
Medicine Senator David Benrimoh contested, “There is value in reminding people, look: this is your legislative body, we are here for you, if you would like to see our deliberations, how we work and how we make decisions that affect your daily lives, you’re welcome [here].”
The motion failed. “If most of the public doesn’t know what SSMU Council is or how to access it, we’re far from fulfilling our roles as representatives and informants,” Ibrahim told The Daily, expressing disappointment with the outcome.
In the context of the grand jury decisions not to indict officers for the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and of Eric Garner in New York, and the growing number of black deaths at the hands of the police, Council voted to condemn the decisions, as well as police brutality and racialized law enforcement, and to work with the Black Students’ Network (BSN) to release a statement on the issue.
“This is something that does affect our student body,” said VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan. “It is not a neutral act to remain silent.”
Ayukawa took issue with the fact that BSN had not been consulted in the drafting of the motion. “I’m uncomfortable with a room full of people that do not seem visibly black passing this motion,” she said.
“[It would have been] ideal to consult the BSN in writing this motion, but given the time constraint, consultation was only had with the SSMU Equity Commissioners,” Ibrahim, one of the movers, told The Daily in an email.
Halfway through the discussion, BSN representative Élie Lubendo came to the meeting, having being informed of the motion by a councillor. After consulting other BSN members, he voiced support for the motion despite the lack of consultation, and proposed an amendment to include the deaths of other black civilians, to show that this was an issue “all across ages, all across genders.”
The motion passed.

Terms of France-Quebec agreement to change following negotiations
For over three decades, French students at Quebec universities have been exempt from international student fees, paying the same tuition rate as residents of the province. However, in light of ongoing negotiations between the Couillard government and the French state, this special status is about to change.
The current tuition regulations are the result of a bilateral agreement reached in 1978. In recognition of the profound cultural and historical ties between Quebec and France, French students pay an annual tuition fee of only $2,200 – the same as Quebec residents – rather than the tuition paid by most international students, which varies between $12,000 and $30,000 depending on the program.
“I think for the French it’s a bit of a blow, obviously, and it’s going to restrict the [influx] of French students.”
This arrangement has been subject to increasing criticism in recent years, however, as the number of those benefitting from it has risen dramatically. During the Fall 2014 semester, roughly 8,000 French students attended Quebec institutions, representing an increase of 90 per cent since 2006, while around 1,000 Quebec students attended French universities.
This past autumn, Premier Philippe Couillard began negotiations with French president François Hollande to reform the 1978 agreement. Although the details remain under discussion, La Presse reported that a mutually agreed-upon solution has emerged: French students will be subject to the same tuition fees as Canadians from out of province.
They will retain a unique status as citizens of France, but this tuition hike of roughly $4,400 is meant to help to ease the province’s financial burden.
Brice Letcher, a third-year Biology student at McGill from Rhône-Alpes, France, commented on the financial drawback for French students. “I think for the French it’s a bit of a blow, obviously, and it’s going to restrict the [influx] of French students.”
However, Letcher ultimately expressed approval of the proposed reform. “All the arguments in favour of the raise, I think, are more than fair,” Letcher told The Daily. “Philippe Couillard made a promise to Hollande and held it, namely, French students will keep on paying a preferential fee. It’s still a little bit above half the price anyone from anywhere else than Canada is having to pay. So the entente franco-québécoise is still very much alive.”
According to Vice-Principal (Communications and External Relations) Olivier Marcil, this reform will be a positive development for the University, and is expected to increase revenue.
“We think this is a reasonable point of view for the Couillard government to take,” he explained in an email to the Daily. “We think it’s fair for a student from Paris, France, to pay the same as a Canadian student from Paris, Ontario.”
Addressing the unique status of French students at McGill and in Quebec as a whole, Marcil said, “It’s important because of the historic relationship between Quebec and France, and to help strengthen the French language, which is a minority language in North America. We agree that French students should have a special status compared with other international students, and even after the new fee is set, students from France will still enjoy an advantage.”
In response to concerns that the tuition hike will negatively impact French enrollment, Marcil remained relatively optimistic.
“We believe there won’t be a dramatic [effect] in either direction,” he said, noting that until negotiations end and the reform is finalized, it will be impossible to know for certain.
When it does take effect however, the new policy probably won’t apply to those currently enrolled. “The common view among Quebec universities, including McGill, is that current students should be grandfathered, so they would not pay the new fee once it is established.”

Minor program a first step in decolonizing McGill
The Indigenous Studies program launch brought a little taste of what decolonization could look like to the Faculty Club at the tail end of last semester, on December 10. The program, which will be housed under the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC), officially launched its interdisciplinary minor program to the rites of formal celebration after many years of students and advocates bringing Indigenous issues to the forefront of McGill’s imagination.
New academic associate of the program and emcee of the launch Allan Downey of the Nak’azdli First Nation described it as “really a historic moment for McGill.” McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC) Director Will Straw cited the program as a result of “research, reflection, and activism that’s been going on for many years on the part of students at McGill and the Indigenous communities on campus.”
According to its description, the minor program will investigate “historical, social, and cultural dimensions of Indigenous life in Canada.” Courses will look at the treatment of Indigenous life, the experience of Indigeneity and gender, Indigenous resistance to the Canadian government, and other topics. In future years, the idea is for the program to expand to include a major option, and many have hopes for an institute on campus one day.
“Decolonizing McGill means that [decolonization takes place] in every discipline and in every field.”
The celebration of the program launch included introductions by Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi, Straw, Downey, and Elder Jean Stevenson of the Peguis First Nation – all of whom acknowledged the Haudenosaunee land on which McGill continues to be housed, the same land on which this article was written. Performances by the Buffalo Hat Singers and Kahnawake rapper Will E. Skandalz graced the Faculty Club, along with a speech by former student Pamela Fillion, a key player in pushing forward the program.
According to the Indigenous Education Advisor at the Social Equity and Diversity Education office (SEDE) Allan Vicaire, talk of an Indigenous Studies program at McGill can be dated back to the 1980s, when former student and now professor at Yale University Ned Blackhawk put out a callout for one. In a document entitled “McGill Community Vision for an Indigenous Studies Program: Forum Report,” put together by Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) student researcher and Métis person from Manitoba Brett Lamoureux in 2013, the earliest attempt of establishing a program is cited as dating from the early 2000s.
***
Downey, in a preface to the telling of one Haudenosaunee creation story, described the “colonial dust” that has clouded the senses of academic institutions and Canadian society at large. The legacy of McGill, its founder James McGill and his role in colonialism, the placing of the Hochelaga Rock, and what it means to decolonize a space like McGill remain contested topics.
“I’ve learned over the years that for many, the idea of Indigenous Studies as a separate program can be controversial because of how it contains Indigenous knowledge, history, and politics as something separate from what is considered foundational in a university education,” said Fillion in an interview with The Daily, adding, “One of the things that I think would be important for decolonizing McGill is to have Indigenous content in every department, in every faculty. This is why the interdisciplinary aspect of the minor program is so important.”
A phone interview with Straw brought forth similar conclusions. To him, “decolonizing McGill means that [decolonization takes place] in every discipline and in every field.” He described how “that’s starting to happen and it’s way too slow. It’s way too slow at McGill, but there are courses now on Indigenous literature, Indigenous art, obviously history, and so on. Those just have to be a much bigger part of the things we learn here.”
“I can assure you that we are more than feathers and sashes and inuksuks.”
The minor, which all speakers said would not have been possible without the strong student push and collaboration with Indigenous groups at McGill and at large, serves as a first step to Indigenizing these spaces. In his speech, Downey said that “by recognizing that Indigenous knowledge offers legitimate ways of understanding the world, we have an opportunity to accept that Western ways of knowing are not the fundamental truth.”
On reflecting on his research experience, Lamoureux said in a phone interview with The Daily, “Like many other students, I found that there was a lack in integrating the Indigenous knowledge in the university setting, and a lot of it isn’t taken seriously by academics yet,” and that at McGill, he was “pleasantly surprised how non-Indigenous people wanted to study Indigenous perspectives and knowledge.”
In the Forum Report, 70.45 per cent of those polled indicated it was “very important” to have First Nations, Inuit, Métis, and Native American community leaders as course instructors. Zero per cent indicated that this was “not very important,” or “not important at all.”
When asked if there would be preference given in hiring practices to Indigenous course instructors, Straw said, “Clearly, we want to say that we want people who understand the issues the best and have the appropriate level of education. And I think it’s important at McGill that we have Indigenous faculty and teachers.”
The Forum Report also indicated that 80.95 per cent of those polled indicated that it was “very important” that the program offer language learning courses in First Nations, Inuit, or Métis languages. Currently, the minor program does not offer language courses, but Straw is supportive of the idea as a future development of the program.

Establishing the minor program was no easy task, as issues arose regarding its housing location, the cost of establishing a standalone department, and program advocates not having enough supporters within the University’s bureaucratic system to get things moving forward. “It took a while for me to figure out the process of how programs actually go through beyond the straightforward process on paper,” said Fillion.
“When we talk about processes that aim to be democratic – there are built-in structural barriers to stop people, even with strong numbers, from getting what they want.”
“I wasn’t a student politician, I was a student,” related Fillion, describing how the minor had to come into fruition sooner or later with all the work done around it – including the 2009 establishment of the KANATA Indigenous Studies community, which also produces an academic journal. KANATA made a formal recommendation and submitted a proposal, with faculty and staff support, for the establishment of the program to the Principal’s Task Force on Diversity, Excellence, and Community Engagement in the winter of 2010. The Aboriginal Affairs Working Group, made up of faculty and staff, also presented to the Task Force, recommending a minor program.
“The administrators have the power, and they need to be using that power. As a student who wasn’t a Senator nor a representative of a student union, I definitely got a really good, and at times confusing, taste of the McGill red tape when I was working on this,” Fillion said.
“When we talk about processes that aim to be democratic – there are built-in structural barriers to stop people, even with strong numbers, from getting what they want,” Fillion added, expressing hopes that what she considers a belated response to the demand for the program will not be replicated in the future.

U4 Science student and designer of the program logo Marcy Maracle wrote in an email to The Daily how she conceived of the design. “[Geese are] a Canadian symbol, as well as a prominent animal in many Indigenous stories,” Maracle wrote, going on to outline that the three geese represent the three major Indigenous groups in Canada – First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples.
“Notably, it is part of a well-known creation story, where a woman who lives in the sky world falls through a hole in the clouds. It is a goose that saves her from falling into the water, and helps her rest on the back of a turtle, which eventually becomes earth.”
Embedded in the logo is the same story that Downey told the crowd gathered at the Faculty Club for this “historic moment.”
“I can assure you that we are more than feathers and sashes and inuksuks,” Downey concluded at the end of his launch.
Fillion, in comparing the conversation on campus to other Canadian university campuses, said that there were students she had met who believed that Indigenous peoples existed only in the past.
“We can’t have students leaving McGill who still believe this,” she said.
