Munroe-Blum defends top wages for top people
No apologies are being made for the $321,471 severance package dolled out to Ann Dowsett Johnston, a former McGill Vice President of Development, Alumni and University Relations, who left her position after 19 months in September 2007.
Johnston, who was intended to orchestrate McGill’s Capital Campaign – a five-year, $750-million fundraising surge to plug the University’s chronic underfunding – collected over $760,000 in wages and benefits by the time she stepped down from her portfolio. The University’s confidentiality clause has prevented the release of the details surrounding her departure.
Principal Heather Munroe-Blum defended the payments, and explained that attracting top people requires competitive salaries.
“I’m not going to say it’s not a lot of money, [but] I won’t make apologies for paying top wages to get top people,” Munroe-Blum said, adding that the situation was quite rare.
Yet on Monday, the Journal de Montreal learned that McGill is currently paying $507,000 annually to Richard Levin, Dean of Medicine and Vice-Principal (Health Affairs), making him Canada’s top-paid medical dean.
Maria Ruocco, president of McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association – a union that is currently on strike because McGill refuses to meet their salary increase demands -– was shocked by Johnston’s severance pay figure.
“The school shouldn’t distribute so much money if it is telling us it’s having financial issues,” Ruocco said. “There seems to be a contradiction [here].”
SSMU VP External, Devin Alfaro, was suspicious of the large severance pay given for so little time, citing it as out of the ordinary.
“There’s something in there,” said Alfaro. “We just don’t know what.”
Dowsett Johnston is, according to the Gazette, a close friend of  President Munroe-Blum. Before coming to McGill, Dowsett Johnston worked for Maclean’s magazine, where she undertook the controversial ranking of the country’s universities in 1992, and established the Maclean’s Guide to Canadian Universities in 1996.
Munroe-Blum has maintained that Dowsett Johnston underwent a standard hiring process.
This is not the first severance scandal to affect underfunded Montreal universities. While high placed officials at the UQAM and Université de Montréal received considerable sums after stepping down from their respective positions, Concordia’s former president, Claude Lajeunesse, is reported to have walked away with over a million dollars in severance pay in 2007.
Like Dowsett Johnston, Lajeunesse left in the middle of a five-year contract.

Health staff look to students for feedback on possibility of a permanent future for rapid HIV testing at McGill
Free, non-nominal, rapid HIV testing will be offered to students this Friday as part of the “Love Yourself!” campaign put on by McGill Health Services, in collaboration with the McGill Global AIDS Coalition and the Shag Shop.
The event, held partly in celebration of Valentine’s Day, will test the feasibility of offering rapid HIV testing on a permanent basis at McGill Health Services.
“From speaking to students, what has come out as the biggest barrier of accessing HIV testing is the wait times at McGill Health Services,” said Jamie Lundine, director of the McGill Global AIDS Coalition.
Rapid HIV tests – involving little more than a prick of the finger – would provide immediate results, since analysis is performed on-site. According to Dr. Pierre-Paul Tellier, director of McGill Student Health Services, the minimum two-week waiting times associated with the HIV test currently offered at the McGill clinic may be a deterrent for many students to get tested at all – on-the-spot results may provide the extra incentive to go in and get tested.
“There’s no anxiety about waiting…and there’s also no anxiety, or even inconvenience, over coming back for results,” Tellier said.
The “Love Yourself!” campaign will be the first time rapid HIV testing will be made available at McGill. They have not previously been offered, in part because of financial constraints.
“[The Quebec government doesn’t] cover anything that is done in a ‘private lab,’ which is what we’re equal to. Whether it’s HIV testing or a urine test, it’s the same,” Tellier said. “Up until now we’ve absorbed the cost for all tests, but this one is a little more costly, so we don’t particularly want to put it in our budget right now.”
Friday’s free pilot program will be used, in part, to gauge the reaction of the student body to rapid HIV testing, as well as their willingness to pay $15 for the test if it were to be introduced permanently in the clinical setting.
Though McGill is not licensed to give anonymous HIV testing, “Love Yourself!” will provide non-nominal testing, which will separate students’ results from their charts.
“In the charts, all we [will] indicate is that a patient was seen, but not what for. There is no recording of the test or the results anywhere,” explained Allison-Joy Flynn, Health Promotion Officer for McGill Health Services.
Tellier did, however, note one drawback to rapid HIV testing: such tests are more susceptible to false positive results – when a test reports HIV-positive but a patient is really HIV-negative – than regular tests. A second, longer, confirmatory test is strongly recommended for all HIV-positive results to determine if the result is a true or false positive.
While regular HIV tests that report a false positive also should be followed by confirmatory tests, most labs will perform the second test immediately after the first so that they are returned to the patient together, meaning that false positives are ruled out before the patient sees any results. The problem with rapid testing is that even though patients would receive counselling, they would be unsure of their status until the second round of test results were received, causing heightened worry for that period.
Nonetheless, Tellier sees rapid testing as a big step for McGill Health in a positive direction.
“Rapid testing would be another option to give people, and if more people end up coming, it gives us more of an opportunity for education,” Tellier said. “On campus, the primary focus of HIV testing is really educating people [about HIV as well as other sexually transmitted infections], because the actual HIV prevalence we’ve detected on campus is extremely low.”
However, Tellier said that he has no specific expectations concerning turnout on Friday. He noted that the pilot project will hinge on the feedback of those who do come out and get tested, rather than on sheer numbers of participants.
“It’s more about the way things go on that day – how the nurses feel about administering it and how the students feel about it. Was it a key factor in their decision-making? That’s the kind of factors we’re looking at,” Tellier said.
“We just hope that the students can give us some usable feedback on Friday that can help us make our decision [in regards to rapid HIV testing].”

Showcasing student-administration collaboration, Office is many years in the making
The McGill Office of Sustainability opened yesterday to a full house of administrators, faculty, and students eager to see the long-awaited space in action.
Introductory speeches by Principal Heather Munroe-Blum and Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell emphasized the importance of environmental, economic, and social sustainability at McGill, as well as the Office’s potential to help students and staff build on previous environmental initiatives and undergraduate research.
“This will remain an individual and collaborative effort on all our parts,” said Nicell, an environmental engineer by training.
SSMU VP University Affairs Nadya Wilkinson acknowledged the amount of progress needed to green McGill, but expressed optimism for the Office to facilitate this progress, likening it to a potluck rather than a sit-down dinner.
“No, we don’t have all the staff some think we need to get things done…. We don’t have a library, or a newsletter. But these aren’t just theoretical questions anymore, they’re questions for today,” said Wilkinson, who has been involved with the Sustainable McGill Project – the student group which originally proposed the office’s concept – since 2005.
Sustainability Director Dennis Fortune explained many features around the Office, located in Ferrier 216, that incorporate some of the tenants of structural sustainability – such as waste diversion, energy reduction, and recycling – that could be implemented around campus.
The furniture was recovered from elsewhere on campus, six of the original 19 light fixtures were removed, and the plywood around windows facing the hall meet Forest Stewardship Council standards. As well, materials such as the tiled floor made from recycled drywall, and the carpet made of 72 per cent recycled material – one-third post-consumer carpet – were donated from various businesses. The Office also has two composters, in which students can place leftovers such as the baked goods and apples served at the event by Organic Campus.
Nicell explained afterwards that none of the Office’s $200,000 budget to support investments and ideas came from the University operating budget; instead, the money was raised through two 15 per cent increases in on-campus parking fees over the past two years. Drivers were both informed and supportive of the reason for the increase.
Nicell also praised the economic viability of sustainability initiatives, such as a $12,000 pilot project with light dimmers in the James Administration Building that will pay for itself in a year and a half.
“It’s not a choice of hard times versus sustainability,” Nicell said, later adding, “We have a moral responsibility not to [delay sustainable initiatives to future generations].”
Powerhouse Supervisor Alain Fournier gave students who attended the opening several tours of McGill’s powerhouse, which supplies the majority of the University’s buildings with heating and electricity, totalling 25 megawatts.
He also showcased a web site that displays and stores real-time data on different types of energy consumption, and easily creates daily, weekly, and monthly consumption profiles.
“I think it’s important for students to have access [to the site], but it’s not my decision,” Fournier said. He said the University has expressed concerns over some sensitive information being available online.
When asked about the future of the Office, many students and administrators focused on the Office’s role as a hub for students interested in environmental projects, to connect them with relevant staff and administrators.
Master’s Geography student Alexandre Poisson – who worked on last year’s Sustainability Report Card and sat on the Office of Sustainability Steering Committee with Wilkinson, Nicell, Fortune, and U2 Environment student Jonathan Glencross – stressed the Office’s place in making undergraduate coursework relevant and useful, and offering adequate guidance to volunteer efforts.
“In the end, students need to assert leadership,” Poisson said. “There’s so much opportunity to use classes to do projects and solve problems.”
During her opening speech, Munroe-Blum recalled the welcoming she received from the SSMU Environment Committee on her first day in office six years ago.
“From the minute I arrived, students were leaders in sustainability,” Munroe-Blum said.
In opening a sustainability centre, McGill follows a long list of other Canadian universities, such as University of British Colombia, the University of Toronto, and Queen’s University.
“It’s a huge step toward our goal as a community to support tangible change,” Wilkinson added.

Once-a-semester forum fills to capacity
McGill staff, who outnumbered students at Tuesday’s Town Hall were eager to ask Principal Heather Munroe-Blum about unions, severance packages, and student feedback. The event attracted over 100 people, filling the MBA lounge to capacity.
McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), President Maria Ruocco’s first question was about university salaries, and why, if they come from public funds, there has been an apparent lack of transparency about accounting details.
Ruocco’s question was particularly relevant, given the recent revelation of the hefty severance package received by one of McGill’s vice principals following an early departure – which caught the attention of mainstream media, who also attended the Town Hall.
“We are completely transparent in our relations with the government of Quebec,” said Munroe-Blum. “We did not hesitate to respond to the requests from the press.”
Ruocco was not the only person concerned with the apparent inequality in staff salary. A member of the Faculty of Medicine’s support staff brought up the issue of discrepancies in pay raises.
He made note of the recent creation of eight administrative positions that pay over $100,000, while there has been no change in the pay of the support staff.
Munroe-Blum reiterated that she did “not apologize” for the financial tactics McGill uses to attract high-level talent, and that she is “proud of our administrative and support staff.”
She also added that “this is not a negotiating table,” and that McGill benchmarks differently for different groups on a local level, without national consideration.
Another prominent concern was the issue of course and seminar evaluations by students each semester at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
After a PhD student in Islamic Studies expressed his distress over conflicts of interest with graduate supervisors and a lack of positive feedback, Adrian Kaats, a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and VP External of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society, approached the microphone with his own suggestions.
For a graduate student, he explained, a positive relationship with a supervisor is key to completing one’s studies on time, and avoiding high dropout and distress rates.
He also pointed to the lack of a feedback mechanism for graduate students, following a removal of formal professor evaluations after the dissolution of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
This is a symptom, according to Kaats, of a “general decentralization at McGill.”
“Every department and unit has its own way of doing things,” Kaats said. “The difficulty is figuring out how to implement it, given the nature of politics and policies at McGill.”
Kaats suggested that students be allowed to sit on the tenure review board, especially for younger faculty members who have different attitudes toward their own research and the importance of facilitating a graduate student’s research.
Lawrence Mysak, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, echoed Kaats in his call for professor evaluations that are anonymously handed to the professor immediately, at all levels of study, with results being publicly available.
And while the handful of students who showed up appreciated the concept of Town Halls at which they can interact with the administration, more needs to be done to make students feel a part of the university community, according to Andreas Birkbak, an Arts Exchange student.
“It’s easy to use the community rhetoric. [But] the administration needs to prove that they are receptive.”

A booming voice at the Roddick Gates Tuesday announced that 80,000 lobsters had been ordered to celebrate President Robert Mugabe’s 85th birthday, while his people die of cholera.
The voice came from one of 50 students organized by Students Taking a Stand for Medicine and Peace, (STAMP) a grassroots organization of McGill medical students that arose spontaneously in the last two weeks.
STAMP member and McGill medical student Myrill Solaski explained that the organization staged the protest in direct response to the recent cholera epidemic
“Our focus is on medicine. It’s an awareness campaign to fight cholera, which is spreading through Zimbabwe and even across neighbouring borders.”
Over 3,000 Zimbabweans have died from cholera in an outbreak that began six months ago, and infection rates are now approaching 70,000. Treatment costs roughly ten cents per person per day, and consists of oral rehydration therapy – a simple water and salt (or sugar) combination.
In addition to raising awareness about the crisis and funds for Medecins Sans Frontieres’s immediate medical relief response, STAMP is also petitioning Stephen Harper to join the humanitarian response to the crisis.
STAMP’s petition describes the cholera crisis as a Man-Made disaster, fallout from the Zimbabwean government’s failure to serve its most basic state functions for its citizens, according to a report released by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR). In their petition, STAMP claims “endless political neglect” is fuelling the crisis.
The list of collapsed systems in Zimbabwe is long: basic sanitation, clean water, and health services; the monetary and economic systems; the system of food supply; a free media; and not least of all, an accountable system of democratic governance.
Foreigners and Zimbabweans alike hope that a new government coalition will provoke response to the health crisis. Yesterday, Morgan Tsvangirai allied his political opponent, long-time President Mugabe, becoming Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, in a controversial and highly anticipated power-sharing arrangement. They have yet to settle the hotly contested ministerial divisions within the arrangement.
Zuwa Matondo, a Zimbabwean and U3 McGill Political Science and International Development Studies student present at the rally, warned against simplifying the problem in his country by blaming only Mugabe.
“The causal links are wrong or are incomplete. It is so frustrating as a young African to see what people here are told about Africa. It’s not as simple as pointing a finger at Mugabe.”
Matondo exclaimed, “What does little Mugabe have to do with thirteen million people [who live in Zimbabwe]?” He insisted that Zimbabwe’s economic and health problems can not be unequivocally linked to just one man.
President Mugabe has been in power since the nation declared independence from Britain in 1980. He has repeatedly been accused of corruption, thuggery, and violence.
Mugabe has vowed not to leave power until the land was reclaimed from the white, European settlers and returned to the black majority. Drastic land reforms pursued, which forced white farmers off the land they cultivated.
“There is no denying mismanagement,” Matondo explained, “But you cannot draw a simple causal line.” The spurious logic Matondo warned against says that if Mugabe vanished so too would the epidemic. Instead, Matondo pointed to geography climate, colonialism, and dictatorship, as factors in addition to the rule of Mugabe that have combined to create the cholera epidemic and poverty in Zimbabwe.
STAMP co-founder Hannah Thomas admitted, “We are ignorant of the larger political issues. There are a lot of factors responsible for the suffering of Zimbabweans.”

Working out of a new residential address, the group is no longer considered non-profit
Filipino community organization Kapit Bisig Centre never expected that moving from a commercial building to a residential space last summer would trigger a string of administrative headaches, forcing them to suspend their activity altogether.
The volunteer-based umbrella group – which includes the Philippine Women Centre, the Philippines-Canada Task Force on Human Rights, Kabataang Montreal (Filipino Youth of Montreal), and SIKLAB (Advance and Uphold the Rights and Welfare of Filipino Migrant Workers) – lost their non-profit status with their switch to a residential address, as stipulated under Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (CDN) by-laws, causing them  to incur new booking fees at a community centre where they have hosted events in the past, free of charge.
At last Monday’s CDN borough meeting, Kapit Bisig asked the borough to help them find a new space and resolve their booking fee conflicts. According to Catherine Mourin, a member of the CDN’s Communications department, the borough will not be flexible due to Kapit Bisig’s residential status.
“The permit was denied…by a by-law, because it was located in a residential area. There is nothing that can be done about that,” Mourin said, adding that the borough may not be able to assist  Kapit Bisig locate a new space, despite the group’s request.
Kapit Bisig chair person, Joanne Vasquez, was disappointed with the borough’s response, and pointed to the South Asian Women’s Centre (SAWC), which has been provided space by the City since it was founded in 1981, as a model for Kapit Bisig.
Yet Dolores Chu, a founding member and current treasurer of SAWC, doubted a new group would receive the same level of support.
“In our case, a long time ago, we got space,” Chu said. “Since that time, there have been many more grassroots [organizations] coming up. There’s a greater demand for space,”
Mourin confirmed that CDNs resources are spread thin.
“There’s more than 150 partner organizations we are working with, and four of them are Filipino, [including] the Filipino Association of Montreal, the Federation of Canadian Filipinos of Quebec. It’s just difficult to find them space,” Mourin said.
In the meantime,  Kapit Bisig is hoping that their $300 booking fees at the community centre 6767 will be waived – since their activities are non-profit in nature.
According to Vasquez and Joy Alcaron, a founding member and current treasurer, before they moved to a residential space, they had never been charged for use of 6767.  Returning to 6767 for another event, after they had staged a production of Panoyville free of charge, they were informed that the rules had changed.
“[Suddenly], 6767 [was] saying we’re booking too many rooms, and they’re going to charge. We said we’re part of a community organization that always gets space for free, so why all the sudden do they want us to pay?”  said  Alarcon. “They said the problem was our address: we were [now] located in a residential area. They were telling me also they will charge us for the past activity.”
Mourin again cited the group’s official status as a reality of the situation.
“Because there’s lots of folks using the community centre, they have a certain fee to pay, there’s no exception,” said Mourin. “The centre has a rate list, and depending on what kind of activity, what kind of group, they all have a certain fee to pay.”
Shutting down operations at Kapit Bisig Centre will have an impact on CDN, as they provide immigration counselling, fair employment information, and youth and women’s programs to the community, which is home to the largest Filipino population in Quebec – with approximately 60 per cent of the province’s population – and is the entry point for most immigrants into the province, according to Vasquez.
“This is the only Little Manila we have in all of Canada. These Filipinos are a large constituency. The City has an obligation to them,” she said.
Kapit Bisig will have another chance to meet with borough councillors on February 24, when CDN’s intercultural commission meets. It is likely, though, that the $300 fee charged by the community centre for use of its space will not be waived by the borough.
For now, Kapit Bisig remains in limbo, though they may continue to organize an inter-college conference this spring that would bring together Filipino university students from all over the island.
