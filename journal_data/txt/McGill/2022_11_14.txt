Montreal’s hospitals face extensive wait times in the face of seasonal virus spikes and staff shortages
content warning: medical racism
As of November 10, 17 out of 21 Montreal emergency rooms were over capacity, according to Index Santé, Quebec’s Health Index directory. Montreal’s children’s hospitals have been particularly hard-hit, with an influx of children with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (R.S.V.) and other viruses contributing to overflowing emergency rooms. R.S.V., a virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages, does not usually reach high infection levels until later in the fall and winter. Laurie Plotnick, Medical Director at the Montreal Children’s Hospital (MCH), told the Daily these unusually early spikes in R.S.V. patients are likely related to the fact that people haven’t been exposed to many viruses since the start of the pandemic. “Both kids and adults have less immunity [since 2020] — pregnant women were not exposed to viruses, so they weren’t passing on antibodies to their newborns, and children, infants, and toddlers haven’t been exposed as frequently to viral illnesses,” said Dr. Plotnick. As a result, “they’ve lost some of that immune capacity to fight viruses in a more effective way.” 
Since the last week of October, the occupancy rates at Montreal Children’s Hospital have remained over 150 per cent capacity, leading to extensive wait times and forcing some parents to leave the hospital without their children receiving care. With talk of a winter “tripledemic” combining the Flu, R.S.V., and COVID-19, these numbers are likely to increase before they get better. In response, hospitals are turning to the COVID-era pandemic strategies that have been in use for the past two and a half years. “We run— and rerun— the same pandemic strategies, we go back to the same principles,” Dr. Plotnick told the Daily. “The difference now compared to the beginning of the pandemic is that we now have healthcare staff who are fatigued, tired, chronically stressed, on sick leave, or have left the profession.” 
Hospitals across Canada have faced staffing shortages and overcrowded emergency rooms since the start of the pandemic, forcing many hospitals to announce temporary reductions in services, including in their emergency rooms. The overcapacity rates experienced with R.S.V. in pediatric emergency rooms this season are equivalent to overcapacity experiences in adult hospitals during the COVID pandemic, according to Dr. Plotnick. “The issue now is that we don’t have the same staff pool that we had back then to be able to rally together [in the same way] because we’ve been doing it for two and a half years already.” 
In particular, increased demand for family doctors has left emergency rooms with high numbers of patients that could have been treated elsewhere. Dr. Plotnick told the Daily that ideally, the MCH would transfer stable patients back to a community hospital that is able to continue hospitalization until the patient is ready to be discharged — but shortages of community clinics and family doctors has made this difficult. “What we’re seeing in the hospital is being seen in the community too,” said Dr. Plotnick. “The family doctors, they’re working hard. The community practitioners are overwhelmed by sick children, lots of viral illnesses, and lots of children with fevers. I just don’t think we have enough community healthcare practitioners right now to best serve our population.” 
A McGill student recounted his experience with the Montreal hospitals to the Daily after he fractured his ankle in late September, demonstrating how difficult it can be to access even a short consultation. After being denied by a clinic because their x-ray room was closed, he went to Lachine Hospital, where he was forced to walk through multiple corridors on his injured ankle for purposes of paperwork. “It took me at least an hour and a half to be seen by a nurse just for her to fill in very basic info about where I was hurt and how bad it was from 1-10, and then I was told that it would be at least a 9-hour wait. I wasn’t given ice, medication, or anything”, he told the Daily. “Rather than waiting, I booked an appointment with an orthopedic specialist for the next day because I just needed an ankle expert to tell me how severe my injury was. That specialist canceled on me.” 
In the end, the student was able to get a cast book for a next-day surgery at Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montreal (CHUM) hospital, but only after a 6-hour wait. Despite the lengthy wait time, he told the Daily that his experience at CHUM was much easier than other hospitals since all the initial stages of seeing the nurse and doing paperwork were accessible with his injury. His experience may have been a lucky one: on November 10, 28 patients had been on stretchers for 24 hours or more at CHUM and nine patients had been on stretchers for 48 hours or more. 
The Legault government has recently expressed the urgency of reducing experiences like his. At an October 25 news conference, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé termed the situation “unacceptable” and announced the creation of a crisis team to address long wait times in Quebec’s emergency rooms. The team’s plan includes a goal to open a pair of clinics in Montreal run by nurse practitioners to accommodate patients without access to family doctors. It also aims to extend access to the “one call, one service” phone line to pediatric patients in order to provide consultations without having to go to the emergency room. Dubé added that the Health Ministry will continue to work with partners to provide more appointments through family medicine and pediatric clinics, as a lack of access to these doctors leads patients to emergency departments for treatment that could have been provided elsewhere. According to Dr. Plotnick, there needs to be more access to community clinics and healthcare professionals who specialize in pediatrics to prevent overcrowding in pediatric hospitals. “The [government’s] crisis task force is a good start, but funding is huge. Nurses need to be adequately compensated and incentivized for what they’re doing,” she told the Daily. “It’s about improving access, and increasing the number of healthcare professionals, whether it be nurse practitioners or physicians in the community.” Referencing the reinstitution of the “one-call, one-service” hotline, Dr. Plotnick said that “we don’t yet have the number of clinics available as they were when the initiative was running a year and a half ago.” 
Currently, there is a limit on the number of physicians that the MHC is permitted to hire, and like at other academic hospitals, MCH’s physicians are required to take on an educational role as well as providing patient care — “an impossibility in this kind of crisis,” said Dr. Potnick. “More students need to be trained in medical schools — [we need to] enable more medical students in universities, more residency positions, and more positions for residents to work in after training. It’s a real pipeline that’s been limited over the years and has been decreasing.” 
McGill’s Student Wellness Hub, where McGill students have access to a variety of healthcare services as a part of their tuition, has not been immune to overcapacity issues faced by the rest of Montreal. According to Giovanni Arcuri, Associate Director of Operations at the Student Wellness Hub, “during the pandemic, 50 per cent of our doctors were redeployed to the public system. Some have returned; however, some are currently on extended leaves.” In order to meet the rising number of students requesting care, and due to the limited scope of its nurses, the Hub is actively recruiting family doctors — however, this is a challenging task due to provincial regulations determining how these doctors spend their time. “Hours worked in university clinics are not recognized by the government, so our doctors are putting in time beyond their government-mandated requirements,” Arcuri told the Daily.  
Healthcare professionals working at the Wellness Hub echo the difficulties faced in the profession as a whole as they face overcapacity. Dr. Hashana Perera, Medical Director of the Student Wellness Hub, expressed the burden on the providers that have stayed at their jobs; “with fewer providers, the burden is higher on the providers that remain,” she told the Daily. “This is compounded by the challenges accessing testing and specialist consultations within the public healthcare system due to staff shortages, where more senior doctors are retiring earlier and more staff are on medical leave.” 
Overcapacity and staffing shortages at the Student Wellness Hub have left many students to turn to more expensive alternatives for urgent care. One student spoke with the Daily about her experience in 2021 with the Wellness Hub: “as an international student who is required to pay for International health insurance as a student at McGill, both my parents and I have been extremely disappointed in the quality of healthcare offered here.”
Another student spoke of her experience trying to get a test for Celiac disease: “I was sent in circles trying to get an appointment and once I finally got a hold of someone, I was told to call at 8 a.m. on a Monday. I wasn’t able to make an appointment online, so I used Maple Telehealth services and was referred to a clinic not associated with McGill. I ended up having to pay $200 for testing and didn’t receive my full result for 4-5 weeks.”
The Wellness Hub’s website states that it does not take students who are symptomatic with flu or cold symptoms “to ensure staff and student safety, and in accordance with McGill policy and the new circumstances,” leaving students to turn to other means of overcrowded healthcare services for the treatment of these widespread illnesses. According to Dr. Vera Romano, Director of the Student Wellness Hub, the Hub is now “examining and reviewing” the directives restricting the provision of care to students with COVID-19-like symptoms as the pandemic evolves. 
Reduced access to healthcare and issues tied to the pandemic have exacerbated preexisting inequities in the healthcare system. Among the most impacted are Canada’s Indigenous populations. Findings from Statistics Canada data show that during the first year of the pandemic, “disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people were evident” in studies of the impact of pandemic-related difficulties and delays in receiving health care services. First Nations people and Metis were more likely than non-Indigenous people to say that these delays caused them pain. 
In September, a report was leaked regarding the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) detailing testimonials of racism experienced by patients and staff at the Centre, including many recounts of mistreatment towards Indigenous patients. The report came after the death of Joyce Echaquan, a 37-year-old Atikamekw woman, who recorded a live Facebook video exposing her abuse by nurses leading to her death in September 2020. The MUHC is Montreal’s largest hospital network and has made the treatment of Indigenous peoples a part of its mandate. The MUHC report, a two-year-long effort, was published following repeated claims by Premier Legault that systemic racism does not exist in the province of Quebec. 
On October 25, SSMU’s External Affairs team hosted an Accessibility Town Hall, where students were invited to express difficulties accessing healthcare, academic accommodations, and culturally-specific support at McGill. In the event’s description, SSMU wrote that “[t]he McGill Student Wellness Hub [has continued] to fail in delivering its promised basic health services.” It also noted that “Student Services has cut the BIPOC Local Wellness Advisor,” a position that previously worked to provide specific support to students who identified as Indigenous, Black, and People of Colour within a therapeutic context. 
Dr. Perera expressed the Hub’s gratitude towards students “for their collaboration and feedback,” emphasizing that the Student Wellness Hub is “actively working to improve the things we can control and are communicating more effectively about the parts that are outside of our control.” 
As overcrowding issues continue to worsen, healthcare professionals emphasize the urgency of the situation: “[t]his is not sustainable. We’re concerned because we already feel like we’re at a breaking point in many respects,” said Dr. Plotnick. Many of the issues behind the abundance of overcrowded hospitals, like staff shortages and a lack of resources, “[a]re just widening the cracks that were already there pre-covid.” Fixing these cracks, says Dr. Plotnick, will require systemic changes to address staff shortages and a lack of access to healthcare. In the meantime, she calls for a return to some of the easier community solutions learned during the pandemic: “wash hands, wear a mask, stay home if you’re sick.”

Protestors gather to oppose RBC’s funding of Coastal Gaslink pipeline
On Saturday, November 5, protestors gathered in front of the Royal Bank of Canada’s (RBC) “On Campus” branch at McGill to object to the bank’s investment in the Coastal Gaslink (CGL) pipeline. The group Decolonial Solidarity organized the protest in response to a call to action from the Gidimt’en Checkpoint in Wet’suwet’en territory, which stated that drilling for the pipeline was ready to begin under the Wedzin Kwa (Morice) river. 
“Working together is the only way we stand a chance to force this incredibly powerful and influential bank to abandon short term profits and divest from the CGL pipeline,” said one organizer speaking to the crowd. “RBC is in violation of Indigenous rights. Wherever RBC bank is, it will hear from the allies of those who its investments hurt.”
According to this organizer, the CGL pipeline will impact Wet’suwet’en people’s access to fresh water and food sources. The finished pipeline will cross over 600 waterways in BC, and has already been flagged for multiple environmental violations, including possible disruptions to fish habitats and potentially damaging water quality non-compliances. The pipeline will also contribute to the global climate crisis: the speaker stated that the pipeline is projected to move up to five billion cubic feet of natural gas a day – the equivalent of 585 million pounds of CO2. 
“Where you put your money actually has an impact,” said Seph, a masters student in biology at McGill who works with Divest McGill. He wants McGill students to be aware that the CGL pipeline funded by RBC runs through unceded Wet’suwet’en territory; “they never gave consent for that so this is an issue both of Indigenous sovereignty but also climate destruction.”
The organizer with Decolonial Solidarity cited the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Article 10, which states that “Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the Indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return.” The BC government passed UNDRIP into law in 2019.
“RBC has violated this fundamental right,” said the organizer. RBC, the pipeline’s biggest funder, is also Canada’s largest fossil fuel funding bank, and the fifth largest fossil fuel funding bank in the world. 
“There are RBC branches all over Canada and every time there’s a demo like this it makes their brand look worse and worse and they need to respond to their investors who care very much what they do with their money,” Sepi, a protestor standing with the crowd in front of the On Campus branch, told the Daily. “Even if RBC doesn’t care, investors care.” 
There are RBC On Campus branches at both McGill and Concordia, and according to one organizer, the McGill student union and many faculty groups bank with them. RBC is also currently collaborating with McGill to offer a  personal finance class in Desautels, and has sponsored frosh for the Faculty of Arts and Science.
Una Sverko, a first year law student at McGill organizing with Decolonial Solidarity, wants to ask the McGill administration to divest from fossil fuels: “Divest has been saying that for over 10 years now, so it’s about time you listen[…]listen to your student body,” she said. She also asks that faculty groups currently banking with RBC look for an alternative bank or credit union. 
Of the On Campus branch and the collaborative course, Sverko said: “it’s allowing RBC to actively try to filter McGill students into their talent pipeline and actively allowing RBC to kind-of poach us as their customers.” 
After a few short speeches, organizers from Decolonial Solidarity led the group in chanting: “Our climate, we’ll fight for that, RBC no time for that” and “Pipeline spills, RBC kills.” The protestors then marched to the RBC On Campus branch at Concordia, continuing to chant. When the group arrived, organizers spoke again, offering actionable steps for those looking to continue to protest RBC’s involvement in the pipeline project. 
“There is so much you can do, just yourself and one other friend, that is safe and that is beautiful, and that keeps bringing the message out” said Una. She suggested participants could sit in front of RBC branches, hand out flyers, set up information booths, or create sidewalk murals with chalk or washable paint. “We will share your stuff, it will spread, people do see the images of all of these actions, and it brings a lot of hope, so please do if you can.” 
According to Una, there were similar protests on November 5 in at least 16 cities across six provinces, including Montreal, Victoriaville, and Valleyfield in Quebec. Despite this, Coastal Gaslink seems to be proceeding with construction. On Tuesday, November 8, security guards blocked Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chief Na’moks from entering the Wedzin Kwa site to monitor the drilling. As of November 11, Decolonial Solidarity has not publicized any new information about upcoming actions in Montreal.

An unconventional book talk about an unconventional book
On November 3, the Feminist and Accessible Publishing, Communications, and Technology series hosted Dr. Shannon Mattern, who discussed writing her most recent book, A City is Not a Computer: Other Urban Intelligences, over Zoom. Dr. Mattern is currently on sabbatical in her new home in Philadelphia, but she will soon begin work as a professor of Media Studies and Art History at the University of Pennsylvania. She was a professor of Anthropology at The New School in New York for 15 years and is currently the president of the board of the Metropolitan New York Library Council. Rather than approach the conference as a typical “book talk,” in which she might read excerpts from her chapters, Dr. Mattern chose to follow a “book biography” method and discuss what influenced her writing process. A City is Not a Computer explores how the modern metaphor of a city as a computer “reduces place-based knowledge to information processing” (Princeton University Press), and Mattern proposes other, more inclusive ideologies about city functions which are tailored specifically to individual cities. 
Before getting into the details of her book’s production, Dr. Mattern explained why presenting her book in the “book biography” style made sense to her. She claimed that this insight into the making of a book extends its limits to become an “argument, story, object, [or] commodity.” Additionally, she wanted to approach the talk in a way that credits the outside forces that impacted the writing of A City is Not A Computer. She mentioned her classes, students, and work with the New York libraries, all of which she said “informed the book we are here to talk about.”
One of the reasons Dr. Mattern wrote her book was that she was “tired of big men with ideas publishing on tech-related and urban-oriented subjects without being burdened with the anxiety of influence.” She claimed that there are many men who have written books about the tech industry without actually considering the “thinkers” who came before them. Dr. Mattern spoke on her own desires to break this supposed norm as a woman writing about tech. She was driven by frustration toward these “big men”; she noticed a repeated fault in tech-related books when the authors were “not thinking about citation as an ethical relation,” so she wanted to write her own tech book that would pay attention to the theorists who came before her. Additionally, Mattern was upfront about times when she herself had neglected to include thorough citations. For example, when re-reading her 2018 piece “Maintenence and Care” to find out if she could include it in her book, she noticed that she had neglected some “issues from critical disability studies and the Black feminist area,” so she edited the piece in order to include these ideas. 
In concurrence with her own feminist ideologies and those of the Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies faculty at McGill, which organized this event, Dr. Mattern was transparent in revealing her own tendency to people-please as another reason she wrote the book: “I will say this is something even 20 years into [it] and say yes to it because I feel obligated,” meaning that she often says “yes” to requests only because she feels worried about letting people down. She also wrote the book because she was invited to and because she was excited to be able to work with the publication group at Princeton University, as this provided her with access to what she believes to be a well-resourced group of editors. 
Another informing factor of Dr. Mattern’s book was her ironic dislike for book-writing. Departing from the norm, A City is Not a Computer is a collection of essays written by Mattern since 2014 and published primarily by the Places Journal (Places). Dr. Mattern described Places as “embodying certain feminist principles” and “a place that focuses on open free access.” The journal’s focus on the concept of “open access” is something that has been incredibly valuable to her. When collecting the work for her book from her previously written articles, she often grappled with the question of eliminating open access in the new book form. Since much of the work for her book had been published online and was readily available to any person with internet access, it seemed odd to privatize it by organizing it into a book. Thus, she was faced with the question, why write a book at all?
Dr. Mattern claimed that another one of her main motivations for writing her book was that the prestige associated with books greatly surpasses that of online articles. Mattern noted that her essays are called “think pieces” or “blog posts, because they are freely available online.” She went on to expose how rigorously fact-checked and edited her articles have been for Places, even sharing  screenshots of some of the edits she has received on her articles. Mattern provided these examples to demonstrate that her freely available journal articles are edited with diligence, and she claimed that her journal articles should not be considered less academic or prestigious than her books just because they are available to the public.
Dr. Mattern approached her discussion of A City is Not a Computer in a semi-unconventional style, and she was able to provide an extensive amount of context about how events in her life and her own ideologies shaped her book. To conclude her presentation, she spoke about the final chapter in the book, which explores how trees are often used as models for “organizing knowledge.” She stated that “thinking  through trees allows me to combine several of the humanistic, material environment, urbanistic, ecological, and computational models that I’m encouraging us to bring together in the book.” Just as her book does through its unconventional writing method, Mattern’s “book biography” talk brought together different pieces to tell one story.
All quotations were taken from the recorded Zoom call with Dr. Mattern.

Turpel-Lafond’s Indigenous identity under question
Mary Ellen Elizabeth Turpel-Lafond, a Canadian lawyer, former judge, and law professor at UBC, received an honorary degree from McGill in 2014. However, she has recently come under fire after a CBC investigation published in early October revealed that information found in publicly available documents was inconsistent with Turpel-Lafond’s claims to Cree ancestry and her treaty Indian status, as well as the community where she grew up and her academic accomplishments. McGill has assembled an ad hoc sub-committee to review the honorary degree awarded to Turpel-Lafond, according to Interim Principal Christopher Manfredi in an email addressed to the McGill community on November 8.
Turpel-Lafond’s career took off in the 1990s when she served as a constitutional adviser to the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations Ovide Mercredi. Since then, Turpel-Lafond has served in various prominent roles that aim for restorative justice. She was appointed British Columbia’s first Representative for Children and Youth in November 2006, and she also served as the founding director of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre (IRSHDC) at UBC. Turpel-Lafond retired from the position this past June but maintains her position as a law professor at UBC’s Peter A. Allard School of Law.
A prominent Indigenous scholar in Canada, Turpel-Lafond is highly decorated and has been awarded 11 honorary degrees from Canadian universities, including McGill. In 1994, she was named one of the “The Global 100” leaders of the new millennium by Time magazine, and in 1999, she was selected as one of the top “Canadian leaders for the 21st century.” The Indigenous Bar Association awarded her the distinction of “Indigenous Peoples’ Counsel” in 2007. She was also a recipient of the Order of Canada in 2021, one of the highest civilian awards in the country.
CBC reports that that “there is a growing problem in this country of non-Indigenous people taking away opportunities from First Nations, Métis and Inuit people by improperly claiming Indigenous ancestry.” Turpel-Lafond’s background and claims that she is a member of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation has been disputed since the mid-1990s. In 1995, a reporter for the Ottawa Citizen explained that in the interviewing process for a profile on Turpel-Lafond, “more than one person suggested checking into her Indian background.”
According to Turpel-Lafond, her father is Cree while her mother was English-Scottish. However, the CBC report found that genealogical records show that her paternal grandfather was of Irish, German, and American ancestry and that his wife was born in England to British parents. After a request from CBC, Turpel-Lafond declined to comment on her father’s biological parents’ identities, instead saying, “I respect my parents and all members of my family and I will never call anyone out. Growing up we did not question biological parentage.”
The same day as the findings of the CBC investigation about Turpel-Lafond’s Indigenous identity were published, UBC issued a statement to The Globe and Mail praising her accomplishments as the IRSHDC director and her connections to the Indigenous community. UBC Director of University Affairs Matthew Ramsey said: “[Prof. Turpel-Lafond’s] identity is her own and the university is not going to comment on it.” Others have also condemned the investigation into Turpel-Lafond’s claimed Indigenous identity; the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) said that Turpel-Lafond has been a groundbreaking advocate for Indigenous peoples for decades, adding that issues of First Nations identity should be personal for Indigenous peoples and not for media “digging into private matters.” Furthermore, UBCIC rejected using solely genealogy as the best indicator of Indigenous identity, deeming it a legacy of “assimilationist colonialism.”
The Muskeg Lake Cree Nation confirms that Turpel-Lafond is a member of their Nation and has been for the past 30 years, stating in a press release that “[k]inship determines who is a member of the Nation, and she is part of one of our kinship families.”
In recent years, Canadian universities have begun to address concerns surrounding the claims of Indigenous identities of faculty. Last year, an anonymous report published at Queen’s University claimed that six faculty members were falsely claiming Indigenous status. The university defended its faculty, saying it “respects and trusts the Indigenous protocols used to identify those it considers Indigenous.” This case came after the University of Saskatchewan was made aware of the alleged mendacity of professor Carrie Bourassa’s claim to Indigenous identity. Bourassa resigned from her position after the university promised to investigate her Indigenous heritage and implement a review of its policies surrounding claims to Indigenous identities.
Though policies to review claims to Indigenous identities are being updated, many Canadian universities prioritize the hiring of Indigenous faculty. In 2019, then-provost Manfredi said: “One of the keys to fulfilling this commitment is to actively increase the number of Indigenous scholars in our professoriate.” UBC says that “Indigenous identity was not a criterion” for Turpel-Lafond’s position at the school.
The Indigenous Women’s Collective is calling on universities to rescind honorary doctorate degrees awarded to Turpel-Lafond, saying that “[r]econciliation starts with truth.” York University, Brock University, Royal Roads University, and the University of Regina are among the universities that have begun to review the honorary degrees they awarded to Turpel-Lafond. 
McGill’s ad hoc sub-committee to review Turpel-Lafond’s honorary degree is composed of Manfredi and three to five Honorary Degrees and Convocations Committee members. Regarding the assembly of the committee, McGill claims that it “places the highest premium on respect and honesty.”
McGill did not elaborate further on the review process, per the Daily’s request.

The McGill Daily editorial board has compiled their endorsements for the Fall 2022 referendum
The McGill Daily editorial board has compiled their endorsements for the following referendum questions. 
The questions and motions in this referendum are: 
Sustainability Projects Fund Fee Renewal
The McGill Daily editorial board endorses a “yes” vote for the fee renewal of the SPF. 
The SPF, funded by SSMU, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), and the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS), provides seed-funding for the development of interdisciplinary projects that aim to improve environmental sustainability at McGill. The fund has existed since 2009, and it has facilitated the development of many notable sustainability initiatives on campus. These include, but are not limited to, the Plate Club, the McGill Farmer’s Market, and Outdoor Frosh. The fund is currently valued at more than $1 million annually, and it has funded more than 300 projects since its inception. Given the project’s presence on campus for more than a decade and the opportunities it grants to McGill students, faculty, and staff, vote “yes” to the continued existence of the SPF. 
Daily Publications Society Fee Renewal
The McGill Daily editorial board endorses a “yes” vote for the fee renewal of the DPS. 
The DPS publishes The McGill Daily and Le Délit, two independent, student-run, non-profit newspapers covering happenings at McGill and across Montreal. Both newspapers are critical sites for journalism on campus, and both provide platforms for all members of the McGill community to voice their opinions and concerns. Given the absence of a journalism program at McGill, these newspapers also serve as a site of learning, collaboration, and experience. The Daily is among Canada’s oldest student newspapers, publishing regularly since 1911. Additionally, Le Délit is the only francophone student newspaper on McGill’s campus. A “no” vote, which would result in the termination of these publications, would deprive the McGill community of important sources of information, discourse, investigation, and creativity. You can read more about why you should vote “yes” for the free press in this week’s editorial. 
The polling period for the Fall 2022 referendum will be held from November 14 at 9:00 AM to November 18 at 5:00 PM. To view the referendum questions and cast your ballot, visit ssmu.simplyvoting.com. Questions regarding the referendum can be directed to SSMU’s Chief Electoral Officer at elections@ssmu.ca.
