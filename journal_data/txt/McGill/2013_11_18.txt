No arrests made despite heavy police presence
Around 150 people gathered on Friday outside the Mont Royal metro station to protest austerity policies in Quebec. The Montreal regional council for the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) arranged the march to coincide with a string of other anti-austerity events across the province this week.
“I don’t like this new precedent of having lots of police – nearly as many as the protesters seems to have become the norm. I’m counting the days until the armoured personnel vehicle starts showing up at the protests.”
The event was marked by heavy police presence; numerous officers on foot and bicycle closely escorted the protest for the duration of the march. Protesters expressed their dissatisfaction by chanting anti-police slogans as they walked down St. Denis.
As the demonstration reached the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal, a group of the protesters entered the building, acting in solidarity with students who were recently found guilty of illegal assembly and mischief during the occupation of the Cégep in the spring of 2012.
The demonstration was declared illegal by the police shortly thereafter and protesters were forced onto the sidewalk for the rest of the march. They peacefully dispersed late in the afternoon and no arrests were made.
The heavy police presence was alarming to some protesters. “I don’t like this new precedent of having lots of police – nearly as many as the protesters seems to have become the norm,” said Trevor Smith, student and member of the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association. “I’m counting the days until the armoured personnel vehicle starts showing up at the protests.”
Many protesters emphasized the importance of continuing to demonstrate in spite of the risk of high fines and the possibility of arrest. “It’s discouraging, but we will not yield to the threat of capital,” Amélie, a student at Cégep de Saint-Laurent, told The Daily in French.
“It’s important that we take this to the streets, that we reiterate our claim to the right to protest, our right to denounce these measures, our right to be politically active,” insisted Benjamin Gingras, co-spokesperson for the ASSÉ.
“[Those hit the hardest are] the most disadvantaged of us, people who are already on welfare, who are already having trouble heating their apartments and paying rent, women especially of course – women are always the first to suffer any kind of anti-social policy. Austerity measures are so broad, and they’re attacking so many people.”
Since coming to office in September 2012, the Parti Québécois (PQ) has embarked on an austerity program in order to decrease the province’s deficit. A rise in education tuition fees, broad welfare cuts, and increases in hydro-electricity rates form part of the government’s program.
“The PQ has had this idea of ‘deficit zero’ since the 1990s, so all these cuts that they’re doing now is in this objective of deficit zero,” explained Gingras.
Critics object that the cuts predominantly affect underprivileged sectors of society that are unable to mount a defense. This sentiment was echoed by many protesters who argued that welfare cuts disproportionately target vulnerable groups. “Cutting social aid, childcare and so on, means that the poor are targeted while the rich remain unaffected,” Sophie Macon, a Cégep student, said to The Daily in French. “Students, the homeless, women and the Indigenous are particularly affected.”
“[Those hit the hardest are] the most disadvantaged of us, people who are already on welfare, who are already having trouble heating their apartments and paying rent, women especially of course – women are always the first to suffer any kind of anti-social policy,” added Gingras. “Austerity measures are so broad, and they’re attacking so many people.”

Initial deficit overcome through budget cuts
Correction appended January 12, 2014.
Having originally forecasted a deficit of $90,000 for the 2013-14 fiscal year, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) has recently revised its budget with the aim of improving its financial situation. The revised budget now breaks even, after $50,000 saved from cuts was transferred to a fund for long-term expenditures, as per SSMU bylaws.
SSMU was able to significantly reduce its deficit by cutting executives’ personal budgets, as well as General Administration, Building, Club, and Information Technology (IT) budgets. The official report on the budget states that the most significant cuts occurred in the General Administration category – which, according to the report, totalled $85,568.
Further examination reveals that approximately $74,600 of this amount arises from cuts in salaries and benefits of employees. The report explains that the Student Salaries Budget has been reduced by 10 per cent in order to account for the fact that 90 per cent of the budgeted hours for student staff are worked.
“The cuts were decided based on SSMU’s stated values and the overall services that we provide to students. The cuts were made as to minimize their effect on the services that SSMU provides,” VP Finances and Operations Tyler Hofmeister told The Daily when asked about how these cuts were determined by SSMU.
However, Hofmeister said that he could not disclose which categories of employees would be most affected by these cuts, for legal reasons.
This projected $50,000 surplus is to be transferred into a fund known as the Capital Expenditures Reserve Fund (CERF). In 1985, SSMU created the CERF to set aside money for long-term expenditures, renovations, student projects, and the like. Excess revenues are transferred to the CERF and the Student Life Fund annually, as deemed necessary. Sometimes money is transferred out to cover deficits, as happened last year when SSMU’s deficit of $211,320 was covered by money out of the CERF.
Hofmeister stated that the previously projected $90,000 deficit for this fiscal year was very high because it “includes a conservative amount for rent and utilities given the current state of lease negotiations.”
“Currently, SSMU has not been paying its lease during negotiations, but once an agreement is signed, SSMU may have to pay retroactively so it is important that [these potential costs are] included,” said Hofmeister.
One large expense that contributed significantly to the deficit was the $21,000 loss incurred at this year’s Frosh, a fact confirmed by Hofmeister. According to an answer VP Internal Brian Farnan gave at SSMU’s Special General Assembly on November 13, accounting mistakes were to blame for the majority of the five-figure loss.
SSMU used PayPal for Frosh, but miscalculated the percentage of fees that the company asked for. Money was also lost through sponsorship, as SSMU made mistakes calculating taxes. A new system that split up sponsorship revenues between faculties also contributed to the errors. According to Farnan, the approximately $200,000 Frosh budget will be maintained next year by SSMU’s accounting department, instead of SSMU executive members.
In a recent interview with the McGill Tribune, SSMU President Katie Larson suggested that the SSMU base fee might need an increase in order to accommodate future deficits. Hofmeister told The Daily that “a student referendum would be required” to change the base fee.
Another alternative could be “changing the investment portfolio to an endowment fund,” which would require “chang[es to] the relevant bylaws and would require the approval of [Legislative Council],” said Hofmeister.
Although SSMU cut its budget in its General Administration department, it also increased spending for areas such as contract services and interest fees from bank charges. Furthermore, SSMU has also increased its spending on security, as they are considering hiring more security and outsourcing less.
The IT department is also facing large expenses, as much of their hardware is out-of-date and needs to be replaced. Although a portion of this year’s budget is allocated to it, some purchases are being pushed back a few years in order to reduce financial pressures, setting SSMU up for a potential deficit in the future.
In an earlier version of this article, The Daily stated that the revised budget included a $50,000 surplus. In fact, the $50,000 in question was transferred into the Capital Expenditures Reserve Fund, and the operating budget broke even. The title of the article has also been changed to reflect these facts. The Daily regrets the errors.

Institutionalizing homophobia in organ donation
Correction appended November 20, 2013.
In Canada, 4,000 people are waiting for an organ donation, yet only 1,803 organ transplants were performed during the past year. 185 people died while waiting for an organ.
With such a large need for organ donors, Jason Behrmann, a post-doctoral fellow at McGill in the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies (IGSF), questions why donor regulations exclude homosexual men. As part of the IGSF’s “Esquisses” series last Tuesday, Behrmann addressed this issue.
“These policies […] exclude a certain group from contributing to society. Gay, bisexual and MSM people have come to be called freeloaders of society.”
“Sex, gender, and sexual orientation are factors that have a huge influence on health […] and health policy,” Behrmann told The Daily. “Correspondingly, [sexual orientation] has a dramatic influence on the structuring of your healthcare system and the availability of very […] scarce resources in health.”
The late 1970s saw thousands of people infected with HIV and hepatitis, often related to blood transfusions. In particular, HIV was prevalent in the gay community at that time. In 1977, men who have sex with men – referred to as MSM by Health Canada – were banned from donating blood or organs.
This meant that if a man had had sex with another man anytime since 1977, they would not be eligible to donate. This regulation also applied to intravenous drug users, sex workers, prisoners, and anyone sexually involved with these groups, as well as people directly exposed to HIV, Hepatitis B (HBV), or Hepatitis C (HCV) infected blood, as published on the website of the Parliament of Canada.
In summer 2013, the government changed these policies to a five-year deferral on MSM. According to Canadian Blood Services, “The change means that any man who has not had sex with another man in the last five years and meets other screening criteria may be eligible to give blood.”
During the “Esquisses,” Behrmann contested this regulation, stating that technology has developed rapidly to control infectious diseases in blood, so that only 1 in 7.8 million transfusions ‘tainted’ with a transmissible disease evade the tests.
However, in the context of the five-year deferral period, Behrmann said that, “These policies […] exclude a certain group from contributing to society. Gay, bisexual and MSM people have come to be called freeloaders of society.”
“The fact that we have regulations that exclude or try to exclude men who have sex with men – an exclusively male population that’s cut out of the donor pool – inadvertently requires the female population having to make up for that slack. That burden gets placed on the backs of women.”
Behrmann also raised the issue of sperm donation in Canada.
“It seems really strange that someone is banned until the day they die, from being an anonymous sperm donor, just because they happen to be MSM.”
Behrmann claimed that these restrictions are intrusive, with the government overly involved in individual, private reproductive freedoms. He also asserted that the quality of health services received by patients from the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans* Queer (LGBTQ) community may be negatively affected, as they would not feel as comfortable consulting medical services.
“It does raise tensions and a negative perception of the gay community toward the medical community. This is rather well-known. These regulations do dissuade people from seeking medical attention,” he said.
Behrmann also looked at the gender discrepancy in the organ donor pool.
“The fact that we have regulations that exclude or try to exclude men who have sex with men – an exclusively male population that’s cut out of the donor pool – inadvertently requires the female population having to make up for that slack. That burden gets placed on the backs of women.”
Behrmann also discussed a loophole provision known as “exceptional circumstances,” which allows for organs from the MSM population to be used in life-or-death situations in which there are no available organs from other eligible populations and the patient has given consent.
This provision does not generally apply to blood or sperm donations and still prevents MSM donors from giving certain organs such as kidneys. While the overall scarcity of available organs results in up to half of donated organs coming from ‘undesirable’ populations, Behrmann emphasized that there are still many problems with this MSM donor criteria, as well as other high-risk populations.
“It reinforces this notion that organs are not equal. It’s not just a human thing, it’s a gay thing. You would have what is deemed ‘high-risk’ organs because they come from a gay donor and you would know it.”
He claimed the current policies enable the discrimination and stigmatization of homosexual men, and deter them from participation in the healthcare system.
“We look [at] how when we structure health interventions for the [MSM] population, we can inadvertently stigmatize people and force this othering and notions of unwantedness of certain population groups.”
Behrmann addressed the ways in which he believed the current donation policies could be improved.
Among others, his proposed changes included reducing the five-year ban on blood donation to 12 months. He also recommended organizing surveys and collecting data that quantify the waste produced by excluding MSM organ donations. Raising awareness of these issues for doctors would also ameliorate the issue, according to Behrmann.
Although implementing such changes would not be easy, Behrmann remains confident in the positive impact they could bring about in the future.
“The question is: now can we change these regulations that exclude broad members of the population, and still keep a very safe and effective system, without increasing the risk of disease. I believe through my proposals that we can achieve those goals.”
The graphic in an earlier version of this article stated that in 1988, a five-year deferral was introduced into the blood screening process. In fact, that year saw an indefinite deferral introduced. The Daily regrets the error.

A look into Vision 2020
On the evening of November 14, staff and students gathered in the McGill bookstore for the launch of the first draft of McGill’s sustainability strategy – otherwise known as Vision 2020.
Vision 2020 is a consultation and planning process that aims to set a sustainability strategy for the McGill community. It was established in Winter 2012 by McGill’s Office of Sustainability and funded by the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF). In Vision 2020’s 2013 Vision and Goals Report, its mandate is described as the process of turning McGill into an institution that “walks the walk of sustainability in all that [McGill does].” 
Lilith Wyatt, SPF Coordinator and a founding member of Vision 2020, told The Daily that she was thrilled with the turnout and with the support. “The coolest part about Vision 2020 is that it’s not just for the community but genuinely from the McGill community.”
Vision 2020 has not always generated such successful results. Earlier in 2013, the project published a failure report outlining Vision 2020’s own missteps. “We got a little bit caught up in being a campus darling,” wrote Julia Solomon, senior communications specialist at University Services. “We let [visibility] distract us from the more basic questions: […] Are we taking advantage of this moment in the spotlight to communicate clearly about why sustainability, this process, and goals built through it, are important?”
Wyatt also reflected on these mistakes. “A university can’t be excellent if it doesn’t publicly fail and learn from it.”
Vision 2020’s first draft of the Sustainability Strategy has been met with positive feedback from other McGill organizations, such as funding from the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office (SEDE).
When discussing the projects’ dialogue with the senior administrative team of the University, Wyatt admitted, “At first what we heard from [the senior administrators] was hard for us to hear because it was a bit of a change to our original dates; however, the bottom line was that they were actually really supportive.”
Wyatt emphasized that McGill has had a long history of demanding a more sustainable campus, saying that, in the past, “there were student grassroot movements, but they were totally disconnected from high-level policies.” 
The development of relationships between administration and student movements on the topic of sustainability is key in the success of Vision 2020. Wyatt called this partnership “really important in the DNA of the McGill Office of Sustainability. It has always been a partnership between the two – especially in a campus context which has held a lot of tension between the students and the administration, so it’s always been a place where students and staff have been able to find common ground.”
When asked what’s next for Vision 2020, Wyatt said, “Right now there are 51 actions, and the administration has asked us to narrow it down to a few priority actions.”

Concerns about creation of administrative hubs voiced at meeting
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) had its bi-weekly Council meeting last Wednesday, adopting two motions declaring that the AUS endorses “yes” votes on the two SSMU referendum questions regarding Midnight Kitchen. 
In addition, Associate Dean (Academic Administration and Oversight) Gillian Lane-Mercier attended the meeting and gave a presentation about the “People, Processes & Partnerships” project that has been going on since the previous academic year.
Lane-Mercier’s presentation focused the project’s plans for administrative restructuring that will take place in the three locations: Sherbrooke 688, Arts/Ferrier, and Leacock.
Among other restructuring and regrouping maneuvers, Lane-Mercier affirmed that administrative restructuring will occur in Leacock, as two new administrative hubs will be created – although the faculty has backed down from transforming the third floor of Leacock into a reception area.
AUS VP Internal Enbal Singer later commented in an interview with The Daily that her expectations regarding the proposed plans were low.
“Student size is growing, physical space is hardly growing. [The University] buy[s] more houses in the area, on Doctor Penfield […] and Bronfman expanded to the CIBC building. So there is a little expansion, but not at the same rate that [the student body is] growing. That’s where the problem is,” Singer said.
However, Lane-Mercier emphasized the environment of austerity impacting the project.
“We are trying to make these administrative hubs robust enough to sustain the early retirement departures and upcoming normal retirements, which will continue to come forward. And we are not allowed to hire [new administrative officers], there is a complete hiring freeze and we don’t know how long that will last. And we also don’t know if the Quebec government will begin to reinvest in Quebec universities,” she said during the presentation. “We’re not 100 per cent convinced that there will be a reinvestment in the administrative services.” 
During the question period after the presentation, Matthew Crawford-Appignanesi, of the McGill Industrial Relations Association asked whether or not the faculty has any plans to integrate the Interdisciplinary Studies coordinator with one of the two hubs in Leacock.
Lane-Mercier responded by saying that the answer to this question was not quite clear yet, but it was definitely on their “radar screen.”
Singer brought up the issue of the McTavish rowhouses, and asked what would happen to the rowhouse that is currently being held by the Department of Jewish Studies, which will move to the Leacock Building, and the one that was previously held by the Department of East Asian Studies, which moved to Sherbrooke 688 over the summer. 
Lane-Mercier cited long-term concerns in explaining the decision to move the Departments of Jewish Studies and East Asian Studies out of their rowhouses on McTavish.
“The Arts Faculty is in a little bit of competition with [Student Life and Learning] who would like to one day see McTavish a 100 per cent student corridor, apart from the Faculty Club. […] Arts doesn’t like that idea, at least not now. We don’t have enough space, we need the space. But we’re worried that the University is not going to invest much in this space until it decides what it’s going to do with it,” Lane-Mercier explained.
In a phone interview with The Daily, AUS President Justin Fletcher said, “While there is a lot of uncertainty in how those spaces are going to be rethought, I also think it’s an opportunity for us to have a big say in what student space means.”

Awareness-raising workshops in development for Winter 2014
On November 12, the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) held a discussion regarding equity issues and safe space within the Faculty of Engineering. Hosted by EUS Equity Commissioner Christopher Tegho, the discussion largely focused on brainstorming ways to tackle current equity issues and a lack of awareness about safe space among students in the Faculty.
Tegho noted that the Faculty currently faces “problems regarding inclusivity,” such as “problematic titles for events, or events and Frosh that are all about drinking and do not include non-drinking options.” He additionally mentioned the presence of rape culture in engineering events such as “engineering chants during Frosh [that] mock people from other schools and other faculties.”
At the end of the discussion, one participant, reflecting on the entire talk, noted that, despite the new ideas being introduced, “there’s still a lot of work to be done to reach our end goal.”
“[The chants] give mixed messages about Frosh and being equitable,” stated Josh Redel, a participant in the discussion, and former president of SSMU in 2012-13 and EUS in 2011-12.
Some ideas to alleviate equity issues included introducing safer space through workshops, Frosh, Rez Project, and professors in a classroom setting. A main goal for the discussion was to find ways to fit social equity and justice into the Engineering curriculum to make students aware of the importance of instilling an atmosphere of safe space within the Faculty.
According to Redel, the EUS lacks policies related to social sustainability and equity “because of [the Engineering Faculty’s] extremely rigid curriculum.”
One key issue to tackle amongst Engineering students is the use of the term “safe space” itself. According to Redel, the term is deemed by many students to be a “joke,” which creates the problem of getting Engineering students to actually attend workshops.
“People will not go to something they perceive as a joke,” he said. As a result, Tegho noted in a follow-up interview with The Daily that he strives to make the equity policy in Engineering “more active rather than reactive.”
Another equity issue among Engineering students discussed at the meeting was “the classroom experience” which, for example, excludes “pronouns other than he [and she]” and “allows for racist and transphobic comments and jokes,” said Tegho.
A participant at the meeting also mentioned that EUS should “approach social equity to Engineering students differently than it would with students of other faculties because engineers are quick to tune things out.” This situation, noted Tegho, creates “a lack of support toward people who experience intimidation, and any kind of oppression.”
One key issue to tackle amongst Engineering students is the use of the term “safe space” itself. According to Redel, the term is deemed by many students to be a “joke,” which creates the problem of getting Engineering students to actually attend workshops.
To resolve issues such as the ones listed above, Tegho, along with others in attendance, agreed that holding workshops in Winter 2014 and thereafter could be an effective way to teach students about the idea and effects of creating a safer space.
Another idea included critically analyzing the work of students in the EUS and organizers of EUS events to “provide them with tools and resources,” such as a checklist, that “make the EUS more inclusive,” noted Tegho in an interview with The Daily.
He also mentioned that communicating with professors about equity could be useful; for instance, one of the professors teaching FACC 100: Introduction to the Engineering Profession, is “looking for ideas and inputs,” implying that the course’s curriculum allows space for the inclusion of “the subject of equity.”
Tegho noted that overall, “the talk was successful because it brought lots of good ideas.”
At the end of the discussion, one participant, reflecting on the entire talk, noted that, despite the new ideas being introduced, “there’s still a lot of work to be done to reach our end goal.”

Calls for community and policy-level solutions
On November 14, Detroit-based organizer Charity Hicks presented the third installment of CKUT’s “Under the Weather” climate change series with a lecture on the importance of community organizing in the ongoing movement for climate justice. Hicks stated that her aim was to “define ecological dilemmas facing the earth, identify the implications for our communities, and strategize solutions to resolve these dilemmas.”
Hicks identified the global economy as one of the main drivers behind climate change, saying “I don’t really want to quote President Clinton but… it’s the economy, stupid!”
She described how the “industrial, globalized, and capitalist economy” has led to a series of crises including a lack of water, an overload of waste and toxins, diminishing cultural and biological diversity, restricted food and agriculture, and a conflict between the climate and energy.
“Every 14 days, an ethnicity and a language is under annihilation,” Hicks explained. “Communities are being destroyed, people are being displaced.”
 “In your lifetime, the Arctic will be free of ice […]. The earth doesn’t discriminate [who it impacts], but the global economy does.”
U2 Political Science student Yasmin Ali thought Hicks offered a unique perspective on the connection between climate change and social disruption.
“It was just interesting what she said about the Arab Spring. Never once have I heard my professors kind of connect the socio-economic issues that led to the Arab Spring actually happening to ecological issues, and that migration from rural to urban settings. I thought that connecting that was such an interesting framework to look at this issue that has already been analyzed in so many ways,” she told The Daily.
Hicks also explained that, due to what is termed the “lag effect,” the world is currently experiencing the environmental effects of carbon emissions from the 1960s. She argued that the impacts of today’s emissions are still to come: “In your lifetime, the Arctic will be free of ice […]. The earth doesn’t discriminate [who it impacts], but the global economy does.”
Throughout the lecture, Hicks discussed solutions alongside the environmental issues. “We have to start growing food locally and regionally,” she said, giving examples of local food projects in Detroit, such as those by the Detroit Food Justice Task Force. She suggested a goal of 25 per cent locally grown food for Montreal.
“[Our solutions to environmental issues] must be what is really needed and be politically realistic.”
Hicks touched on the importance of movements led by Indigenous populations to climate justice solutions. In a recent article for The Media Coop on the Idle No More movement, Hicks said, “As the oldest cultures that are place-based and rooted in ecosystem-based knowledge and exchange and reciprocity, that [Indigenous] wisdom is like a roadmap […] they represent a way of knowing and being in place that we’ve lost.”
Hicks stressed that “[Our solutions to environmental issues] must be what is really needed and be politically realistic.” She maintained that there is a need to combat false solutions, and that “environmental champions” in government and policy-making are a necessity.
Discussing the balance between optimism and urgency, Hicks told The Daily, “I have kind of moved away from the doom and gloom. I don’t think we function under depression. Our change can either be intentional, or the result of a collapse.”
To close her presentation, Hicks extended a call-to-action to Montrealers, asking them to “be a part of the shift” toward climate justice. To those skeptical of climate change, she urged, “Montreal, do not be a cynic. This is not a hoax, this is for real.”

Meeting criticized for lacking concrete solutions
On Wednesday, McGill’s senators, governors, staff, and students, convened for the annual joint Board of Governors (BoG) and Senate meeting. This year’s meeting revolved around the issue of mental health, focusing on the broad issues of awareness and stigma.
The keynote presentation, given by Lynne McVey, Executive Director of the Douglas Mental Health Institute, talked about the issue of mental health, as well as stigmatization and stressors for students. “It’s an illness like any other,” McVey told the crowd, pointing to research done by scientists that showed that mental illness is a biological and genetic problem.
After another presentation by Jeff Moat, President of Partners for Mental Health, the meeting broke out into small tables to discuss case studies.
Arts Senator Claire Stewart-Kanigan mentioned that one of the proposals that she put forward at her table was incorporating mental health training into the pedagogical training Teaching Assistants (TAs) receive. “Since you already have that structure institutionalized, it would be easy to add a mental health component so TAs can be supportive and aware of where to direct students.”
However, Stewart-Kanigan was critical of the meeting for overlooking issues related to gender or sexuality present within the cases.
Brian Cowan, professor of history at McGill and a member of Senate, also pointed to the fact that the meeting lacked people who have dealt with mental health issues speaking. “Nobody was speaking to the group who actually had experienced mental illness, which actually struck me as odd,” Cowan told The Daily.
Although there is currently a working group under the Student Services portfolio that brings together different players to brainstorm recommendations, the meeting lacked concrete solutions for the state of mental health resources at McGill.
“I actually would have liked to have known what the University is doing now,” Cowan said. “And areas where it thinks it should improve. That would have been useful, and we didn’t really have a whole lot of that.”
Mental health has been a much-discussed issue on campus recently, and Vera Romano, Director of Counselling Services, was happy that it was made a priority at the meeting. “The number one concern [regarding mental health] of McGill students is anxiety and stress – both academic anxiety and stress, and social anxiety and stress,” Romano told The Daily, referring to a study of McGill students conducted by Romano and Lisa Di Genova.
“Mental health is one of those things that everyone has an opinion [on], they want to talk about it, and it is very prevalent […] I think going into it everyone was ready for discussion,” Elizabeth Cawley, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society of McGill University Member Services Commissioner, stated in an interview with The Daily after the meeting.
Cowan noted that the selection of the topic itself was a good sign. “That’s one thing I found quite positive about this whole affair: the simple recognition that this is a problem. If you can’t recognize that you have a problem, you’re not going to do anything about it.”
“All the right things were being said; this sounds like progress to me,” Cowan added. “On the other hand, the devil’s in the detail and there were very few details.”
