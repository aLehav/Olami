Activists discuss Indigenous land defense and Line 9 case
At 7:30 a.m. on December 21, 2015, Vanessa Gray and two supporters, Stone Stewart and Sarah Scanlon, shut down the flow of oil through Enbridge’s Line 9 pipeline near Sarnia on Anishinaabe Territory. After calling Enbridge Inc. to demand that the pipeline be turned off, they turned the handwheel themselves to shut off the pipeline, and bike-locked their necks to the valve.
Roughly 50 people gathered in McGill’s Frank Dawson Adams auditorium on Tuesday, September 27 to hear Gray speak at an event called “Defending Land Defenders.” The event consisted of three parts, including a presentation by Gray and her sister Lindsay, a discussion by panelists about direct action, and an open conversation with the audience on how students, researchers, and scholars can help support Indigenous land defenders. The event was organized by CKUT radio, Climate Justice Montreal, Economics for the Anthropocene, and Divest McGill, as part of Divest McGill’s Fossil Free Week.
Other panelists included Darin Barney, an associate professor of Art History & Communication Studies at McGill; Geoffrey Garver, who recently received a PhD from McGill’s Geography department; Bradley Por, a doctoral candidate who studies Indigenous blockades as a source of law; Nicolas Kosoy, an associate professor at McGill’s Natural Resource Sciences department, specializing in environmental economics; and Normand Beaudet, co-founder of the Centre de ressources sur la non-violence.
Vanessa and Lindsay Gray are women from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, just outside Sarnia, Ontario. They live in what is called “Canada’s Chemical Valley”: an area which houses over 60 oil refineries and chemical plants that produce plastics and gasoline. Recently, plans to build a new polyethelyne plant were announced.
“There’s a lot of cancer in my community. I’ve noticed there’s a lot of breast cancer in the women,” said Vanessa at a press conference prior to the event, in response to The Daily’s question. 39 per cent of women surveyed in the community of 800 have experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth. Many community members experience severe or chronic headaches, asthma, rashes, and thyroid and kidney problems.
“As a child, I was worried for my own sake, when I would constantly have asthma attacks,” explained Vanessa during the panel. “This is ongoing violence on the land, and violence on our bodies. It’s a chemical war zone that we’re dealing with.”
Then, in December 2015, a tar sands pipeline owned by Enbridge, called Line 9, began shipping diluted bitumen – a liquid form of petroleum – between Sarnia and Montreal. According to many Indigenous activists, Line 9 violates Indigenous sovereignty and treaty rights.
“This is ongoing violence on the land, and violence on our bodies. It’s a chemical war zone that we’re dealing with.”
“Line 9, Enbridge’s pipeline, is an unsafe pipeline,” said Vanessa, noting that changes to the pipeline were made without consultation with the Indigenous people living in communities along the pipeline. “And so now a lot of communities – not only Indigenous communities – are faced with their drinking water at risk, with little to no emergency plan for a tar sands spill, anywhere between here and Sarnia,” she continued.
Vanessa Gray, Stewart, and Scanlon have been charged with counts of Mischief Over $5,000 and Mischief Endangering Life – the latter charge carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. Stewart was also charged with resisting arrest. Vanessa’s preliminary hearing will take place on February 24 in Sarnia, she explained at the panel.
During the panel, Garver noted that governments don’t have the resources to prosecute every instance of civil disobedience. “Every act of enforcement is an exercise of discretion – so it’s really a political choice,” he explained.
“And so now a lot of communities – not only Indigenous communities – are faced with their drinking water at risk, with little to no emergency plan for a tar sands spill, anywhere between here and Sarnia.”
According to the Line 9 Shutdown website, there are no other known instances of activists who have been charged for Mischief Endangering Life, “which leads us to believe it is a scare tactic to discourage land defense and resistance against the fossil fuel industry,” the site states.
“When we look at my case, you see the extreme charges that I have,” Vanessa told The Daily. “I think we should be thinking of my actions as less radical, and looking at our own government and our own justice system as more extreme. Because there’s nothing radical about Indigenous people protecting their own lands, and their own Indigenous territory.”
Beaudet explained to the audience that, in a representative democracy like Canada, individual citizens rely on elected representatives to act in their best interests. “But you start feeling that if your representative can’t do anything, then you need to go to actions that are direct,” he said.
But according to Beaudet, direct action is not acknowledged by the Canadian government as a legitimate part of the democratic process, which leads those who attempt civil disobedience to be arrested for various charges.
“Every act of enforcement is an exercise of discretion – so it’s really a political choice.”
“You have charges of mischief, assault, obstructing police officers,” said Beaudet. “All of these rules are very vague, and permit officers to arrest anyone in almost any situation.”
Vanessa added, however, that Indigenous land defence is distinct from other acts of civil disobedience. “When it comes to Indigenous people there is a history of law enforcement escalating quickly,” she explained. She cited the 1995 Ipperwash Crisis, where the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) shot and killed an Ojibwe protester, Dudley George, as he walked towards officers with a stick in his hand during an Indigenous land dispute.
Barney believes that acts of civil disobedience by Indigenous people to protect their land are both morally and politically justifiable.
“The conditions which typically produce this kind of direct action are some kind of historical criminal injury; current conditions of ongoing material, psychological, bodily, social harm; an imperative to act to protect the future against some known and present threat or danger; and the demonstrable incapacity of existing institutions to address those first three conditions,” he said. “I would say that it’s clear that each of those conditions is present in the case of Vanessa’s action.”
“I think we should be thinking of my actions as less radical, and looking at our own government and our own justice system as more extreme. Because there’s nothing radical about Indigenous people protecting their own lands, and their own Indigenous territory.”
“For Indigenous people, it’s our lives that are at stake when it comes to defending the land and the water,” Vanessa continued. “Indigenous people had to resist in order to survive up until this moment – and that’s who we are as a people now. We are nothing but survival.”
Those who would seek to delegitimize direct action argue that’s it’s ‘undemocratic,’ Barney explained. “But […] that democratic ideal, under certain conditions, is thwarted by organized power and by agents who seek to undermine it – which are the conditions that pertain around resource extraction and petrochemical development.”
“When those conditions of thwarting of the democratic process and ideal are present, actions which seek to expose that, and to enforce the possibility of autonomous collective decision-making by the people who are most affected by the kinds of conditions that we’ve been discussing, those actions don’t undermine democracy – they serve it,” Barney concluded.
“Indigenous people had to resist in order to survive up until this moment – and that’s who we are as a people now. We are nothing but survival.”
Por argued that recognition of Indigenous legal systems would legitimize the actions of Indigenous activists in the eyes of the Canadian government. “We need to recognize that […] there’s a different legal system that actually requires people, out of a duty to the land, to protect the land,” he explained.
Vanessa encouraged audience members to consider taking direct action as a form of activism, but also stressed the importance of being an ally to Indigenous people in their defense of their own territory.
Speaking to The Daily, Andrew Stein, a U3 Environment student and member of Divest McGill, said that it’s essential for activists to recognise that climate change impacts Indigenous people more than others, in what Vanessa called “environmental racism.”
“It’s important to support people on the front lines of extraction, support people in Indigenous communities who are being underrepresented elsewhere, and recognise that they are the traditional custodians of the lands and waters,” said Stein. “They’ve been fighting this fight for a long time, and it’s time that we recognise that and support them however we can.”

Panelists decry “climate of secrecy” at McGill
A panel entitled “Sexual Violence and Power Dynamics in a University Setting” was held at McGill on Thursday, September 29, to discuss sexual violence and the abuse of power, including in student-professor and staff-employer relationships. The panel was part of Consent Week, an event series run by Consent McGill, and was organized in collaboration with Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Equity and Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) Community Engagement Day. Roughly 50 students attended the event.
Sexual violence has been a particularly prevalent topic on campus in recent months, as a result of the ongoing controversy surrounding McGill’s proposed Sexual Violence Policy, which is currently in development. However, the topic of abuse of power in the university context is rarely discussed publicly.
The topic was briefly discussed at Senate last September with reference to an article published in The Daily, “Let’s Talk about Teacher.” Principal Suzanne Fortier was also asked about allegations of intimate relationships between professors and research assistants in a meeting of the Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) council last November, where she said “We have to […] be careful in respecting [professors’] private lives.”
The University’s Draft Policy against Sexual Violence (DPSV), which was released on September 12 and will be brought to Senate for information this month, does refer to power dynamics in its definition of consent, but does not mention specific types of power dynamics, such as those between students and professors.
“We have to […] be careful in respecting [professors’] private lives.”
During the discussion period, two graduate students asked questions about the DPSV and expressed concerns about the focus of the conversation around sexual assault being solely based on supporting survivors. They said that they would want to see a greater focus on punitive measures against perpetrators in the policy, which currently focuses on “ensuring support for survivors of sexual violence.”
The panelists on Thursday included Nina Hermes, a student who has worked as a floor fellow in McGill residences for the past two years and has been involved with the Sexual Assault Policy Working Group; Claire Michela, the president of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE); Jason Opal, an associate professor in the department of history; and Adrienne Piggott, a harassment assessor and chair of the subcommittee of the Joint Board-Senate Committee on Equity for Racialized and Ethnic Persons.
The panelists explained that abuse of power is a pervasive issue because it is extremely difficult to take action against a perpetrator of sexual violence who holds a position of power.
For example, Michela said that AMUSE members who are casual employees face particularly challenging obstacles because “their employers are often their professor or their sports coach,” and because they have short term contracts, “they can easily be let go without actually being fired. The employer can simply wait until their contract is up and then not renew it.”
Speaking specifically about barriers to addressing allegations against professors, Opal explained that, amongst professors, there is a pervasive “fear about a false rumour destroying [a] reputation,” which is often used to shut down other professors who raise concerns about allegations.
He added that when a professor is accused of sexual harassment, this is often seen by other professors “as a threat to the department,” which, he stressed, “is itself unacceptable behaviour.”
Hermes spoke of her personal experience of being sexually assaulted by a floor fellow while living in residence. She explained that she was very disappointed with how her case was dealt with in residence, as the perpetrator was “quietly let go.”
“As someone who has just survived this trauma, I really felt like it was swept under the rug,” she told the audience.
Piggott also mentioned that there is still “a climate of secrecy on campus surrounding sexual harassment complaints,” and the panelists discussed the role of “rumours” and informal channels such as student media and social media in this climate.
“As someone who has just survived this trauma, I really felt like it was swept under the rug.”
Michela suggested that rumours about such abuses of power “have become so difficult for the University to ignore that they’ve become politically powerful.”
Piggott added that the University has been aware that sexual assault is a problem on campus for decades, but it was the discussion of the topic publicly in the media that has finally pushed them to respond now. “It really did have to be a public shaming for the University to respond, and I think that’s really sad,” she said.
Hermes agreed that informal channels are important as “one of the few avenues that survivors can access.” However, she added, “rarely does that [informal channel] result in any sort of justice, because I can write as many articles as I want, but that’s not going to get someone out of their tenured position.”
“It really did have to be a public shaming for the University to respond, and I think that’s really sad.”
Opal also spoke about how professors must become “informed and visible allies” who are “educated in how to respond in the immediate sense” when someone confides in them about having faced sexual harassment.
He suggested that having a physical sign on allied professors’ office doors to indicate that “the person occupying this office is an informed and sympathetic voice” could give students somewhere to turn to when they need help, while also “visibly disrupting a landscape of hostility.”
Speaking to The Daily, Esther, a U4 student in Education who attended the event, said, “It was very interesting to have such different panelists […] because it really gives us a different point of view of all the different people who are trying to act against sexual violence, especially about power dynamics on campus – it’s something that we don’t really talk about.”
“Rarely does that [informal channel] result in any sort of justice, because I can write as many articles as I want, but that’s not going to get someone out of their tenured position.”
In an interview with The Daily, SSMU VP University Affairs and student senator Erin Sobat, who had also attended the panel, explained the key point which he would like to bring before Senate from the discussion.
“I think there’s a real desire expressed both by panelists and by audience members for there to be a real recognition that the issue does exist,” Sobat said, “I don’t think that has happened in a substantial way, even in the language of the policy. There’s not really a trust in the administration and their ability to take meaningful action.”

Student-Run Cafe’s deficit poses concern
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council met for the second time this academic year on Thursday, September 29. Council members heard committee reports, executive reports, two presentations, and one notice of motion.
Council discussed a notice of motion regarding the amendment of the internal regulations of governance and the electoral timeline. The timeline originally called for the approval of referendum questions on October 27, however, there is no Council meeting that day. An additional meeting was scheduled for October 20 to accommodate the two readings required for referendum questions.
VP Finance Niall Carolan gave an extended presentation on SSMU’s 2016-2017 budget to SSMU council members. The presentation focused on SSMU’s sources of revenue, with an emphasis on SSMU’s operations.
Carolan didn’t go into the details of SSMU’s investment portfolio, which he himself described as “extremely boring.” He did detail SSMU operations, however, like the Student Run Cafe (SRC), Gerts, and Mini Courses. For each of SSMU’s operations, Carolan highlighted its respective profitabilities, challenges, risks, and opportunities.
During a discussion of corporate sponsorship, Carolan acknowledged the contentious nature of the topic, as SSMU’s corporatization of student spaces has faced widespread criticism from the McGill community. Despite this, he explained that the revenue from advertising contracts has helped fund SSMU’s operations.
“The revenue generated from that sponsorship goes directly into offsetting the costs of running this building,” explained Carolan.
He argued that SSMU must strike a productive balance which would allow them to limit the negative impact that corporatization might have on the student body while securing the revenues necessary to hold events and reduce the Society’s overall deficit. Carolan also expressed a desire to make the sponsorship more student-centered.
Several questions about Carolan’s presentation centered around the Student-Run Cafe (SRC) in the Shatner building. Carolan explained that total revenue from commercial tenants dropped from approximately $214,000 in the 2015 fiscal year to $154,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, mainly as a result of losing two commercial tenants in the Shatner building with the opening of the SRC. This was a step toward putting a larger focus on student-run initiatives within SSMU, said Carolan, albeit “at a financial cost, which is lost commercial revenue.”
“The revenue generated from that sponsorship goes directly into offsetting the costs of running this building.”
Concerns were raised regarding the SRC’s deficit, which was nearly $70,000 in 2015. In 2016, it was near $120,000. According to Carolan, this was primarily because, while the number of daily transactions has risen substantially over the past year, the amount of labour and food required to run the cafe has, as a result, also increased. Furthermore, the SRC is required to use locally sourced and produced ingredients, while also assuring that the sources of food have fair labour practices. “These are good mandates, but it does restrict our ability to be profitable,” said Carolan.
Carolan also addressed the fact that SSMU’s Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) prevents the SRC from advertising anywhere on campus except inside the Shatner building, which limits its profitability even more. Overall, he said, SRC now stands as the single biggest contributor to past SSMU deficits. However, he assured councillors that the cafe has been investigating new streams of revenue. This includes expanded catering services.
“These are good mandates, but it does restrict our ability to be profitable.”
In light of this discussion, Senate Caucus representative Joshua Chin asked at what point one should start asking “existential questions” about the SRC, since it appears that the SRC has little alternative but to run a deficit.
A previous version of this article stated, “The notice mentioned a Legislative Council meeting on October 20, but as there is no scheduled meeting that day, Council will have to meet earlier to approve the amendment motion.” In fact, Council added another meeting on October 20 to approve referendum questions, as the original electoral timeline called for approval on October 27, but there is no Council meeting that day. The Daily regrets the error.

Consent Week organizers highlight continuing urgency of issue
McGill’s third annual Consent Week began on Monday, September 29, with a vigil for missing and murdered Indigenous women. The event, organized collaboratively by Consent McGill, First Peoples’ House, and Indigenous students, was held on lower field behind the Hochelaga Rock with roughly sixty people in attendance.
“I want to sincerely thank everyone here today for coming out and showing your support as we come together in honour of missing and murdered [Indigenous] women,” said Paige Isaac, the current coordinator of First People’s House. “I would like to acknowledge the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe peoples on whose traditional territory we live, work, and learn. We recognize and respect these nations as the traditional stewards of the lands and waters on which we meet today.”
Isaac highlighted the urgency of the issue at hand, reminding attendees of the severity of the crimes against Indigenous peoples.
“The [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] reported 1,181 cases of Indigenous women who have been murdered or who have gone missing since 1980. The numbers are likely higher than this,” she said. “Our aim is to bring awareness, and to shed light on this very important and multifaceted issue. This is a national crisis that has been repeatedly denounced by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations. It has been repeatedly ignored and dismissed by the Canadian government for years.”
“[But] while awareness is necessary,” she continued, “we are also here to urge people to take action. While you’re here with us, I want you to think about what you would do if this happened to your sister, your daughter, your mother, your loved one.”
“This is a national crisis that has been repeatedly denounced by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations. It has been repeatedly ignored and dismissed by the Canadian government for years.”
Around the space of the vigil, organizers showcased the art of Monique Bedard (under the pen name AURA), a Onkwehonwe (Oneida) and French-Canadian artist from the small town of Courtright, Ontario, much of which was displayed near the Hochelaga Rock. Her work was accompanied by a reading of one of her poems by Ashley Bach, a former coordinator of McGill’s Indigenous Student Alliance, and environmental science graduate.
“No more stolen sisters, no more stolen land, no more hate. / We hold each other’s hands as we rise / Rise for our children so they know their own strength / as we breath in and out like the tides of the waters / connecting to our grandmother,” she read.
A very large dreamcatcher was also on display at the vigil. Vigil organizers invited attendees to write down their hopes and aspirations for those affected by the crisis. These notes were then affixed to the dreamcatcher. Tiffany Harrington-Ashoona, one of the primary organizers of the vigil, wrote the first note, which said, “No more stolen sisters!”
Candles were passed around and lit for a moment of silence. Isaac and Harrington-Ashoona ended the vigil with a reminder of its importance.
“[But] while awareness is necessary,” she continued, “we are also here to urge people to take action. While you’re here with us, I want you to think about what you would do if this happened to your sister, your daughter, your mother, your loved one.”
“We really have to continue these vigils and these marches because women are still going missing, despite an inquiry coming up,” said Harrington-Ashoona. “Despite all of our efforts, women are still missing.”
She also reminded those in attendance that this crisis is deeply personal for many in the McGill community.
“My mother-in-law’s cousin just went missing,” she said. “She was found in [a] river last week […] This isn’t just going to end overnight.”
In an interview with The Daily, Bach also commented on how this crisis has affected the McGill community.
“A lot of people heard about the [Provost’s] Task Force [on Indigenous Studies and Education], but I don’t know if they fully know what’s been happening [regarding] missing and murdered aboriginal women,” she said, “and I don’t know if they fully understand the extent to which that affects students at McGill. Some [students’] aunts have gone missing, and other family members as well.”
“This is something people have to learn about,” she continued, “and I’m hoping that this [vigil] will draw in more people. It also gives us a community space for us to be together, to gather in, and remember these missing and murdered women.”

IJV will be first anti-Zionist Jewish group on campus since 2009
A McGill chapter of Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV) is launching this year, founded by two students, Anna and Sonja. IJV describes itself on its website as a “national human rights organization whose mandate is to promote a just resolution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine through the application of international law and respect for the human rights of all parties.”
In an email to The Daily, Anna explained that IJV McGill’s main goals are to “motivate critical Jewish students to gain awareness of the Israeli occupation and to bring this awareness to the broader campus community.” The group also aims to work with and support the McGill Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) and McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) movements through political campaigns and education.
The organization will further these goals through “speaker events, film screenings, and popular education on differences between Judaism and political Zionism,” Anna added.
McGill BDS expressed their support for IJV in an email to The Daily, saying that IJV’s message is “especially important in terms of increasing the visibility of anti-Zionist Jewish voices and alternative perspectives in the debate surrounding BDS.”
However, the pro-Palestine movement on campus may be hampered by the recent Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) justice board ruling concerning BDS.
In June, the justice board ruled that the BDS motion brought before SSMU’s Winter 2016 general assembly was unconstitutional, as it would require SSMU to adopt a platform against a specific country. This would allegedly violate SSMU’s equity policy.
When asked about the impact this ruling might have on IJV McGill, Anna cited the fact that the decision has not been ratified by SSMU, which makes it non-binding. She added the group will play a unique role at McGill as the first “anti-Zionist Jewish group” on campus since 2009. It will provide space for Jewish students to encounter a set of perspectives which are often marginalized in Jewish communities.
Anna explained that she believes IJV is important at McGill because “it remains a taboo for Jewish students to engage openly in pro-Palestinian solidarity work, [and] IJV seeks to challenge this. […] Many [non/anti-Zionist Jews in North America] find themselves unable to be open about their views with parents, communities or even their best friends.”
Anna hopes to “demystify,” in her words, the conflation between Jewishness and support for Israel. “IJV McGill will strive to celebrate diasporic Judaism and Jewish culture separately from Zionism.”
“It remains a taboo for Jewish students to engage openly in pro-Palestinian solidarity work, [and] IJV seeks to challenge this. […] Many [non/anti-Zionist Jews in North America] find themselves unable to be open about their views with parents, communities or even their best friends.”
This message is fully supported by the McGill-based Jewish political discussion podcast TREYF.
TREYF’s hosts, Sam Bick and David Zinman, advocate for the celebration of the rich Jewish culture that exists beyond Israel. They believe that many young Jewish people in North America are searching for a voice as they articulate their views on Zionism, and that McGill’s IJV chapter will provide them with a crucial space to discuss anti-colonial ideas.
A spokesperson for the Jewish student centre Chabad for McGill said that they were “glad that McGill affords students the opportunity to form clubs and have a voice,” especially if that view reflects the pluralism of a free society. The spokesperson declined to comment directly on IJV, since they were unfamiliar with the organization, but stated that Chabad had no issue with any student club, “as long as it respectfully follows [McGill’s] rules for clubs.”
A spokesperson for Israel on Campus echoed Chabad’s views on student diversity but voiced concerns over another club pushing for BDS. Israel on Campus feels BDS has “ostracized and led to the harassment of Jewish, Israeli, and pro-Israel students.”
“IJV McGill will strive to celebrate diasporic Judaism and Jewish culture separately from Zionism.”
Scott Weinstein, a member of IJV’s Montreal chapter, told The Daily in an email that “we are excited about working with the IJV chapter at McGill, which will serve an important role in educating McGill students about the realities on the ground in Israel-Palestine.”
“Jewish groups on campus have typically offered blind support for Israel’s behaviour,” he continued. “It will be refreshing to have a Jewish group on campus that promotes an honest and ethical discussion about what’s occurring in Israel-Palestine.”

Attack third of its kind in four years; racial or political motive suspected
A man wearing a black hoodie splashed gasoline on the side of Haitian radio station,CPAM 1410 in the Montreal borough of Saint-Michel during the early hours of Sunday, September 18. A CPAM camera captured this moment, after which the man threw a brick–then a Molotov cocktail–through one of the station’s windows.
“It’s the third time we’ve had a fire at the station,” CPAM 1410 station manager Jean-Ernest Pierre told CTV News in French. In 2012, a similar Molotov cocktail attack damaged the building. In May of this year, a car was firebombed in the parking lot.
The motive behind the arson remains unclear. “I think that some people might have a problem with the opinions that I express, and when I express my opinions, they’re always very clear and bold,” Pierre said in French, in a phone interview with The Daily.
“It’s the third time we’ve had a fire at the station.”
Controversial opinions may have been behind the 2012 firebombing the radio station as well. That attack occurred not long after Jean-Claude Duvalier, the former dictator of Haiti, made a surprise return to the country. Duvalier, nicknamed Baby Doc, ruled from 1971 until an uprising broke out in 1986 and he was forced to flee to France. He was arrested two days after his return to Haiti and charged with corruption. Prior to the 2012 firebombing, Pierre had said on-air that Duvalier should face a criminal trial.
“But apparently he had some ‘fans’ who made threats over the phone,” Pierre said in French, according to an article from La Presse. People speaking in Haitian Creole had called the radio station and threatened to set it on fire. “Is that the cause? I don’t know. We’ve also received threats this year after criticizing president Michel Martelly.”
The 2012 firebombing caused significant damage. The studio suffered water damage from firefighters dousing the building’s flames, and was unusable. Speaking to the Toronto Sun, Pierre described the scene of people coming to the station to see the debris as “like a funeral.” Despite that, CPAM was back on-air ten hours later. Pierre had announced from a temporary studio: “the culprit has disturbed our routine, but he can’t disrupt our ideas.”
“I think that some people might have a problem with the opinions that I express, and when I express my opinions, they’re always very clear and bold.”
Fortunately, damage from the September 18 attack was not as serious. There was water damage from the firefighting and the toilet had been destroyed, amounting to a few thousand dollars’ worth of damages, Pierre told The Daily in French.
The media liaison of the Montreal Fire Department, speaking to The Daily in French over the phone, provided an outline of what happened that night. “We received a call to 3990 Boulevard Crémazie […] at 3:21 am. We sent out two fire engines and a truck […] for a total of 15 firefighters. We left the premises at 4:29 [a.m.]. For us, it took about an hour before we transferred the case over to the police.”
The police are considering other potential motives for the attack. CTV News quoted Service de Police de la Ville de Montreal (SPVM) spokesperson Manuel Couture, who said, “Is it someone who’s been fired and who wants to get revenge? What happened exactly and why is it a target?”
Couture went on to say that police were also looking into whether or not the crime was racially motivated. CPAM is the only ethnic, Francophone radio station in North America, according to the station’s website. If the attack was racially motivated, the investigation would be transferred to the SPVM’s hate crimes division. However, as of September 27, the SPVM told The Daily by phone that there had been “no new developments” in the case.
Although the arsonist is still at large, Pierre is not worried. According to CTV, he is playing music until the damage is repaired, but listeners won’t have to wait long before a return to regular programming. “We’re going to keep having the same positions,” Pierre told The Daily. “The risks are there [but] it’s the choice that we’ve made to work for the people of our community.”

Attendees suggest new initiatives, criticise Fortier
Friday, September 23, marked the first of three open forum meetings that invited members of the McGill community to discuss sustainability at McGill. According to the event page on Facebook, the main goal of these forums was to “[create] a ‘comprehensive climate action plan’ in order to reduce McGill’s own carbon footprint while expanding initiatives in sustainability research and education” and “[develop] concrete measures to ensure our investments comply with recognized Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles.” Friday’s meeting was held in the Moot Court at New Chancellor Day Hall.
Many members of the University’s faculty and administration, including Principal Suzanne Fortier, attended the event. As the opening remarks began, members of the student climate justice group Divest McGill arrived.
The event began with some brief remarks from Frédéric Bachand, associate professor of law at McGill and co-chair of the forum, on the context and parameters of the discussion at hand.
“McGill accepts that not only more can be done, but that more should be done, and this is why we are gathered here today,” Bachand said.
Bachand briefly reviewed the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) report from March 2016 which dismissed Divest McGill’s request that the University divest from the fossil fuel industry. This report led to the Board of Governors’ decision to vote against divestment.
“McGill accepts that not only more can be done, but that more should be done, and this is why we are gathered here today.”
Notably, the release of the CAMSR report and the decision against divestment led to Divest McGill’s 72-hour sit-in from March 29 to April 1 in the reception area outside Fortier’s office in the James Administration building. During this time, the group demanded three things from McGill: public consultation on divestment, the release of the expert testimonies on which the CAMSR report had been based, and an acknowledgement from Fortier that the fossil fuel industry causes grave social injury.
Although Fortier has not acknowledged that fossil fuel industry causes grave social injury, the open forums on sustainability represented the administration’s response to Divest’s first demand. The forums were ostensibly designed to provide a space for members of the McGill community to voice their concerns and ideas regarding sustainability, and to have those statements acknowledged in an official setting.
At Friday’s forum, suggestions were made to implement sustainable practices including composting on campus, e-conferences to lower the carbon emissions incurred through travel, and to improve the efficiency of pre-existing structures such as the heating and cooling systems in university buildings.
Speakers also discussed the need for action at the institutional and individual levels, cited examples of social injury caused by the fossil fuel industry, and expressed their disappointment in the controversial CAMSR report.
“I cannot believe that that’s the message the university wants to convey about this problem,” said Richard Janda, an associate professor in the Faculty of Law and a supporter of divestment. “I don’t think [CAMSR] fulfilled its mandate according to its terms. I don’t think the committee did the job that it was supposed to do.” This was met with a large amount of applause.

Denzel Sutherland-Wilson, a U2 Management student and member of the Gitxsan Nation, spoke to the audience about the harm inflicted on his family and community by pipeline projects, as well as the broader impact of the fossil fuel industry on Indigenous peoples.
“It’s not just a climate change issue, it is a social issue,” he said. “It’s sickening to me, the tactics that pipeline companies will use to get chiefs to sign on. All of the chiefs I know have lived in poverty. It’s tough to not take the deal, […] to not take the money.”
“Pipelines represent a huge threat to our rivers and way of life […] These companies have a major impact on our lives already, and it’s not some distant thing in the future,” he said. “If McGill is serious about respecting Indigenous rights, then they need to divest and take greater action against climate change.”

Julia, a member of Divest and International Development student at McGill, directed her statement towards Fortier. She described a conversation held between Fortier and some members of Divest during the sit-in where Fortier was asked about the legality of the actions of oil companies. According to Julia, the principal responded, “‘Well, I mean, maybe they break the law sometimes, but don’t we all break the law?’”
“I’m tired of it all being on us and there being no accountability for our leaders in the name of things like gradual change and individual action. I think we are long past that point and we need institutional action,” she continued. “I honestly want you [Fortier] to see things from our perspective, because when we are getting that message […] that there is immunity for those people at the upper echelons of society, it is the most disheartening thing for a university student.”

Principal Fortier responded by saying, “I also am a human being who knows that while all of us would like to be perfect, and would like to strive for perfection in everything we do, most of us have not succeeded in that. […] We need to strive for doing better; perfection is very hard to achieve, and that means as human beings, sometimes we have to accept that. That’s the context in which I made that comment.”
When asked whether he believes McGill will take concrete action following the forum, Josh Spencer, a recent graduate from McGill’s International Management program, told The Daily, “If pressure stops, if pressure from Divest and the greater McGill community de-escalates or ceases – there’s no chance, in my opinion, of McGill or the administration divesting or of following through with turning these forums and these concerns into concrete action.”
