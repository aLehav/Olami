SSMU executives worry change in medical notes process could prove detrimental
Due to recent reforms of McGill Mental Health Services (MMHS) and Counselling Services, the process by which students obtain medical notes has changed.
Previously in order to receive a medical note students experiencing mental health issues had to go to daily drop-in hours, make a brief appointment for the same day, and receive a medical note to bring to professors to justify an absence or an extension.
Now, access to same-day medical notes will be limited to two categories of students: those in imminent danger of harming themselves or others, or those who have already been assigned a Client Care Clinician (CCC).
Under the recently instituted stepped care system, students arriving at MMHS and Counselling will be matched with a CCC through a shared intake process, who will then help them figure out a plan of care best suited to their individual needs.
However, according to Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP University Affairs Erin Sobat, the current wait time for appointments with a CCC is roughly two weeks. This means that students who are not in need of emergency care and are not already being followed by a CCC will have to wait for two weeks before having access to a medical note. However, McGill professors are unable to accept medical notes that retroactively justify past absences.
In a statement emailed to campus media, including The Daily, on October 28, Sobat expressed serious concern about the impact of this change on the student body.
“This will have an immediate and detrimental effect on many of our members,” he wrote, “not least because there has been no prior warning or communication regarding the change. In particular, it disregards the need to provide services and accommodation for incidental cases of mental health issues that may not qualify as an immediate safety concern, in a system where there is not currently sufficient access to care to ensure that students are already being seen by a McGill or external clinician.”
Speaking to The Daily, Cara Piperni, Interim Senior Director of Services for Students, explained the context behind the change. She was not responsible for the decision to implement these reforms to MMHS and Counselling, as she only stepped into her role in late October, but was nonetheless able to speak to the rationale behind them.
“When we talk about ‘the change’ relating to [medical notes],” she said, “I think it’s also important [to recognize] that we didn’t actually make a decision specifically around medical notes. What’s changed is the way students access what is now a common intake for both Counselling and Mental Health, so as a consequence of some of those changes, pathways changed, and there is a subgroup of students who used to be able to use same-day urgent drop-ins strictly for the purpose of medical notes, [who can no longer do so].”
This, said Piperni, was why SSMU executives working on mental health reforms, like Sobat and VP Student Life Elaine Patterson, had not been informed about the change regarding medical notes: “This was a residual impact [of broader reforms], that I don’t think we really noted specifically.”
Piperni also explained the logic of limiting same-day emergency appointments to those immediately at risk.
“We created this notion of ‘safety appointments,’ because students that are in situations where someone or they themselves are concerned about harm to self or harm to others, because of the bottleneck that used to exist, […] couldn’t get access,” she said. “So we carved out a very particular space […] for […] ‘safety appointments.’”
“Now, knowing that there are other [cases] that are non-safety but still urgent,” continued Piperni, “we are looking to see how we can adjust the model to try and accommodate. So we’re looking at adding urgent appointments that would be same-day or next-day.”
“We’re looking at maybe inserting a new resource, like a social worker or a nurse who could deal with just the documentation things that people need, but the reality is that medical notes is a systemic issue,” she added.
Piperni assured The Daily that she and the other staff members working on implementing the stepped care system of mental healthcare were fully cognizant of the urgency of this issue. Consultation with Sobat and Patterson, other student leaders, peer support providers, and people with lived experiences of interacting with the new system will be carried out in the next couple of weeks, she explained, and adjustments based on their feedback will be implemented as soon as possible.
Piperni also mentioned that during the Fall 2016 final exam season, a pilot project will be underway across most McGill faculties which will allow students to defer an exam without medical documentation, if it is the first deferral of their current degree program. This should lessen the number of people needing urgent appointments at MMHS and Counselling.

Organizers call for recognizing studying as a form of labour
On the evening of November 2, roughly a hundred students gathered in Victoria Square to rally for the recognition of student work as part of a national Student Day of Action.
In other provinces, this Day of Action was organized by the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), but CFS doesn’t have any members in Quebec. In Montreal, the demonstration was organized by various individuals at local universities, and by the Campagne sur le travail étudiant (CUTE), or Campaign on Student Work in English. Working in conjunction with McGill Against Austerity, David Aird, the VP External of the Students’ Society of McGill University, organized a McGill contingent to the event, which was comprised roughly of 25 people.
The demonstration began with a rally in Victoria Square. Addressing the crowd, CUTE members delivered speeches in favour of recognizing studying as a form of labour that contributes to society and, as such, should be subsidized and even remunerated by the state.
Officers of the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) were present, but refrained from interfering with the protest.
In an interview with The Daily, John Hutton, a recent graduate from Dalhousie University who attended the demonstration, argued that “education should be accessible to everybody regardless of ability to pay.”
“Education should be seen as a public service. It’s something that should be done in the interest of society, and not just to produce some educated workers for the companies that buy the university,” he said.
“Students, […] if they are going into their first year, don’t know what they’re going to take. They can’t actually afford to take a class that might not work out, they can’t afford to fail. If it’s $800 per class, you can’t afford to try out something, you have to get it right the first try. It doesn’t always work that way, especially when you’re seventeen, eighteen.”
Hutton also commented on the Liberal government’s new measures to assist postsecondary students with student debt in the 2016 federal budget. According to Employment and Social Development Canada, graduates may defer repayment until their income reaches $25,000, effective starting November 1.
The Liberal government has also introduced a Repayment Assistance program for graduates having difficulty with repayment, but Hutton said this is “a headline, it’s not a real policy.”
“Poverty is not the solution to student debt,” said Hutton. “Abolishing student debt is the solution to student debt.”
Thierry Beauvais-Gentile, another attendee, told The Daily, “Right now there is a big fight for [a 15 dollar minimum wage] going on, so it would be great if that could apply to students as well […]. As long as we are not understood as doing work [by studying], we’re basically getting exploited.”
“There is the old saying of equal work, equal pay, and I think that should apply. […] That means equal advantages for international students, women, and other populations that are affected by this.”
Amelie Poirier, a CUTE member and a l’Université de Quebec à Montréal student, shared Gentile’s sentiments regarding systemic misogyny, speaking in both English and French: “It’s the women programs where the internships aren’t paid like infirmary, social workers, sociologists, all the people around health. […] But people in law schools are paid, engineering too, which is [traditionally thought to be a] more masculine program.”
Poirier told The Daily that the march was a “feminist campaign” and that “so far it’s been women who feel more concerned about our campaign.”
“Our principle [is] for the recognition of student work, in part for paid internship and at large and student salary. […] I think students are autonomous from the moment they leave their parents’ house and they should be recognized as is,” she concluded.
After the event at Victoria Square, the group marched to McGill’s Community Square, in order to join the rally taking place in support of the striking Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE).

 Council supports Quebec Public Interest Research Group-McGill
On Wednesday, November 2, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Council gathered for the Legislative Council meeting during which they discussed a proposed motion to change the Chair of the Arts Internship Advisory Committee, amendments to the AUS Annual Budget, the approval of ad hoc allocations from the Arts Student Employment Fund, support for the continued existence of the McGill chapter of the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG), and Committee reports.
AUS VP Finance Deepak Punjabi presented the annual budget for approval by the Council. This year, questions arose concerning a budget item allocating $592.12 to the purchase of AUS executive hoodies.
World Islamic and Middle East Studies Student Association VP External and former editor at The Daily Niyousha Bastani voiced concern that this was not an appropriate use of AUS resources. She proposed an amendment saying, “I would like [the budget] to be approved but with the budget towards exec sweaters being moved to the Equity Committee […]. It doesn’t really make sense to me why our money would be used for exec sweaters.”
This led to a debate on the discrepancy between the inadequate budget for certain committees, such as the Equity Committee (which was only allocated $300 for the year), and the funds allocated for items such as the executive hoodies.
AUS President Becky Goldberg defended the budget, saying, “the reason that the Equity number is so low is because it was taken from the budget from last year which was […] $700 […]. Less than $300 of that original allocation was used that year.”
AUS Equity Commissioner Jad El Tal responded, “what we’re concerned about is that it’s not that the number is low […] but because the other number is so high. For AUS swag, six hundred dollars, that’s double our budget.”
AUS VP Internal Kira Smith voiced her concern given that the debate was pitting executive sweaters against funding for the Equity committee, saying, “AUSec [AUS McGill Environmental Council], for example, has $350 and we would really like more money too, so while Equity is important there are tons of important causes that we could be giving the money to.”
This led to further debate concerning the Equity Committee’s lack of funding. The issue was resolved by a final amendment to the budget: a clause adding $200 to the Equity Budget. This funding will be diverted from the overall AUS surplus, initially proposed to be $21,617.64.
QPIRG-McGill is described on its website as “a non-profit, student-run organization that conducts research, education, and action on environmental and social justices” at McGill and in Montreal. This organization is largely funded by a five dollar opt-outable student fee.
While discussing the motion to endorse QPIRG-McGill’s continued existence, the fee’s opt-outable nature became a subject of debate.
Political Science Students’ Association (PSSA) President Tofunmi Odugbemi said that “the automatic fee takes advantage of lack of information and student disengagement. With the automatic fee QPIRG is in a position where the less students know about the organization the more income they receive. Making QPIRG membership non-automatic would make QPIRG accountable to its members.”
“A large portion [of QPIRG funding] actually goes to groups outside of McGill or to organizations outside which may be considered by some to be more radical and not representative of the majority of McGill students,” she continued.
In contrast, AUS VP Social Kat Sviknushin argued, “you not knowing where your student fees go sounds like a ‘you’ problem, not a ‘QPIRG’ problem […] QPIRG taking money from you and you not knowing how to opt out is actually not what we’re debating here. […] You cannot speak to the people whose lives its literally changed.”
Odugbemi responded that “as a visible minority I do not appreciate us sitting in this room right now and saying ‘the people we are helping, yada yada yada.’ […] I would just like to look at it as a facts thing […] My understanding is if the automatic fee is removed it doesn’t result in the dismantling of QPIRG, that they will still exist as an organization.”
The Council decided to amend the motion whereby “AUS include[s] conditions of the fee and that it is opt-outable,” and which stipulated that AUS publicize the endorsement. The motion then passed.

Council changes Faculty of Engineering senator elections
On Thursday, November 3, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council convened for its fifth meeting of the 2016-2017 academic year.
Councilors heard a presentation from VP External David Aird on the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ), one of Quebec’s main student federations, along with five reports from SSMU committees and three councilor reports.
Four motions were passed, including a motion to endorse an existence referendum for the McGill chapter of the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG), a motion regarding the election of student senators from the Faculty of Engineering, a motion concerning Board of Directors (BoD) seating allocations, and a motion which aimed to create a “Democratic Governance Review Committee.”
Julie Skarha, a representative from QPIRG, came to Council to provide reasons in favour of SSMU passing a motion endorsing the group’s upcoming existence referendum. Incorporated at McGill in 1989, the group’s mandate “is to conduct research, education, and action at McGill and in the Montreal community on environmental and social justice issues,” according to the respective motion, and “provides resources and funding to students and community groups.”
McGill undergraduate students currently pay a five dollar opt-outable fee to support QPIRG. The motion saw no debate and Council passed the motion with 87 per cent in favour and 13 per cent abstaining.
A motion was brought forward to Council regarding how student senators from the Faculty of Engineering are elected. Currently, more engineering students vote in the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) Executive Elections than SSMU elections, which seems to indicate a growing indifference for SSMU elections within the Faculty of Engineering.
The motion put forward would “concurrently [hold] the election of the Engineering Senator alongside the election of faculty-level association council members,” effectively placing the election of a Senate representative under the auspices of EUS, instead of SSMU, in accordance with SSMU’s Internal Regulations of Representation and Advocacy.
Engineering representative Richard (Tre) Mansdoerfer argued that the adoption of the motion would hopefully increase the number of interested candidates and voter turnout for the Senator position.
Senate Caucus representative Joshua Chin noted that this may become “more of the norm rather than the exception” in the future if other faculties choose to do the same, and asked if this could be revisited in the future.
VP University Affairs Erin Sobat responded that he was happy to look into this later, but asserted that it was each faculty’s prerogative to do the same as the Faculty of Engineering. He added that it is SSMU’s responsibility to fill these Senate seats, and delegating the task to faculties is a valid option. He noted that a higher level of institutionalized communication between SSMU and faculties would be helpful.
The motion passed with 91 per cent in favour, four per cent opposed, and four per cent abstaining.
A motion was brought forward regarding the “creation of an ad hoc Democratic Governance Review Committee.”
SSMU increased the BoD’s responsibilities last April. The motion raised concerns about the fact that the BoD, the highest governing body within SSMU, is not required to address Council or the General Assembly. The BoD is also not required to hold meetings at publicly available times, or make the minutes of its meetings public.
“The democratic legitimacy of the BoD depends on the transparency of its procedures and dimensions,” reads the motion. The proposed committee would review the overall role and mechanisms of the BoD, all the while aiming to “identify and propose changes to address any inconsistencies, ambiguities and omissions in the Constitution and Internal Regulations [regarding the BoD] that lie within the scope of the Committee’s mandate.”
SSMU President Ben Ger, speaking in favour of the motion, said, “As someone who is currently sitting on the Board, I am yet to be convinced that it is a perfect body for what was envisioned in terms of the division of labor [between Council and the BoD].”
“This motion is far from questioning the existence of the Board,” said Arts representative and former editor at The Daily, Igor Sadikov.
Chin, who was added as a mover of the motion during debate, also spoke in favour of the committee, specifically with regards to the division of labour between the BoD and Council.
“I’ve had this concern for quite some time now, that there is potential that […] the Board could be used to push contentious issues or debate on higher level and bypass [SSMU Council],” he said. “Who makes the decision with regards to where motions, debates, or discussions get presented, here [at Council] or at the Board?”
“That division is not properly outlined to some extent,” Ger. said “There are matters where the Board ends up dealing with something that could foreseeably be seen as a political matter, because it is tangled with something that is legal, so there definitely is room to further define what [goes to Council and what goes to BoD].”
Sobat also spoke in favour of the motion, saying the BoD was important for reducing Council’s administrative overhead, but acknowledging there are inconsistencies in SSMU’s governing documents about the BoD.
“The [SSMU] constitution gives members of Council and the Board power to put forward referendum questions, but the appropriate relations of elections right now only apply to council and members, so there’s effectively no regulations on the BoD because of that, […] which is something that was missed.”
The motion was split in two, with councilors first voting on whether the committee should exist, and then appointing councilors to sit on it.
The motion passed with 88 per cent in favour and 12 per cent abstaining. Councillors appointed to the Committee included Sadikov, First Year Council representative Kevin Zhou, Clubs Representative Adam Templer, and Residences Representative Olivia Shi.
