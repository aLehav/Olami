Councillors vote to close second tax account
The Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) has been filing taxes under two separate accounts for the last several years, it was revealed at a council meeting last Wednesday.
According to a motion filed by VP Finance Elaine Xie, the second account was opened by a predecessor, who acted under the assumption that SUS had “lost its corporate status.”
Xie’s motion, which passed unanimously, sought to close the second account and return to using the first tax account.
Although Xie was not present at the meeting, SUS President Joanna Xu explained that the society’s accountants had been using one account, while Xie had been using another.
The motion brought the society into compliance with Quebec tax law.
Science Senator Moe Nasr sought to delay proceedings, however, by initiating an open debate among councillors about what he argued was “financial negligence.”
After the motion dissolved the second tax account, councillors debated whether or not to set up a provisional independent student inquiry into the SUS executive, as advocated by Nasr.
Many councillors declined, citing the lack of a clear mandate for such a committee. Executives encouraged Nasr to bring up a more detailed motion at the next council, on January 30.
In an interview with The Daily, Xu said that she would theoretically support such a committee for financial oversight, but disagreed with Nasr’s characterization of financial negligence.
“The [external] accountants didn’t catch it,” she said, referring to the duplicate tax account.

East Asian Studies professor points to challenges faced by area studies
The Korea Foundation, a charitable organization owned by the government of South Korea, has pledged $1 million for the establishment of a Korean Studies chair in the Department of East Asian Studies.
This will be the first time that the University has a tenure-track position in Korean Studies, according to Robin D.S. Yates, the Chair of the East Asian Studies Department.
According to its website, the foundation seeks to “broaden understanding of Korea among the peoples in the global society” and describes itself as the nation’s “foremost institution to advance Korea’s public diplomacy interests through global communication.” 
The Department of East Asian Studies has been working with the foundation for over twenty years trying to “develop [McGill’s] Korean language program and Korean studies program,” according to Yates.
Despite its ties to the South Korean government, Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi told The Daily in an email that while “the University will keep the Foundation informed of the process of selecting the Professor,” all decisions will be made by “the University in its sole discretion, in keeping with its academic mission, and its policies and practices, with vigilant protection of speech and academic freedom.”
Last year the University raised more than $84 million in gifts and pledges: 73 per cent from individuals, 18 per cent from foundations and 9 per cent from corporations, according to Vice-Principal (Development and Alumni Relations) Marc Weinstein.
“Philanthropic gifts to the University reflect an intersection of donors’ interests and the University’s priorities,” Weinstein told The Daily. “Fundraisers are assigned to every Faculty of the University, and work diligently to secure gifts from alumni and friends to support areas of academic priority.”
In an interview with The Daily, Thomas Lamarre, a professor in East Asian Studies Department, highlighted some of the difficulties faced by “area programs” such as East Asian Studies and African Studies.
Since program budgets have to be maintained in order to keep a permanent staff, the “politics of funding different programs often happen around hiring: what program gets new hires or is allowed to rehire after retirements,” Lamarre said. 
The dean and upper administration determine those priorities. 
“Obviously every program feels underfunded, and funds will probably get tighter,” Lamarre said, but area studies or non-western studies tend “to receive less funding and generally fewer new hires.”

AGSEM protests cuts in positions
Correction appended Jan 21, 2013.
Union members walked out of a meeting with senior administrators and other campus unions in protest of planned cuts  to course lecturer positions.
The administration had called the meeting to discuss the provincial’s government’s announcement of budget cuts for universities.
Representatives from campus unions such as the McGill University Association of Support Employees (AMUSE),  non-academic workers at McGill (MUNACA), as well as Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa were in attendance. The meeting, held in Sherbrooke 688, was a follow-up to another gathering held in December to which campus union presidents were invited.
Di Grappa began by speaking about a meeting between the principals of Quebec universities and the provincial government last week.
According to Di Grappa, the University received the news that the cuts are continuing. The cuts to the operating budget will come to around $20 million for the fiscal year of 2014, which begins on May 1, 2013.
Course Lecturer Unit Chair Raad Jassim responded to Di Grappa’s statement by calling for a bottom-up approach to complying with the mandated provincial budget cuts.
“You’re inviting us to a consultation, but actually we have noticed that course lecturers’ jobs are being cut as we speak, they have been announced in a few areas,” Jassim said at the meeting.
Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi announced that 100 small classes will be eliminated, allowing full-time facutly members to teach classes currently taught by course lecturers.
“We are feeling that this is not a consultation, this is a consultation on the surface… I’m protesting this action, and will ask all my team to stand up and come with me,” he said before leaving the room.
Following Jassim’s statement, seven AGSEM members – representing each of the union’s units – and AGSEM President Lilian Radovac walked out of the meeting.
AGSEM is composed of three different units representing course lecturers, teaching assistants, and invigilators.
AGSEM Communications Officer Stefana Lamasanu told The Daily that they were “pleased with the way they walked in and rejected the cuts.”
“We also made them know that if they are serious about it, they can contact us. But we are not going to pretend to negotiate, we are not going to pretend to engage in confronting when this just a re-packaged control measure,” said Lamasanu.
“We’re not going to sit by and allow this excuse to undermine what we’re bargaining for our members, job security, and course allocations. These things can be affected by the budget cuts, if we let it happen, so we’re not going to sit by idly,” she added.
According to Lamasanu the negotiations for a collective agreement between course lecturers and the University will continue as previously planned.
Di Grappa told The Daily in an email that he thought it was “a productive meeting.”
“I was able to exchange with those present some fairly recent information we’ve received from the government about its firm intention to seek more budget compressions from universities in the future,” he said. 
In order to deal effectively with these circumstances, we need to work co-operatively. We agreed to meet again, either at the end of February or during the second week of March.”
An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Raad Jassim as AGSEM Course Lecturer Unit President. In fact, he is the Course Lecturer Unit Chair.

Demonstrations held across Canada
Under last Wednesday night’s overcast sky, approximately 200 demonstrators gathered at Place Émilie-Gamelin as part of a series of nationwide actions linked with the Idle No More movement. The protest, which set off at 7:30 p.m., wound its way north on Berri and St. Denis before heading south, against traffic, on St. Laurent.
Indigenous activists have been fighting for the repeal of omnibus Bill C-45, stronger environmental protections, and the safeguarding of Indigenous land rights since December, when Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence began a hunger strike on Victoria Island in Ottawa. 
Fireworks were fired into the air, and chants of “Stop destroying Mother Earth. Settlers: Wake Up!” and “Anti-Colonialist!” were heard during the rally. The march was deemed illegal by the SPVM at the outset, as the police had not been notified of the itinerary, though no arrests were made. Police presence was minimal throughout.
Disruptions took place simultaneously across Canada, blocking trains between Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, and slowing traffic over the Ambassador Bridge – a key trade route for trucks between the U.S. and Canada.
Mateo Du Pekuakami, an Innu protester from Lac Saint-Jean, who gave a speech when the protest returned to Place Émilie-Gamelin at around 8:45 p.m., told The Daily that he was happy with the turnout.
“We are here in support of Theresa Spence, we also support Aniesh Vollant and Jeannette Pilot, two other Innus who are undertaking a hunger strike,” he said. “When you have women who are ready to give their lives, we can’t stay inactive.”
Spence has been on a hunger strike with the goal of obtaining a meeting between Stephen Harper, Governor General David Johnston, and Aboriginal leaders. Vollant and Pilot – Innu women from Côte-Nord – have been hunger striking in solidarity since December 31.
Standing behind a large purple banner that read “Decolonize,” Jane, who did not want to provide her last name, told The Daily in French: “The Idle No More movement needs to be pushed further. It’s about something more profound than the recent bills passed by the government. It’s been 400 years that Natives have been fighting against this government.”
A Facebook event promoting the demonstration was taken down on Tuesday. In an email to organizers, Facebook wrote that the original event violated the website’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. Du Pekuakami, who later created a new Facebook event page, told The Daily that the original page had been created with a fake account, and that someone had probably informed Facebook of this.
