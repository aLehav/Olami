Salary freeze among concerns for health workers
Several Quebec public sector employee unions are expected to start a series of rotating strike days starting October 26. Teachers, health workers, and the province’s two largest labour federations are getting ready to hold demonstrations across the province at the start of this week if no serious progress is made during the ongoing negotiations.
The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), which represents over 325,000 workers and the Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ), representing more than 130,000 members, voted overwhelmingly in favour of holding a strike earlier in the month. This mobilization comes in the aftermath of a series of failed contract negotiations and cutbacks with the provincial government. The rotating strikes are expected to start in the Laurentides on October 26 and finish in Montreal and Laval on November 16 and 17.
The Front commun, a coalition of public sector unions, is also expected to hold three consecutive days of striking from December 1 to 3, across the health and education sectors. According to a press release on the Front commun website, almost a year has passed since the union filed its demands and negotiations with the government started.
The unions’ main concerns include a two-year salary freeze, followed by a salary raise of 1 per cent over the next three years, and the raising of the retirement age from 60 to 62. Other concerns are job insecurity, setbacks in the working conditions, the transition of services towards the private sectors, in accessibility of public services, and the loss of professional autonomy for employees in the public sector.
Speaking to The Daily, Maxime Clément, the press officer of the Secrétariat intersyndical des services publics (SISP), expressed frustration with the current offers. “The offers on the table right now are just unacceptable, […] in five years the [salary] would have an increase of 2 per cent, which is way below the life cost increase.”
“With all the workers who are retiring [in] the next year, we must be able to attract [a] qualified workforce. With salaries like that it will be really tough for the public sector to recruit in the next years.”
“With all the workers who are retiring [in] the next year, we must be able to attract [a] qualified workforce. With salaries like that it will be really tough for the public sector to recruit in the next years,” Clément added.
The Fédération autonome de l’enseignement (FAE), a union that represents over 34,000 French-language teachers across the province, which has already been on a one-day strike on September 30, has also voted in favour of a strike following a work-to-rule mandate earlier in the year. It will be holding three consecutive strike days on October 26, 27 and 28, and the intended strike action will coincide with the labour federation’s first days of striking.
FAE’s main concerns include the proposed increase in teacher-student ratios, the elimination of funds toward special needs children’s services, the removal of 800 special education and resource-teacher jobs, a two-year salary freeze, and cuts to the employee pension plans. The Quebec French-language teachers have been negotiating without a contract since April 2014.
The Montreal Teachers Association (MTA), which represents all the teachers working for the English Montreal School Board, will be holding strike days as well.
“We have a strike day in the [English Montreal School Board (EMSB)] for teachers on October 29, and we have two more scheduled for November 16 and 17 […] assuming we need them,” MTA President Peter Sutherland told The Daily. “If the negotiations still don’t get settled, we could be on strike December 1, 2, and 3,” he added.
“If the negotiations still don’t get settled, we could be on strike December 1, 2, and 3.”
The English-language teachers of Quebec have similar concerns as those represented by the FAE. According to Sutherland, the Quebec government initially proposed removing the practice of having smaller class sizes when classes included children with special needs.
“For example, when they [were forming] a class they [took] into account the students in that class with special needs,” Sutherland said. “If there were many [children with special needs,] then the class didn’t have as many students in it. Initially [the government] wanted to remove all that.”
“We’ve been attending a lot of the meetings that the [university sector unions have] been having […] as well as lending our support discursively,” said Molly Swain, president of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE).
Quebec’s labour federations have promised further disruption if the provincial government refuses to negotiate. The CSQ has also released a statement notifying that the series of strikes is part of the first phase and further scenarios will be considered if the negotiators have not found an agreeable settlement by November 9.

Friends and family call for objectivity in police force
On October 22, the U.S. National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation, over a hundred people gathered outside the Fraternité des policiers et policières de Montréal (FPPM) building to commemorate those killed as a direct result of police violence. The event was organized by Montreal-based group Justice for the Victims of Police Killings, which is comprised of the families and friends of Anas Bennis, Claudio Castagnetta, Ben Matson, Jean-François Nadreau, Quilem Registre, Gladys Tolley, and Fredy Villanueva, seven individuals who were subject to police brutality in Canada.
Various protests were coordinated throughout the U.S. by the October 22 Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. The coalition has been mobilizing every year since 1996 and serves to remember those who have been victims of violence at the hands of police.
Since 1987, when a teenager named Anthony Griffin was killed in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG) by police, Montreal has witnessed the deaths of more than sixty people as a result of police violence. The vigil aimed to address all instances of police brutality in Montreal and elsewhere, but focused specifically on the victims whose friends and families were present.
Outside of Laurier metro station, the doors of the FPPM building were lined by police officers. Attendees joined the candlelight vigil to stand in solidarity with the families and friends of the victims.
“It’s sad that this happens every day, that it’s happening somewhere right now.”
Members of organisations such as the Collective Opposed to Police Brutality (COBP), the Coalition Contre la répression et les abus policiers, Solidarity Across Borders (SAB), Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) Concordia, Montréal-Nord Républik, and Insurgent Projections were also present at the vigil.
A musician who wished to remain anonymous expressed how it is “important to remember unjust violence targeting, killing people who are marginalized [already.]” This message was echoed by the participants through speeches and spoken word pieces as the demonstration progressed.
Julia Matson, the daughter of Ben Matson, who was beaten to death after a minor confrontation with an off-duty police officer over a parking spot in Vancouver, was one of several who spoke against widespread police violence. She noted, “It’s sad that this happens every day, that it’s happening somewhere right now.”
The gathering then turned from a memorial to a direct call for action. One of the speakers, Bridget Tolley, confronted the police, who were present at the vigil, demanding further investigation into the death of her mother. Her mother, Gladys Tolley, was a 61-year-old Algonquin woman who was killed in 2001 by a Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police cruiser on the highway on the Kitigan Zibi reserve where she lived.
At the protest, Bridget Tolley called for government action, saying, “My family still has so many unanswered questions.” Tolley noted that the investigator for the case was the brother of the police officer in question, stating that this was a direct conflict of interest within the police force, and called for greater police objectivity.
“The police are a [unit], a brotherhood, and I speak out to undo that in some way.”
An anonymous speaker at the event echoed Tolley’s point about the lack of objectivity within the police force, saying, “The police are a [unit], a brotherhood, and I speak out to undo that in some way.”
Following Tolley’s call for action, ideas about the de-escalation of violence were raised. One attendee spoke about the shortcomings of the police education system.
The attendee, who had filed access to information (ATI) requests, argued that the bulk of police education is completed in CEGEP, but two of the largest CEGEPs (Ahuntisc and Maisonneuve) do not include training for crisis de-escalation at any point in their programs. The result, the attendee said, is police being called in to respond to situations they were never trained for.
Another speaker shared the story of a friend who was killed on his front lawn by police after the police overreacted to a complaint of noise and suspicious behaviour. The speaker alleged that the police were not adequately trained to de-escalate the conflict, resulting in the man’s death.
The organisers emphasized the importance of remembering these people and sharing their stories so that their deaths were not in vain.
As Matson seeks to build and strengthen the community of supporters that already exists in Montreal and raise awareness on these issues, she asked those present at the vigil to “remember those who have been killed in these really intense ways, support one another, and love one another.”

Calls for immediate freeze in investments during deliberations
On October 22, members of Divest McGill gave a presentation to McGill’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR). In its presentation, Divest McGill reminded the committee of its demand that McGill put an immediate freeze on its investments in the fossil fuel industry.
In an email to The Daily, McGill’s Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet explained that CAMSR meetings are not normally open to the public because “confidentiality of deliberations is essential to the presentation of diverse points of view, full and frank discussion, and arriving at a consensus [and] decision.”
However, members of Divest McGill were able to convince CAMSR to let observers and members of the press into this meeting. As such, in addition to the 15 members of Divest McGill who were officially recognized by CAMSR, around 17 observers were present at the meeting.
Speaking to CAMSR, Chloé Laflamme, an organizer with Divest McGill, explained that freezing the investments now would allow CAMSR to demonstrate that it is taking deliberations on divesting on the grounds of social injury seriously.
“CAMSR would also be protecting the university from additional reputational and financial risk, while taking the time to come to a meaningful decision on this very important ethical question.”
“A freeze is a show of good faith and also follows a precautionary principle in that we stop further investment [in] the fossil fuel industry during the deliberations,” Laflamme said. “In doing so, CAMSR would also be protecting the university from additional reputational and financial risk, while taking the time to come to a meaningful decision on this very important ethical question.”
“I do want to highlight that we do understand that […] there is a certain time frame needed when making a decision as important as this one – and we have been patient for nearly three years,” Laflamme continued.
In their presentation, members of Divest McGill talked about the global divestment movement and gave updates on recent examples of campus activism with regards to divestment.
One of the most recent examples was Fossil Free Week, organized by Divest McGill from September 21 to 25. Julianna Duholke, a recent McGill graduate and another organizer with Divest McGill, recalled that members of the administration failed to attend the many events.
Duholke addressed CAMSR, “our administration was notably absent from [Fossil Free Week]. You’ve repeatedly said that you need more information to make a decision, and we had this week right outside of your door and none of you came.” Duholke directed her comments at Principal Suzanne Fortier in particular, who, according to Duholke, had said that she looked at her window and “saw nothing going on.”
“Our administration was notably absent from [Fossil Free Week]. You’ve repeatedly said that you need more information to make a decision, and we had this week right outside of your door and none of you came.”
Fortier responded to Duholke, saying “I was told there was an event, and so I did look to see when the event was occurring. […] I checked several times and did not see. So, maybe it was postponed or it was before, or maybe I misunderstood. But I did check several times.”
“Right outside your windows, outside your doors, we had frontline speakers, Indigenous organizers, who’ve been really on the frontline of this movement. Their communities have felt the effects of fossil fuel industries the most,” Duholke responded. “We had the privilege of getting these stories first-hand outside of your building and not seeing anyone there was hard to swallow, frankly.”
Ellen Gillies, another member of Divest McGill at the presentation, talked about McGill Alumni for Divestment, some members of which have pledged not to donate to the university until McGill divests from the fossil fuel industry. In addition, some alumni have pledged to return their diplomas if McGill does not commit to divestment by March 30, 2016.
Following the presentation, members of Divest McGill asked CAMSR what specific steps it has taken to determine whether or not there is social injury in investing in the fossil fuel industry and what CAMSR’s timeline would be in reaching a decision.
CAMSR Chair Stuart “Kip” Cobbett said that the committee was “working hard at it.”
“We have had four meetings, five meetings, six meetings, to discuss, to reflect on the petition. […] We have consulted a number of well-respected and leading scholars in environmental, […] engineering, and social sciences fields to get additional information,” Cobbett added.
Speaking to The Daily after the meeting, Dave Clark, a McGill alumnus, said that he was not convinced that the issue is being considered seriously enough.
“I was concerned by one or two of the responses by [CAMSR]. For example, they mentioned that they were going to some other sources to get information about whether, in fact, investment [in the] fossil fuel industry constitutes social injury,” Clark said. “They mentioned […] other sources, but they were very reticent to actually say what these other sources are or if in fact they would be willing to share that information afterwards.”
Cobbett expressed that there is no definite timeline. “I would expect, however, I would certainly hope – and I hope I can move that hope to an expectation – we will have a decision by early next year. Certainly by the March 30 deadline. […] This is not a drop-dead deadline, because stuff happens.”
Joey Broda, a U4 Chemical Engineering student and a member of Divest McGill, said, “The thing that’s kind of been disappointing for us for the last while has been that we have these discussions – we had a discussion in February, and again in May, and now we’re having one in October. It’s been taking a long time.”

Student-driven mental health initiatives seek more institutional support
Last week marked McGill’s second annual Mental Health Awareness Week. Spanning from October 15 to 23, the event series was organized by the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) in conjunction with the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), the university administration, and various student groups.
The events included everything from workshops and speakers on different mental illnesses to therapy dog sessions to group painting exercises. The week was meant to continue a dialogue about mental health on campus and reduce the stigma that surrounds mental illness.
According to SSMU VP University Affairs Chloe Rourke, mental health initiatives are critical for universities, especially ones as academically demanding as McGill.
“Mental illness is quite prevalent on university campuses [with surveys showing] that over 50 per cent of students report symptoms of anxiety or overwhelming anxiety. […] Also, a very high percentage report depression, and even suicidality is over 10 per cent,” Rourke told The Daily.
“It was hard to push through, but my case was not incredibly severe and I was able to manage it enough. I don’t know how anyone else does it, though.”
“In terms of the unique culture at McGill, when I talk to students about it, they cite it as the competitiveness, the intensity of McGill’s curriculum – it doesn’t leave a lot of room for good mental health and healthy habits. That’s something that we need to internally reflect on and see how we can address it.”
As part of Mental Health Awareness Week, Healthy McGill and McGill Mental Health Services (MMHS) held a question-and-answer session with MMHS Clinical Director Nancy Low on Friday. According to Low, the demand for mental health services at McGill is high.
At the session, Low told the group, “Of around 40,000 students, about one in ten come in [to MMHS].”
This high demand has implications for how quickly students can access care. In an interview with The Daily, one U2 Psychology student, who wished to remain anonymous, recalled that after their initial intake appointment at MMHS in November 2014, they were unable to begin therapy until April.
“It was hard to push through, but my case was not incredibly severe and I was able to manage it enough. I don’t know how anyone else does it, though,” said the student.
According to Low, this is not abnormal. “If you went in [to MMHS] in November, you were probably not seen that year. Which is really disappointing and discouraging,” she said. Low added that to address the waitlist at MMHS, which currently numbers 105 people or a roughly three-month wait, they are providing more group therapy options, with the hope that this change could cut the wait list in half.
The scope of Mental Health Awareness Week went beyond mental health services specific to McGill. According to Rourke, one of the goals of the week was to give students tools that can empower them to seek help.
Speaking to The Daily, Rourke said, “We want to destigmatize mental illness. We want to say ‘It’s okay to not be okay sometimes.’ We want to encourage help-seeking behaviour. We want to validate […] the huge number of students [who] are struggling, and tell them that they’re not alone.”
Rourke added that the student-driven aspect of initiatives like Mental Health Awareness Week is important, and that these projects can have an institutional impact on McGill.
“Students have always pushed the administration on issues we care about. […] I think that if you look back historically, after this [kind of] continued advocacy, the administration does respond.”
“The one way that I’d strongly advocate for the University to step up a bit more is in the provision of resources to support [student-driven mental health] initiatives,” said Rourke. “The funding for these initiatives, and the human resources [required] should not unfairly and unduly burden students.”

Critically acclaimed writer comes to Montreal
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd at the Ukrainian Federation Hall in Montreal’s Mile End on the night of October 22, critically acclaimed writer Roxane Gay discussed her recent work and the challenges she has faced as a queer woman of colour who routinely speaks out about race, gender, and identity politics. The conversation was facilitated by activist and McGill Education PhD candidate Rachel Zellars, and formed part of a series of events organized by the bookstore Drawn & Quarterly.
Growing up in Nebraska as the child of Haitian immigrants, with “a foot in three different worlds,” Gay was forced to navigate complex questions of identity starting at a young age.
“I think that’s what contributes to a lot of my ability to consider issues with nuance,” she explained. “I was American, I was Haitian, I was Black American, and I had to straddle all these identities at once, and so that taught me to see multiple sides of an issue.”
“I think one of the biggest challenges we face in contemporary discourse is that no one’s interested in nuance. […] We don’t acknowledge that people who disagree with us might, once in a while, have some merit to their arguments. We have to listen to the other side, and we have to acknowledge the grey areas.”
Gay explores these “grey areas” in her collection of essays Bad Feminist: her conflicted feelings about enjoying misogynistic hip hop; her profound admiration of her mother, who chose to stay at home and raise her and her siblings rather than pursuing a career; and her continuing fondness for the problematic teen romances she enjoyed growing up.
“I think that’s what contributes to a lot of my ability to consider issues with nuance,” she explained. “I was American, I was Haitian, I was Black American, and I had to straddle all these identities at once, and so that taught me to see multiple sides of an issue.”
Gay’s habit of approaching controversial subjects with nuance has drawn both criticism and widespread acclaim from across the political spectrum, and she spoke at length about the challenges of having her writings subjected to increasing media scrutiny.
“It’s really hard to be able to receive criticism. And I think [as] women, we’re criticized about everything, all the time. We’re criticized about how we look, and how we walk, and how we talk, and what we wear, and so when you deal with a culture where you’re constantly being criticized and evaluated based on your appearance and then your intellect, it becomes really hard to hear criticism of any kind.”
Zellars asked Gay about how she feels about being called an angry Black woman when she exists in predominantly white spaces.
Gay said, “One thing I’ve learned to do is embrace anger, and say that given the difficulties and […] the injustices of this world, and the way Black women have been subjugated and continue to be subjugated, anger is a perfectly reasonable response.”
“You need to call people on that – ‘why do you read anger in me because of my Blackness?’ […] That’s their fear. When they say that, they’re trying to shut you down. They’re trying to say, ‘don’t make me uncomfortable,’ and that’s not your problem.”
Despite such criticisms, Gay continues to address issues of systemic inequality in her work. In the wake of the police shooting of Samuel DuBose, an unarmed Black man, at a Cincinnati traffic stop on July 19, Gay penned an article for the New York Times highlighting the vast discrepancy between the relatively subdued public reaction to his murder and the international outpouring of grief triggered by the killing of Cecil the lion. A second piece for the Times reflected on Sandra Bland’s death in police custody that same month.
The articles provoked a storm of negative comments, but Gay said she has learned to rise above them, and not to “read things that aren’t going to help me become a better writer or thinker.”
“A lot of people felt like – in my piece about Cecil and Samuel – I was saying we couldn’t care [about] both, and that means they didn’t read what I wrote,” she said. “But we had more cultural empathy for the lion than we did for the man. And I think that’s a problem.”
Gay confronts violence against women in many of her works. In Bad Feminist, she describes her own experience of sexual assault as a young teenager, and her ongoing struggle to deal with the resulting trauma.
Prompted by Zellars, Gay also commented on why she writes about the violence faced by marginalized communities.
“I was compelled to write about Sandra Bland because all too often, when we talk about police misconduct and police violence, we talk about Black men. And, that’s understandable, and that conversation needs to happen, but we also need to talk about how Black women are equally subjected to violence from police. […] And when these inexplicable things happen, I want answers – and there are no answers to be found. But writing offers at least a sense of solace – a sense of trying to make sense of that which cannot be made sense of.”
“When we see violence in entertainment, it’s stylized. It’s readable, or it’s watchable. And I wanted to make it unreadable. I wanted to make it such that you had to put the book down.”
Zellars also asked Gay about her decision to use graphic depictions of violence in her debut novel, An Untamed State, about a Haitian expatriate who is abducted on a visit to Port-au-Prince and held hostage for 13 days while her father hesitates to pay her ransom. The novel was described by the Guardian as “an unflinching portrayal of sexual and spiritual violence.”
“When we see violence in entertainment, it’s stylized,” said Gay, discussing the novel. “It’s readable, or it’s watchable. And I wanted to make it unreadable. I wanted to make it such that you had to put the book down.”
The conversation between Gay and Zellars was followed by a question period that covered a range of issues, from the media’s objectification of women, to Gay’s experience of reconciling her bisexuality with the homophobia she describes as prevalent in Haitian culture. When the discussion drew to a close, many of those present lined up to have books signed.
In an email to The Daily, a U3 Education student who had attended the event expressed enthusiasm: “I appreciate her work in acknowledging the grey area between what is ‘problematic’ and ‘unproblematic,’ as it’s most definitely something I go through every day.” They added enthusiastically, “The voice she gave for queer women of colour (who are writers! That’s amazing to me also as a writer who is [a person of colour]!) and her work in education. It was also a joy to lend an ear to her experience being a Black Haitian-American.”
On her experience with writing Bad Feminist, Gay commented that “writing these essays was a way of just acknowledging my existence, that you just don’t see written about. All too often, the Black experience is […] limited to one very specific type of story, and I think that we have to broaden our cultural understanding of what it means to be Black.”

BRIEF
Correction appended on October 29.
Members of the McGill University Health Centre Employee Union (MUHCEU) are preparing to go on strike on October 29 as part of the public sector strikes organized by the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), with which the union is affiliated.
The MUHCEU represents more than 4,800 support staff at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC). Its collective agreement expired in March, and the union is currently seeking a 13.5 per cent wage increase over three years.
The MUHC relocated to the Glen site in Westmount in April after the new campus was built in a private-public partnership between the provincial government and a consortium of companies called the Groupe infrastructure santé McGill (GISM), headed by the company SNC-Lavalin. Since the campus’ opening, MUHCEU has been negotiating with the provincial government over pay disparities, and inadequate facility maintenance.
Chronic sewage backups at the Glen site led to an investigation in September 2015, which revealed that the piping laid by SNC-Lavalin was built at an improper angle, and that latex gloves and newspapers had been flushed down employee toilets. SNC-Lavalin acknowledged the error and has sent workers to fix the issue with the angles. It is also demanding $172 million from MUHC for other services that were provided before April 2015, which it claims were not covered in the contract.
MUHCEU claims that, upon these discoveries, MUHC administration made allegations of sabotage, which the union has dismissed as mechanical failures on the part of SNC-Lavalin. As reported by the Montreal Gazette, these allegations surfaced just before the strike vote on September 29, which members of the union found insulting.
MUHC administration has denied that they have made such allegations.
In an email to The Daily in French, MUHCEU president Paul Thomas explained, “I believe that the investigations must continue to clearly establish the nature of the problem. Because the MUHC [was built as part of a private-public partnership], the responsibility must lie with the consortium.”
According to Thomas, if the provincial government does not take the negotiation seriously, strikes will continue on November 16 and 17, and December 1, 2, and 3.
Thomas emphasized the need for widespread awareness regarding the issues faced by MUHC employees.
“We face too much litigation and prosecution of labour relations. We need the MUHC to modernize and open [itself] to greater dialogue with the union, particularly with respect to the organization of labour,” Thomas continued.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Glen site is in West Island. In fact, it is in Westmount. It also incorrectly implied that the public-private consortium consisted of the provincial government and SNC-Lavalin. In fact, the consortium consists of multiple companies and the provincial government is not involved in it. It also implied that a sum of $172 million was demanded for incorrectly laid out pipes. In fact, it was demanded for other expenses prior to April 2015. In addition, the McGill University Health Centre Employee Union (MUHCEU) does not negotiate with the consortium or the hospital administration. In fact, it negotiates with the provincial government. The article further implied that the hospital administration made allegations of sabotage. In fact, it is MUHCEU’s belief that such allegations have surfaced, while the hospital administration denies this claim.
