Endorses DPS, opposes budget cuts
Last Wednesday, Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) councillors discussed motions about the opposition to Quebec’s budget cuts, the Daily Publications Society (DPS), accessible education, and opposition to war on Iran. 
Of the five motions on the agenda, only two were actually debated, as one was resigned, one was tabled until the next council meeting, and one was tabled indefinitely.  
The council meeting began with a presentation by Associate Dean (Academic Administration and Oversight) Gillian Lane-Mercier about a new initiative named “People, Processes, and Partnerships.” 
According to Lane-Mercier, the initiative aims to re-organize the administration to ensure that the Faculty provides the best possible services to students, faculty members, and each other. 
Due to a new ruling of the Parti Québécois (PQ) government, for every two administrative or general staff members that leave McGill, the University is allowed to hire only one. 
“It’s really difficult to find back-up people to fill striking staff members’ positions,” said Lane-Mercier, alluding to the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strike.  “Some managers turned out not to even know processes they were supposed to be doing,” Lane-Mercier told the councillors.
The administrative re-organization will be both physical and structural. In order to create a seamless experience for students, the Faculty of Arts is planning on creating hubs, whereby it will be easier for students to reach services such as advising. 
Lane-Mercier ended her presentation by emphasizing the amount of student input that is part of this initiative, and asked the AUS councillors to volunteer their support.
As part of her report on external affairs, SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser reported on SSMU’s projected involvement in the PQ government’s much anticipated education summit, slated to happen in February. 
McGill Environment Students’ Society representative Christian Elliott, and AUS VP External Brian Farnan moved the motion to oppose the provincial budget cuts required for McGill University, which passed with a single abstention and no votes against.
AUS VP Communications Yasmeen Gholmieh and AUS VP Finance Saad Qazi moved a motion to endorse a yes vote for the Daily Publications Society’s (DPS) existence referendum. The motion was passed. 
During deliberations, most councillors pointed out a previous article that was published and subsequently retracted by The Daily that openly attacked a member of the AUS council. “[The] thing about journalism is that they criticize, so we’ll take [the criticism],” Qazi said.  
In response to a suggestion of conditional endorsement, Arts senator James Gutman asked, “Is this the AUS or the Communist Party of China?” however he quickly retracted his statement.
The motion regarding the opposition of the war on Iran was tabled indefinitely, along with the motion on accessible education, which was tabled again until the next council meeting.

Province-wide union reps attend campus protest
The University will adopt a permanent set of operating procedures regarding demonstrations, despite statements to the contrary made just last week by VP (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa.
Anticipating this, campus unions staged a demonstration outside the James Administration building yesterday, two hours before the announcement was made at Senate.
A proposed protocol regulating campus demonstrations was withdrawn last week by the administration following a condemnation from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and growing attention from the Montreal press, though its provisional version remained in effect.
At the time, administration officials stated in an email to the community that “the McGill community will be best served by an agreed-upon statement of values and principles, rather than a protocol of operating procedures.”
“We’re not surprised. This is exactly why we proceeded with the demonstration we had today. We strongly suspected that the administration was still committed to some sort of protest management policy,” Lilian Radovac, the president of AGSEM-McGill’s Teaching Union, told The Daily. “We knew this was a temporary respite.”
Despite -30-degree temperatures, prominent representatives of province-wide unions joined students and campus unions to protest the University’s recent attempts to police campus protests.
This was more than a simple show of solidarity, according to Sylvain Marois, a vice president of the Fédération nationale des enseignants et des enseignantes du Québec (FNEEQ), which represents over 30,000 professors and teachers across the province.
“We know for a fact that if McGill goes ahead with this, then other universities will do exactly the same,” he told The Daily, noting that similar rules are under consideration at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM).
Jérémie Bédard-Wien, a spokesperson for the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante (ASSÉ), made a similar point. “The brilliant minds in the James Admin did not invent the kinds of repressive politics that are hiding behind this protocol. We are currently facing all across Quebec the systematic imposition of a culture of security on our campuses,” he told the assembled crowd.
Representatives from the Public Service Alliance of Canada, the parent union of several campus unions, were also present at the protest, as were members of several Concordia and UQAM unions.
Di Grappa announced at Senate that the protocol had been reshaped into two separate documents – a statement of values, and a set of operating procedures.
The forthcoming “operational procedures” will be guidelines for campus security and disciplinary officers about how to deal with protests on campus. Developing a specific set of procedures was one of the recommendations of a report authored by Dean of Law Daniel Jutras in response to the events of November 10, 2011, when riot police were deployed on campus.
Di Grappa made only passing reference to the controversy the proposed protocol has caused on campus, saying that there was no “unanimity” on campus to the changes the protocol sought.
“Over the period that the protocol has been in place, there have been many protests,” he said.
Both the “statement of principles” and the new rules governing campus protest – expected next week – will go through McGill’s now familiar consultation process, with two consultation fairs next month at both campuses, and a website to be launched next week.
Though the statement of principles will be subject to approval by the Senate and Board of Governors (BoG), the operational procedures will not go before either body. In an email to The Daily, Di Grappa wrote that the new set of rules about campus protests is an “operational or administrative matter.”
For teaching assistant (TA) Sunci Avlijas, “it is completely undemocratic,” that the University plans on adopting these guidelines without Senate or BoG approval. “I don’t see how they think they can get away with this.”
According to Avlijas, AGSEM’s TA unit plans on filing a grievance with the University under their collective bargaining agreement, arguing that these “operating procedures” would fundamentally change their working conditions.

Dean of Arts stands by decision to reduce number of low-enrolment classes
During a Town Hall with students on Tuesday, Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi reiterated his commitment to reduce the number of  low-enrolment classes to give full-time faculty more time to teach large classes.
The event was hosted by the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) as a way to allow students to raise questions and provide feedback on the subject of cuts in Arts classes.
Last week, The Daily reported that 100 classes with low enrolment will not be offered in the coming year, as the Faculty of Arts tries to raise the number of larger classes taught by full-time faculty members. Any funds saved will be directed toward hiring additional TAs for those larger courses.
Manfredi began by telling students that the main objective of this move was to enhance the connection between research and undergraduate teaching by having researchers in classrooms, and to decrease the ratio of students to TAs.
According to Manfredi, these objectives go as far back as 2006, when McGill Senate adopted the Strengths and Aspirations white paper, which regulates academic priorities at the University. Manfredi also pointed to a Town Hall meeting held in the fall of 2010 in which students expressed concerns about a disconnect between instructors and students.
Associate Dean of Arts Gillian Lane-Mercier said that other solutions could include retiring courses, reducing the frequency of offering, redefining course objectives, or increasing the number of students in each class.
Arts Senator James Gutman expressed dismay regarding the cuts. He said that while students were being promised more, they were actually being asked to settle for less, and accused Manfredi of punishing course lecturers for unionizing. According to Gutman, accepting cuts to low-enrolment classes would leave course lecturers in the lurch.
“If we accept this, we are going to be accepting an attack on these workers who are some of our favourite teachers,” Gutman told Manfredi.
Manfredi responded that the allegations that the administration was punishing lecturers for unionizing were “completely untrue.” According to Manfredi, the faculty had been planning the course cuts before the union had been certified.
Gutman also worried about the effects the cuts would have on students’ education.
“Is school simply a conveyor belt, or are we doing something more? Are we trying to learn? Can we learn in a big class? Maybe you’re talking to your TA once a week, or do you want to learn in a small environment with people that really care about teaching every time you go to class,” he asked.
“There is no direct correlation between the size of a class and the educational experience that it offers; it’s a combination of things,” Manfredi responded. “You can sometimes have a very poor educational experience in a very small-enrolment class.”
Lily Schwarzbaum, a U3 Political Science and International Development Studies student, responded that there are more opportunities to have better learning experiences when classes are kept small.
“You’re right, there’s no absolute correlation [between class size and learning outcomes], but the avenues with which you engage pedagogically with students are vastly increased when you have smaller class sizes,” Schwarzbaum said.
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser compared the cuts to classes with the provincial government’s recent budget cuts. The government “just sort of impose[d] the cut,” she said.
Reid-Fraser asked Manfredi why the administration had chosen to cut a seemingly arbitrary number of classes.
“I’m curious about why it was that you decided on the number 100, and now you are choosing to do the evaluation and figure out if that number is possible to achieve,” Reid-Fraser asked.
Manfredi responded he chose 100 because it is “less than 25 per cent of the current number of small-enrolment courses, it’s a round number, it’s a number that could generate the level of freed-up resources that I think would make an important impact on the other things we want to do.”
“This is not about cutting the faculty’s budget; it’s about spending our money in a different way. It’s mostly spending it on enhancing the classroom experience but also in the educational experience outside the classroom,” he added.
Manfredi told The Daily that the process would be moving forward with a presentation to faculty at an upcoming meeting.

Events cancelled due to miscommunication
On January 21 SSMU opened its “Introduction to Quebec” week with a debate on Quebec sovereignty hosted by the McGill Debating Union.
The week of events – a collaborative effort between SSMU and student organizations on campus – aims to better educate the student population about the unique cultural, historical, and political identity of Quebec. 
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser organized the week of events after conversations about the recent student strike made her realize that students didn’t know much about the history of the province. 
“It seems like one of the reasons that folks at McGill didn’t have as much of a connection to the strike is because they aren’t from Quebec, and don’t have the history and sense of the province because of that,” Reid-Fraser told The Daily by email. 
“I’ve heard a lot of students saying that it can be really difficult to break out of the McGill bubble, and get involved in the greater Montreal community. That being said, there’s a real desire to get to know this province,” Reid-Fraser said.
Reid-Fraser explained that SSMU aimed to create a mix of more traditional events, such as discussions on Quebec sovereignty and Bill 101, Quebec’s charter of the French language, and less explored topics, such as black history in Montreal and the historical relationship between Aboriginals and white settlers in Quebec.
A workshop on Monday aiming to provide a basic introduction to Quebec, and a presentation on Tuesday aiming to explain the relationship between different regions in Quebec, were both cancelled due to miscommunications in scheduling. 
Tuesday’s workshop on Montreal’s black history was cancelled as the presenter was ill. 
Wednesday’s events included a workshop by Paige Isaac from the McGill First Peoples’ House on the Aboriginal community in Quebec, and a workshop on the Quebec student movement.
Thursday’s events are slated to include a workshop on Bill 101 and other legal issues in Quebec, and a francophone night at Gert’s featuring the Montreal band Les Lazy Lovers. 
On Friday, SSMU plans to host a presentation on the history of Canada from a francophone perspective, followed by a poutine crawl.
Reid-Fraser was enthusiastic about future possibilities for the Quebec-themed week of events. 
“I would love it if this can be an annual thing…and bring in more speakers from outside of McGill to have even more of a diversity of perspectives, and a lot more from actual Québécois,” she said.

Senate discusses re-reads of students’ academic work
In a number of recent meetings, Quebec government ministers have told Principal Heather Munroe-Blum that recent cuts to higher education funding are permanent, and that McGill should expect more cuts in the future. The administration will continue to campaign for more money from the government, but according to Munroe-Blum, Premier Pauline Marois refuses to admit any amount of reinvestment.
That was the main message communicated by Munroe-Blum’s opening remarks at yesterday’s monthly Senate meeting.
The meetings she referred to were preparatory talks for February’s upcoming summit on higher education. According to Munroe-Blum, she attended meetings on behalf of the McGill community, as well as CREPUQ, the organization that represents Quebec’s university administrations.
The provincial budget cuts represent a $19-million blow to McGill’s budget. It is the “third reversal” of government higher education funding policy since April of this year, Munroe-Blum said, referring to the Charest government’s restructuring of tuition hikes last spring amidst student protests, and the Marois government’s subsequent cancellation of the hikes.
“We also must stay the course,” in resisting the cuts, Munroe-Blum said.
Munroe-Blum added that the Quebec Minister of Higher Education Pierre Duchesne told her there would be more cuts in the 2013-14 provincial budget.
The Faculty of Arts’ recently- announced decision to cut 100 classes from next year’s course offerings has nothing to do with the provincial cuts, and had been in the works long before the current government was elected, Munroe-Blum said.
Other Senate business included the annual report from the University’s ombudsman, Spencer Boudreau. According to the report, the past 12 months have seen 271 requests for ombudsman support from the McGill community, 250 of them from students. The vast majority of students’ requests, Boudreau said, are about class grades.
All McGill students are entitled to a re-read of submitted work after an initial grading. There is no definite procedure for the process however, Boudreau said, and he recommended a clearer procedure across faculties.
Boudreau also recommended that re-reads of submitted work should be conducted by a panel of three professors, rather than the single professor currently allowed for in McGill statutes.
Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures and Equity) Lydia White said the last recommendation was unrealistic, especially in obscure fields where there may be only one or two experts in a given field.
Boudreau held firm, however, saying that all other universities in Quebec have a panel of three professors for re-reads of student papers.

Quebec profs report recommends more transparent financial practices
Quebec universities are funneling more and more teaching dollars into massive infrastructure projects with no oversight – a bad use of public money and a blow to students and faculty, according to a new report by a Quebec professors’ federation.
Between 1998 and 2009, there was a 162 per cent increase in funding for capital projects – new buildings, renovations, equipment, and books, mostly – that universities siphoned off from other parts of their budgets, such as faculty salaries and student services, the report says. That amounts to $167 million.
The 426-page report, authored by the Fédération québécoise des professeures et professeurs d’université (FQPPU), comes just a month after McGill and other schools publicly decried the provincial government’s $124-million cut to university funding, which administrators say will hinder core functions like teaching and research.
While the FQPPU oppose the cuts too, their report is the latest salvo in a fight over how Quebec universities spend their money. Administrators recently claimed the province’s universities are underfunded by $850 million, mostly due to low tuition, while student and faculty groups say schools have enough money but are spending too much on unnecessary building projects.
FQPPU President Max Roy concedes that there are good reasons for increased spending on university infrastructure. “The government isn’t giving enough money for capital expenses,” he said in French during a phone interview with The Daily.
Between 1998 and 2009, enrolment in Quebec universities jumped 23.8 per cent, forcing schools to make room for students by buying up real estate. IT costs have also skyrocketed over the past decade.
But Roy says he doesn’t trust universities to determine which infrastructure projects are most important. “All administrations are going to say that projects are prioritized and urgent,” he said.
In their report, the FQPPU calls for the creation of a university council to review spending choices and make recommendations to the provincial government. “We’re not saying that administrators are acting in bad faith,” Roy said. “But we’re saying if they’re acting in good faith, they’ll accept greater transparency around their decision-making.”
The Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) went further last week, calling for a freeze on university construction until an external review of the schools’ finances is done.
McGill, the eye of the storm
No one in the McGill administration was prepared to comment on the report by press time.
McGill alone accounts for 22 per cent of Quebec universities’ infrastructure expenditures, largely thanks to its huge medical faculty. Indeed, of the 18 universities studied in the report, the four with medical faculties – Laval, Sherbrooke, Université de Montreal, and McGill – account for $3.6 billion of the $6.1 billion in capital expenses across the system.
The abundance of old buildings on campus makes maintenance expensive, too. 33 per cent of McGill’s total space is in buildings erected before 1940, against 5 per cent for the other Quebec universities. In its most recent budget, McGill estimated that it has at least $647 million in “urgent” deferred maintenance work.
Roy says he wants proof. “They have to prove it – they have to put it on paper,” he said. “There is a major transparency problem. We think there are projects that are not justified, but we can’t tell which ones.”
FEUQ President Martine Desjardins attended a roundtable meeting on higher education with McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum last week, and said Munroe-Blum bristled at calls for oversight on university spending. “She kept saying, ‘Just keep giving us money and we’ll just decide how we spend it’,” Desjardins said in a phone interview.
This fiscal year, McGill plans to spend $46.7 million on construction and renovation, out of a $717.4- million budget.
In competition for students, winners unclear
The FQPPU report also calls for less competition between universities over scarce provincial funding, much of which comes on a per-student basis.
Desjardins, who agrees with FQPPU’s assessment, believes that the roughly $7,300 subsidy Quebec universities receive per full-time student is driving schools to misspend money on buildings and promotional campaigns. “If you have more and more students inside your buildings, the government is giving you more and more money. This is why we see this competition,” she said.
“We think it’s a good thing to have competition. It makes sure the quality of the universities is high enough. But it’s going to another level. We’re having a lot of expenses for publicity and construction that we don’t need.”

Enbridge Inc. pushing regulatory approval
Several hundred students, citizens, and environmental activists gathered last Saturday to find ways of preventing the reversal of a pipeline that could carry Alberta oil into the province of Quebec.
Climate Justice Montreal hosted the day-long community forum at Concordia, which included workshops, panel discussions, and brainstorming sessions, among other activities.
Free to the public, the event attracted a wide-ranging crowd, from eco-conscious CEGEP students to members of the Montreal Raging Grannies.
The attendees discussed the Athabasca tar sands, a collection of oil deposits near Fort McMurray, Alberta, which the Environmental Defence organization has called the most destructive project on earth.
The forum revolved around  Line 9, a pipeline that would transport oil from Sarnia, Ontario to Montreal. According to Shona Watt, a professor at Champlain College who attended the forum, the pipeline would complete a series of pipelines flowing eastward from Alberta, giving the crude oil from the tar sands an uninterrupted path to the eastern provinces.
Line 9 was built in 1975 to carry oil eastbound to Quebec, but the flow was reversed in the late 1990s in order to carry imported oil westward. Enbridge Inc., a Canadian energy company, is proposing that the flow be reversed again, to bring Alberta oil to the Quebec market. The company argues that because the pipeline already exists, there will be minimal impact to the environment as a result of the flow switch.
In 2008, Enbridge tried to reverse Line 9 back to its eastbound route as part of their Trailbreaker project. It halted its plans in 2009 due to sub-par economic conditions, and after several years of trying to revive the project, claimed, “the scope and objective of Trailbreaker, as previously contemplated, is no longer being pursued.”
But Watt and other attendees said that the company has broken the project up into smaller pieces in order to get regulatory approval more quickly. Line 9 is one link in the pipeline which carries crude from Alberta to Quebec.
According to Watt, because oil coming from the tar sands is more viscous and corrosive than the kind currently flowing through Line 9, it is more likely to cause pipe cracks, which could lead to dangerous spills.
In addition, Enbridge plans to increase the capacity of oil being pumped from 240,000 barrels a day to 300,000 barrels per day.
Environmental activists say spills, such as the one in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2010, which also occurred on an Enbridge pipe, cause massive damages to surrounding land and communities. If oil spills out of a pipeline, it sinks into the earth and can often go unnoticed. But Watt pointed out that residents near the Kalamazoo River experienced headaches, nausea, and breathing problems as a result of the leak.
Watt became involved with Climate Justice Montreal after discovering that part of Line 9 is located a little over three miles away from her family cottage.
“It’s something that strikes really close to home for me,” she told The Daily. “It just [seems] that if something happened, I’d be able to see it.”
One pair of students also advocated encouraging universities to divest endowment funds away from big oil companies.
“The university is a kind of beacon for what we want society to look like,” said workshop facilitator and McGill student Lily Schwarzbaum. “We’re creating these centres where people can generate a kind of future that is based on passage of knowledge. The endowment, in a sense, should reflect that.”
Divest McGill plans to present a petition within the next two weeks to McGill’s Board of Governors, specifically, under the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social responsibility (CAMSR).
Vanessa Gray, a youth activist from Aamjiwnaang, a First Nations community in Sarnia, Ontario also made a call against the project.
Having grown up on a reserve beside refineries, Gray explained that even though oil projects may not take place on Native land, they still affect nearby communities by polluting the environment. She has lost many family members to cancer and most of the kids she grew up with use inhalers.
“I’m not afraid to say that I feel this is wrong,” she said at the event. “It’s not whether a company will release something, it’s when.”
Gray mentioned that the Idle No More movement has empowered her community to come together for the first time against many of the issues – such as pollution and the environment – affecting life on their reserve.
At the end of the day people broke out into smaller working groups and brainstormed ways to resist Line 9. Most agreed that a priority should be increasing awareness for the cause and attracting more members.
Gaby Rimok, a student at CEGEP John Abbott College, attended the forum with classmates from the environmental club at her school.
“I think we can all work together. All the people here have the same goals, so if we all show up the next time, then it could work!” she said.
