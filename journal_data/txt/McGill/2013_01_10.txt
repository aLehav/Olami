Ongoing lease negotiations cited as main reason
Correction appended Jan 14, 2013. 
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) has budgeted a deficit of $211,320 for this fiscal year, according to the revised fall 2012-2013 budget, which was released in late November.
SSMU knew last year that they would be facing an initial deficit of $274,751 due to higher expenses and lower revenues, as well as uncertainty surrounding ongoing lease negotiations with the University.
To reduce the deficit, the budget underwent two phases of cuts, where non-essential expenditures were abolished, and the position of one full-time building manager was removed. Money was taken from the Student Life Fund, which is accumulated surpluses from differents SSMU services.
“We could probably slash completely the majority of the services and most of the events we run, and still not make the deficit,” SSMU President Josh Redel said at one of SSMU’s biweekly Legislative Councils, November 29. “There is no way to account for a quarter million dollars.”
The Capital Expenditures Reserve Fund (CERF), part of SSMU’s budget which is set aside for renovations, student projects, and long term investments, will cover the remaining $211,320 to ensure that quality is not sacrificed during cuts. In an interview with The Daily, SSMU VP Finance Jean-Paul Briggs said, “the budget is lean and efficient while maintaining the same or greater levels of service.”
The CERF includes the investment portfolio, annual budget surpluses, capital assets, and an annual contribution of $50,000 from the Operating Budget. It is designed to allow SSMU to fund large projects and equipment expenditures beyond the scope of annual operations.
“The fund has ample room to cover the deficit without affecting our long-term financial plans,” Briggs said.
The revised fall budget stated “CERF is capable of covering the deficit with ease and this is precisely the type of situation a reserve fund is meant for,” although only as a short-term solution. According to audited financial statements, CERF has over $5 million. 
According to the revised fall budget, the bulk of the deficit stems from the ongoing lease negotiations with McGill. SSMU has yet to sign a contract with the University for the Shatner building, and has not paid utilities for the past year.
“The budget is created conservatively to reflect the potential cost of utilities based off the direction of last year’s negotiations,” Briggs said. Due to the uncertainty, SSMU must remain flexible about its measures in the long-term, Briggs said, adding, “It’s impossible to know what the results of the negotiations will be and what exact strategy the outcome will ultimately require.”
Deficit notwithstanding, the revised fall budget passed in the Legislative Council meeting on November 29 without any initial opposition. Science Senator Moe Nasr was alone in challenging the bill, and failed to secure any support from his fellow councillors.
Nasr expressed concerns about dipping into reserve funds, and argued instead for more cuts. He highlighted a $25,000 expense for Plank, a new room-booking software, as an area where more cuts could have been made. “Every dollar makes a difference,” Nasr said.
In the meeting Briggs said, “[the] expenses in here are justified by the people responsible.”
The revised fall budget presented a series of increased expenses across all areas of the budget. Notable variations from last fiscal year’s budget include $16,000 for new work stations in SSMU, and the loss of a donation from La Prep that brought in $10,000 per year for three years.
General Manager Pauline Gervais explained at Council that SSMU also saw a loss of revenue due to a lack of summer rent during the turnover of restaurants on the second floor. 
This turnover was also accompanied by extensive repairs, maintenance, and cleaning of the vacated space. The replacement of old equipment also accounted for heightened expenses, but Briggs assured that this was part of the long-term financial plan for the second floor cafeteria.
More expenses stemmed from the hiring of more student and permanent staff this year, resulting in a significant increase in salaries and benefits.
As a non-for-profit corporation, SSMU is not allowed to run a deficit; however, when asked by The Daily about this, Briggs provided no comment. 
He did state in an email to The Daily that “the deficit has no immediate impact on the Society… the budget was created using very conservative projections in a time of extraordinary uncertainty.”
“As such, I felt that the benefits of showing a projected deficit and drawing from our reserves far outweighed the cost of further cuts that would be detrimental to the level of service the Society is able to offer,” he added.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to reduced ‘non-essential services,’ when in fact it should have only referred to ‘non-essential expenditures’. The article also stated that SSMU had not paid rent to the University due to ongoing lease negotiations, in fact, SSMU has paid rent, though not utilities. Furthermore, the infographic attached to the article should have specified that the revenues and expenses assigned to 2012-2013 were budgeted amounts, and that the numbers assigned to 2011-2012 were final audited amounts. The Daily regrets the errors.

Student files grievance, citing human rights violation 
The Quebec Civil Liberties Union, a civil rights group based in Quebec, expressed concern on Monday over McGill’s decision to implement new regulations on campus protests. The regulations, first introduced in provisional form in response to the five-day occupation of the James administration building last February, drew the ire of three of the University’s thirteen unions and of major student groups shortly after its announcement.
In an interview with The Daily, Philippe Robert de Massy, a lawyer and spokesperson for the group, described the protocol as “unrealistic” and “seemingly authoritarian.”
“There’s already plenty of laws and charters that regulate freedom of speech,” he said in French. “It gives the impression that McGill wants to turn the screw [on protests.]”
Some of the protocol’s most controversial passages stipulate that the more “intense” the protest, the greater the “likelihood that it will be deemed not to be peaceful.”
“It seems that [the University] wants protests that aren’t bothersome. It’s not realistic. [Protests] are obviously political and they usually involve a certain degree of emotion,” he added. 
Another clause in the document states that the University might notify “civil authorities” if protesters “refuse to comply with instructions from Security Services personnel, such as requiring demonstrators to reduce the level of noise, to identify themselves, to leave a particular location, to move to a more suitable location or to disperse.”
“For me, the fact that [McGill] reiterates these rules in a protocol signifies that it won’t be the same in [future demonstrations],” de Massy said. “It means, ‘next time, if we find that the level [of noise] is too high, expect us to intervene and watch out if you haven’t obeyed the rules.’”
In December, U3 Philosophy student Eli Freedman filed a grievance to the University Senate alleging that the new set of regulations violates the school’s charter of student rights, and likely infringes on provincial as well as international law. 
The Montreal Gazette quoted prominent civil-rights lawyer Julius Grey as saying that he agreed with Freedman’s cause. Grey noted a shift in the University’s attitude regarding protests. 
“It is the nature of students that they protest and this should be understood and accepted,” he added.
“I’m not asking for a better policy, I’m asking for no policy,” Freedman told The Daily. “This isn’t about me, it’s about any one that needs to use space at McGill… [McGill] needs a healthy tolerance for dissenting views.” 
Freedman was told by the Senate grievance committee that he would be notified after winter break concerning whether or not he would be granted a hearing, though he had not yet received further communications from them as of yesterday. 
Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa, who is in charge of revising the protocol along with Provost Anthony Masi, told The Daily in an interview in December that he did not believe the protocol “violate[d] any rights,” and that instead it effectively “[balanced] between the rights of all parties.”
According to an email sent on the behalf of Di Grappa and Masi on November 30 to the university-wide community, the last date for students to return comments on the protocol via a confidential email address was January 7. 
The document is set to go before Senate on January 23 and to the Board of Governors – McGill’s highest governing body – on January 29 for final approval.

American researcher attacks McGill’s asbestos investigation
The ongoing debate over McGill’s role in producing flawed, industry-funded asbestos research erupted in a shouting match between McGill faculty and an American researcher at the Faculty Club on Monday.
The dispute centered on the research of retired McGill professor J. Corbett MacDonald, conducted with nearly a million dollars from the asbestos industry, about the health effects of asbestos extraction in Quebec. A CBC documentary last year suggested that MacDonald tailored his results to suit industry interests. In a landmark paper published in 1998 after decades of research, MacDonald concluded that the kind of asbestos primarily mined in Quebec – chrysotile – was “innocuous” at certain exposure levels.
Under the chandeliers of the Faculty Club’s Gold Room, Brown University associate professor David Egilman called on McGill to retract MacDonald’s paper. Egilman, who booked the room himself, called MacDonald’s paper “garbage” and said it used outdated measurement methods and relied on manipulated data.
Egilman also objected to the fact that data on the location of mines containing differing levels of tremolite – a form of asbestos universally recognized to cause cancer of the lung lining – in the Thetford Mines area has not been made public. MacDonald’s conclusions about chrysotile hinge on the existence of these high- and low-density tremolite mines.
Egilman has been attacking McGill’s asbestos research for over a decade; in 2003 he wrote a long study, “Exposing the ‘Myth’ of ABC, ‘Anything But Chrysotile’: A critique of the Canadian asbestos mining industry and McGill University chrysotile studies.”
Egilman noted that MacDonald’s paper is being used by the asbestos industry in Brazil and Canada to downplay the health effects of chrysotile exposure.
“I’m not here because I care that he cheated on his research. I’m here because the research is being used in a way that is counterproductive from a health perspective,” Egilman said. “If McGill withdraws the paper, it’s over. It’s over.”
The Harper government has cited MacDonald’s research to oppose the inclusion of chrysotile in the Rotterdam Convention, the UN’s treaty on dangerous substances. The government abandoned the position last September.
Based on MacDonald’s research, the official position of the Brazilian government has long been that the controlled use of chrysotile is safe.
Last semester, an internal investigation conducted by McGill’s own Research Integrity Officer Abraham Fuks cleared MacDonald of any research misconduct. Egilman has called the review “a shameful cover-up.”
During his presentation, Egilman referred to Fuks as Inspector Fox and included a cartoon in his slideshow of a henhouse guarded by a grinning fox.
“Fuks, by the way, is German for Fox,” Egilman said.
“I extremely resent that,” said Eduardo Franco, Interim Chair of Oncolgy at McGill, interrupting. “Dr. Fuks is one of the most distinguished scientists we have at McGill. You could have made your point without that.”
“I could have, but it’s funny,” said Egilman.
Wayne Wood, an Occupational Health lecturer at McGill, also called Egilman’s presentation “flawed” and “dishonest” in an emotional exchange during the question period. He said Egilman should not have attributed the view that chrysotile was “safe” to MacDonald, as MacDonald did not use the word himself.
Egilman’s talk was in response to a lecture earlier that afternoon by Bruce Case, an asbestos researcher at McGill currently on sabbatical. A long time colleague and backer of MacDonald, Case defended the reputations of several asbestos researchers he feels have been unfairly maligned, MacDonald among them. Case called on the audience to “remember them as the not-always-perfect heroes they are” for pioneering the study of asbestos’s health effects.
At the end of Case’s presentation, held at Purvis Hall, Egilman stood up at the back of the room and invited the audience to his talk.
Egilman and Case have a long history of sparring over asbestos research. In 2005, while Case gave a deposition in Dallas, Texas as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in a case about chrysotile exposure – arguing that chrysotile had not been proven to cause mesothelioma, a cancer usually associated with asbestos exposure – Egilman entered the courtroom wearing a “flamboyant” orange t-shirt bearing a moose and a McGill “M,” according to court documents. One of the defendants’ lawyers accused Egilman of trying to “provoke” Case.
In last year’s CBC documentary about McGill’s asbestos studies, Case said, “I wouldn’t give Dr. Egilman the time of day…because he’s not an honourable person.”
Six scientists who signed a letter to McGill in December requesting that Egilman be invited to speak alongside Case cited Case’s attacks in the CBC documentary as a reason for their “concerns” with the McGill scientist’s lecture.
Egilman called on the press to weigh his claims against those of MacDonald’s defenders, such as Case and Fuks. “One of us is an asshole,” he said.

What a McGill official described as a fluke accident in the Shatner building over the winter break has resulted in damages to several rooms in the Shatner building. The costs of the damages are as yet unknown. Rooms damaged include the SSMU ballroom, cafeteria, student lounge, the Muslim Student Association’s (MSA) prayer space, and The Daily/Le Délit office.
According to Luc Roy, McGill’s director of Building Operations, a buildup of water around the pipes on the third floor caused the leak. Roy said the leak was not caused by changes made to the building’s heating system over the winter break. 
Both SSMU’s General Manager Pauline Gervais, and SSMU Security Supervisor Wallace Sealy disputed this, saying that the heat had in fact been lowered over break, and that this was likely the cause of the pipe bursts. Sealy added that he had to wear a hat and coat during a visit to the building over winter break.
The leaks became apparent the night of January 4, as cleaning staff discovered water spewing into the SSMU ballroom from a burst pipe in the southeast corner of the room, as well as from a pipe in La Prep on the first floor.
The damage led the MSA to host its prayer services in a different room of the Shatner basement while repairs are made to their prayer space. The student lounge on the ground floor was also damaged, and cleaning crews have been working there and in the prayer space all week. Gervais said that repairs are expected to be completed today.
Because McGill owns the Shatner building and leases it to SSMU, the University will pay the full cost of the cleaning and repairs. Gervais said that damage to the floors in the ballroom would require them to be replaced, most likely over Reading Week.

Josh Redel – President
Redel arrived in office with a divided and politicized student body and what seemed to be a politically divergent executive team. However, Redel has been successful in keeping the executive working together smoothly, although this has often been done at the expense of tackling divisive issues.
Redel also oversaw the implementation of a new General Assembly structure last fall – with online ratification and a mood watcher. However, these measures failed to effectively help maintain quorum, which was lost halfway through the year’s first GA.
As the only undergraduate student representative on the Board of Governors, Redel has fostered friendly relationships with the administration, although we will see – most likely, when a renegotiated lease for the SSMU building is finally released – if this has come at the cost of real student advocacy. Some of Redel’s projects, such as the “roaming councils” and the “Green GA,” were more fluff than substance. It is reassuring to know that Redel seeks to engage the wider McGill community, but these initiatives might not be the most effective approach.
As president, we would like to see Redel facilitate more productive discussions at SSMU Council. 
Haley Dinel – VP University Affairs
One of the biggest projects for Dinel last semester was working with the SSMU Indigenous Studies researcher, the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office, and other parties in the implementation of a North American Indigenous Studies program. The joint effort resulted in the creation of a minor for next year and increased awareness on the subject on campus.
It is troubling to see that the executive responsible for relations with the University is heard so little during Senate, which has been exceptionally controversial this year. That being said, she should be commended for seeing her Senate livestreaming initiative through.
Dinel has also taken up the responsibility of negotiating the lease for the Shatner building along with Redel. Despite reporting “good progress” in the negotiations – confidential so far – the lease has yet to be signed.
SSMU also faced controversy during the 4Floors event last fall when a student attended the event wearing blackface. As the executive in charge of enforcing the equity policy, this was an important failure for Dinel, especially given that the prior executive had successfully prevented this sort of incident by publicizing the equity policy before 4Floors and informing participants to be sensitive regarding their costume choices.
Jean-Paul Briggs – VP Finance and Operations
Briggs started the year with the renovation in Gerts, an increase in sales for the bar, and the creation of Gertrude’s Corner.  However, he faced some of the biggest challenges in the executive team, with the student-run cafe and the revision of the budget. Despite initially appearing hesitant about the feasibility of a student run cafe, given the lease negotiations which render SSMU’s finances so uncertain, Briggs now appears much more dedicated to fulfilling his campaign promise to see the initiative through, though likely with an extended timeline.
The budget revision was presented late last semester, and although reduced, still has a deficit of $211,320.
In the coming semester, Briggs should improve his communication efforts with the student body and especially with campus media.
Allison Cooper – VP Clubs and Services
Cooper’s first challenge was to run the Fall Activities night, which went smoothly, despite the expected long lines outside the building. The challenge for this semester is to have a widely attended Winter Activities night, which plans to feature performances and interactive activities. Cooper also started initiatives aimed at helping clubs, such as the clubs workshop, which assisted new club executives navigate SSMU bureaucracy, as well as a services round-table, and the “Club Hub” project, an online portal aimed at alleviating turnover problems by helping new club executives, which has however yet to be fully implemented. Cooper has been active in her advocacy for groups like CKUT and M-SERT, even when SSMU Council did not endorse a yes vote for the former.
Along with Briggs, Cooper has changed the financial audit for clubs to happen once a semester, instead of yearly. The change will allow clubs to receive funding based on their more recent performance. Cooper oversaw a lot of the building renovations planned last year, which saw the expansion of the Legal Aid Clinic and new flooring on the fourth floor of the Shatner building.
Despite having small initiatives like overseeing the office re-allocation on the fourth floor started by last year’s executive, Cooper has not undertaken many large projects aimed at improving the status of clubs and services.
Michael Szpedja – VP Internal
Orientation week, Szpedja’s first event of the year, saw a major overhaul with increased participation from the administration and the implementation of à la carte events. Frosh was, as usual, not without its major incidents, though it is hard to separate what we can pin on organizers and what is inevitable given the nature of Frosh week. Since Frosh, Szpedja has worked on big events like 4Floors, which sold out quickly but also proved controversial. As VP Internal, he has focused on traditional events but students would have benefited from initiatives of a different nature, such as speaker events mentioned in his campaign platform.
Szpedja needs to make better use of social media and other communication means to fulfill his campaign goal of building school spirit.
Robin Reid-Fraser – VP External
Reid-Fraser’s most notable achievements have been in SSMU’s relationship with the Milton-Parc community, such as the creation of  the position of community ambassadors. She has also worked with the Community Affairs Coordinator in initiatives like the creation of French conversation classes with members of the Milton-Parc community and videos about the neighbourhood.
Although Reid-Fraser planned a candidate’ debate early in the semester with members of other student unions, she should strive to have a stronger relationship with other student unions in Montreal and Quebec to create similar initiatives. Reid-Fraser should also encourage stronger participation in Table de Concertation Étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) next semester.
Reid-Fraser’s role as a liaison between SSMU and the provincial government could have been better. Despite the abolition of the tuition hikes by the Parti Québécois, concerted efforts to mobilize McGill students during the fall semester were absent.
