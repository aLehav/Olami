AUS, EUS, SSMU, Midnight Kitchen all taking action in response to Arch Café closure
Faculty undergraduate associations and student organizations across campus are taking action on what is fast becoming the most important issue in student politics this fall: food. After student interests united around the closure of the Architecture Café – culminating last week in hundreds of students marching through campus to protest the closure – student organizations have turned their attention to more long-term initiatives. The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), Midnight Kitchen, and SSMU have all moved – albeit in different ways – toward addressing a common goal of student involvement in campus food.
The student-run Midnight Kitchen collective held an open “strategy session” September 27 to address the issue of food on campus. Collective member Carol Fraser explained their push for a boycott.
“The Midnight Kitchen collective was actively involved in the boycott of McGill food services the last time the Architecture Café was temporarily closed in 2007. … We are concerned about student’s input and active control on campus. As the last standing student-run food service [offering full meals], we felt the need and responsibility to do something in light of recent events and the overall trend in the past ten years,” wrote Fraser in an email to The Daily.
Ideas explored at the meeting included raising awareness amongst first-year students (many of whom have pre-purchased meal plans and must spend their money at McGill cafeterias), organizing a boycott of McGill food supplier Aramark, and strengthening alternative student-run food sources on campus. Fraser added that Midnight Kitchen is considering hosting cooking skill-shares and an increased serving capacity in conjunction with a larger boycott, but stressed that the collective is “not ‘spearheading’ so to speak.”
The EUS, which includes the Architecture Students Association as of this semester, also took action this week. At EUS council September 28, President Daniel Keresteci authored a motion proposing that the EUS officially register disapproval with the administration’s decision to close the Architecture cafe, and to earmark $500 in support of the campaign to bring back the café. The motion did not mention a boycott.
“I don’t think that the EUS mandating support of a boycott would achieve the aims that we are looking at,” said Keresteci.
 On September 21, the EUS submitted a full business proposal to the administration, aiming to take full control of the Architecture Café’s operations if it were to be re-opened. “All the financial burden would be on us,” said Keresteci. As of press time, the administration had yet to respond.
 AUS council approved a motion September 22 mandating that they explore the idea of day-long interfaculty food market, as well as taking initial steps toward a boycott of McGill food services. The motion, brought by Anthropology Students Association councillor Brittni Martin, was unanimously adopted by the council.
AUS President David Marshall explained the motion. “The proposed boycott is, as noted in the resolution, simply a proposed one: the representatives from AUS that approach EUS, ASA, and SSMU will simply suggest that a boycott take place to supplement any food market that may come into existence. It is certainly not set in stone, but the spirit of the motion – to encourage  discussion and debate around the real issue of needing broad-based student consultation, as well as to bring to light the fact that students have many ideas as to how to run a food service on campus – remains intact.”
AUS operates one of the few remaining student-run food services on campus, SNAX in the Leacock building.
 “SNAX has been a profitable business for us, and very beneficial for the students, as well as the faculty, that frequent it,” said Marshall, adding that business was up this year.
SNAX general manager Erin Schilling confirmed that business has been up this year, but reiterated that there are likely reasons beyond the closure of the Architecture Café.
“It’s not the sole factor, but you can’t really deny that we’ve picked up that clientele,” she said. “Being AUS-run, we try to keep our prices low. This year, we’ve tightened up the management. Making the store more accessible has also improved our business.”
Arts Senator Tyler Lawson and Councillor Kallee Lins submitted a motion to SSMU regarding the aftermath of the closure of the Architecture Café.
“On the basis that SSMU need represent student interest – which has been so clearly and continually demonstrated on Facebook, in the campus press, as well as at the rally last Wednesday – we will move that SSMU officially endorse and promote a boycott of McGill Food and Dining Services amongst its members until the Architecture Café is reopened,” said Lawson.
 The Facebook event “Boycott McGill Food Services,” running from September 23 to December 31, had over 2,800 attendees when The Daily went to press.

Competing charges of violence fuel tensions between groups
Last Thursday, September 24, tensions peaked in the ongoing battle between QPRIG (Quebec Public Interest Research Group) and the Opt-Out campaign against it, as the two groups clashed in the hallway between Macdonald Engineering and the Adams Building.
The Opt-Out campaign accused QPIRG of attacking their “private property,” including the fliers and posters on the Opt-Out table, while two QPIRG board members reported that a member of the Opt-Out campaign grabbed a QPIRG board member and briefly prevented her from leaving.
Last Thursday’s incident led the Opt-Out campaign to call McGill Security. According to Pierre Barbarie, Associate Director, University Safety, who was not on campus Thursday to witness these events firsthand, “The people wanting to hand out fliers called us to make sure everything went smoothly while they were handing out their fliers.”
When asked if any physical attacks had occurred, Barbarie said, “Not according to our log entry. We didn’t witness physical incident. Often times, we arrive and things are over, and I’m not saying it didn’t happen, but I didn’t read anything that tells me that there was a physical altercation.”
However, Maddie Ritts, a QPIRG board member, said she was grabbed by Jess Weiser, former Conservative McGill president and current Opt-Out campaigner, after Ritts removed a pile of fliers and posters from the Opt-Out table.
“I had to push and fight him off of me…he would not let go of me,” she told The Daily.
According to an article this week in the McGill Tribune, Weiser denied any allegations that he touched Ritts.
However, Kira Page, a QPIRG board member and a witness to the event, confirmed that at one point Weiser physically held Ritts.
“Maddie was very frustrated [with the Opt-Out campaigners],” Page told The Daily. “She wasn’t there for long, but she ended up grabbing the fliers off the table. Then, Jess grabbed her and wouldn’t let her go. She was yelling ‘Let me go, let me go,’ and at that point I intervened and said physical assault is really a different thing than taking fliers, and I think you should probably let her go right now. … and he let her go, and she ran.”
In an email to The Daily, Weiser said it was QPIRG that acted violently. “QPIRG’s board members as well as their group of supporters grew in number, and their verbal attacks on campaign members became increasingly vial [sic], including racial slurs and stereotyping,” he wrote. The slurs included the phrase “rich white boy,” according to the Tribune.
Addressing Weiser’s charges of racism, Ritts said, “I believe that calling someone out for speaking from the stance of white privilege does not constitute a racial slur.” She said she was not speaking on behalf of QPIRG.
Ritts added that she was “frustrated and saddened” that Weiser would not “own up” to grabbing her. “I think that’s it’s deeply troubling when statements get made that emphasize harm to private property – which I don’t even think removing a stack of fliers constitutes – [and are then] conflated with physical restriction on to some one else’s movement,”  she continued.
Wesier maintained that “members of QPIRG board of directors” argued “aggressively with members of our campaign.” He also alleged that QPIRG board members  “physically obstructed members of our camapaign from distributing flyers.”
Citing an Opt-Out press release disseminated the night of the confrontation charging that QPIRG “physically attacked” the campaign table, Page said the incident “is being turned into a ‘QPIRG is violent’ thing, and [the campaigners] are really playing into the line, which is that QPIRG is funding terrorism and anarchists and building pipe bombs, and this whole lie about what QPIRG does, which is totally incorrect.”
The period during which students could opt out of paying QPIRG’s $3.75 per semester student fee ended yesterday.

New StatsCan report shows anglophones have lower median incomes than francophones
The impression that anglophones in Quebec are a rich, privileged minority took a hit last week with the release of a Statistics Canada (StatsCan) report showing that English-speakers have a lower median income than francophones with the same qualifications.
The 122-page report, released September 23, describes demographic trends among Quebeckers for whom English is the first language. According to 2006 Census data, anglophones have a median income of $1,806 less than francophones. Among men, the gap was about $3,900 and among women it was approximately $2,200.
The report’s findings do not paint a picture of total francophone economic domination in the province, however. A wealthy minority exists within the anglophone community, skewing their average income data upwards – anglophones’ total average income is $3,080 higher than that of francophones.
Anglophones also have a higher poverty rate – by six per cent –  than francophones, dragging their median income results down. A median is the numeric value separating the higher half of a sample from the lower half.
Factors influencing the disparity in average income between the language groups include age, education, region, and type of employment. When controlling for these variables, the StatsCan report found that average income of anglophone men is still $1,900 lower than for their francophone counterparts. An anglophone woman earns $300 less than her French-speaking counterpart.
The report detailed specific factors that have affected this dramatic turnaround in income status.
“On the one hand, the major changes that Quebec society has undergone since the Quiet Revolution have considerably improved the status and socioeconomic position of francophones within Quebec society,” explained the report, authored by Jean-Pierre Corbeil, Brigitte Chavez, and Daniel Pereira. “On the other hand, the departure of many anglophones from the province during the 1970s, along with the arrival of a growing number of international immigrants, many of them from developing countries, have affected the demographic, ethnic and socioeconomic makeup of this language group.”
The majority of migrants to Quebec are English-speaking –  33 per cent of the anglophone population is made up of immigrants, compared to only 7 per cent of the French-speaking population – and inflows of foreign migrants contribute to higher poverty rates among anglophones.
“Numerous studies have already shown that, despite a higher education level, immigrants have a higher unemployment rate and lower income levels than their Canadian-born counterparts,” said the report, titled “Portrait of Official-Language Minorities in Canada –  Anglophones in Quebec.”
Perhaps more significant, however, has been the mass exodus of wealthy anglophones to other Canadian provinces. Historically, lack of employment, fears over separatism and an uncertain political future, and unfavourable language legislation have driven anglophones out of the province. Indeed, the biggest wave of emigration occurred between 1976 and 1981 – the Parti Québécois’s first term in office – when 151,308 Quebec anglophones emigrated, according to StatsCan. From 2001 to 2006, the anglophone population faced a net loss of 16,005 people to other provinces. Almost a quarter of anglophones aged 18 to 24 intend to move away from Quebec within the next five years.
“[Quebec] changed a lot between, say, 1950 and 1990 as a result of deliberate policy measures,” said William Watson, a Senior Research Fellow at Montreal’s Institute for Research on Public Policy, and a McGill Economics professor.
“Many of those policy measures were distasteful to a lot of English people, so they left. So it’s a case of social engineering, really. There is an argument that these [demographic] changes might have taken place without the pro-francophone policies being brought into place…but I think the probably more convincing argument is that the policies themselves have had some effect.”
Watson also said he doubted whether this study will have an impact on the public discourse about anglophones and on policy decisions, at least for the moment.
“A result like that has to be repeated many times to become part of public awareness, to have an influence on people’s thinking,” he said.

$18,000 taken from student faculty association’s RBC account
The federal and provincial government seized $18,000 in unpaid taxes this May from an Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) account at the Royal Bank of Canada.
AUS President Dave Marshall confirmed that AUS has not filed a complete tax return in several years. Sources inside AUS claim that tax woes began with the 2003-2004 executive, and that over the years incomplete exit reports and accounting errors had compounded the problem.
The current executive was unaware of the government seizure until September, Marshall said, when they received a duplicate of an original notice sent by the Quebec government this spring.
“We were very much under the impression that we had inherited a clean house, in the sense that we know we had these issues in the past, but believed that they had all been resolved in the past,” Marshall said.
Shehreyar Jamshed, last year’s VP Finance, said he did not know about the unpaid taxes when he took on his position last year. “I didn’t know about the situation but suspected it because we couldn’t find tax records from before,” he wrote in an email to The Daily. “The tax issue appears to be a very old issue.”
However, as the year progressed, Jamshed said the AUS executive became aware of the back taxes. “During my term in office I tried to collect data on when the last time we paid taxes was and how much we owed,” he wrote.
“AUS council was also aware we could not find tax records, and were trying for months to find enough information to pay them,” continued Jamshed.
Marshall suggested that government notices about AUS’s unpaid taxes might have been lost in McGill’s internal mail, or might have been overlooked during the transition from the 2009-2010 executive to the current one this spring.
Marshall was concerned with the timing of the news that AUS had bungled its finances, as AUS currently supports the re-opening of another student-run service, the Architecture Café.
“The fact we didn’t pay taxes in the past few years does suggest a great amount of negligence on our part, and [on the] part of the AUS as a whole,” Marshall explained. “I would be remiss to suggest of our executive that we cannot function, in a time like this, when the ability of students to run organizations is brought into question.”
AUS Council was informed of the situation during a confidential session on September 22.
Though AUS is similar to a non-profit organization under Quebec law, it is still required to pay taxes on income earned from events, the sale of alcohol, and SNAX profits, as well as capital gains taxes on its investments, endowment, and interest earned from its assets.
Marshall and a source within AUS, who spoke anonymously due to confidentiality requirements, said that the amount seized by the government was artificially high because it was based on the assumption that the AUS would make a profit every year, based on projections on the last annual declaration of assets, submitted in 2007.
However, it was recently discovered that last year’s executive ran a deficit of $51,000 – though they initially reported a surplus – after they misallocated funds for the Arts Student Employment Fund.
“I have spoken to last year’s executive: many of them don’t understand how that could have happened.  It appears there was a misunderstanding with how those funds were allocated or distributed. It’s been a little frustrating for this year’s executive because it seems we’ve spent a large amount of time fixing problems left by previous executives,” Marshall said.
This meant any government assessment would have been inflated.
The AUS is currently attempting to appeal the assessment, but sources within the AUS say their chances are “slim to none,” as the 90-day deadline to submit an appeal to Revenu Québec has likely run out.
Marshall and a source within AUS said steps have already been made to correct accounting mistakes, which they saw as the product of systemic miscommunication and accounting errors in payroll and inventory.
“Our major task this year is to rebuild not our student services, because they are fantastic, but rebuild the infrastructure that surrounds those services,” Marshall said. “A permanent office administrator is coming in, [to improve] the way we do our departmental bank accounts, things as simple as payroll.”
Marshall does not think the seized back taxes will significantly affect the AUS operating budget this year.
The AUS has also externalized its payroll services to the same firm as McGill, and is currently working with four former McGill students, who have offered their services pro bono, to improve the way the executive handles taxes.

Renowned environmental activist delivers “legacy lecture”
Celebrated Canadian scientist and broadcaster David Suzuki visited McGill’s Pollack Hall Tuesday night to discuss two futures: humanity’s and the planet’s.
Part way into a presentation about the necessity of saving an ailing planet, the 74 year-old Suzuki departed from his scripted presentation to lambast Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s environmental policies.
He condemned Harper for “saying that doing something about climate change will ruin the economy.”
Suzuki pointed to the example of Sweden, which imposed a substantial domestic carbon tax in the 1990s, and has since grown its economy by 44 per cent while far surpassing the environmental targets set by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. He went on to remark of Harper, “How dare a leader of this country tell you a lie without even examining what the hell he is saying.”
Suzuki appeared on behalf of the David Suzuki Foundation, in promotion of his recently published book, The Legacy: An Elder’s Vision For Our Sustainable Future. The ten dollar tickets to the event sold out a week in advance.
Billing himself as a speaker “without any hidden agenda,” Suzuki told the audience he wanted to give a final, personal message to younger generations. Noting his age, he joked that he had entered “the death zone.” But he also stressed that it was the responsibility of society’s elders “to sift through our experiences in a lifetime–our observations and thoughts–to distill a legacy…that will be something worth passing on.”
Speaking for well over an hour, Suzuki returned repeatedly to the theme of “legacy,” urging his audience to consider the impact of current Western lifestyles on the lives of future generations.
After an introduction by way of the trailer for the upcoming film Force Of Nature: The David Suzuki Movie, the iconic environmentalist and educator walked on stage to enthusiastic applause.
Suzuki outlined several ways that humanity is putting a dent in the planet, such as overpopulation, an economy flawed in its evaluation of natural resources – a forest, he argued, provides valuable ecological services that standard economic models do not account for – and harmful technologies of industries driven by profit.
“When you add these things together – our numbers, our technological muscle power, our consumptive appetite in the global economy – that means that we have become a force that has never before existed in the 3.9 billion years of life on Earth,” he said. “We have become a force of nature.”
A biologist and geneticist by training, Suzuki appealed to empirical research: “We are now altering the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the planet” on an unprecedented scale, he said.
Suzuki also emphasized the shared etymology of the words “economy” and “ecology.”
“‘Oikos’,” he said, “is the Greek word for ‘household’ or ‘domain.’ Ecology is the study of home. Economics is the management of home.”
The problem, he continued, is that our society elevates the latter above the former, which results in unsustainable lifestyles. Moreover, he argued, an economy is an artificial structure, whereas an ecology is not. “Let’s put the ‘eco’ back in ‘economics,’” Suzuki said.
Suzuki also urged the audience to reassess the consumerist values of the West.
“What’s an economy for?” he asked. “Are there no limits? How much is enough? Am I happier with all this stuff?”
City living, he continued, has “cut us off from the world that keeps us alive.” Suzuki pointed to the mass urbanization of Canada – 85 per cent of Canadians now live in cities – and the world in general as a major factor in what he sees as humanity’s disregard for nature.
“If we don’t go outside, how can we fall in love with nature? And if we don’t love nature, how can we ever worry about what’s happening to it?”
