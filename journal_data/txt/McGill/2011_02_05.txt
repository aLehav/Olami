Councillors reluctant to speak for fear of legal reprisals
Correction appended – Sunday, Feb 6
SSMU Council voted early Friday morning to censure President Zach Newburgh for pursuing a contract with jobbook.com, a job-networking website for university students, without informing the Students’ Society.
The debate and censure took place in two separate confidential sessions, which together lasted for almost six hours. The original motion called for Newburgh’s resignation, and was amended in the second confidential session to call for public censure.
Speakers of Council Cathal Rooney-Cespedes and Raymond Xing sent an email to campus publications at 5:50 a.m. Friday, writing, “‘Resolved, That the SSMU President be faced with a public censure.’ Motions to censure require two-thirds majority of Council members… The SSMU Legislative Council hereby censures the President of SSMU.”
According to Robert’s Rules, the result of a censure is that “the member is put on notice that if he or she repeats the offence, he or she can be suspended or removed from membership or office.”
Newburgh told Council that he had been involved in a partnership with “Jobbook.biz Inc.” since September. His involvement was not disclosed to the Executive Committee until January, four months after entering into the agreement.
On September 20 the founder and CEO of Jobbook, Jean de Brabant, met with Newburgh. According to a January 19 memo from Newburgh to the Executive Committee obtained by The Daily, de Brabant is a McGill alum and former guest lecturer in the Faculty of Law. Newburgh wrote in the memo that he refused to meet with de Brabant upon first contact, but that de Brabant “begg[ed] for only a few minutes of [his] time.”
Without consulting fellow executives, upon meeting with de Brabant, Newburgh described in his memo how he signed a confidentiality agreement – since the website was yet to be patented – and began working with Jobbook with the intention of promoting the project to the SSMU executive and other universities.
In their partnership, Newburgh and de Brabant travelled on three separate occasions to schools in the United States and Britain to meet with presidents of other student unions. De Brabant paid for all travel and accommodations. In his October 27 report to Council, Newburgh stated that he “visited six (6) of the top eight (8) universities in the Northeast to discuss the creation of a network for student leaders of top North American educational institutions.”
Schools the two approached included Oxford, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Caltech, and Stanford.
Adam Khan, president of the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology (ASCIT), confirmed that he met with Newburgh. “Zach did come to California around mid-November with the founder of the company, Jean de Brabant. They both pitched myself as well as our treasurer the idea of partnering with them in this venture, and we accepted,” wrote Khan in an email to The Daily.
The minutes from the November 11 Council meeting detail that, “President Newburgh will be absent from Friday, November 19 to Friday, November 26 for American Thanksgiving.” However, in the memo, he noted that his trip to London lasted from November 18 to 22, dates that he requested for personal holiday.
Newburgh stated in his memo to the Executive Committee that he did not spend SSMU time or money on his partnership, though he admitted Thursday night to Council that he had missed one workday.
In an interview with The Daily, de Brabant said, “I know for a fact he [Newburgh] spoke to the Vice President Finance and Operations [Nick Drew], who didn’t discourage him in any way.” When asked to provide a date, de Brabant responded that Drew was informed a month and a half ago.
Multiple councillors and executives were unaware of the fact that Drew was informed of the venture weeks before documents were brought forth to the Executive Committee.
According to an email obtained by The Daily sent to Drew on January 13, and forwarded to SSMU General Manager Pauline Gervais on January 17, Newburgh stated that he had “a financial interest in the company.” In confidential session, Newburgh claimed to have given up any personal stake February 3, hours before Council met. He then obtained a letter from de Brabant stating that he was working pro bono.
Newburgh disclosed his past financial stake in Jobbook only after being questioned by numerous councillors on the subject.
The McGill name is used on the website for Jobbook, which states that, “With the objective of recruiting the best and the brightest Members, Jobbook has entered into partnership agreements with the Presidents of the Student Unions of Caltech, Stanford, Berkeley, Imperial College London, University College London, Johns Hopkins and McGill, as well as many others.” The site was officially launched February 2.
Several councillors refused to publicly comment, or requested to remain anonymous for fear of legal reprisals. One councillor told The Daily, “There’s a reason for which certain individuals were quoted anonymously, being the unfounded but seriously implied legal action that speaks to the character of any individual that would bring about this situation in the first place.”
Pauline Gervais, general manager of SSMU, spoke in the confidential session, an uncommon action for a SSMU permanent employee. She spoke against Newburgh’s removal.
Multiple sources have also confirmed that VP Internal Tom Fabian threatened to resign if Newburgh was removed from his position.
Councillor Eli Freedman spoke about how this will affect Council from this point on. “Council is probably not going to be able to accomplish anything for the rest of the year,” he said. “I don’t think there will be any more trust.”
Referring to a story in the Tribune published Friday morning, VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki said, “I don’t think the comment that there is no harm done to the Society is correct. There was definitely harm done to the Society. In my view, there were policies that he clearly went against, and he’s lost the moral authority to guide the Society.”
Neither Newburgh nor Drew responded to multiple requests for interview, including a request sent to Newburgh before he granted an interview to the Tribune.

Due to an editorial error, the printed version of this article (News, Feb 7, pg. 4) describes that Newburgh admitted to Council that he had missed one work day last night. In fact, Newburgh made the admission to Council Thursday night. The Daily regrets the error.

The controversial motion to abolish the General Assembly, authored by SSMU President Zach Newburgh, was referred to a committee after a Council vote
The controversial motion to abolish the General Assembly (GA), authored by SSMU President Zach Newburgh, was referred to a committee after a Council vote. The committee will conduct further research in hopes of improving the GA, and making the institution more democratic and accessible to students.
The Executive Committee were also asked why they failed to go on a retreat scheduled for the previous week. Newburgh replied, “Very frankly, members of the SSMU Executive were disappointed with the way in which the GA motion was brought up, and therefore refused to go on the Executive retreat.” This claim contradicted a statement made by VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew, who, in an interview  with The Daily attributed the cancellation of the retreat to excessive work.
The Executive’s decision to cancel the retreat cost SSMU $800.

The Black Students Network and Queer McGill co-hosted their first joint event, “Is it Dark in the Closet?” last Wednesday evening
The Black Students Network (BSN) and Queer McGill (QM) co-hosted their first joint event, “Is it Dark in the Closet?” last Wednesday evening.
Featured speaker Rinaldo Walcott, a Sociology and Equity Studies professor from the University of Toronto, spoke about the need for “anti-racist queer politics” to address black queer history. He asked the fifty-person audience to consider black queer people as “a part of a much longer history of black disenfranchisement and marginalization.”
Rojarra Armbrister, a BSN executive member, explained the idea behind the event’s focus on homosexuality within the black community.
“There is a lot of homophobia within the black community itself, and people want answers. We don’t know where it stems from,” Armbrister said.
She noted that homophobia is present in “this generation especially,” and explained why she felt last night’s event could contribute to finding answers.
“It’s more [about] educating ourselves and educating those around us about where this comes from and what we can do to fix it,” Armbrister added.
About fifty people attended the event. Gisele Ishema-Karekezi, a McGill student originally from Rwanda, also noted the uniqueness of the event.
“This is the first time they brought up the gay issues in the black community, so I was very excited,” said Ishema-Karekezi. “It’s not really talked about in the African community.”
According to Ryan Thom, a QM co-administrator, a long discussion between BSN and QM was devoted to, “How the space will be shaped so that it [would] be a place that both racialized black students could imagine themselves at and a place where queer students who aren’t necessarily black could also imagine themselves having a place at.”
According to Thom the discussion was “delicate but really productive.”
“We don’t always have the experience or perspective to come at [issues of race], and that’s something that all the progressive organizations, including Queer McGill, work toward,” Thom said. “That’s why we have these collaborations, that’s why we work together – to draw in a different audience.”
BSN will be collaborating with QPIRG for an event this week, and will be running several events in honour of Black History Month.
“I do anticipate that you will be seeing a lot more of these events.” Armbrister said regarding the club’s future plans.

A Warning from the United Nations WFP: “The margins between stability and chaos are perilously thin”
A statement released Friday by the United Nation’s World Food Programme (WFP) claims that the rising cost of food is a key factor in the current protests and uprisings across the Middle East.
“In many of the protests, demonstrators have brandished loaves of bread or displayed banners expressing anger about the rising cost of food staples such as lentils,” said the statement written by Josette Sheeran, the WFP’s executive director.
“These are the nutritional building blocks of life, and if people feel that rising prices are pushing these food items out of reach, growing anxiety adds to the general feeling of exclusion, resentment and despair,” the statement continued.
Shokry Gohar, a professor in the Islamic Studies department at McGill and originally from Egypt, agreed that rising food prices played a large role in public discontent, especially in his native country.
“The rise in food prices have had a very negative impact on the Egyptian people because annual income is very, very low. I don’t think the average Egyptian makes more than $2 a day,” he said.
“This makes it difficult for him to be able to buy supplies and all those sort of things for his family, so it has a very strong impact, and I think it is one of the reasons that has pushed the Egyptian people to take to the street,” Gohar added.
According to the WFP’s statement, “The UN Food and Agriculture Organization Food Price Index in January reached a new historic peak, rising for the seventh consecutive month and surpassing the peak of the 2007-2008 food price crisis.”
Gohar pointed out that rising food prices are not specific to North Africa and the Middle East. He noted that there have been significant hikes in global food prices over the past year.
“It’s not restricted to Egypt. It is a worldwide issue, but the Egyptian government did not respond to what is going on around the world,” he said. “In Egypt, the government did not react at all to this issue. It therefore became very difficult for the Egyptians to cope with the change.”
When asked if the Egyptian government could have done anything to remedy the situation, Gohar replied, “I think the government could have done a lot to cope with this problem.”
Jane Howard, the WFP’s public information officer, agreed that rising food prices are a global phenomenon, however, she also noted that it is an issue with varying degrees. “There is no suggestion that countries in North Africa and the Middle East are running out of food. Media reports say that in Egypt, for example, the government has sufficient wheat supplies to last until June this year,” she said, indicating that populations do not necessarily need to be starving for food prices to become an issue.
“Even in times of stability, many people throughout North Africa and the Middle East struggle to access the nutritious food they require for a balanced diet,” Howard said. “All governments are struggling with the rising cost of food globally…higher prices globally will mean less food for the hungry.”
“[Egypt’s] like everywhere else in the world but the governments of the world are trying to compensate [for the rise in food prices] through giving people a sufficient income so that they can deal with the increasing food prices,” Gohar said.
Haroun Bouazzi, a Tunisian Montrealer who helped organize the recent Tunisia rally in Montreal and is involved with Collectif de solidarité au Canada avec les luttes sociales en Tunisie, echoed Howard’s view that food is not the main problem in Tunisia.
While “food prices did play a role in the discontent in Tunisia,” Bouazzi said, “it was not the main reason people went to the streets. It was the lack of hope. It was more political than anything else. It’s not because it’s expensive, it’s because they don’t have a job.”
Though food prices in 2008 did cause some protests in Tunisia, they are not an immediate concern in Tunisia at the moment, according to Bouazzi.
“Nobody is dying from hunger right now in Tunisia. The bread and other foods are subsidized. For sure, some people cannot buy meat and stuff like that, but it is not a major social problem, for example, to buy bread,” he said.
Howard further emphasized the fact that food is just one part of the greater picture.
“Rising food prices have undoubtedly been a contributing factor in the political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, but they have not been the central issue,” she said. “They are only part of a complex array of different issues driving the protests, such as unemployment, political reform and freedom of speech.”
However, the WFP statement warned that the rising cost of food should not be taken lightly as food and market volatility can quickly translate into unrest.
“When it comes to food, the margins between stability and chaos are perilously thin,” the WFP concluded. “It is still too early to quantify the role that rising food prices are playing in the current wave of discontent.”

Event highlights student collaboration and change
Last Monday evening, McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS), the student-run McGill Food Systems Project (MFSP), and the Office of Sustainability hosted “Deconstructing Dinner”, an event aimed at increasing awareness of positive developments in student food services on campus.
The event also celebrated important projects between students and MFDS. Student initiatives such as McGill Feeding McGill have been critical primary steps toward increasing sustainability on campus. McGill Feeding McGill is an initiative that will make the farms on Macdonald Campus McGill’s main fruit and vegetable supplier beginning next fall. MFDS is also working on plans to serve more sustainable seafood, pork, and chicken.
The recent appointment of Laura Rhodes as food systems administrator, who spoke at the event, was another major step towards sustainability.
The position of Food Systems Administrator was created to encourage food sustainability on campus, initiate a Strategic Action Plan for MFDS, help organize applied student research, and facilitate collaboration between administration and students on such issues.
The Strategic Action Plan, drafted in the fall of 2010 outlines the short-and long-term changes MFDS will undergo with regards to food sustainability, transparency, teamwork, trust, and a more sustainable business model.
Recently, MFDS has come under a lot of criticism from student media, in particular from The Daily.
According to Oliver de Volpi, executive chef of MFDS, who also spoke at the event, these criticisms are often one-sided and miss signs of progress.
“We’ve screwed up a bunch of times, but for everything that gets screwed up that gets printed, there’s three or four actions that are good, and sometimes the screw-ups aren’t as they’re put out to be… There are two sides to these things and we’re hearing one side only,” he said.
De Volpi referred to Monday’s Daily article, which criticized MFDS’s recent price hikes. “The balance has to be made: what we can do for sustainable initiatives and what the students are willing to accept paying for. That’s what we’re trying to do, figure how much they want, at what time frame they want it, and what they want first. We consult with students all the time on these things.”
Sarah Archibald, a student co-coordinator of the MFSP who has been working closely with de Volpi and the MFDS, has had a very positive experience so far. “For me, it’s the first time I’ve worked with ‘the man’ and it’s been incredibly empowering to see this change.”
“When you are working on a scale to feed 30,000 people it’s pretty easy to be critiqued, I’d say,” said Archibald, “but they’re always open to consultation, criticism, and questions.”
Dana Lahey, another student involved with MFSP, said that one of the reasons for the success of recent projects was the collaboration between students and staff.
“To me that’s what’s made this whole process work,” said Lahey. The changes were made possible when they approached the administration with a positive attitude: “We wanted to work with them, and we wanted to understand their perspective.”
Much of the discussion at “Deconstructing Dinner” revolved around applied student research. Many changes have been initiated by students. For example, a GEOG 302 Management Proposal created in 2009 suggested that MFDS hire a food sustainability coordinator, independent research projects on chicken purchasing options, and the possibility of offering more vegetarian meals.
“I think [applied student research] is the best thing that we have to offer as a university,” said de Volpi. “It makes us look so good, it gives students the opportunity to do research that they wouldn’t be able to, it gives the farm the opportunity to do more work. All around, everybody wins. We’re doing 95 per cent of the recommendations already.”
“We really want to include applied student research and collaboration throughout the entire cycle,” said Archibald, “Everything from food scraps to the planting at Mac campus, where the Plant Science students will be involved – it’s all a cycle.”
After the speeches Lahey spoke of the importance and of the event.
“I’m hoping that events like this will keep on making those personal connections, and that more and more people on campus start talking together and working together,” she said.
“It’s really exciting to think of where this could go and the idea that this University could actually be a model for the world,” added Archibald.
De Volpi was equally positive: “We’re going to be something that I hope other universities are going to look at as a model,” he said. “I hope people are going to look at us and say, that’s something to be proud of.’”
“Trying to cultivate systems outside of the industrial food system box really works when we become part of the food system instead of a recipient. We really have to push ourselves out of the box,” said activist Jon Steinman during his talk at the event.
According to Steinman, this involves students working with administration instead of against. For Rhodes and student speakers, the progress made so far is proof of this.

McGill Food and Dining Services promise to establish commission to increase communication with students
McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS) is developing a new commission to work with students to improve transparency and publish relevant financial information after controversy over food price hikes.
MFDS was heavily criticized in January when students from several McGill residences returned to find that food prices in their cafeterias had been raised over the holidays.
To protest, students formed the group Perturbed Residents Interested in Changing Expensive Dining (PRICED) to petition against the price hikes.
Last week, PRICED and student representatives met with MFDS Director Mathieu Laperle to dispute the price hikes. They came out of the meeting with the goal of improving communication between MFDS and the student body through the establishment of a new commission.
“In general, I think the meeting went really well,” said Valentine Sergeev, one of the organizers of the petition.
“We talked for a long time and they admitted that they might have made a mistake in the way that they handled the price increase, but they also explained that the actual price hike was out of their control,” he said.
MFDS executive chef Oliver de Volpi explained, “The prices of food are going up recently, that that led us to raising them in the cafeterias.”
“These are things we’ve absorbed up till now,” he said. “But we don’t want to leave next years students with this year’s debt.”
Planning for the commission is still in its infancy. It has have not decided whether student representatives will be chosen through the Inter-Residence Council, or whether new positions will be elected.
Laperle hopes to reach an agreement on the commission before the end of the current fiscal year and implement it next fall.
In the future, MFDS has agreed to keep students more aware of their plans, but highlighted existing communication channels such as the Food and Dining Advisory Committee (FADAC), which includes representatives from SSMU, MCSS, PGSS.
“Our only raison-d’être [here] is for the students,” de Volpi said. “We have to provide nutritious meals and respect certain University regulations, but aside from that everything the students are telling us is what we’re implementing.”
However, de Volpi also noted that students did not make adequate use of the communication channels available to them before creating PRICED.
“They went to a different sort of extreme,” he said. “Students have some responsibility to find out the right channel to vent or express concerns, and we put those out there. They’re not in everybody’s hands, but they’re not more than a touch away.”
Laperle encouraged students to email MFDS, stop by their office, or fill out the Talk2Us forms available online or in the cafeterias.
Students were receptive to MFDS’s attempts to open communication lines.
“They’re doing a good job in comparison to what they are obligated to do,” said Sean Reginio, president of  the Inter-Residence Council, “but they aren’t perfect, and they can do better. We want to work together on the same team to improve things.”
Monique Lauzon, MFDS nutritionist, marketing, and quality counsellor, said, “The idea is to have the student’s point of view and voice in terms of the different planning that we do within MFDS.”
Reginio hopes that the commission can help students to understand why the MFDS has made these decisions and to avoid false assumptions in the future.
“The MFDS is doing a good job,” he said. “They’re good people working hard towards making the service as good as possible, and we have to accept that these things happen. We’re looking forward to working towards that sustainable solution for improved transparency.”

How other student-run campus food outlets have fared without the Arch Café
Despite widely publicized mobilization around the closure of the Architecture Café at the beginning of the academic year, student-run food outlets on campus have not seen a significant increase in business.
Snax 
Jordana Weiss, U3 Arts, has worked at Snax, the student-run food outlet of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), for two and a half years.
“It was nuts,” she said of sales at the beginning of the year, though it is “less now, because the whole boycott [of McGill Food and Dining Services, MFDS] kind of died down.”
Majd Al Khaldi, AUS VP Finance, claimed that the increase in Snax sales following Arch Café protests only lasted two weeks.
“There was an increase in sales,” he said, “but not necessarily in our revenues.” Snax is being run more efficiently this year due to better record keeping and management, but has not seen a drastic change in profits. Prices were increased last semester “out of necessity” for the first time in two or three years. Even so, another increase may be necessary to keep the coffee shop out of the red.
Al Khaldi noted that Snax, though under the jurisdiction of AUS, has separate management and thus has not been affected by AUS, financial troubles this year.
Frostbite
Etienne De Muelenaere, VP Finance for the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) was unable to say whether Frostbite, the society’s food outlet in Macdonald Engineering, had seen a rise in business. “It’s hard to say, because we weren’t keeping stats before,” he said. However he did note that EUS has improved record keeping this year, and altered Frostbite’s operating hours to fit student demand.
EUS recently voted to absorb the Architecture Students’ Association into their organization, but De Muelenaere explained that it is difficult to see whether this has changed the business environment around Frostbite. According to De Muelenaere, EUS does not keep track of what faculties their customers are from.
MK and SSMU
Midnight Kitchen (MK), a student-run food service that provides lunch by donation for students, served lunch outdoors during October to promote the boycott. Council voted on February 3 to renew MK’s opt-outable fee, which will be put to online referendum. In the text of the resolution, MK states that it provides “a balanced and complete lunch on a pay-as-you-can basis to an average of 150 students every weekday.”
Other food vendors in the SSMU building are not part of McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS), and negotiate individual leases with SSMU. Revenue numbers for these businesses are not available to the public.
MFDS boycott
The boycott of MFDS, organized by Mobilization McGill (MM), began in October 2010. An event on Facebook promoting the boycott had over 3,000 supporters, and, encouraged students not to resume business at MFDS cafeterias until the Arch Café reopened.
The issue of reopening the Arch Café was presented to the University’s Senate, and later directed to the Board of Governors. At SSMU Legislative Council on January 19, President Zach, Newburgh refused to comment publicly on the current status of discussions, or even confirm that discussion addressing the reopening of the Arch Café is ongoing.
Guy Lifshitz, a MM member, expressed disappointment in the success of the boycott. In a meeting that was held on November 2 between MM members and director of MFDS Mathieu Laperle, Laperle claimed that the boycott had no effect on business. Lifshitz said this was “not necessarily surprising, but unfortunate.” Lifshitz said that he had hoped the formation of MM would prompt the administration to change their system of consultation and give students the opportunity for more meaningful input in the future. MFDS did not respond to The Daily’s requests for an interview.
