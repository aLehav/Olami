EdUS Strikes, AUS GA Fails to Meet Quorum 
As approximately 200 students took to the streets of Montreal on January 17 to demonstrate in opposition Law 21, students of the McGill Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) were also organizing against the Coalition Avenir Québec’s (CAQ) controversial secularism law. Coordinated by SSMU VP External Adam Gwiazda-Amsel and a number of departmental associations, the AUS held a General Assembly (GA) that same Friday night in attempts to strike in solidarity with the Faculties of Education, Law, and Medicine, as well as UQAM, on Monday, January 20. Though a Facebook event that was created on January 13, the GA was officially communicated by the Faculty via email just over 40 hours before it was scheduled to begin.
The GA was held in Leacock 132 and was slated to begin at 4:30 on Friday evening. However, the following 30 minutes were spent with students filing in and out of the lecture hall, as the AUS counted attendees to try to meet quorum. Official attendance count was recorded at 90 students – about one per cent of the Arts undergraduate student population. The meeting failed to meet quorum, which was set at 500, accounting for approximately six per cent of total enrolled Arts undergraduate students. Failing to meet quorum meant that the AUS was unable to pass either a binding or nonbinding motion to be passed online, and at 5:01 p.m., the GA was called to a close.
Speaking to the Daily after the meeting dissolved, Gwiazda-Amsel expressed his disappointment with the lack of mobilization beforehand, but also his satisfaction at the “impressive turnout” despite sudden notice and the fact that “only four [SSMU executives did] classroom announcements.” He cited “getting 90 people out to hear about the opportunities that are going on and encouraging them to start conversations” as a “great beginning,” also emphasizing that “this is not the end” of student mobilization against Law 21.
Looking ahead to the next week, Gwiazda-Amsel stressed the importance of supporting Education students and those affected by Law 21, despite a strike not being officially endorsed by AUS.
“I look forward to working with the executives who are interested in serving their student body on the issues that are important to them. I think it’s very easy to say that, well, if people aren’t mobilizing themselves or if they’re not coming to us during office hours and telling us what they want us to work on, then it’s not really our problem,” he explained. “It’s very easy to disengage in that way. It takes real courage to go consult students, make classroom announcements, ask what students want you to work on, and then mobilize yourself so you’re not shifting labour onto other people and to everyone who did that, I say ‘congratulations.’”
The Education Undergraduate Society (EdUS) had its own struggles ahead of the strike, as their initial GA on January 10 failed to meet quorum. However, the strike was later ratified online, with the vote taking place on January 14 and 15, exceeding quorum and obtaining 24.4 per cent of votes from the student body, with 94.6 per cent voting in favour. According to GwiazdaAmsel, it had the largest turnout of any EdUS vote, including this year’s elections.
A soft picket line was held by the EdUS outside the Education Building on McTavish Street on Monday, January 20, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Gwiazda-Amsel, who picketed in solidarity with Education students, tells the Daily that “people were generally receptive” during the action. “Some people were frustrated, and people always are. Generally I feel like people on campus support the action against Law 21 and want to further that conversation.”
Elaborating on the strike, the VP External stated, “[we’re] reclaiming the space from the Quebec government, and saying we’re not going to become teachers or file into the ranks when certain members of the faculty are systematically not able or allowed to do this.” Student action against Law 21 will continue to be organized outside of official strikes: student group McGill contre la loi 21 is holding its next meeting on Tuesday, January 28 at 12 p.m. at QPIRG-McGill offices and a follow up demonstration is being organized on March 21, coinciding with the International Day Against Racial Discrimination.

Union Accreditation Received January 15
After months of organizing and card-signing, the Student-Run Service Members’ Union (SSMUnion) has received accreditation. As stated in a post on their Facebook page, the union is “now legally recognized as the union representing all nonmanagement employees of SSMU.” It was granted formal status on January 15, after submitting signed union cards for verification to the Tribunal administratif du travail (TAT) of Quebec. Since the TAT confirmed that at least 50 per cent plus one of SSMU employees have signed and submitted cards, the union has been certified without an election.
SSMUnion’s parent union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), is also the union that represents the Concordia Student Union (CSU) and the Graduate Student Union (GSU) at Concordia, giving the organization relevant experience on unionizing student workers in Quebec.
The SSMUnion hopes to tackle issues faced by the over 100 employees of SSMU. Belle Sullivan, a member of the organizing committee and acting communications coordinator, tells the Daily that these issues include “unpredictable fluctuations in schedules and workload, lack of job security from being kept on temporary contracts, histories of harassment, and serious and systemic problems with communication.”
Those covered under the union range from volunteers to full-time paid employees. SSMU executives are not included in the coverage, as they are considered a part of management. This includes, for example, those working within an organization run under SSMU, such as Queer McGill or the Sexual Assault Center of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS), and those who do administrative work in SSMU. Claire Downie, one student who recently joined the union, works in the organizing committee. Downie tells the Daily she got involved because she believes “unions can benefit every worker;” however, she feels strongly “that having protections provided by a union is especially essential for McGill student workers. Students often manage a job, schoolwork, and involvement in extracurricular activities, which can get extremely stressful.”
The next steps for the SSMUnion include electing executives, working to create internal bywlaws – they will be governed by CUPE’s bylaws until they do so – and beginning collective bargaining with SSMU. From there, the Union will negotiate wages, working conditions, additional resources, and other demands with their employer (SSMU).
Most importantly, the organizing committee is preparing for their first General Assembly (GA), “where union members will be able to vote on by-laws, elect executives, and amend our constitution,” Sullivan says. “We’re trying to get as many union members as possible to come out to the GA, because we want everyone’s opinions to be heard as we move forward as a union.”
Although over 50 per cent of SSMU employees have signed cards and joined, organizers are continuing to reach out to workers to join the Union. While doing so, they are listening to their grievances to ensure that the needs of all SSMU employees are heard, and that all union members are being negotiated for.
“If you’re a SSMU employee who hasn’t yet signed a card, or you’ve already signed a card but have yet to be involved with the SSMUnion, please reach out!” Sullivan says. “We want everyone’s opinions to be heard, because the SSMUnion is here to represent every SSMU employee!” You can follow the SSMUnion’s Facebook page for updates on upcoming events, including how to join the union and information about the upcoming first General Assembly.
