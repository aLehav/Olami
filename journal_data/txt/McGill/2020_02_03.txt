UGE Encourages Community to Boycott Dr. Zucker’s Talk
On Thursday, January 23, the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at McGill University hosted a talk by Dr. Kenneth J. Zucker, a child psychologist from Ontario who works with children and adolescents facing gender dysphoria. He is also a professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto.
Dr. Zucker has been largely criticized for his work, which has been called conversion therapy by transgender-rights activists. In 1994, Dr. Zucker said that one of the goals of his clinic was to “help the child feel more secure about his or her actual gender.” In 2015, he was dismissed from his position at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health when reviewers found that his clinic “focused on intensive assessment and treatment in lieu of more modern approaches” which included “educating and supporting parents to accept a child’s gender expression.”
Dr. Zucker was invited to the school by Professor Samuel Veissiere, a co-director of the Culture, Mind, and Brain program at McGill. When asked about his reasoning for inviting Dr. Zucker, Professor Veissiere told the Daily that “When individuals for whom transition didn’t work tell us they feel excluded from this conversation, we need to listen and learn.” Professor Veissere also argued that calling Dr. Zucker’s work “conversion therapy” is a “misconception.”
To provide support to trans and non-binary members of the McGill community who may have been affected by the talk, the Joint BoardSenate Committee on Equity’s (JBSCE) Subcommittee on Queer People came up with the idea of holding a “positive space” at the same time as the event, which they shared on their Facebook page. This idea was then put into action by Meryem Benslimane, who is the Equity Education Advisor of the Office of the Provost and Vice-Principal (Equity and Academic) and co-chair of the JBSCE Subcommittee on Queer People, with the support of Angela Campbell, Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies). Benslimane told the Daily that the committee’s number one priority at the time “was to provide a positive space for trans and non-binary students, staff and faculty (and their allies) who might have been hurt by this event happening, and who would have felt the need to gather and be together in solidarity.” She added, “[we] wanted to let people affected by the talk know that ‘we see you and we love you’, and that we would not stand idly by and remain silent.”
Furthermore, the Union for Gender Empowerment (UGE) posted an open letter on Facebook in response to the event, which was signed by TVMcGill, Queer Engineer McGill, SSMU President Bryan Buraga, VP External Affairs Adam Gwiazda-Amsel, and VP University Affairs Madeline Wilson. The letter argued that Professor Veissiere was “determined to hold this event under the guise of academic freedom whilst ignoring the academic responsibility that goes alongside it.” The letter overall denounced the “speaking event and [encouraged] all those who may have been interested in attending to boycott.”
In an interview with the Daily, Jeanne Prevost, Finance and Co-op Coordinator for the UGE said that hosting speakers like Dr. Zucker “tells the transgender members of the McGill community that their identity is up for debate, that some professors care more about giving a platform to harmful theories and endangering their students’ wellbeing than they do about their academic responsibility.” She further noted that “every time an advocate of harmful theories is platformed, and subsequently their ideas, it legitimizes them further and enables discrimination against these vulnerable groups.”
McGill students voiced similar concerns about the talk. VC Renaud, a trans U2 Psychology student, told the Daily that “having a speaker like this at McGill is not only harmful to the trans community in general, it could reinforce transphobic views in the general public and give well meaning medical professionals and med students the wrong information, which also has a negative impact on trans people.”
At this time, the McGill administration has not released an official statement on the matter.

Investment in Social Housing “Necessary,” Activists Say
Two Montreal organizations are engaged in a struggle over the future of the former Canada Malting site in Saint-Henri – Renwick Development and a group of local residents called “À nous la Malting.” At the heart of the conflict stands two different visions of what kind of development is needed for the neighborhood. Renwick Development wants to build a mix of condominiums, social housing units, commercial services, and spaces for “community needs.” “À nous la Malting” wants a 100 per cent community-based social housing project and sees condominiums as a threat to Saint-Henri’s social fabric. Saint-Henri has seen an influx of luxury condominiums in recent years, as the availability of affordable housing has plummeted.
The hulking structure of the former Canada Malting is a familiar sight for residents of Le Sud-Ouest. Its decaying facilities have been abandoned since 1989, even though the location itself is of prime real estate quality, right by the Lachine Canal. This site “is very complicated” and presents “a ton of issues” as Julie Bélanger, director of the office of Le Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoît Dorais, told the Daily. According to Bélanger, it needs decontamination, and it has historical value and components that need to be preserved and restored.
Noam Schnitzer tells the Daily he is confident that his group, Renwick Development, can take care of these issues and deliver a sustainable project, one where “the provision of the services would not depend upon government funding.” He is the founder and developer of the company, and is responsible for the Malting site project. He presents his vision as “an inclusive project, open for everyone.” The site is currently owned by Quonta Holdings, an investment management firm.
Schnitzer plans to build “a total of 240 units, of which 80 will be social housing units, and the rest will be condominiums.” With regards to the social housing units, he intends to construct them in a separate building on a vacant spot of land. The remainder of the square footage would then be divided between commercial spaces and a collaborative workspace for artists, among other things. According to Schnitzer, the social housing units will be tailored to the needs of the community, which is “not a homogenous scenario; the need is actually for family-centric social housing units.” He intends for most of them to have two or three bedrooms. But 80 social housing units are “not even close to enough,” according to Shannon Franssen, coordinator for Solidarité SaintHenri, a coalition of community groups active in the neighbourhood. She tells the Daily that Saint-Henri needs at least 500 new social housing units, a number that the group arrived at by looking at the number of households who spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent.
Schnitzer feels like Renwick Development would do more than its fair share, going “well beyond” municipal requirements in terms of the proportion of social housing units. But Franssen insists: “We need to maximize the use of the vacant land that is available;” otherwise the needs of the community won’t be met, she says. Solidarité Saint-Henri supports “À nous la Malting,” a collective of residents and local community organizations founded in 2017 who is working on a project “that would involve 200 social housing units.” Franssen says that technical questions still need to be addressed, but that more information should be available in the next few weeks. A public presentation is scheduled for March 3, and the city expects a business plan and a feasibility study by the end of February.
City officials seem both enthusiastic and worried about this project. “We hope to see actual numbers,” Julie Bélanger tells the Daily. “If they have a sustainable business plan, we will support [the collective], but we have not yet seen this” in the previous progress reports.
Elected officials funded the collective and gave it over a year to come up with a proposition. One thing that seems clear is that the City of Montreal is not going to buy the property: “We don’t have the means to buy it, and it wouldn’t be responsible to do so,” according to Bélanger. However, she recognizes the need for affordable housing in the area. “Le Sud-Ouest is the borough with the lowest rate of vacancy in Montreal, [at] under one per cent,” she admits; “it’s a big problem.”
The current municipal administration has pledged to create 12,000 new social housing units in Montreal, what Bélanger calls “a record number.” But to deliver this, the City has to think strategically. Given the difficulties presented by this site, the City claims the cost per unit would be extremely high. “They would probably be the most expensive social housing units in the country,” Bélanger says. “Financially, it wouldn’t be a responsible decision.”
Montreal is currently experiencing a 15-year low vacancy rate, now at 1.5 per cent, according to a recent report by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. As Bélanger underscored, the situation is particularly dire in Le Sud-Ouest, where the vacancy rate has dropped as low as 0.5 per cent. Such numbers naturally lead to concerns for low-income tenants who struggle to find – and keep – a decent place to live.
Amy Darwish, from the Comité d’Action de Parc-Extension (CAPE), is “very concerned that if there is no action taken, a lot of people could find themselves being homeless as of July 1” she tells the Daily. The CAPE is not directly involved, but supports “À nous la Malting” in their struggle. For them, it’s absolutely necessary to invest massively in social housing. “The crisis is twofold” she explains. “There are fewer apartments and the ones that are available are much more expensive.” This, according to Darwish, means that we are likely to see more evictions and more race-based discrimination against tenants across the city.
This reflects a trend noticed by Solidarité Saint-Henri in their neighbourhood. “There is such a high demand for rental units that people are willing to waive their own right; they’re willing to pay more to live in Saint-Henri,” Franssen tells the Daily. “This is what gentrification looks like.” According to her, part of the reason why housing is getting so expensive, “is because of real-estate speculation by developers like Renwick Development who want to build luxury condominiums on the canal.”
This is a concern that Schnitzer dismisses. “For renters, the term ‘gentrification’ doesn’t exist; rent is controlled in Montreal. Simply because someone builds next door doesn’t mean that your rent will increase,” he tells the Daily. In theory, the Regulation respecting the criteria for the fixing of rent does limit the possible rent increases in the province well below what a free market would allow – but this may not reflect what actually happens. Yet-to-be-published research done by Solidarité Saint-Henri shows that rent has increased by an average of 91 per cent in the neighbourhood since 1996, whereas, according to the group, “if the landlords respected the law, we would’ve expected an increase of about 45 per cent.”

Renwick Development says that they are “in discussion with [Le SudOuest] and waiting for the approval process to begin,” while Bélanger says that “no project has been authorized at the moment.” The city has an informal agreement with “À nous la Malting” that nothing will happen until they receive the details of their plan. Whatever the outcome is, the next few weeks are likely to be crucial for the future of the Canada Malting site and the residents of Saint-Henri.

Members of the McGill and Montreal Community Reflect on Tragedy Three Years Later
A small group of McGill students and Montreal community members gathered in the MacDonald Engineering Building mezzanine to honour the six victims of the Quebec City massacre on January 29, 2020 – the third anniversary of the attack.
On the same date in 2017, a shooter opened fire in the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City mosque, shortly after evening prayer. Azzeddine Soufiane, Abdelkrim Hassane, Mamadou Tanou Barry, Ibrahima Barry, Aboubaker Thabti, and Khaled Belkacemi were killed, and 19 others were injured, including Aymen Derbali, who was paralyzed by the attack.
The commemoration was held in partnership with the second annual Muslim Awareness Week (MAW), which takes place in Quebec from January 25–31 each year. Ehab Lotayef, a member of McGill’s Board of Governors and coordinator of the MAW organizing committee, described the week as “an initiative by the Muslim community to try to go beyond just compassion and sympathy after what happened in 2017, and to take that to the level of trying to build bridges and connections.”
Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) Christopher Manfredi and Caroline Savic, a representative of the Quebec National Assembly for Westmount-Saint-Louis, spoke on behalf of the McGill and Montreal communities, respectively. The Provost led a moment of silence.
Hamza Lahmimsi, president of the Muslim Student Association, spoke on the lasting effects this act of terror. “It is important to remember that no such tragedy occurs in a vacuum,” he stated. “Women were left widowed; children, fatherless. A whole community was wounded by the loss of their beloved friend. All Muslims were shaking at the realization that it could have been them in that mosque. How can a community be at peace when the place that gives them the most peace is no longer safe to enter?”
Professor Khalid Medani from the Institute of Islamic Studies emphasized the importance of accurate Muslim representation in the media to prevent the perpetuation of ignorance and prejudice. “We, of course, represent a diversity of different nationalities, points of view, ethnicities, and that is something that, surprisingly, is not always projected sufficiently in the media,” Medani told attendees. “We really want to encourage the media also to represent Muslims in a realistic way – that has such an important impact on how people percieve Islam in general, and Muslim-Canadians in particular.”
The event finished with a walk to the tree planted on campus in memoriam of the mass shooting. For each name read of the victims who lost their lives, as well as Aymen Derbali, who has been permanently paralyzed, an attendee placed a white rose under the tree. This portion of the event also provided time for reflection and prayer in front of the memorial.

Participants Talk Affordable Student Housing
On Monday, January 27, a group composed of SSMU representatives, community members, and housing activists convened to discuss affordable student housing in Montreal.
As the first in a series of workshops hosted by SSMU and the Milton Parc Citizens’ Committee, the public assembly featured representatives from La communauté Milton Parc, the Concordia Housing and Job Resource Centre (HOJO), and Unité de travail pour l’implantation de logement étudiant (UTILE), who each spoke about their organizations’ experiences.
Dimitrios Roussopoulos, from La communauté Milton Parc, opened the session by providing a brief history of the Milton Parc community and communal housing movements in Montreal. Roussopoulos clarified the distinction between Milton Parc as a neighborhood and the Milton Parc co-operative, the latter of which is the largest publicly-owned co-op in North America. Roussopoulos also highlighted the work of community activist Lucia Kowaluk – whose efforts and leadership shaped the community – and strongly recommended that students read Villages in Cities, a comprehensive history of the Milton Parc community, which he co-authored. He emphasized the importance of creating more co-ops, highlighting that the Milton Parc community “removed six urban city blocks in the second biggest city in Canada off the capitalist market,” which he described as “quite an accomplishment.”
Following Roussopoulos’ talk, Laurent Lévesque of UTILE took the floor. He described the seven year-old organization’s mission as “try[ing] to expand nonprofit and co-operative housing options,” with a particular focus on students. Lévesque expressed concern over new forms of housing speculation and development, asserting that “in the last three years, the average rents in the Plateau for a three bedroom apartment went up by 30 per cent.” Citing the fact that these rent increases are occurring in areas with the greatest concentrations of McGill students, Lévesque stated that “the housing crisis that Montreal is facing is also a student housing crisis.” He added that the quick turnover of students doesn’t help – each year, new incoming students arrive, introducing a new population of potentially exploitable residents.
These issues highlight the already intense need for affordable, accessible student housing, something that UTILE is actively working towards. Currently under construction is a housing project called the Woodnote, a 90-unit student co-operative expected to house 144 Concordia undergraduates when completed, set to open this summer. Lévesque summarized his and UTILE’s objectives, saying “the goal of building not-for-profit student housing now is not just to have options for students in the short term, but also to plan for future housing crises.”
When asked how to get students excited about housing, Lévesque stated that the best way is to make it personal. “It seems abstract when you talk about housing,” he explained, “but when you talk about your house, it becomes very tangible.”
Lastly, Leanne Ashworth from HOJO highlighted the importance of easily accessible, accurate information, which is often hard for students to find. Per HOJO, this is especially true for international students who arrive and need to find a place to live as soon as possible. These students, she explained, are more vulnerable – and landlords know it. Ashworth noted personal privacy as a prime opportunity for exploitation, explaining that landlords will often ask for excessive amounts of information, and desperate students will provide it. She observed that, “For a lot of students, when they come in and they’re given a[n application] form and they have no time to find an apartment, they will give everything.”
Beyond their personal privacy initiatives, HOJO also helps students to advocate for themselves and organize with their neighbors. “A cool thing about organizing students,” Ashworth explained, “is that students know how to do homework.” Among the resources Ashworth provided was the informational site likehome.info (lappart.info in French, zufangba.info in Mandarin), which is designed to make housing issues more accessible to students. Though HOJO is a Concordia-based group, Ashworth emphasized that she welcomes McGill students to attend HOJO events. Their upcoming workshop on leasing and rent is slated to take place on March 23 from 12:00 p.m.–1:00 p.m.
The event was catered by Midnight Kitchen and sponsored in part by the SSMU VP External and the SSMU Community Affairs Commissioner, who guided the group discussion. The next workshop in this series, covering Frosh, St. Patrick’s Day, and being a respectful neighbour, will take place on February 24. Students should be aware that the Montreal police will be present at this session. The following workshop on March 23 will cover homelessness in the community. At the time of print, the event page does not say that police will be present.
For students interested in participating in the conversation, there is an ongoing SSMU survey open to the McGill community: https://forms.gle/AABWCoU1QeBJ6sxp8
