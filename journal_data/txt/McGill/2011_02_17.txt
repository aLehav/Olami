Both landlord associations and tenant groups dissatisfied with this year’s predictions
On January 25, the Régie du logement du Québec issued a statement that Quebec tenants and landlords should expect a rent increase of approximately 0.5 per cent this year. Rents for apartments with gas and electric heating could increase by as much as 0.6 per cent according to an RDL statement.
For an apartment with a monthly rent of $650, the 0.5 per cent increase would translate to an additional $3.25 each month, translating into $39 annually.
Régie spokesperson Jean-Pierre Leblanc said that the 0.5 per cent estimate comes from “the cost of renovations, tax increase, maintenance, and heating…calculated according to Statistics Canada figures for these increased costs across the whole province of Quebec.”
Leslie Bagg, community organizer with the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Community Council, explained how increased rents are examined before the Régie.
“If the rent increase is contested and it goes to the [Régie], then [it] does the calculation based on all the expenses that the landlord did in the previous year,” she said. “All those expenses are taken into account.”
“The rent increase could be a lot more for a particular city or building if there was a major tax increase or repair costs,” said Leblanc.
Martin Messier, president of the Association des propriétaires du Québec, said the increase would not be enough to cover the costs of maintaining a building.
“We cannot keep up with the increase of costs that we have. … If a landlord redid a roof in 2010, it will take that owner more than thirty years to get back their investment,” said Messier.
“We have landlords postponing major repairs as much as possible because they simply can’t afford them,” Messier added. “[These postponements] affect the quality of buildings in Quebec.”
Bagg indicated that students are especially at risk of illegal rent hikes in lease agreements.
“Students are a prime target more for the rent increases that happen between tenants because they often aren’t aware that they do have the right to know what the previous tenant was paying and that they can contest it at the [Régie],” she said.
“It’s important that people know what their rights are when it comes to rent increases,” Bagg said.
“Students are one of the groups that unscrupulous landlords unfortunately prey upon for those kinds of increases,” she pointed out.

Braving the elements in commemoration of missing and murdered indigenous women
Approximately 100 people gathered at Cabot Square, and walked east on Ste. Catherine to Phillips Square this past Monday as part of the second annual Memorial March for Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women.
Missing Justice, an activist volunteer collective, organized the march, which took place in solidarity with similar marches across Canada. Monica van Schaik, one of the march’s organizers, explained that activism around this issue is especially important because it can be difficult for Aboriginal communities to mobilize due to the many other issues they face.
The march began with a song from the mixed drum group, Tiohtiake Drum. The group continued to play throughout the march. The drummers and singers were from different First Nations, and requested that the opening song not be recorded or filmed. The collective also invited speakers from various organizations to speak at the march.
Schaik noted that attention surrounding the issue increased after Tiffany Morrison, a 25-year-old woman from the Kahnawake region went missing in 2006, but that discussion surrounding missing and murdered Aboriginal women is still extremely “silenced” within public discourse.
According to Missing Justice, the number of murdered or missing indigenous women in Canada since 2005 is estimated to be between 583 to 3,000. Numbers are inexact due to the lack of serious measures the Canadian government and police services have taken to address this issue.
“Missing Justice, as a collective, saw there wasn’t any activism in Quebec going on around the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women,” said van Schaik.
Missing Justice works closely with Aboriginal communities in Montreal. Last year the collective held ten events to bring attention to this issue.
“It’s a pretty devastating loss for families to go through. We need to support our sisters, our family members, and our community, in helping resolve all these issues and find solutions so that all these issues can be addressed in a timely fashion,” said Jennifer Russell, an administrative assistant at Projets Autochtones du Québec, who sang with Tiohtiake Drum.
“It’s essential that people hear it… It’s part of our responsibility to do that,” said Chad Diabo, one of four drummers and a Mohawk from Kahnawake. “If you look at the emotions of the crowd after we sang – people were crying – this is what it brings out to people. And for us as native people that’s worth more than gold.”
Action in Montreal and Beyond
Cesar Caceres, coordinator of Action Créative – an organization that explores cultural identities through methods of communication and art – carried a large banner throughout the march.
“It is important to be in the streets. It is a problem in Montreal and in Canadian and Quebec society with respect to native women,” he said. “It must be put right on all levels.”
Sisters in Spirit is a nation-wide organization that spearheads mobilization efforts around the large numbers of murdered and missing Aboriginal women.
Nakuset, the executive director of the Montreal Native Women’s Shelter spoke at the march about the Canadian government’s decision last November to reallocate $10 million dollars, originally marked to go to Sisters in Spirit’s projects, to Public Safety Canada. She told the crowd she received a phone call from a Public Safety Canada representative, and was impressed by the way they seemed to be handling the funding.
“It’s a good thing for Montreal… they’re asking Aboriginals what do you want to do with the money, where do you see a safety plan?” Nakuset said. “They are actually coming to us. I don’t know if they are doing that everywhere else.”
Speaking to The Daily, Nakuset said she would to hold a weeklong conference for Aboriginal people on violence. She cited increased awareness, and resources such as anger management classes or traditional ceremonies tailored to provide for situations of domestic violence, as actions she would like to be undertaken.
“We need to step up” 
Stone Iwaasa attended the march on behalf of the Mohawk Tribal Council of Kahnawake. He explained the traditionally matrilineal nature of Mohawk society and the Council’s commitment “to put things back in the right order” by bringing justice for murdered and missing women.
“We are here for the women,” Iwaasa said.
“It has to bring up change. To let the government know this is not acceptable. This is not tolerated. They will have to listen to us and they will have to do something,” Diabo said regarding the significance of Monday’s march and the message it aimed to send.
“This is our future. These are our mothers, our lifebearers, so we need to step up and do our part,” he added.
“The strength of this community [is] being able to reach out to all of the races. It’s not just Aboriginals – all peoples to come together for the same purposes of healing people,” Russell said. “The fact that there are all different people here to support is an amazing thing.”
Community resources
“There’s certain community centres that help keep people together,” Diabo said, referring to the Native Friendship Centre and the Native Women’s Shelter.
He added that organizations like these help to “keep the community strong.”
France Robertson, Coordinator of women’s shelters and the promotion of non-violence for Quebec Native Women Inc. – an organization that offers support to Aboriginal women from abusive backgrounds – explained that, in Quebec, many Aboriginal women come to Montreal to escape the violence they experience in their communities. They are able to find resources and support in shelters run specifically for Aboriginal women.
Robertson grew up in Mashteuiatsh, a northern Quebec First Nations community on Lac Saint-Jean.
“I experienced violence there. In fact, for me, violence there was normal because I lived it,” Robertson said in reference to her upbringing.
“We know what helps our people. To be able to foster a caring and compassionate environment for them to come out of that abuse – it’s a very big cycle. I’m a victim of it and a survivor of it,” explained Russell who comes from an Ojibwe community.
“The only thing that helped me was going back through my community and through my culture,” Russell said.
Robertson added that the process of healing has especially large implications in Aboriginal communities.
“For us, violence is a subject that was not spoken about for a long time in our community. To increase public awareness in communities and to help people in our communities, help families – it’s not just to help women, it is the family as well,” said Robertson.
According to Russell, the high statistics of violence against Aboriginal women are traced to residential school experiences, the effects of which are still resonating within indigenous communities today.
“It’s been ingrained in our children, in the past generation so that it’s something that we’ve been taught. A lot of people have been taught that that’s what normal is,” said Russell.
“This is kind of the society we’ve built I guess. Everybody has a responsibility in it so we all have to change it all together,” Russell said.

QuebecLeaks will aim to fight province-wide corruption
The launch of QuebecLeaks.org, a website aiming for complete transparency of the Quebec government, will officially launch on March 9. Modelled on WikiLeaks, the site will publish leaked documents from anonymous sources, and focus solely on the province of Quebec.
In recent months, the provincial government has been plagued by controversy. A recent formal investigation, led by former Supreme Court justice Michel Bastarache, concerned allegations that fundraisers for the provincial government influenced the appointment of three judges – all judges were cleared of suspicion though Bastarache remains skeptical about the state of the provincial government.
“When almost half of the population believes that political ties are considered in the appointment of judges, there is a problem,” said Bastarache in an interview with the CBC.
QuebecLeaks plans on revealing its spokesperson when its site is launched on March 9.  Currently any correspondence with QuebecLeaks is attributed to “Noam Chomsky” – it is unclear who is behind the website.
“Our group is very decentralized and made up of many people… all sorts of people but mostly experts, entrepreneurs and professionals,” wrote QuebecLeaks in an email to Le Devoir.
A spokesperson for QuebecLeaks described to Le Devoir its hopes that a more limited focus on the province will make it more efficient in exposing corruption than an international site like WikiLeaks. “WikiLeaks is a very large organization, it can often take a lot of time for the documents to be sorted, they also can be lost in the sea of information concerning all the other countries in the world.”
QuebecLeaks plans to launch several mirror sites at the same time to keep the site going if the original is blocked.  The strategy is currently used by WikiLeaks, which has over 1,400 functioning mirror sites.
The site’s launch date was originally set for February 16 but was recently pushed back in order to give QuebecLeaks additional time to improve its security and ensure better protection for whistleblowers who postdocuments on their site.
“It is, in fact, an excellent thing for our organization and the citizens [of Quebec]. It shows that the project is growing,” wrote a QuebecLeaks representative on their Facebook page in reference to the launch’s postponement.
QuebecLeaks will join a growing group of regionally focused leak-websites, including BrusselsLeaks, BalkanLeaks, and IndoLeaks; focusing on the European Union, the Balkan region, and Indonesia respectively.
SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi commented on QuebecLeaks: “I don’t know what they will be leaking, but I think it is important for any government to be as transparent as possible.”
All of the leak sites have the goal of eliminating corruption through more transparent government.

 Missing audits jeopardize critical student services
The McGill administration is withholding $90,000 in student fees from the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) until the Society can produce documentation verifying the state of their finances.
The AUS executive broke the news to Arts students in an open letter Monday night, which is now posted on their website.
The letter states that Morton Mendelson, deputy provost (Student Life and Learning), “has now decided to withhold your student fees until all outstanding audit reports are received.”
In the letter, the AUS executive wrote that Mendelson’s actions have put the AUS “in jeopardy,” and that “his actions have put our student services at risk.”
The $90,000 is intended for AUS’s general operating budget, including the Arts Student Employment Fund. Given that the AUS had to pay off $18,000 in unpaid taxes earlier this year and ran a $30,000 deficit for AUS Frosh, many of these services could suffer as a result of withheld student fees. AUS President Dave Marshall said the executive had taken emergency measures to ensure the continued running of staple events like the weekly Bar des Arts.
Marshall said the executive had already “planned this year out to a tee because there is no extra cash.”
According to Mendelson, the AUS first committed to getting the administration financial statements by March 19, 2010, but, as of August 2010, the two missing statements – from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 – still hadn’t been submitted. On October 5, 2010 Mendelson said the current AUS executive committed to submitting 2009 financial statements by October 15 and 2010 statements by October 30.
“Based on that commitment we released the cheque,” said Mendelson. “That’s the second cheque that we have released to the AUS on the commitment that we would get their financial statements, and then the financial statements didn’t come.”
Referencing an article published in the McGill Tribune, Marshall said he was insulted by a quote from Mendelson that read: “Once bitten, twice shy.” Marshall said he felt the quotes insinuated that Mendelson felt personally affected by events.
“I don’t think there was any malice ever intended by any executive in not producing these audits, and certainly [Mendelson’s] not personally affected by any of this,” said Marshall. “Students are at the point where they will be personally affected by these services.”
Upon entering office this year, AUS executives learned that the Society had not submitted audited financial statements to McGill since the end of the 2008 fiscal year. Despite the missing audits, Mendelson’s office had continued to release fees to the AUS on the understanding that the Society would submit financial statements soon after.
Marshall also pointed out the difficulties student associations face in compiling annual financial statements, given the annual turnover of executives.
“The problem is if the auditor is missing any financial information from that year, that executive has already disappeared, and it’s up to the new executive to try and figure out what pieces are missing,” said Marshall.
Marshall described an instance from the 2008 Arts Frosh where AUS could not access their PayPal account for the event.
“The password for PayPal disappeared with the previous VP Finance, who ran off, was out of the country and no one was able to get in contact with him, and, by the time they were, he had forgotten the password to PayPal,” said Marshall. “It’s an endemic part of the structure of how student organizations run.”
Marshall said it took AUS a year and a half to get the password for the PayPal account.
There was also confusion between Marshall and Mendelson concerning communication.
“We keep on writing to the president and say, ‘Look, we need to know certain information, can you please give us the information?’ We don’t hear back from him,” said Mendelson.
Marshall, however, said he has had difficulty scheduling a meeting with Mendelson, despite repeated attempts over the past few weeks.
“I’m still waiting for…a meeting with [Mendelson] that has been requested for the last two weeks,” said Marshall. “We’re now doing more communicating through the press than an actual sitdown meeting.”
Mendelson said the administration had decided to finally withhold the fees for the benefit of students.
“The reason why the University does this is that…for us to fill our responsibility to students from whom we are collecting money we need to know that the money is being used appropriately,” said Mendelson. “That is to protects students from groups or executives who might be irresponsible with their money.”
Marshall said the AUS hopes to provide Mendelson’s office with Notice of Reader statements, informal audits that give an idea of where the Society’s past finances have gone, at which point he expects the funds will be released.

Replacement selection committee urges for student feedback
After six years of use, Blackboard WebCT Vista 8.4 is no longer getting crucial retail support, and as a result McGill is now searching for a replacement Learning Management System (LMS).
In late January and early February, four providers presented their systems to McGill professors, information-technology personnel, and Engineering Senator Andrew Doyle.
Doyle says that he was approached and asked to get involved because he was already actively searching for a method to collect student feedback on the IT systems.
“Basically, these vendor demos were a big opportunity for students to participate, ask questions, voice their concerns, give their feedback in the form of a survey we are compiling, but I think that asking students or anyone to come out for four hours to four different sessions is unrealistic,” he told The Daily.
“The best idea is that we get one student to attend all four and compare the systems. Realistically, no one has that kind of time, except me.”
While Doyle said he is the only student consistently involved, the LMS replacement selection committee has been seeking students’ involvement from the beginning.
“We learned from the food-systems project that the stakeholders didn’t really feel like they were consulted, even though the committee thought they were doing a good job,” Doyle said.
“In that case, decisions were made before the committee even met. There wasn’t really a place for students to participate in that project.”
Sharon Roy, director of Content and Collaboration Solutions and project manager of Moving Forward to select a new LMS, told The Daily that broad consultation is fundamental when it comes to executing such an enormous project that affects every part of the McGill community.
“We did interviews over the course of the year with 31 different faculties, students, and system staff members,” she said.
An extended list of requirements constructed from these meetings as well as surveys was sent to Learning Management System providers so that they would know what features were expected in a replacement for WebCT.
Roy said that there were countless requests for features that WebCT lacks. For example, many professors requested open content so that course material can be shared online, and crawled – an automated program that scans web pages and creates a index of specified data – by Google and other search engines.
Ken Ragan, McGill Physics professor and member of the selection committee, said that he is looking for tools that he thinks will generate more student discussion and participation.
“I’ve seen things that I won’t use, but that are cool. I can imagine that my colleagues would use them,” he said.
“There’s a core set of functions [that any LMS will] provide, but it’s the additional things they do, or the upgrade path, the support, and how knowledgeable [the software providers] are, that we are looking at for valuation.”
Doyle added that a major debate on the committee is whether or not to go with an open source solution. He says many people in the community, especially Computer Science students and staff, would like to have a system that can be adjusted and augmented. The problem is that most providers of open-source systems have an uninvolved and hands-off approach, which would require McGill to hire specialists to provide in-house support.
Ragan said that the goal is to choose the product that provides the highest quality and most consistent services to the McGill community.
“The committee has been explicitly told not to deal with cost; we are not given a budget to balance, that’s not our concern,” he said. “We’re trying to see which ones work and, ultimately, rank/order them to see which ones are below threshold and which ones are above it. By law, we can’t even think about dollars until we’ve gone through the process.”
In terms of student consultation Doyle stressed that the committee would benefit from greater student input.
“[The committee] asks me what students would think about certain features, or what students want in the system. I think I’ve done a good job, but it would have been nice to hear other voices.”
Students are encouraged to email andrew.doyle@mail.mcgill.ca or css@mcgill.ca and offer their opinions, positive or negative, about WebCT or possible replacement systems. Requests to poke around prototype versions of LMS candidates are strongly encouraged.

Montréal Ouvert, a citizens’ initiative that aims to promote open access to civic information, is pushing the City of Montreal to implement an open data policy. Jean-Noé Landry, one of four co-founders of Montréal Ouvert, spoke to The Daily about the advantages of implementing such a policy in Montreal. 
Montréal Ouvert, a citizens’ initiative that aims to promote open access to civic information, is pushing the City of Montreal to implement an open data policy. This policy calls for the City to give the public free access to any collected civic information. In cities across Canada this policy has allowed citizens to create useful resources concerning municipal facilities and services.

Jean-Noé Landry, one of four co-founders of Montréal Ouvert, spoke to The Daily about the advantages of implementing such a policy in Montreal. 
The McGill Daily: Cities such as Ottawa have created open data policies, which have led to the creation of websites and iPhone apps concerning municipal facilities and services. How does the open data policy allow individuals to create such resources?
Jean-Noé Landry: Well, all the civic information would be put into a centralized website. Other cities have done this as well, where you will see all the catalogues of data in a format that is free to be accessed. When you have precious data – data that is untampered – posted on that website in a permanent way, developers can modify it, use it and share the information back. So in that way it’s a very simple website.
The key thing here in what were talking about is the change in how to manage information, the change in behaviour. I think whenever you have change like this, every organization is going to have its inhibitions, but we’re here to share the positive experiences of other cities as well. Setting up the website is a mechanism by which to do this.
MD: Montreal has been slow in adopting an open data policy compared to other major Canadian cities, such as Vancouver, Toronto, and Edmonton. Why do you think Montreal has been more reluctant about this policy?
JL: To be fair, you do need to look at how many cities there are in Canada. If there are ten cities that have done this there are still about, what, 170 cities across Canada, who have not. But, hopefully, Montreal will be able to learn from the experience of other cities. We want to work collaboratively to help the city. It is behind, I’m not going to lie. Other cities in Canada are doing this…[but] all bureaucracies are going to be different; they are going to want to take the time to evaluate the feasibility of this. Obviously this is something that should have been done yesterday, but we’ll respect the process and try [to] put pressure to encourage them to work. There is a demand for it, and we really hope that the city recognizes that this is an approach that the city needs to take on.
MD: What kinds of services and benefits can Montrealers expect to see from open data?
JL: As residents of this city there are a lot of services that are accessible to us. But for each service there is information that organizes that service itself. We’re talking about schedules; we’re talking about the location of water fountains, parks, community services, [and] skating rinks. We understand that this may take time…not all citizens have the knowledge or knowhow to use that information in a way that is understood and a way that makes the services more accessible. So the thing is to connect with administrations, and then citizens can also innovate.
MD: With the growth of social media and professional blogging sites, more and more people are getting their information through non-traditional outlets. Open data is another way to access information through less orthodox means. How do you feel about the trend toward a more citizen-oriented or populist media?
JL: If we look at trends – especially with youth – in terms of their public participation, I think it’s to the city’s advantage to have two-way interaction or an active mechanism where residents are able to meet their needs and give ideas about how to interpret data; where we are able to realize the kind of vision that Montreal has for itself. The data is an outlet for this relationship to change and become more dynamic…it’s really a trend we’re seeing across Canada, and across the world.

Students and faculty demonstrate against university administration and tuition increases
This past Monday, around 1,200 undergraduate and graduate students met on Concordia’s Hall building terrace to hold the Wintry Hot Accessible Love-In for Education (WHALE). It included both a Special General Meeting, and a demonstration opposing upcoming tuition hikes.
Both events took place with the support of Concordia’s Provost David Graham, who declared academic amnesty for all students participating in the event.
The Special General Meeting (SGM) of the Concordia Students Union (CSU) passed two motions. The first denounced the Quebec Ministry of Education’s proposed tuition fee hikes, and the second motion approved the beginning of a Day of Action against tuition hikes, which began immediately following the meeting.
The motion regarding the Day of Action also reduced the quorum for a CSU SGM from around 790 students to around 500, in the hopes of facilitating more student involvement in the future. Previously, the quorum exceeded the capacity of any venue on Concordia’s downtown campus.
Mathew Brett, WHALE’s communication coordinator told The Daily that the demonstration was primarily a grassroots organization and expressed his excitement over the student turnout on Monday.
“The hypocrisy is blatant,” added Brett, in reference to the university administration’s spending on severance packages in the face of increasing tuition.
A statement released by the Concordia University Part-time Faculty Association (CUPFA) on January 21 also spoke to the lack of focus and direction regarding the University’s recent spending priorities.
“No policy, plans, decision, collective agreement, or hiring at our University is sustainable. Human resource management at the University is rudderless at all levels,” it stated. “There have been some 45 senior administrators and staff who have left, resigned, or been dismissed (whatever) since 2000. Conservative figures have placed the costs of all these departures (buy-outs) at $10 million.”
Last Thursday, the Concordia Student Union passed a motion at an Informational General Meeting mandating a call for the resignation of all the members-at-large of the Board of Governors (BoG).
In January the Concordia Senate unanimously passed a motion calling for the resignation of Peter Kruyt, the chair of the Concordia BoG.
Neither of these motions are binding.
In response to tuition increases, province-wide demonstrations will be held on March 12. These protest plan to confront Quebec’s provincial budget and perceived deficiencies in its funding of public services, such as Quebec’s universities.
Louis-Philippe Savoie, president of Federation Étudiante Universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), told The Daily that these demonstrations would be a “chance to send a clear message to the Quebec government that students do not agree with the policy of raising tuition fees.”
The projected tuition increases outlined on the CSU website predict that starting in 2011, Quebec students will have to pay an additional $1,500 for tuition, while out of province tuition will rise by an additional $4,500.
The Charest government is expected to address these tuition hikes in its 2011 budget, to be presented to parliament in March.

Online Party of Canada seeks to reshape the political process
The Online Party of Canada (OPC), billing itself as “Canada’s Political Revolution,” intends to make the internet not only an instrument of Canadians’ political will, but also the foundation of the Canadian political process.
“The impetus for the project is to return Canadian politics to their original democratic roots, a simpler system of pure democracy, people voting not for specific politicians or parties but rather voting on issues,” said Stephanie Penney, a senior advisor for the OPC.
“The party got started about a year ago, but really revved up in the last few months,” she added, attributing the new momentum to the recent launch of the party’s website.
Through its unique methodology the OPC hopes to address what it sees as the major flaw in our current political process: voter apathy produced by a widespread feeling that personal concerns are ignored at the level of parliamentary power, and that elected officials lack accountability to their voters.
While Penney acknowledged that the notion of combating voter apathy is far from new, she affirmed that the OPC’s approach is “the best way to encourage people to go out and inform themselves and to get people invested again in the political process.”
OPC will field candidates in federal ridings, and, if elected, MPs would be legally obligated to carry out the majority position established by online votes. Membership is available to any eligible voter, and grants access to online forums organized in terms of issues, and a right to vote on those issues.
The emphasis on issues is designed to avoid what the OPC sees as an inevitable pitfall of the party system.
“It’s not the case that somebody would be all Conservative for all issues or all Liberal, it’s always a blend…so this approach can really embrace that heterogeneity in people’s opinions,” asserted Penney.
Given that the internet is increasingly the primary source of information for Canadians, Penney denies the possibility that the convenience of an online forum will enable the participation of uninformed and disengaged individuals in critical decision-making processes.
“With any system, internet-based or not, you’re going to have a sector of the people who are eligible to vote who are voting without sufficient information. OPC is the best shot we’ve got…of basically encouraging people to inform themselves more in a way that’s convenient for them,” said Penney.
In an email to The Daily, McGill Political Science professor Dietlind Stolle drew parallels between the OPC and other parties worldwide that are “focused on using the internet for political activities” and “like to appeal to young people and to the disaffection in politics that we observe in western democracies.”
Stolle questions the yet unclear role of leadership in the party, as well as the practicality of the decision-making progress in certain contexts.
“Will there be a party leadership that defines what’s on the agenda and how issues are put on the agenda? If so, they need tools to discuss and weigh issues. Will all this be done online?” she asked.
She also raised concerns about the OPC’s reliance on what she called “referendum tools”—the  population voting on a yes/no basis.
“First of all, not all questions lend themselves to a referendum with two choices. Second, it’s a majoritarian tool, and might, at times at least, suppress minority voices,” Stolle said.
However Michael Nicula, founder of the OPC, stressed the party’s revolutionary agenda.
“We are not trying to fit into the current political system, we believe it’s archaic and flawed,” wrote Michael Nicula in an email to The Daily. “OPC is designed to be the new political system.”
These statements, however, highlight a fundamental problem for a party whose core principles involve a rejection of the system with which it must necessarily engage, and Penney admits as much.
“It’s going to be increasingly challenging as time moves on because we need to successfully interact with the existing system in order to move forward…but yet interacting with the system, it will be challenging to mesh that with the OPC principles.”
