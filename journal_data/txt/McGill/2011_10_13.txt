Graduate student union calls general meeting to mobilize
A
ccording to officials from the union representing McGill’s Teaching Assistants (TAs), the administration has refused most of the union’s demands in current contract negotiations.
While the administration has refused to comment about current collective bargaining, the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) says that the administration has balked at the union’s five primary demands.
AGSEM is seeking increased TA hours, paid training for new TAs, the limiting of conference and lab sizes, mandatory meetings with course supervisors, and a three per cent pay increase.
According to the union, McGill administration bargainers, after consultation with Provost Anthony Masi, refused these five primary demands.
“McGill just said ‘no’ flatly to our main demands, with the exception of a very small and vague opening on training,” said the chair of AGSEM’s bargaining committee, Renaud Roussel, at a delegates meeting Wednesday night.
“They’re just willing basically to set up some kind of training…and we’re not sure that this training is going to be paid,” he said.
Molly Alexander, a union adviser from AGSEM’s parent union, the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, said that the offer rings hollow.
“‘We are willing to move on training’ was the wording, but they didn’t come back with any written proposal on it. In negotiations that doesn’t mean a whole lot,” she said. This is the eleventh meeting between AGSEM and the administration since May.
According to a member of AGSEM’s bargaining team, Jonathan Mooney, McGill has offered a 1.2 per cent pay raise that is mandated by the province. AGSEM officials pointed to a Canadian rate of inflation of 3.1 per cent.
AGSEM has called a general meeting on October 19 to discuss mobilization efforts.
Officials were quick to say a TA strike mandate or any kind of work stoppage would need a separate vote from that for pressure tactics.
According to TA employment calculations by AGSEM and data from University enrolment numbers, the ratio of increased graduate and undergraduate student enrollment to new TAships has risen to 27 to 1 since 2007.
Section 109.1 interpretation
The McGill administration has twice in recent years called on the anti-scab provision of the Quebec Labour Code as justification for firing striking workers from their other positions on campus.
In the first instance, during a TA strike in 2008, the administration fired all striking TAs from their other positions on campus.
Similarly, during the current MUNACA strike, the administration fired striking workers who were also employed as course lecturers, paying them a 20 per cent indemnity.
Before the next round of bargaining sessions scheduled for October 20 and 21, AGSEM is planning to draft an agreement that would save the non-striking jobs of workers on strike.
According to Mooney, such an agreement would “lessen the impact of a strike” on the University, and for the administration to refuse it would be “retaliatory.”

Quebec activists take Parc Ex public housing protest into Ville Mont-Royal
A long-standing Quebec housing rights group held a large demonstration on Sunday to protest the current state of the province’s public housing system.
Organizers from FRAPRU, or Front d’action populaire en réaménagement urbain, assembled at the corner of Hutchison and Jean Talon, along with representatives from various other social advocacy groups and members of the public. The group is calling for an additional 50,000 public housing units to be built in the province within the next five years.
The demonstration was the final stop in FRAPRU’s Caravane, a nine-day journey throughout the province, during which the group staged protests in various communities to call federal and provincial leaders to account. The caravan travelled with low-income renters and made stops around the province to show solidarity with people living in substandard housing.
Protesters marched through the streets of Parc Extension, a neighbourhood where over one half of all residents are deemed to be living in low income housing, according to Statistics Canada.
As the procession–which FRAPRU estimated at 800 people – made its way towards Boulevard de l‘Acadie, Parc Ex residents stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch and chat with volunteers.
FRAPRU organizers then directed the group to the hitherto unannounced location of Ville Mont Royal, a secluded enclave. Mont-Royal directly borders Parc Ex – the two are separated by a chain-link fence and hedges, with few points of entry.
As demonstrators made their way down Mont-Royal’s streets, a few residents watched from windows and driveways. The demonstration ended in a Mont-Royal park with a speech from FRAPRU’s chief coordinator François Saillant.
“The government is always telling us that there’s no money,” he said in French, prompting vocal responses from the crowd. “As you can see, the money is here. The problem is, it’s not being shared.”
Stéphan Corriveau participated in the demonstration as a representative of the Fédération des locataires d’habitations à loyer modique du Québec (Federation of Quebec Public Housing Tenants). He associated public housing needs with what he sees as a discrepancy in the distribution of wealth.
“I’m not interested to live in a society where it’s the law of the jungle. You end up in a society…where there’s a huge level of mistrust between the different communities,” he said.
Corriveau spoke of Ville Mont-Royal, where the average house costs $750,000, as being symbolic of the situation.
“I’m doubtful that [Mont-Royal residents] work harder than any people who work in a kitchen, or as a janitor, or a construction worker, or the mother that is raising five kids in Parc-Extension just across the fence,” he said, adding that “these people deserve just as much life quality as the people who live in Mont-Royal. We’re not talking about charity, we’re talking about justice, and we’re talking about solidarity.”
While on the road with FRAPRU, Grant Latimer described the housing situation in the Val d’Or native community as “a desperate situation.”
“They don’t even have electricity or water,” he said. “This is a reserve that is surrounded by gold mines.”
Elizabeth, a FRAPRU volunteer, spoke of the caravan’s visit to students in Sherbrooke, who she said are living “in very bad conditions, with a very desperate need for [public] housing.”
Under provincial policy, most university students are ineligible for Quebec public housing.
FRAPRU also voiced concerns that federal funding for public housing, including rent subsidies and renovation payments, will be cut in coming years due to the expiration of funding contracts with provincial and municipal governments.
Alain Roy, who came to the demonstration representing the Association des locataires de Sherbrooke, expressed concern for what he considered to be thousands of people who might lose their homes because of the loss of subsidies. He spoke from his own experiences in Sherbrooke, where many federal subsidy contracts that had benefited low-income renters in co-ops have already run out.
He described how his group has been receiving calls from individuals panicking about sharp rent increases.
“They tell us that they’re completely hopeless, they were paying two or three hundred dollars a month with the subsidies, now they’re paying six,” he told The Daily in French. “They’re just not able to live there anymore.”

California inmates demanding improvement in standards of living
A small group of protesters gathered in front of the American consulate in Montreal on Friday to demonstrate their solidarity with a group of striking prison inmates in California.
The protest, organized by the Montreal Hunger Strike Support Committee, is part of a larger movement that aims to improve inmates’ standard of living.
Inmates across California are undertaking a hunger strike to demand better conditions behind bars. The strike, which began on July 1, was organized by inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison’s security housing unit, where prisoners are kept isolated in windowless, soundproof cells.
According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 811 inmates are currently involved in the strike, down from a peak of 4,252 in July. An inmate is considered to be on a hunger strike if they have missed more than nine consecutive meals.
Some activists have likened conditions inside Security Housing Units (SHUs) to torture. Ed Mead, a former inmate at Washington State Penitentiary, described the living conditions in SHUs.
“Those prisoners are subjected to total isolation. They have no communication with anyone and they are kept in what is essentially is a dog kennel,” he said.
Mead added that the only way to get out was to “snitch” on other inmates. This practice, known as “debriefing,” is one of the main grievances of the strikers.
Isaac Ontiveros, the communications director of Critical Resistance, an American organization whose goal is the abolishment of the prison-industrial complex, explained the practice.
“What happens is that prisoners are forced to identity themselves or others as high level gang leaders,” said Ontiveros. “This creates all kinds of problems, it makes so that people end up in the security housing unit for many years, it effects their safety if they return to the general prison population, it effects their parole, and it creates a vicious circle in which prisoners are forced to fabricate information on one another.”
According to Ontiveros, Critical Resistance has blamed “debriefing” for causing the prolonged solitary incarceration of inmates, some for as long as 20 years.
“The health effects of this kind of imprisonment are devastating.  They’re not just devastating to the prisoners themselves, but to their family members as well. It follows people from inside of prison to their lives outside of prison, if they ever get out,” Ontiveros said.
Ontiveros has also criticized the response from the Pelican Bay administration.
“The administration is creating this culture of intimidation. They identified the leaders of the strike and destroyed their personal items; they also did a variety of disciplinary write-ups against participants,” Ontiveros said.
Others were also threatened with solitary confinement.
For Mead, the hunger strike at Pelican Bay is part of a larger problem. Inmates in security housing units, he said, often have mental health issues.
“Mental health facilities in the United States have been emptied out. Most of [those with mental health issues] find themselves in prisons, and once in prisons, they’re also disruptive, so they end up in the security housing units,” he said.
The reasoning behind the Pelican Bay strike, he said, is obvious.
“Anytime you treat human beings like animals, deprive them of any self worth, you’re going to have those kinds of problems,” Mead said.
With the highest prison population rate in the world and tight budget constraints, correctional facilities in the United States are subject to overcrowding and often lack the means to care for mentally ill inmates.
While the Canadian correctional system has historically differed from the American model, Maria, a spokesperson from the Montreal Hunger Strike Support Committee, claims that this may no longer be the case.
The budget of the Correctional Service of Canada has expanded significantly under the current government. Most of that money, she said, is directed towards the building of new prisons.
“The general gist is to get more people in prison,” she said.

Course instructors advised to put copyright symbol on their materials
The emergence of a student-run note-sharing website on campus has provoked the administration to rein in possible copyright infringement of course materials.
An email sent by Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson advised all course instructors to display a copyright symbol on their course materials. The Daily recently obtained the email.
In the message, dated September 23, Mendelson writes, “recent cases of students posting the entire course content from WebCT has raised questions about the possibility of copyright infringement,” and that “persistent infringements will likely lead to disciplinary procedures under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.”
The students – who, according to Mendelson’s email, were “ignorant of the issue” – were notified that their posting was an infringement of copyright and told to remove the materials, which they subsequently did.
One specific website – wikinotes.ca – is mentioned in the email. Founded and run by McGill science undergraduates Clarence Leung and Santina Lin, along with a small group of other science students, Wikinotes states on its website that it “strives to provide free and open student-generated course content through a publicly-edited wiki.”
Most of the content on Wikinotes currently applies to large U0 and U1 science courses, with six arts courses documented on the site.
In an interview with The Daily, Mendelson said an instructor complained that some of his materials had ended up online.
“If an instructor creates notes and posts that on WebCT, it’s copyrighted material. It’s not permissible to take that and do what you want with it,” he said.
In an email to The Daily, the board of administrators for Wikinotes wrote that student-generated materials comprised most of the content available on the website, but that instructor-generated materials would be useful to post as well – provided students get permission from the creator of the work.
The members of the board added that the McGill administration had recently told Wikinotes to remove images uploaded from textbooks and links to lecture recordings. Both were removed, though the members of the board wrote that they did not consider links to lecture recordings a violation of copyright, as the recordings are already available on the McGill website. They added that similar content would not be permitted on the site in the future.
Mikkel Paulson, leader of the Pirate Party of Canada, wrote in an email to The Daily that his group “takes the position that all information is power, and must be shaped and channeled to empower the weak and protect them from exploitation by the strong.”
Paulson said the copyright issues with university note sharing were more cultural than legal and political.
“Professors have the ability to unilaterally license their course material under Creative Commons or other copyleft licenses, regardless of the administration’s opinions on the matter,” said Paulson.
“Using copyright as a club is particularly hypocritical for academics, given that our present academic culture was built through hundreds of years of free sharing of ideas and information,” he continued.
Chemistry Professor David N. Harpp, who helps run Courses Online, a website established by the McGill Office of Science and Society to freely distribute recorded lectures and presentations, said that he hadn’t paid much attention to Mendelson’s advice to display his copyrights. “I’m not putting any copyright on anything… I haven’t even really looked into it, but [Mendelson’s] probably right to look into it,” he said.
Harpp said he had no problem with students or others posting and using his materials online, but noted differing attitudes throughout the University.
“We’re all in a different environment, I’m not sure how I can emphasize to you how different they are. There may be a culture within a faculty or a department that whatever they put out there, you have to pay for it. My best guess is that my own colleagues in Chemistry would have a similar feeling to my own.”
In regard to enforcing copyrights online, Harpp said, “This is a giant quantum step from a textbook, and, even with a textbook, it would be difficult to do.”

McGill biology professors condemn administration’s conduct
Thirteen professors from McGill’s biology department have signed a letter condemning the conduct of the McGill administration during the non-academic workers’ strike. The document details how the strike, which has been in effect since September 1, has affected the department.
The letter is signed by a third of McGill’s biology professors, and warns that, as the community enters the midterm season, “logistic problems that we are likely to face may well degenerate into chaos.”
Louis Lefebvre, the department’s program director, presented the letter at a press conference, seated beside representatives from MUNACA, SSMU, and MUNACA’s parent union, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC).
“We need to not turn our backs on people that are our friends and colleagues,” he said.
Labs, he said, are “abnormally short or modified,” without lab technicians and “people we rely upon.”
The letter cites troubles with research funding and the increased risk of “epidemics in the McGill Phytotron,” a centre for research in experimental plant biology, which “could cause long term damages to our plant genetics program.”
The letter goes on to say that the professors fear for the “long term and bitter fragmentation of our social network” and criticizes McGill for seeking an injunction against the strikers.
According to VP (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa, the University sought the injunction because “picketing infringed on the University’s right to remain open.”
When asked about the professors’ letter, Di Grappa wrote in an email to The Daily that the gesture was premature, given that the conciliation process had not been allowed to “bear fruit.”

MUNACA and administration head back to negotiating table today
McGill University was cleared of all allegations of using illegal replacement labour in a decision released by the Commission des Relations du Travail (CRT) on Tuesday.
The CRT report on illegal replacements, dated October 4, was issued after Ministry of Labour inspections at McGill found a number of cases in which workers were believed to be replacing McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) workers.
Ministry investigators were called into the University in late September after MUNACA received complaints of illegal replacements, and completed inspections accompanied by representatives from the union and McGill.
The CRT ruling named thirteen workers against whom MUNACA filed complaints.
“This was a very strange ruling,” said MUNACA Vice-President (Finance) David Kalant of the CRT decision.
“We’re going to take further legal action on this, we don’t think this is correct. For one thing, it seems to ignore some very clear evidence in the investigator’s report,” Kalant explained.
When the Ministry of Labour released its findings in late September, McGill disputed every case mentioned by the investigator.
“The Commissioner heard all the evidence on September 29 and took all evidence that was presented, verbally and in writing,” said McGill Vice-President (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa. “In every single case, the Commissioner sided with the University.”
Di Grappa cited cases of workers taking on the duties of employees who are not MUNACA members as an example of the type of complaints on which the CRT ruled.
As for future allegations, Kalant said that the union is “continuing to receive reports” of illegal replacement workers. “If we think there is enough evidence, yes, we will ask for an investigators to come back and look at more,” he continued.
Di Grappa also said that McGill is “looking forward to getting back to the [negotiation] table on Thursday, October 13, after almost two weeks of not being at the table.”
“At the onset of the conciliation process, the conciliator offered a number of dates. McGill said yes to every date that was proposed; the union did not,” Di Grappa explained.
“We are committed to resolving this at the table and finding a solution that’s fair and reflects the realities in which we live,” he said.
In an email to staff and students on October 12, Di Grappa said that the two-week hiatus on negotiations was “caused by the union’s inability to attend any sessions during that period.”
Later that day, MUNACA issued a statement on its website from President Kevin Whittaker stating that Di Grappa’s statement was false on two counts. “The negotiation schedule was decided on by taking into account the constraints of everyone – not just ours,” the statement read.
“We have made it clear to McGill University on several occasions that we would make ourselves available at any time if they are prepared to discuss any core issues at the heart of this conflict,” it continued.

Union asking alumni to stop donating until strike resolved
According to Kevin Whittaker, president of MUNACA, the recent injunction, which restricts the unions group size, noise level, and proximity to the University, has forced them to “expand our abilities and messages outside of the McGill community.”
According to Whittaker, the union is asking McGill alumni not to donate to the University until the strike is resolved. The announcement preceded McGill’s three days of Homecoming events, which began today.
“If [alumni] wish to do so afterwards, we would encourage them to wait until that time,” he said.
MUNACA has also attempted to put pressure on members of McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) by demonstrating outside their offices this week.
According to a MUNACA press release, the union recieved a “firm commitment” from BoG member Kathy Fazel early yesterday that she will “contact her fellow Board of Governors members and ask that they work for a quick solution to the conflict.” Fazel has been a member-at-large of McGill’s BoG with RBC since February 2008.
MUNACA VP Finance David Kalant commented in the press release that “while we are pleased to get a firm commitment from Mme. Fazel, we will make sure that she follows through on her commitment.”

Citizens demand adequate protection for the environment
In a series of public consultations, citizens of the greater Montreal area have raised concerns regarding the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal (CMM)’s plan to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of the greater Montreal region. Concerns centre around whether the plan will guarantee an adequate protection of the environment.
The Plan métropolitain d’aménagement et de développement (PMAD) project was proposed in April 2011 in order to accommodate an expected population increase of half a million people in the greater Montreal region over the next four years.
The PMAD is currently in the process of being approved by the government of Quebec.
Throughout the month of October, the plan will be discussed in a series of 11 public consultations, enabling citizens and organizations to express their opinions and concerns.
The PMAD aims to improve transportation, rearrange spaces to account for increased living density, and suggests the creation of green and blue belts around the island.
However, citizens have argued that environmental issues are only briefly mentioned in passing, and call for more concrete measures to be taken.
Green and blue belts would include various corridors for diversity, such as forests, wetlands, agricultural lands, flood plains, and islands.
Annie Tellier, president of the Société de biologie de Montréal, a non-profit science education group, stressed the importance of a greener Montreal, and the creation and preservation of more green spaces in the region.
“Construction is on the rise, and will only increase with time. Natural habitats are constantly being destroyed,” she explained.
Those present at the first consultation, held on September 28, demanded more attention given to the idea of green and blue belts around the island, and called for the creation of an ecological park to be added the PMAD’s objectives.
The park, known as the Parc Écologique de l’Archipel de Montréal, would extend from the Basses-Laurentides to the American border.
Second year CEGEP student at Marianopolis College Leehi Yona was responsible for launching the consultations. In an interview with The Daily, she expressed concern that, without such an ecological park, Quebec may not be able to reach objectives set by the Nagoya Protocol.
The Nagoya Protocol, a supplementary agreement to the 1993 Convention of Biological Diversity, was adopted on October 29, 2010 in Nagoya, Japan. The protocol’s objectives aim to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.
“The PMAD must include a zone that would preserve at least 12 per cent of the territory by 2015,” said Yona at the first consultation meeting.
Like Yona, many citizens believe that the creation of an ecological park would help the realization of this objective.
A representative from the CMM explained that the organization encouraged discussions at the consultations.
“The CMM hopes to work with citizens of the region in order to guarantee that the PMAD may better the lives of everyone over the next twenty years. Suggestions and modifications to the plan will be taken into account,” he stated.
