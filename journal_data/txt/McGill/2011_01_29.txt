Student unemployment needs more drastic measures, say critics
Despite the recent announcement of a $10-million investment to the Canadian Summer Jobs (CSJ) program, many believe the Conservative government is still not doing enough to curb student unemployment.
The investment is expected to create as many as 3,500 additional student summer jobs this year by encouraging not-for-profit organizations, public-sector employers, and small businesses (with fewer than fifty employees) to hire full-time students.
The program aims to help full-time students aged 15 to 30 to find summer employment, but there is no mention of compensation for part-time students or support for year-round student employment. The Conservative government already invested $10 million in the CSJ program in both 2009 and 2010 as part of their Economic Action Plan, yet, according to Statistics Canada, both of those years saw some of the highest youth unemployment rates on record.
“The economy remains the Government of Canada’s top priority. That’s why we are supporting the creation of more jobs for young Canadians, so they can find employment and gain the skills and experience they need to succeed,” wrote a spokesperson for Human Resources and Skills Development Canada in an email to The Daily.
Although NDP youth and post-secondary education critic Niki Ashton agreed that any focus on student unemployment is an important first step, she insisted that the current Conservative plan does little to address the sources of the problem.  It is a plan that she said lacks ingenuity and vision.
“Stephen Harper and his government claim to be good economic managers while they are leaving our generation and young people out in the cold by failing to take head on the problem of youth employment more generally,” she said.
According to Ashton, student unemployment needs to be addressed as part of a larger plan for a more sustainable Canadian future. “A lack of employment out there for young people to access does not bode well for the next generation’s ability to move forward. We are calling for an economy that is sustainable, a green economy, an economy built on research and development within our own institutions and our post-secondary institutions.
In an interview with the Canadian University Press, Dave Molenhuis, national chairperson for the Canadian Federation of Students, agreed that while the CSJ program is good news for full-time students, there is still a desperate need for programs that support those who are in school part-time.
“Looking at who is a part-time student, especially [in] today’s economy, [it] includes mature students, students with dependents, students with disabilities, as well as those requiring re-training,” said Molenhuis.
“These are students who can only complete their studies on a part-time basis because of financial circumstances, because they have to work during the school year in order to be able to afford the costs of living and afford the increasing cost of post-secondary education,” he added.
Myriam Zaidi, SSMU VP External, also acknowledged that while the investment is a good first step, it is nowhere near a solution to students’ financial issues.
“I think that $10 million invested in student employment is great, but I also think that the federal investment in education is extremely low,” she said, emphasizing the need to place a greater focus on the increasing cost of tuition.
“If post-secondary education was not as expensive, students would be less pressured to find student jobs during the summer. Because even if students do find jobs over the summer, they will still have trouble paying for tuition during the year,” she said.
Provincial government aid allocated for students in Quebec greatly surpasses funds allocated by any other province in Canada – more than triple the second highest recipient, Ontario – according to a University Committee on Scholarships and Student Aid report submitted to McGill Senate for the 2007-2008 fiscal year.

English CEGEPs poised to bear the brunt of high student influx
The Quebec government continues to be slow in dealing with the over-enrolment and overcrowding of CEGEPs in Montreal and surrounding areas.
The government plans to wait until after the March 1 application deadline to decide how it will address the problem. For now the government has lifted fines for over-enrolment in colleges by up to ten per cent, so that Montreal CEGEPs can cope with the higher demand.
As of last June, the provincial government promised one million dollars to help CEGEPs accommodate students and deal with the lack of space. CEGEPs have been waiting to find out whether the provincial government will continue to facilitate the admittance of more students next August.
Colleges off the island of Montreal, such as Collège Montmorency in Laval, are not included in the agreement to temporarily suspend over-enrolment fines. Many feel that the Quebec government is only focusing on Montreal at their expense, said Johanne Morisette, a spokesperson for Collège Montmorency, in an interview with the Gazette.
“We won’t go out tomorrow with our placard. But we think that probably the ministry didn’t necessarily look at the whole picture when it looked at Montreal Island – it didn’t see that there is Greater Montreal, which has a common reality,” Morissette said.
A report Commissioned by Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ) and the Institut de recherche sur le français en Amérique  (IRFA) released last Thursday shows that the effects of overcrowding may be compounded for English CEGEPs. The report shows that this is partly due to a greater number of francophone applicants.
According to the report, since the end of 1990 less than half of new registered students in English Montreal CEGEPs speak English as their first language. The reasons for this, the report outlines, are numerous, but an increase in the importance of being fully fluent in the English language as well as an increase in the importance of being fluent in English appear to be driving forces.
“A strong majority of French-speaking people intend to work or continue English academic work after CEGEP. A relatively important proportion of students in English CEGEPs also intend to leave Quebec after their collegial studies. The desire to open a greater number of doors seems to be an important variable in the equation of the choice of an English CEGEP,” stated the report.
Despite the emphasis placed on a greater number of francophones choosing English CEGEPs in order to achieve “full fluency,” the report notes that the trend does not extend to native English speakers enrolling in French CEGEPs.
“[With] anglophones, the importance of the linguistic factor is explained mainly by a greater ease with English, or by difficulties with French. Anglophones having attended the French secondary school [still] have more ease [communicating] in English than in French. This result raises important questions,” read the report.
Despite over thirty years of legislation to ensure French language prominence in the province, the report reveals that English continues to be pervasive.
“In the light of the results presented in this report…it appears clear that the linguistic impact of the English CEGEPs is negatively reflected on the objective to make French the common language of Quebeckers,” said the report.
This continues to stoke controversy over language laws in Quebec. This includes implementing strict rules regarding who can attend publicly funded English schools.
Previously, a loophole in provincial Bill 101 allowed students otherwise ineligible to attend English public school if they attended a non-subsidized private English school for one year. The loophole was closed by the passage of Bill 104 in 2002.
Since then, Bill 104 has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada.  A proposed law, Bill 103, would allow immigrants to send their children to a public English school after three years of attendance at a non-subsidized English school. Bill 103 is currently moving through the Quebec National Assembly.
Neither Minister of Education Line Beauchamp nor the English Montreal School Board could be reached for comment.

Egyptians in Montreal and Ottawa rally for democracy 
Amid chants and songs in Arabic, English, and French, several hundred from Montreal’s Egyptian community converged Friday in front of Montreal’s Egyptian consulate. If the rally had a single overarching emotion, it was one of joy, as Egyptians gathered to celebrate the four consecutive days of mass protests that threaten to end the thirty year reign of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.
The rally was held in front of the Egyptian consulate a week after a similar rally was held by Montreal’s Tunisian community in Dorchester Square, in response to the popular uprising and overthrow of Tunisia’s five-term president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.
Ihab Khandil, a McGill student and Cairo native, attended the rally. “We’re all here to support them. We’re all here to help this revolution, and it’s going to happen,” he said. He added that he has been in contact with family in Cairo, despite the Egyptian government’s shutdown of much of the country’s communication infrastructure in response to the protests. “We want real democracy for once in our lives,” added Khandil.
The rally was organized by Taghyeer-Canada – Arabic for “change” – along with similar events outside Egyptian embassies and consulates in Ottawa and Toronto. Ehab Lotayef, an employee in McGill’s Information Technology department, was one of the rally’s principle organizers.
“Our demands are an echo of their demands,” said Lotayef, referring to the demands of thousands on the streets of Egypt’s cities for the ouster of Mubarak.
Lotayef said that he and others had scheduled a meeting with officials from the consulate, but were turned away by the building’s security. They had planned to deliver an open letter asking for, among other things, the criminalization of “abuse and torture committed by the police,” the release of all those detained in the Egyptian protests, and an address of the “problems of poverty by raising the minimum salary.”
Shokry Gohar, a McGill Arabic professor and an Egyptian himself, spoke to the nature of the protests in his native country as reason for his attendance. “The movement came from the street, it didn’t come from any party. … Christians and Muslims are together against this tyrant.”
When asked if he expected Mubarak’s government to fall in the coming weeks, he said he “can’t wait.” Gohar said that he hadn’t been able to reach his family in Egypt. “This tyrant already cuts the network, cuts the telephone lines, so that he can torture and kill our people.”

ASSÉ-coordinated sit-ins protest tuition hikes at Laval, UdeM, UQAM, and UQAC
Students at four francophone universities – Université du Québec à Montréal, the Université Laval, the Université de Montréal, and the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi – staged sit-ins at their rector’s offices on Wednesday, January 19 to express their anger over prospective provincial tuition increases.
The Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiant (ASSÉ) called for the occupations to protest what they regard as administrators’ compliance with the Conférence des recteurs et des principaux des universités du Québec (CREPUQ) proposal to increase tuition in Quebec by $500 a year for three years, beginning in 2012.
Maxime Larue-Bourdages, the Internal Coordinator of ASSÉ, elaborated on the motivations behind the sit-ins.
“We find it very hypocritical that [the Ministry of Education] now says that tuition has to increase for students when university administration’s prefer to put their money in construction, rather than students, who are the life of the university. Year after year members of the administration give themselves higher salaries and bonuses, and they take that money from students,” he said.
ASSÉ’s official press release echoed these sentiments in French: “On the one hand, the rectors of universities get paid exorbitant salaries, and divert public funds to megalomaniacal real estate projects, while simultaneously complaining of being underfunded to advocate for a dizzying increase in tuition. We are not fooled by their hypocrisy!”
Students at Université du Québec à Montréal succeeded in blocking off all administrative buildings, preventing rector Claude Corbo from entering his office for the remainder of the afternoon, and prompting him to cancel all his planned activities for the week.
Jaouad Laaroussi, a UQAM student present at the sit-in, made his demands clear in the ASSÉ press release.
“How dare our president demand an increase in tuition when it is his direction that is plunging UQAM into financial distress?” he wrote.
At the Université de Montréal, students blocked off the administrative area, occupyed rector Guy Breton’s office, and hung banners denouncing Breton’s support of tuition increases. “If Mr. Breton left his office more often, he would see the reality for students. We don’t earn $365,00 a year!” said Héloïse Lanouette, a student at UdeM, in the ASSÉ press release.
SSMU maintains communication with ASSÉ but does not have official membership within the student association, which is renowned for its more radical approach to mobilization against planned tuition hikes.
SSMU created its own Mobilization Committee last January, which is starting to gain momentum, according to VP External Myriam Zaidi, who explained the differences between the ASSÉ approach to protesting and the Mobilization Committee’s methods of raising awareness about tuition increases.
“When you’re mobilizing at McGill you have to start from scratch. Here people don’t follow Quebec politics. The ASSÉ are more radical, but [the Mobilization Committee] is hoping to get students at McGill who want to mobilize together, and when that gets going we can talk about actions. It started with a delay, but I’m very optimistic about the future,” she said.
Larue-Bourdages also expressed his optimism about the future of the student movements against tuition increases.
“Historically speaking, student mobilization has almost always been successful for students. The only time they don’t get what they want is when they don’t mobilize, don’t strike, and don’t put more pressure on the administration. I hope that the student movement will take mobilization seriously, because if they do, I think we will win.”
Representatives from Corbo’s office failed to reply to the Daily’s calls.

Shelters overflow as temperatures drop below -25 degrees Celsius
Montreal shelters were packed early last week, as temperatures plummeted to minus 40 degrees Celsius accounting for wind chill. In compliance with the Winter Protocol, a collaborative action involving almost every shelter in Montreal, no one was refused entry, regardless of shelters’ capacity.
Implemented four years ago, the objective of the Winter Protocol is to save lives in extreme conditions. Part of the protocol includes patrol cars searching out those in need of shelter and bringing them in. Montreal is host to over 30,000 homeless. As a result of the protocol, over the past three winters no homeless people in Montreal have died as a result of an inability to find shelter.
Canada’s largest private shelter, the Old Brewery Mission near the Old Port is crucial to maintaining this practice. The mission offers overnight shelter starting at 9 p.m. every night, and provides breakfast each morning. The weekend of January 22 it was so cold that the centre was forced to keep its doors open continuously over two days, something it has not needed to do in the last six years.
Danny Gaudat is 63 years old and has been coming to the Old Brewery Mission for two years.
“I come back here because the people are friendly and they’re helpful,” he said. “They’ll get you a decent meal, they’ll make sure that you’re comfortable and they’ll get you a place – even if you’re on the floor.”
Xavier, a homeless man who has been coming to the Old Brewery Mission for the past four years, described the people in the organization and the administration as “really, really gentle.”
“We don’t judge here,” he said.
“They know what your situation is. They know you’re not in the best of shape, and they do what they can to help you. You can’t complain about that,” Gaudat added.
The Old Brewery Mission has been open for twenty years. It takes in over 300 people each night and provides around 400 people access to a nightly hot meal and a clothing depot.
“Sometimes it’s really full and you have to sleep on the floor,” Gaudat said. “Somebody will eventually bring you a blanket – if you’re lucky a pillow. But even if not, it’s better than outside.”
Gaudat added that the strict no-violence policy creates a safe atmosphere for those staying the night.
As well as shelter, some missions offer programs to address a wider range of concerns including substance abuse, societal reintegration, and mental and behavioral issues.
Xavier described a program at the Old Brewery called the Fifth Floor. The program lasts for about a month and helps participants with a variety of tasks, including finding a job and money to pay rent so that they can figure out their next steps. According to Xavier, who has personally been involved in the program three times, the program’s short-term nature is due to the high demand for the services provided.
“There’s not much for older guys,” Gaudat said referring to other outreach programs. “They mostly consider us a write off; that’s the bottom line.
“There could be a little more funding for places like this,” he continued referring to the Old Brewery and shelters like it.
Shelters receive relatively low amounts of government support relying on private and corporate donations for over 65 percent of their budget. Most shelters only receive between $1.24 and $2.36 per person per day from the municipality for the emergency services provided. The actual cost is between $55 and $57 dollars per person per day.
Robert Levigne, chief of emergency programs and general operations at the Old Brewery spoke of the initaitve’s successes but also warned that if the shelter closed there would be “more deaths.”
“No one can tell me that’s not true,” he added.

Gerald Butts, President and CEO of WWF-Canada; Peter Coughlin, co-founder of Montreal-based real estate and investment company Redbourne Properties Inc.; and Samuel Minzberg, a director of Reitmans (Canada) Limited, Quebecor Media Inc., and Richmont Mines Inc, will replace three former external members-at-large on the McGill Board of Governors
Gerald Butts, President and CEO of WWF-Canada; Peter Coughlin, co-founder of Montreal-based real estate and investment company Redbourne Properties Inc.; and Samuel Minzberg, a director of Reitmans (Canada) Limited, Quebecor Media Inc., and Richmont Mines Inc, will replace three former external members-at-large on the McGill Board of Governors. They join nine other members-at-large on the 25-person board. Their terms began January 1, 2011, and will expire December 31, 2015, after which they will be eligible for re-election for one more five-year term.
“They are replacing three people whose terms were completed at the end of last year,” said Chris Chipello, a McGill Media Relations spokesperson.
When asked how the new members were selected, Chipello answered that they were elected through “the standard process.”
“To a degree their backgrounds speak for themselves,” said Chipello.
The Nominating and Governance Committee was responsible for nominating Butts, Coughlin, and Minzberg, whom the BoG selected from a broader field of nominations.
In a press release, Stuart Cobbett, Chair of the McGill BoG, said, “Our three new members bring with them a range of expertise that will be of considerable value to the Board in overseeing the affairs of the University.”
Butts, President and CEO of the international environmental charity WWF-Canada, will sit on the board’s Nominating and Governance Committee, whose mandate is to be “responsible for making recommendations to the Board with respect to nominations of members-at-large, appointments to Board committees, Board appointments to non-Board committees and the evaluation of the governance activities and functions of the Board.”
Minzberg will sit on the Human Resources Committee, whose mandate is to “monitor, evaluate, and make decisions on behalf of the Board with respect to policies and strategic matters related to the University’s human resources and personnel issues.”
The University is scheduled to go into collective agreement negotiations with five campus unions this calendar year, and has already begun negotiations with the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA).
Quebecor Media Inc., the media conglomerate for whom Minzberg is a director, has been trapped in bitter contract negotiations with angry Journal de Montréal workers since January 2009. Quebecor has been involved in 13 lockouts in little over ten years.

Midnight Kitchen (MK) resumed operations last Friday after resolving misunderstandings with SSMU over the collective’s certification under the Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation du Québec, which resulted in a two-day hiatus
Midnight Kitchen (MK) resumed operations last Friday after resolving misunderstandings with SSMU over the collective’s certification under the Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation du Québec, which resulted in a two-day hiatus.
MK volunteer Kayle Towsley broadcasted news of the reopening over the group’s volunteer listserv on Thursday, saying that the certification issued last year was still valid, and that re-certification was no longer an immediate concern.
“There has been a lot of confusion with SSMU. We thought we had to certify new people with food safety training, but it turns out our certification from last year is still valid, but just had to be re-submitted,” she wrote in the email obtained by The Daily.
Volunteer coordinator Carol Fraser explained that two MK members had received Institut de technologie agroalimentaire (ITA) certification last April and that it was valid “for life.” The certification numbers were mailed directly to the individuals and therefore not obtained by SSMU, which needed them for renewal.
“It’s been a learning curve for everybody…there wasn’t enough dialogue and the closure was a matter of miscommunication between us,” she added.
SSMU general manager Pauline Gervais, who oversees the Shatner building’s operations, and SSMU VP Clubs and Services
Anushay Khan approached MK volunteers on Tuesday, telling them that the collective had to cease operations until they acquired a new permit.
Khan explained SSMU’s confusion: “We had thought the collective increased to more than 20 people, [meaning that] more than two people would need to be registered, but it turns out that only ten to twelve people are involved in cooking, so only two people are needed,” she said.
Khan and Gervais have since called the registry and submitted the existing certification numbers for renewal. This means MK can resume its operations without any risk of being fined.
Serving food and alcohol is permitted in Shatner as outlined by SSMU’s Memorandum of Agreement with the University, but the ITA certificate is a requirement for any group that prepares food.
Fraser added that  “this has not been an isolated instance between us and SSMU – the new legislation is effecting soup kitchens everywhere.”
The People’s Potato, which offers a similar service at Concordia, went through the same process.
Several MK members involved with Organic Campus, the locally grown food stand that was shut down under similar circumstances last Wednesday, guessed that it would also reopen after similar paperwork processing.

Students weren’t consulted before Food Services raised meal prices over break
Students living in McGill’s residences returned from winter break to find that mandatory meal prices had risen without prior notification. Now some, under the banner of Perturbed Residents Interested in Changing Expensive Dining (PRICED), have launched a petition drive to combat the price hikes. According to Valentine Sergeev, one of the petition’s organizers, around 500 hundred students had signed their names within the first 24 hours.
McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS) currently offer one of the most expensive university meal plan options in the country, with the average plan costing $4,050. Comparable plans at Ryerson University and the University of Ottawa, for example, cost $2,900 and $1,950 respectively.
MFDS, the organization responsible for the price increases, has also implemented a $1,200 compulsory “administration charge” on top of the existing cost of the meal plan. On January 14, MFDS posted a memorandum in their dining halls offering an explanation for the inflation, namely “The seasonal price increases of fresh fruits and vegetables. … More importantly, however, the significant increase in the market prices of basic food staples.” Examples given include the rising cost of broccoli from $11.00 per case to $23.95 per case and coffee rising between eight and twelve per cent.
The unexpected change led a to group of students in Upper Rez creating PRICED. Led by Sergeev of McConnell Hall, the group aims to achieve increased communication between MFDS and students, and to have a permanent student on the MFDS board.
The petition seeks clarification of the $1,200 compulsory administration charge, the lack of prices on products, as well as failure to adhere to posted business hours.
The building resentment and frustration toward MFDS stems from what students have called a lack of student participation in decision making with respect to the inflexible mandatory meal plans and a lack of communication. The PRICED petition argues that “given that residents are financially locked into their service plans, and are thus unable to express their concerns by simply taking their business elsewhere, it is incumbent upon MFDS to exhibit greater respect and openness in their dealing with the students of residence.”
The current “Regular Meal Plan” option offered by MFDS costs residents $5,250. This includes the $1,200 “administrative charge,” with the remaining $4,050 (or 77 per cent of total) prescribed as “food dollars.” Current numbers provided by PRICED show that if a student were to purchase three hot meals a day with no beverages, the daily total would be $19.93. If the semester lasts 120 days, the semester total will come to $2,391.60, $366 more than the funds available on the plan.
Students have also argued that the price increases will result in a less nutritious diet, as affording an additional apple or box of milk per day may realistically be out of reach.
Last Friday, MFDS invited students and staff at McGill to participate in a survey to improve its services. In a recent meeting with PRICED, MFDS reportedly acknowledged the unfair price increase and intends on formally recognizing this in a letter to students, according to a member of PRICED who attended the meeting. They also intend on working jointly with PRICED to better disclose finances, which will be made available to students. They also noted that as a business, their goal is to break even.
Mathieu Laperle, the director of MFDS, did not respond to requests for comment.
