Government to raise tuition by $70 a year 
Over 1,500 students took to the street Monday night to protest the two-day education summit held by the Parti Québécois (PQ) government.
The summit has been criticized by many who believe that its outcomes have been pre-determined. The Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), a student federation representing 70,000 students, boycotted the meeting because free education was taken off the table as a discussion topic.
McGill Principal Heather Monroe-Blum also said that the summit was a “farce”, and called the meeting “choreographed” in an interview with Le Devoir two weeks ago.
Corine Trubiano, a student at the Collège de Maisonneuve who was at the protest, told The Daily in French that she did not feel the summit represented the student population fairly.
“I’m here because I’m angry that the idea of free education is being excluded from the summit. The ideas they are talking about have been pre-determined; I find that this isn’t including the entire population. ASSÉ and other student associations are not represented here today,” she said.
The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) declared the protest illegal before it started marching south from Cabot Square, where protesters gathered at 4:30 p.m. Riot police and police on bicycles flanked the march almost immediately, along with buses filled with more police dressed in riot gear at the rear.
The march snaked through residential streets in St. Henri before arriving at the Arsenal, a contemporary art gallery where the summit is being held. SPVM and Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers filled the parking lot in front of the Arsenal, blocking the entrance. A helicopter circled above, while peaceful protesters chanted anti-police slogans.
La Presse reported on Sunday that the SQ was present at the summit at the behest of Premier Pauline Marois, and would be called on if the SPVM felt it needed reinforcements.
“The police presence is completely absurd here. We aren’t living in a police state. Their huge numbers are just increasing people’s anger. It’s brutal, and it’s creating a violent image for our society. That isn’t necessary,” Trubiano said in French.
Inside the Arsenal, civil society groups, student leaders, and representatives from professors’ unions and administrative bodies tackled four areas of discussion during the twelve-and-a-half hour meeting – the quality of education and university governance, the research collaboration between schools and communities, the development of university funding, and strategies for the accessibility of education and student retention.
Marois said that she wanted to increase tuition fees by 3 per cent starting next September. This increase would be indexed to families’ disposable income, which would be a $70 increase from what students are now paying. This was the “most just” and “fairest” solution for society, Marois said.
Québec solidaire co-leader Françoise David, who wore a red square during the meeting, tweeted that the 3 per cent indexation was “indecent” and “unacceptable”.
After standing outside the Arsenal for about twenty minutes, the protesters continued east on Notre-Dame, then north on Guy and up de la Montagne. The march then headed east on Ste. Catherine.
According to SPVM spokesperson Jean-Bruno Latour, one person was arrested for armed assault after launching a projectile at police. Two people were fined – one for refusing to disperse, and another for putting stickers on a building.
While the SPVM had no information regarding the types of projectiles used, CTV speculated that the projectiles, which were thrown by several people, could have been snowballs and paint-filled ping pong balls.
Police chased protesters down to Place des Arts, where some were shoved aside from the Complexe Desjardins and held for a short time. At one point, police fired a sound bomb, also known as a flash-bang, to try to get protesters to scatter.
There were reports that an SPVM officer was injured by tear gas, but the SPVM would not comment on this by press time. Several journalists – including a Concordia University Television (CUTV) correspondent – were pepper sprayed.
The majority of protesters dispersed by around 7 p.m.; however, a group of around 100 protesters who regrouped at Place Émilie-Gamelin started another march east along Ste. Catherine. This protest was immediately declared illegal, and police announced over loudspeakers that everyone had to walk on the sidewalk or would be “broken up”.
By around 7:15 p.m., this small protest scattered at Beaudry metro. Here, riot police took a break at a local fastfood restaurant and were met with jeers from onlookers.
ASSÉ has planned a bigger protest for Tuesday, the second day of the summit, which will meet at Square Victoria at 2 p.m. The Facebook event has almost 4,500 confirmed attendees, dwarfing Monday’s event of just over 1,000 confirmed attendees.

Lower costs and better training cited
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) announced they turned a profit of $17,000 for its August 2012 Arts Frosh at a council meeting on February 13. This came as good news; for the past three years Arts Frosh has been a financial burden for AUS.
In 2010, McGill decided to withhold $90,000 from AUS as a result of two missing financial statements, $18,000 of unpaid taxes, and a $35,000 budget deficit resulting from that year’s Frosh.
The AUS VP Events at that time, Nampande Londe, cited under-registration as a reason for Frosh’s deficit. In that year, the participant cap for Frosh was raised from 1,500 to 1,800, and only around 1,400 students had signed up. AUS needed 1,600 to break even.
An anonymous organizer at the time cited Londe’s absence in the planning process of Frosh as one of the essential causes of the budget deficit.
“[Her] absence caused me to be late on food deposits, and [Frosh coordinator Brock Clancy] to be late on deposits for pubs and club night venues. A large Provigo order had to be done in three days because the SSMU and OAP refrigerators were unavailable after [Londe’s] failure to give them advance notice,” the coordinator wrote in an email to The Daily in 2010.
Miscommunication and failure to report unexpected costs were also cited among the reasons behind the deficit.
Consequently, this event resulted in Londe’s resignation from the position, although the AUS executive had said at the time that her resignation was due to an unrelated personal matter.
The following year was marked with the theft of $12,000 of Frosh money from the AUS office. According to the current AUS VP Finance Saad Qazi, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) gave AUS $8,000  to lighten the burden. The remaining $4,000 has not yet been made up.
Qazi stated that the University and the AUS were two different legal entities and therefore the police report was filed by AUS only.
“The fact that we have received the money from the University doesn’t make any sense,” said Qazi.
Last year’s AUS VP Finance Marlene Benavides, reported that Frosh had produced a profit of $6,000, however, according to current accounting information, there was a deficit of $1,700.
According to Qazi, Frosh gets sponsorship from many companies, some of which provide direct goods instead of money. Coca-Cola, for instance, provides crates of Coke, which are not reflected in accounting statements. However, the value of goods and services obtained from sponsors that do not give money does not exceed $4,000.
When asked how AUS managed to make profits this year, Qazi said that costs were lower than anticipated. But that was not simply an issue of luck: they had built up a buffer, and the budget was ready to absorb unexpected costs.
Another issue with the previous years, Qazi claimed, was that the VP Finances before him did not stay in Montreal over the summer to help with the planning of Frosh.  “There is a really steep learning curve,” said Qazi. “The incoming VP Finances did not have the experience to be efficient.”
The profit will be put into the AUS’ savings account.

Canada in violation of UN human rights charter, activist says
Around fifty people gathered in front of the monthly meeting of the Commission  scolaire de Montréal (CSM) on Wednesday to advocate for the rights of all children, especially those without immigration status, to attend primary and secondary schools in Montreal.
The protest was organized by the Education Across Borders Collective (EABC), part of migrant justice group Solidarity Across Borders (SAB).
According to SAB, there are 40,000 non-status families and thousands of children who are not currently able to attend school in Montreal. These children, many of whom have had difficult pasts, face isolation and social exclusion, issues that are exacerbated by not receiving a formal education.
Non-status children face many barriers to attending public schools in Quebec. They are required to pay up to $6,000 in tuition fees, which are unaffordable for many immigrant families. Non-status children without papers such as health insurance cards or birth certificates can also be rejected from enrolment.However, families often do not apply for this documentation in fear of deportation.
Romina Hernandez, spokesperson for the EABC, told The Daily in French that this is in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Canada is a signatory. However, she noted that that these types of agreements are not necessarily binding.
“If countries want to engage themselves internationally, in order to have a good image, but the people in their country that need the help, we usually don’t see any change,” Hernandez said.
Whether or not non-status children who manage to go to school are able to receive a diploma after graduating is uncertain. In order to get a valid diploma in Quebec, students need a permanent code – which are only given to people with legal immigration status.
“My son graduated from a secondary school in Montreal, but they won’t give him a diploma, so he can’t attend  CEGEP….If there is no change, he will not be able to get a job in the future,” a father who was at the protest, and who preferred to remain anonymous, told The Daily in French.
During the demonstration, protesters were invited inside the building, where representatives of EABC were given the opportunity to speak to the commission. Other people attending the demonstration were asked to remain in the hallway.
The EABC demanded that proof of immigration status should not be required in order to enrol in Montreal schools, and that primary and secondary education be made free for immigrants. They also asked that graduates be given permanent codes, allowing them to pursue their studies at CEGEP’s and universities.
“We also think that every child of school age in Montreal has the right to free education. It is not favourable that children stay at home, don’t learn French, and cannot integrate himself or herself in a Montreal school or Quebec society,” Daniel Duranleau, president of the CSM, said in French.
However, members of the CSM said that they were unable to give children permanent codes. Duranleau gave EABC the option of working out a precise solution to this problem, and told them to come back on March 27.
“This is a very urgent matter. One solution for the problem could be a temporary permanent code, or the politics and bureaucracy have to change in such a way that the permanent code is not necessary anymore. The commission has been supportive, and we hope that they will use their power to change the situation next time,” Hernandez told The Daily in French.

Next year’s course lecturer budget likely “zero”
With the continued threat of budget cuts throughout McGill, the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (FAES) is preparing for a reduction of classes.
In an internal memo addressed to Program Directors and Specialization Coordinators, FAES Associate Dean (Academic) William Hendershot pointed to the likely possibility of the faculty receiving a directive to cut low-enrolment courses, and to create a preemptive plan to manage the down-sizing “in a less damaging fashion.”
The memo reads that “in light of the severe financial situation of the University, it is quite possible that we will be faced with the need to decrease the number of courses we teach. I expect that the directive will focus on low-enrolment courses, without any consideration of the effect that this would have to our programs.”
Hendershot asked department heads to evaluate the relative importance of certain courses in programs, to rank the complementary ones in their programs and to identify those that are not essential.
Attached to the document was a list of courses described as “less important” to each program, which, as the document states, could be dropped with the least impact. These courses include those that are not prerequisites or program requirements.
Natural Resources Sciences Department Chair Jim Fyles told The Daily that the memo was the most recent part of an ongoing discussion, which has been taking place for at least five years.
“This is in part preparation. We expect there to be budget cuts, really serious budget cuts to be coming down shortly and over the next few years. This kind of prior reflection on these courses when we get into that position these are courses that we would look at to say, could we amalgamate those courses with other courses? Do we really need them to be taught?” Fyles said.
“In our case, [the memo] raised a lot of questions about how the offering of those courses link to government funding. Because we know that different courses have different government funding weight…if we decide we are going to close courses, we should have some sense of what that means in terms of its attachment to government funding,” he added.
The document also states that in all probability the budget for course lecturers will be zero in 2013-2014. “That means that other members of the teaching staff will be expected to teach courses that would otherwise be taught by lecturers,” reads the document.
According to Hendershot, teaching fewer courses will increase the time faculty members have to do other tasks that could increase revenue, like writing grant proposals and working on recruiting materials.
There are currently ten course lecturers employed in FAES, who are paid $7,200 per three-credit course.
In an email to The Daily, AGSEM-McGill Teaching Union’s Communications Officer Stefana Lamasanu wrote that AGSEM had not heard about courses being cut, but is “outraged that such decisions continue to be taken without discussing them with the course lecturers,” Lamasanu said.
“The administration is clearly not interested in consulting with those primarily affected by these cuts; this is unacceptable and worrisome.”
“There is no question that it will affect, we don’t currently have a budget line item for course lecturers, but we use a variety of funding sources, some of which are freeing up money from other locations that we use for teaching some courses and those will have to be taught in different ways,” said Fyles in response.

Decision made without Senate approval
McGill announced this week that in 2014, the University will join the growing ranks of universities across the United States and Canada in offering some of its classes entirely online, available to potentially thousands of students over the internet.
Massively open online courses, or MOOCs, are a growing trend across North American academia, and allow for thousands of students to enroll in college courses online, sometimes paying tuition for credit. McGill has joined a consortium called “edX,” which describes itself as a not-for-profit based in Cambridge, Massachusetts focused on the goal of educating one billion people in the next ten years.
In a press release, Provost Anthony Masi wrote that “Membership in the edX consortium ensures access to massive datasets that provide unprecedented opportunities to study how students learn in digital environments, to develop assessment tools for these broadly distributed platforms, and to improve technology-supported learning on campus.”
The decision, announced late last Wednesday, has caught a number of professors and students off guard as the decision was made without Senate approval, and with little faculty or student consultation.
At Senate on January 23, Masi gave senators an informational presentation about various MOOC consortiums. The presentation was followed by a discussion among senators about whether or not McGill should join such a consortium. As the presentation was billed as merely an informational session, no vote was taken by the Senate, and MOOCs were not discussed at last week’s Senate meeting.
During the open discussion, senators raised questions about how potentially large numbers of students would be assessed.
In an email sent to Senate by senator and political science professor Catherine Lu, and forwarded to The Daily by another senator, Lu questions the process by which the decision was made.
“I am wondering if someone can help me to understand governance processes at this university. As far as I am aware, Senate had an open discussion about MOOCs on January 23rd, and there was no agreement about proceeding with this initiative,” Lu wrote.
Lu’s email goes on to ask why there was “no effort” made to inform senators of the decision at the February Senate meeting, and questions how McGill can afford such a program of development as budget cuts are expected across the University.
According to SSMU President Josh Redel, the executive committee of the Board of Governors voted at some point during the last month to join the MOOC consortium, following a positive report from the Board’s finance committee. Redel said he was bound by confidentiality and was not allowed to say exactly when the vote took place.
Redel, through his position as SSMU president, is an observer on the Board’s executive committee, but has no vote.
Redel, who also sits on Senate, said that after the January Senate meeting “what everyone said to me is that it sounded like we were a year or two off [joining a MOOC consortium].” He did say that he was excited about MOOCs and about the particular consortium that McGill has chosen to join, but was surprised to hear about the decision last week.
“I don’t think that they made a bad choice. I think that they did put the work into it. But, just like a lot of other things at McGill, they grade-A failed at communication. Just no word about it. I’ve been here for six years. I’ve been in positions of leadership roles…. And I have never heard of [McGill’s plan to join a MOOC consortium],” Redel said.
The SSMU president went on to say that he recently learned of two “large working groups composed of very broad constituency representation,” involving University deans and members of the IT community, that have been working on the issue of MOOCs for as long as two years.
In an email to The Daily, AGSEM–McGill’s teaching union president Lilian Radovac wrote: “It is more than mildly ironic that McGill is climbing on the MOOC bandwagon at the same time as it’s putting hundreds of undergraduate courses and the lecturers that teach them on the chopping block.”
Alvin Shrier, president of the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT), declined to comment, saying that the MAUT has not had a chance to consider the decision.
On Friday afternoon, Masi sent an email to senators in an effort to respond to Senator Lu’s concerns.
In the email, Masi writes that senators were not informed of the decision at the February 19 senate meeting because the McGill was still in negotiations with edX, and was unable to announce the partnership until the next day.
Responding to Lu’s concerns about approval and the governance procedure, Masi wrote that MOOCs were implicitly given the go-ahead by senate in its approval of the Achieving Strategic Academic Priorities (ASAP) administration policy paper, voted on in October.
Masi goes on to write that his understanding of the Senate discussion of MOOCs in January was that McGill should “occupy the MOOC space,” and should do it “deliberately.”
“If and when new courses or programs may be offered via this consortium for McGill credit, Senate will have an opportunity to discuss these issues again,” Masi wrote to senators.
Money to pay for the development of MOOCs at McGill will come from exclusively philanthropic sources, according to Masi’s email.
MOOCs reportedly have a dropout rate of approximately 90 per cent, according to an article in the New York Times.
