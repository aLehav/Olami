On March 15, 150,000 people took to the streets of Montreal to demand climate justice. The demonstration was organized by high school, CEGEP, and university students in conjunction with over a million students around the world. Montreal’s demonstration ranks among one of the largest worldwide. Students and demonstrators met at the Sir Georges-Étienne Cartier Monument at noon, marched through downtown, and rallied at Place des Arts. As protestors marched, they chanted slogans, such as “system change, not climate change,” and “sausau- sau- sauver la planète [save the planet].” 
Anne Sophie, a Montreal resident, was asked why she attended the demonstration. She pointed to her son and said, “I’m here because of him, because of my daughter, and because power belongs to the people. When the politicians don’t listen, we need to make them listen.” Université de Montréal student, Gabriel Hamelin Roussel, emphasized the importance of the government’s role in combating climate change, telling the Daily that climate justice “definitely has a political dimension that has to be addressed.” Many others, including speakers at McGill’s rally, organized by members of Divest McGill and La planète s’invite à l’Université  McGill (LPSU), argued that climate change is tied to the current global economic and political system. As a result, combating climate change means drastically changing the status quo.
UdeM student Camille Abbas said, “I think it’s a really important cause. […] I hope that people will do this daily. If we do, I believe that we can change things.” Many others echoed the sentiment that while the march was important, sustained pressure was a necessary next step. McGill student Nivedita Shukla also spoke to the importance of the rally, saying,“it’s disappointing to know that there are still people out there who don’t believe in climate change, who think of it as a hoax, whilst everything around them actively suffers. This kind of action can be the only way to spark consciousness and make it a universal priority to save what we have left to save.”

Islamophobic Violence in New Zealand
content warning: Islamophobia, violence, death
On March 15, during Friday (Jummah) prayers, a gunman opened fire on worshippers at Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. The shooter live streamed the terrorist attack on his Facebook account. He then drove five kilometres to Linwood Mosque, where he carried out a second shooting. In total, 49 people were murdered. 
Local police arrested three people on suspicion of possession of firearms. Weapons were found at both mosques and explosives were found in cars. A twenty eight-year-old man has been charged with murder in connection with the attacks. 
Before the first shooting, a 16,000 word unsigned manifesto was posted on Twitter and 8chan. The document expresses severe anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments as well as white supremacist ideology, and includes plans for the attacks. The same Twitter account, now deleted, posted pictures of weapons and protective gear painted with the names of other mass shooters who have carried out Islamophobic and anti-immigrant attacks, as well as a neo-Nazi symbol. In the live stream and in the manifesto, the shooter listed other white nationalists and white supremacists, some of whom have also committed mass shootings and terrorist attacks on racialized communities, as sources of inspiration for his own attack. 
The gunman was clear in his Islamophobic, racist, and extremist intentions. His decision to open fire during Jummah prayers is also a deliberate and targeted one, as midday Friday prayers are sacred and significant in Islam. 
There is a fund for the victims’ families on LaunchGood. Funds will be distributed by The New Zealand Islamic Information Centre. The New Zealand Council of Victim Support Groups has also set up a donation fund, which can be found on our website.

DPCP Conclusion: SPVM Killing of Coriolan “Justified”
content warning: violence, police brutality, anti-Black racism
On June 27, 2017, SPVM officers shot and killed Pierre Coriolan, a 58-year-old Black man with a history of mental illness. Coriolan was killed in the hallway outside his apartment on Robillard Avenue near St-André Street in the Gay Village. 
SPVM officers yelled at Coriolan as they entered the apartment; rather than de-escalating the situation, the officers created a more tense environment. Coriolan did not pose a threat to anyone. He was reported as being alone and yelling in his apartment. Furthermore, officers used extreme force despite Coriolan being clearly incapacitated after falling to the ground. They can be seen striking Coriolan with a baton, tazing him twice, kicking him in the ribs, and punching him in the head. It is clear from videos taken by witnesses that officers made no effort to interact with Coriolan or de-escalate the situation. 
Earlier this month, a three person panel from the Directeur des Poursuites Criminelles et Pénales (DPCP) released their decision regarding the use of force against Coriolan. This decision followed the Bureau des Enquêtes Indépendantes’ (BEI) examination, an independent group that reviews cases of police violence. Based on the results of the BEI’s report, the DPCP concluded that the use of police force in killing Pierre Coriolan was justified. Notably, none of the BEI’s investigations have ever convicted a single officer. 
The coroner’s office has recommended the SPVM undergo more training in aiding people who suffer from mental illness. The SPVM even acknowledged that very few of their officers are trained in de-escalating mental health crises. However, the DPCP justified the actions of the officers, stating that “police are often placed in situations where they have to rapidly make difficult decisions. In this context, it cannot be expected that they measure the level of force applied with precision.” Even though the officers’ use of force resulted in Coriolan’s death, they went on to conclude that the officers did not commit a crime. 
Coriolan’s family’s lawyer, Virginie Dufresne-Lemire, stated that the family would still continue to pursue a civil case against the city. In a phone interview with CTV, she asked, “was it right the way they intervened, how they prepared and decided to intervene, the words they used and in what way they were said? Was that the right way to intervene with people in crisis?” 
The results of the lawsuit against the city have yet to be announced.

STM Spokesperson Defends Violence at Villa-Maria Metro
content warning: violence, police brutality, racism
On March 8, 2019, Nzo Hodges posted a video to Facebook depicting two STM agents repeatedly and violently striking a man next to the Villa-Maria metro tracks. The two-minute video shows the man, whose identity remains unknown, being wrestled to the ground and hit with batons by the two officers. He repeatedly yells in French that “it hurts” and begs the officers to “stop hitting [him], please” as he lies on his back with his hands protecting his head. While he is in this prone position near the tracks, the officers begin hitting him again with their batons just as the train arrives. The officers’ blows push him extremely close to the train, and the man’s head is only prevented from colliding with the arriving metro due to his struggling and maneuvering around the officers’ strikes. The video ends as the man struggles to free himself and escape, leaving his jacket and backpack behind. 
While the STM claims that the officers approached the man because he was bothering other passengers, witness Samantha Gold, who was riding the metro next to him, says that “nothing about his conduct or posturing on the metro drew any attention” from other passengers. She says that she first noticed him when she saw the two officers approach him “with purpose,” and then begin to question him “somewhat aggressively.” She says that she felt that the man was “unfairly targeted” and that the STM agents were “too quick to [use] violence.” Similarly, Hodges, who posted the video, says that the man “wasn’t being aggressive – they were being aggressive with him.” He says that he started recording after he saw the passenger being “abruptly thrown against the concrete wall and onto the ground.” 
However, STM spokesperson Philippe Dery stated that “everything was done by the book” and that the passenger “inconvenienced other passengers” – directly contradicting both what witnesses and the video depict of the event. Dery added that “the level of force is always in relation to the level of cooperation with the person being approached,” despite the fact that the officers are shown repeatedly striking a man who is nonviolently and non threateningly lying on the ground, repeating that he is hurt, and asking not to be hit. Furthermore, despite the fact that the man’s identity is unknown, he seems to be racialized while the two officers appear to be white: this is yet another example of the larger pattern of police violently targeting people of colour.

Protests in Algeria and in the Diaspora Prove Successful
On February 9, 2019, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced that he was running for a fifth term. As a result, weeks of protests erupted in Algeria and in the diaspora. 
The Algerian Consulate in Montreal, located at the corner of Saint Urbain and Sherbrooke, has been the site of recurring protests since the announcement of Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term. An estimated 1,000 protestors participated in the most recent demonstration on March 10. 
Following these demonstrations, on March 11, Bouteflika rescinded his bid for the presidency in the country’s upcoming elections set for April. Bouteflika made the announcement via a letter that describes the need for “deep reforms in the political, institutional, economic, and social fields;” this includes a postponement of the April presidential elections until after reforms are implemented. 
Bouteflika, 82, has been in power for 20 years. When he came to power in 1999, he was credited with ending the country’s civil war and praised for maintaining social stability throughout the first ten years of his rule, largely with the good fortune of high oil prices. 
As oil prices fell, so did the country’s unemployment rate. In 2008, he amended the country’s constitution to remove the two term limit on presidential rule, enabling him to serve a third and fourth term. 
After suffering a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public. As a result, many Algerians deem him unfit to govern. There is great concern that Bouteflika is used as by the military, business elites, and politicians as a way to rule. Allegedly, Bouteflika’s brother, Saïd Bouteflika, is acting as de facto president in his place. 
Since Bouteflika announced his planned reforms, there have been concerns over internal power dynamics. The announcement mentions his plan to appoint a new government as well as a “national conference.” 
This conference will be responsible for drafting a new constitution as well as setting the date of the next presidential election. 
Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui has become Prime Minister following the resignation of Ahmed Ouyahia. The new Prime Minister has announced plans to create a technocratic interim government with a cabinet representative of the young people leading the recent protests. 
Some are concerned Bouteflika will remain in power until this election, thereby extending his final term. Others are looking to those in Bouteflika’s inner-circle, waiting to see if someone will emerge as his successor. Ultimately, it seems that the protests have been effective, but what will happen in the long-term remains unclear.
