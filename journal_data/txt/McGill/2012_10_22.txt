Critics accuse government of glorifying war and distorting details
The Harper government renamed a federal building in Old Montreal on Wednesday, October 10 as part of a $28 million campaign to commemorate the bicentennial of the War of 1812. Located at 400 Place d’Youville, the Édifice des douanes is now officially the Dominique Ducharme Building.
“Mr. Ducharme fought both at the Battle of Beaver Dams in Upper Canada and at the Battle of the Chateauguay, and played an important role in Canada’s development,” Minister of Public Works and Government Services Rona Ambrose stated in a press release.
“The building’s proximity to the Battle of the Chateauguay site gives it special historic significance for the region,” Jacques Gourde, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, said at the October 10 naming ceremony.
According to the government press release, the Battle of Chateauguay was a decisive loss for the Americans, who abandoned their Saint Lawrence campaign.
Pierre Nantel, vice-critic for Canadian Heritage for the New Democratic Party, told La Presse in French that he is “concerned to see new symbols being imposed as new icons of Canada, implying that the symbols which have been built over the years have not been sufficient.”
In an interview with The Daily, Canadian military history expert and Hiram Mills Emeritus Professor Desmond Morton explained that the federal government is not giving the full story on Ducharme.
“[Ducharme] was the British Army’s Indian Department agent with the Mohawks who defeated the Americans at Beaver Dams, using the information Laura Secord had brought to Lieutenant Fitzgibbon. As usual in our history, reference to the Mohawks is never part of the Laura Secord story,” said Morton.
“The real victors in the War of 1812 weren’t the Upper Canadians [Ontario]; it was the Lower Canadians [Quebec] who provided much of the troops in the early victories,” Morton continued. “The best militia in North America was the militia that had evolved in Lower Canada.”
“Nobody in Ontario ever hears about this. I’m not sure Mr. Harper wants them to, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to recognize that the French Canadians saved them so they could go on being Canadians,” he added.
History Students’ Association (HSA) President Hannah Wood told The Daily, “Canadian history as taught in elementary and secondary schools is highly selective. The War of 1812 was never discussed.”
However, according to Wood, the war was symbolically formative to the Canadian nation. “A fundamental part of popular Canadian identity is the fact we are not American. Although the War of 1812 may technically have been a British war, Canada has historically identified with Britain over America,” she said.
Wood said she hopes “there is a concerted effort to represent events such as the War of 1812 accurately, and not idealize them as the government has done in its press releases and television commercials.”
She specified that these views are her own and do not necessarily represent those of HSA constituents.
In an interview with The Daily, Alan Taylor – Pulitzer Prize winner, Distinguished Professor of History at the University of California, Davis, and author of The Civil War of 1812 – said, “in Upper Canada at the start of the war, most of the inhabitants were settlers from the United States. During the first two years of the war most of them sought to avoid any service in the war, on either side, and some of them did join the invaders.”
“By the last year of the war, most of the Upper Canada inhabitants did reluctantly become more active in defending the colony and the war did create a greater sense of Canadian patriotism,” said Taylor.
However, Taylor noted, “Canadian militia played an important role but of lesser importance when compared to the leading roles played by the British regulars and the First Nation peoples.”
“My dissent from the government position is that it implies that all Canadians immediately rallied to defend the colony [and] that there was already a unified Canada when in fact there were seven distinct colonies,” he said.
Taylor also criticized the Canadian government for glorifying the war. “The government line also misses a golden opportunity to treat the war as a tragedy that persuaded both Americans and the British that they should avoid future wars,” he said. “The 200 years of peace warrant our celebration far more than does the supposed glories of a war full of miseries.  At the 1912 centennial commemoration there was much more bi-national cooperation around the message of shared peace.”
“While spending $29 million on TV ads and reenactments, the federal government has gutted the budgets of Parks Canada and the Library and Archives Canada, which strikes me as a misallocation of priorities and resources,” Taylor added.

A resolution to create an Equity Policy for the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) was passed last Wednesday at the AUS Legislative Council meeting. The resolution was drafted by VP Internal Justin Fletcher and AUS Middle East Studies representative Ella Nalepka.
According to Fletcher, the policy aims to foster “a safe space [for students]…in which everyone will feel included and have the ability to participate in AUS events and services.” The policy will also outline principles of anti-oppression and non-discrimination. Fletcher further explained that this policy will establish a framework that the AUS Council can abide by when planning events and providing services.
The policy will also provide guidelines for how student grievances might be addressed if they feel that the equity policy has been violated.
The resolution mandated that an Ad Hoc Equity Committee be created in order to formulate the policy. Fletcher explained that the committee will consist of himself, two AUS councillors, and two members-at-large to be selected through an application procedure. The committee will also carry out a consultation process, which will be open to all AUS members to provide their suggestions and ideas.
Fletcher stated that the committee hopes to have a policy to bring before AUS Council by their November 28 meeting.

Principal’s Task Force and five-year strategic academic plan also covered
McGill Senate met last Wednesday for the second time this year. Discussion lingered on the accessibility of interfaculty and interdepartmental course registration, but topics also included university funding, asbestos research at McGill, the Principal’s Task Force on Diversity, Excellence and Community Engagement, and the Open Forum on Free Expression and Peaceful Assembly report.
In her opening statement, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum underlined her concern about government investment in education and the quality of education and student support at the University, stating that she “[didn’t] want to start sounding like a broken record, but we need these resources in a consistent and predictable manner.”
She noted that the new provincial government had been “quite quiet” in interactions with the University, and that a summit would most likely be scheduled for the following spring.
Asbestos research
Dean of Medicine David Eidelman spoke briefly about the report prepared by the University’s Research Integrity Officer Abraham Fuks to address allegations of academic misconduct against McGill Professor Emeritus J. Corbett Macdonald, who researched the health effects of asbestos in the 1970s.
Eidelman stated that in releasing the report to the public, he hoped to dispel beliefs that McGill “was in some kind of conspiracy with the asbestos industry.”
Several senators asked why the report did not address larger issues concerning McGill’s relationship to the asbestos industry – namely, the fact that a prominent asbestos exporter sat on the University’s Board of Governors until last year – as well as its research financing practices in general.
Interdisciplinary registration
SSMU VP University Affairs Haley Dinel and Arts Senator Max Zidel said that the lack of a university-wide guide on interdepartmental course registration had resulted in the presence of vastly different registration policies, which can make registration difficult and frustrating.
In response, Provost Anthony Masi reiterated that while a strong depth and breadth of learning was a part of the McGill experience, the priority of registering major and minor students in their departmental courses naturally preceded “latitude enrichment.” He also stated that as a large university, practical concerns would have to factor in policy decisions, though steps were being taken to improve interdepartmental relations.
Masi additionally informed Senate that the University was working with Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson to eliminate low-enrollment courses and programs in order to allocate more time for the teaching of courses that were more in demand. Masi acknowledged that reducing certain courses would not appeal to the entire student body, and once again would involve a trade-off between specificity and breadth.
During the meeting, the student senators asked whether students’ needs were fully taken into account by faculty policymakers. While the Faculty of Arts has reduced its major credit requirements from 56 to 36 in light of student demand, Senator   and Post-Graduate Students’ Society Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney remarked that other majors, especially in the Faculty of Science, still required 76 credits out of a 90-credit program.
Senator and Dean of Science Martin Grant pointed out that the specific nature of science programs and the necessity of prerequisite courses were the reasons for a high-credit major, especially in honours programs. He also stated that pursuing a Bachelor of Arts and Science was an option for students who wanted a more inter-faculty degree.
According to Masi, the expansion and improvement of interdepartmental course registration is central to McGill’s commitment to maintaining its global reputation as a world leader in education. The Academic Policy Committee will be working with the deans of each faculty to discuss the issue, although no concrete policies have been put in place.
The Task Force
In response to the recommendations made by the Principal’s Task Force on Diversity, Excellence and Community Engagement, the administration decided to expand the mandate of the Associate Provost for Policies, Procedures, and Equity to include the promotion and monitoring of diversity at the University. The administration’s official response suggested implementing measures aimed at increasing “the number of individuals from groups now underrepresented in various segments of the McGill community, in particular, visible minorities, Aboriginal groups, women, persons with disabilities, and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups.”
ASAP 2012: Achieving Strategic Academic Priorities
Senate endorsed the academic strategies and objectives outlined in the Provost’s five-year strategic academic plan. Like the Task Force, ASAP emphasized the importance of diversifying the University’s staff and faculty. The 81-page document outlined ten central objectives, including: that McGill revise its academic hiring policy, especially concerning tenure-track professors; provide adequate student aid to improve the accessibility of education to “underrepresented population groups”; “ensure innovation in graduate studies”; “develop a culture of ‘best practices’” in its administrative policies; improve opportunities for advancement with its support staff; implement better feedback loops; provide a service to “Quebec, Canada, and the global community”; and “encourage diversity in…ideas among faculty, students, and staff.”
Mooney remarked that the goals outlined in the report were “so broad that they became aphorisms.”

University redaction practices questioned
McGilliLeaked, a website compiling various documents about McGill University – including contracts, security reports, and investments – was launched last week.
Among the documents are the University’s contract with the private security company Securitas and its contract with MIR3, the company in charge of the emergency text alerts for which the University spends a total of $37,220.20 per year.
Students and student journalists from The Daily and The Link obtained the documents from McGill through various Access to Information (ATI) requests.
U3 Economics student Christopher Bangs requested the majority of the documents, and was also responsible for compiling and uploading all documents to the McGilliLeaked website.
“A lot of us have been submitting a lot of ATIs over the last year and a half or so. We had a lot of interesting documents, a lot of interesting security reports…I thought it would be cool if we all had access to all of these documents that we requested,” Bangs told The Daily.
In an email to The Daily, Vice-Principal (External Relations) Olivier Marcil stated that McGill University releases “hundreds of documents” under Quebec’s Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information.
“The fact that these documents were released shows that the University is fulfilling its obligation and that the system is working,” said Marcil.
However, Bangs said the high volume of ATI requests received by McGill reflects flaws in the University’s structure.
“The number of Access to Information requests received by McGill University in the last few years is many times higher than a decade ago. Similarly, the Committee on Student Grievances has seen a huge rise in the number of cases brought by students against the school,” Bangs wrote in an email to The Daily.
“While McGill seems to think that these changes show that the system works, in reality they are indicative of the broad shift in the University…from a collegial, decentralized system with informal, personal conflict resolution methods and more transparency to a system micromanaged by a few people at the top of the hierarchy,” he wrote.
“The fact that so many ATIs are made now shows how few avenues remain to gain access to basic information about this public university.”
In an interview with The Daily, Bangs also mentioned that the University has sent him letters to prevent him from getting access to certain information.
“[McGill] can deny requests [in the case of] security issues. McGill has said that my requests at times were repetitive, systematic and just too many documents for them to handle,” he said.
Bangs and McGill had a mediation session over the summer regarding the ATIs of the Independent Student Inquiry, a group formed last year to investigate the events of November 10. According to Bangs, the two parties met with an employee of the Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec.
Marcil also referred to documents which were blacked-out – or redacted – to conceal confidential information.
“Some of the information [the McGilliLeaked documents] contain was redacted in application of exceptions to disclosure provided in the law, or in order to protect the privacy of individuals,” wrote Marcil.
In response, Bangs claimed that University figures use redactions to “protect [themselves] from the consequences of their decisions made on the job.”
“Members of the Board of Governors are responsible for running this university, and the decisions they make are often public and always important, but the University redacts the names of members in the minutes,” said Bangs. “Their privacy is not at issue here, for there is no right to privacy in this case, and I hope that the University will review its policy on redactions.”

Councillors divided over online ratification
Last Thursday, the Legislative Council of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) met for the fourth time this semester to discuss a series of motions presented at the Fall General Assembly (GA) earlier this month.
Instead, councillors found themselves tied up in procedural debate after a report by the Steering Committee found a series of weaknesses in the by-laws of the SSMU constitution.
The Steering Committee’s report detailed several tensions between the role of Council and the constitutional integration of online ratification.
In accordance with article 7.3 in the SSMU By-Law Book 1, motions passed at a GA that have lost quorum – and are thus non-binding and passed as a consultative forum – are then passed to Council by direction of the Steering Committee. The traditional role of Council is to simply “rubber stamp” the motions based on the vote of the consultative forum.
However, as the by-law stands, there is no precedent for the integration of online ratification in the situation of a vote by consultative forum.
Councillors were divided over the merits of online ratification.
Claire Stewart-Kanigan, newly-elected Arts representative to SSMU, told The Daily, “decisions should be arrived at via discussion and debate, but with online ratification, this process is devalued,” adding that she “fundamentally disapproved” of the process.
VP University Affairs Haley Dinel, on the other hand, saw online ratification as “beneficial to the GA process.”
“I am in fact hopeful that it will lead to a different kind of participation at the GA,” Dinel told The Daily.
The Steering Committee also raised concerns about Council’s mandate to pass external and potentially divisive motions – such as the motion on war with Iran – and held in its report, “the Legislative Council holds no authority to adopt positions on external affairs brought to the General Assembly.”
Several councillors proposed to amend or debate the motions in question to orient them more under SSMU’s mandate and make the motions less externally-based.
President Josh Redel, however, cautioned against Council debating or amending motions presented in a GA, pointing out the “clear distinction between the direct democracy of the GA and representative democracy of the council.”
There is a legal precedent in the by-law book to table all motions passed by a consultative forum until the next GA, which would take place in the 2013 winter semester.
Suggestions to follow this precedent were met with strong opposition.
“[These motions] are time-sensitive issues that must be discussed as soon as possible. By the time the next GA rolls around, it may be too late to take a meaningful stance on the issues at hand,” Stewart-Kanigan told The Daily.
VP Internal Michael Szpejda said that it was preferable to fix the constitutional loopholes before passing the motions in either Council or in the next GA.
The four motions were tabled until the next meeting of Council on November 1 to allow the Steering Committee to make final decisions on the possible amendment of the by-laws.

Tuition and underfunding major concerns
Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum addressed a crowd of 425 people last Friday afternoon on the importance of bringing international students to Quebec universities.
The event, hosted by the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations, was held at Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth Hotel in downtown Montreal. The main event of the afternoon was Munroe-Blum’s speech, entitled “Quebec in the race for global talent.”
The speech was structured around “myths” about international students in Quebec. According to Munroe-Blum, one such myth is the fact that “higher tuition rates would drive talented Quebec and international students away from [Quebec] universities.”
“Studies across the country are crystal-clear: no link exists between the amount of tuition and attendance in universities,” she said.
Munroe-Blum also mentioned that McGill seeks to attract international students for the “cultural and intellectual enrichment of our learning community,” and not for gains from higher tuition.
“Under the Quebec funding system, most of the tuition paid by students from outside Quebec returns to the government…Because of this, each year, McGill gives back around $55 million of its students’ fees,” said Munroe-Blum.
SSMU President Josh Redel, who was present at the conference, told The Daily in an email that although the Principal’s statements were based on research, there are important caveats to account for.
“While increased tuition may not affect overall attendance in universities, it is quite likely that higher tuition would certainly affect attendance by under-represented groups that might not have the privilege of being able to afford the higher tuition,” wrote Redel.
According to Redel, SSMU stands for accessible education for all.
Redel also pointed to ways of helping international students in terms of entrance and language support.
“I think [Quebec] needs to provide better support for international students by cutting down the red tape surrounding the visa and study visa process…[and] provide better language support for international students,” wrote Redel. “I think many students would love to be able to learn French and speak it while they are here, but the province provides no such framework to assist in that endeavour. By providing a better support system for teaching and learning French, more students would be able to become employed and would be way more likely to remain in the province.”
Munroe-Blum gave three recommendations: to increase the number of French courses offered at McGill, to increase the number of international student enrolment to 33 per cent, and to encourage investment in higher education.
This event also marked the first meeting of Munroe-Blum and Minister of Higher Education Pierre Duchesne.
Following the conference session, Munroe-Blum met with members of the student and Montreal press. At the meeting, The Daily asked about the effect of the Quebec student strike on McGill’s international reputation.
“The international world is used to disruption and I did a lot of interviews with international media back in the spring. At the same time, London was having riots, California was having riots, everywhere you go in the world there were things happening… It is true today that Montreal is one of the safest really cosmopolitan, big cities where students from around the world can come,” responded Munroe-Blum.
The McGill Tribune asked about the portion of international student tuition that goes into the Quebec financial aid system but which students don’t have access to.
“It is a significant portion of the tuition fee they pay [that] they don’t get the benefit of, and McGill doesn’t get the finances to support them. So if you look around McGill right now, you’ll see blue bins all over our campus asking our employees to bring coats because we have students from the South, from developing countries, who are here without winter clothes,” said Munroe-Blum.
“If you’re coming from a background where no one in your family has gone to university before and you don’t have much financial resources, you need more support than free tuition. You actually need full support for all kinds of services…. We are underfunded so we’re making a strong case – I’ll make it to the Minister – that money should stay where the students pay it,” she added.
The Daily also asked about McGill’s ability to finance international marketing considering the state of university funding.
Munroe-Blum pointed to the fact that the University depends on others – like alumni – to pay for marketing.
“Our Hong Kong alumni and our China mainland alumni are very upset that McGill doesn’t advertise there,” she said. “Queen’s University does, Toronto does, all the American universities do, the Australian universities do, the British universities do, and they are saying, ‘we want our alma mater to be seen in the newspaper and seen on television.’”
