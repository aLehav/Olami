Busy spring looms as activist groups multiply
A far-reaching social movement is taking shape against expansive funding cuts to public institutions in Quebec.
“It’s [only] the beginning,” Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said in French last April, announcing that $3.7 billion in cuts to public institutions would be made in 2014-15. “We’re at the beginning of an action that will be spread out over an entire [electoral] mandate.”
With the goal of balancing the budget by 2015-16 and running a surplus in 2017-18, the Liberal government has imposed severe cuts to education, healthcare, community organizations, and other public services.
The Liberals’ austerity measures drew the ire of a large portion of the population, with tens of thousands taking to the streets on October 31 and November 29. The movement is renewing its struggle with increased vigour in 2015 – the past few months have seen activists organize in interest-, institution-, or region-based Comités printemps 2015, or Spring Committees. The Comités are open to all, decentralized, and loosely coordinated through a “Comité large” that meets every few weeks in Montreal.
“We’ve been very active in supporting local picket lines of clinics and hospitals that are under attack recently,” said Richard St-Pierre, a Centre-Sud resident involved in the neighbourhood’s autonomous popular assembly, of the work of the Comité large in an interview with The Daily. Along with several unions and community organizations, the neighbourhood assembly regularly sends representatives to meetings of the Comité.
The Comité large had its first meeting of the year on January 12. “We just voted to start our 2015 campaign in January with support for daycare services in Quebec, [which] are under serious attack,” said St-Pierre.
“Through the years [since the 1970s], the struggle [for accessible daycare in Quebec] has continued to the point that we have the least expensive daycare services across Canada,” St-Pierre continued. St-Pierre also noted that the newly announced modulation of rates for daycare services imposed according to parents’ revenue will only serve to reduce government subsidies.
The daycare workers’ collective agreement will come to an end on March 31, along with that of most public sector workers in Quebec. Many activists in the Comités printemps are hoping for a general strike in the public sector once the collective agreements end.
“We could do otherwise – reject the ‘there is no alternative’ argument […] and realize that there could be other choices.”
Various community organizations are also associated with the Comités printemps. On November 19, hundreds of these organizations across Quebec closed for 225 minutes in protest, to symbolize the $225 million in funding they lack to be able to provide adequate services.
“We had a promise from [the last Parti Québécois] government – they promised $120 million of [additional] money for these organizations,” Sébastien Rivard, coordinator at the Regroupement intersectoriel des organismes communautaires de Montréal (RIOCM), told The Daily in an interview. “We [had] been waiting for at least ten years for new funds, and the Liberals, the first thing they did – they cut [those] new funds.”
“[Underfunded groups] cannot provide the services they should to people, so, in the end, it’s people [who] are the victims of these austerity measures,” added Rivard.
At Collège de Maisonneuve, teachers and students alike have taken action to protest the Liberals’ particularly severe cuts to CEGEPs across the province. In November, the teachers’ union – the Syndicat des professeures et professeurs du Collège de Maisonneuve (SPPCM) – collaborated with the student association to stage a picket line.
In an interview with The Daily, SPPCM President Benoît Lacoursière described the austerity program as a political choice.
“There is plenty of ability to implement creative solutions to increase revenues from elsewhere,” Lacoursière said in French. “Many budgetary problems arise because the government doesn’t want to tax big businesses.”
“I think this movement [the Comités printemps] is very important. […] We have to stop [the cuts], and we have to do it this year,” he said, pointing to the fact that funding cuts are set to continue indefinitely.
According to Rivard, the RIOCM is planning a new strike day this spring on May 1.
“We could do otherwise – reject the ‘there is no alternative’ argument […] and realize that there could be other choices,” added Rivard.

Justin Irwin, president of AGSEM: McGill’s Teaching Union, put forward alternatives to austerity in the McGill context.
“One of the challenges that we face is that there is a real willingness on part of both the government and public opinion to see these constant cuts and austerity as being something inevitable,” Irwin told The Daily.
“McGill wants to tell us that they are in dire economic straits all the time, but in fact, in some respects, their finances are more healthy than they like to present,” continued Irwin. For example, McGill’s budget projects an increase in net assets of almost $90 million for 2014-15, he said.
Ultimately, St-Pierre emphasized both the necessity for local organization and the global nature of the struggle.
“The solution, to our leaders, so far, is easy – it’s not up to them to pay for the crisis [of capitalism],” said St-Pierre. “If we don’t accept that logic, and I don’t think we should, the only alternative we have is to take the struggle into our own hands and say ‘no.’ And if this ‘no’ represents a call for a new society – even better.”

Professor highlights inadequacy of ‘multicultural’ narrative in McGill talk
Anthony Stewart, a professor of English at Bucknell University, gave a series of talks at McGill this week entitled “Talking Black to Canada.” Drawing partly on his own experience of growing up as a person of colour in this country, Stewart offered a penetrating analysis of Canada’s collective perception of itself as a tolerant, multicultural nation.
Speaking to a packed lecture hall on Friday afternoon, he discussed the consequences of this shared perception, and the extent to which it is divorced from the everyday realities faced by people of colour.
“Canada’s national story claims, in essence […] that of all the human social arrangements in the history of the species, Canada, and Canada alone, has been able to exist without racism,” said Stewart. “That’s arrogance.”
He explained that another widely-held notion – among white Canadians, at least – is that if racism does exist in their country, it is nowhere near as serious or as prevalent as in the U.S.; or, if it used to exist, the situation has improved immeasurably.
This, said Stewart, is not an acceptable response to racial inequality. “What I want you to understand is that not being as bad as someone else is not good enough, and still comes at great cost to those whose experience and existence contradicts the story.”
Stewart emphasized that this story is harmful. “Constantly being told that there is not a problem, when you know there is one, does things to you cognitively,” he said.
“I became aware from an early age that my claims to my own Canadianness were under constant strain.”
To illustrate the damaging effects of this narrative of colourblindness, Stewart alluded to the incident in 2013 when Chris Spence, former director of education at the Toronto District School Board, stepped down over allegations of plagiarism.
“When [Spence] loses his job under suspicion of plagiarism, while the mayor of the same city keeps his job despite […] criminal activity […] we are within our rights to remember that Chris Spence is black, and Rob Ford is white, even if the national story tells us that race doesn’t matter in such, or indeed in any, decision-making in Canada.”
Stewart explained that he himself had experienced the unsavoury reality of racism in Canada, from racial taunts in the elementary school playground to more insidious forms of discrimination in the academic world.
“I became aware from an early age that my claims to my own Canadianness were under constant strain; a strain that only increased as I aged, gained more academic credentials, and grew increasingly aware of the stories I was relentlessly told about the nation where I was born. Stories that, more often than not, imprinted upon me a sense of non-belonging, of being insufficiently Canadian,” said Stewart.
In the end, said Stewart, we must think critically about the national narratives we create for ourselves, and work toward re-imagining Canada so as to deal better with our differences.
“Stories construct our reality, right? They’re really central, and some people argue they’re the only way for us to understand our world. […] The good news is, we can change stories, and maybe, maybe, maybe, if we change enough stories […] then we can change ideology.”
Speaking to The Daily after the event, Lerona-Dana Lewis – a representative of Community-University Talks (C-Uni-T), which organized the lecture – expressed satisfaction with the attendance and audience participation. “Usually when it’s something that addresses people of colour, very few people come,” Lewis said. “It’s really encouraging to see that [so many students attended].”
C-Uni-T is a Montreal organization that raises awareness regarding issues faced by people of colour on university campuses. “It really gives undergraduate students who are facing racism a space to talk about this, and to know that other people understand what they’re saying,” said Lewis.
“Oftentimes, people tend to internalize, and think ‘it’s my problem,’ but as we heard from [Stewart], it’s the story that we’ve been told about Canada being this place where everybody’s welcome. In fact, some people are not welcome.”

BRIEF
The Flat, McGill’s bike collective, welcomed a new bicycle-part vending machine on January 12. Located beside The Flat, room B-02 in the Shatner building, the vending machine is the first of its kind in Montreal, according to collective member Matt Ainsley.
Already up and running, the vending machine contains all items that were available for sale at The Flat, such as inner tubes, bike lights, brake cables, tools, and promotional material. Because the machine was funded by a Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Space Fund grant, prices will not rise to cover the cost of the machine, and all earnings will go back into running the collective, as they have in the past.
The idea for a bike-part vending machine was raised about a year ago by former Flat member Harald Kliems, with the goal of addressing the collective’s main constraints – lack of space, long wait times, crowds, and restricted hours. Since Kliems’ departure, the project has been spearheaded by Ainsley.
The collective hopes that the machine will allow cyclists to address any problems they might have outside of opening hours, or to forgo lineups at The Flat and simply head home or to the public repair stand by the Bronfman building on McTavish.
The vending machine was purchased from a local supplier, and has been custom-spaced to fit bike parts. At this point in time, it also looks like a very standard machine, but The Flat is hoping to change that: the collective is looking for a student artist to paint the machine, with the possibility of reimbursement.

Executive committee removed from office following investigation
On January 7, the Teaching and Research Assistants at Concordia (TRAC) union was put under the trusteeship of its parent organization, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). This action followed an investigation by PSAC that resulted in the removal of the TRAC executives from their respective positions on the grounds that there was “evidence of a fully dysfunctional executive committee.”
The investigation was initiated on September 9 following multiple complaints by TRAC Vice President Daria Saryan, Bargaining Officer Isabelle Johnston, and Communications and Mobilization Officer Robert Sonin against President Nader Nodoushan.
According to Sonin, the initial complaint was prompted by difficulties facing the executive committee during the summer.
The investigation report, obtained by The Daily, detailed allegations against Nodoushan, including harassment, interfering with other executives’ work, and violating TRAC bylaws by failing to have a $3,000 expense approved by the executive committee.
Nodoushan also filed a number of counter-complaints of harassment, and one of racism, against other executives. However, most of these complaints were deemed unfounded by the report, except for a complaint that Sonin had an outstanding loan of $450 from TRAC, which the report described as somewhat “reasonable” given the context of alleged pay withholding by Nadoushan.
“There is nothing to be gained by publicly debating the investigation committee’s findings.”
According to Sonin, the report’s recommendations are overly harsh, given that the complaints against Nadoushan were the most founded in the report. “We made a complaint, the complaint was found to be valid, and we were fired,” Sonin told The Daily in an interview.
In an official response to the situation released on January 13, PSAC indicated that action beyond the removal of the TRAC executive would be taken in the future, and urged members to focus their energies on upcoming collective bargaining.
“There is nothing to be gained by publicly debating the investigation committee’s findings,” read the statement. “Its main conclusions will be released at an upcoming general assembly and local members in attendance will obtain all necessary clarifications.”
TRAC is a local section of PSAC, a larger union; as such, PSAC has the authority to bargain with employers, authorize strikes, and take control of a local section.
According to Jamie Burnett, a grievance officer at AGSEM: McGill’s Teaching Union, the local sections’ lack of autonomy can cause difficulties – a problem AGSEM does not face, as it belongs to the more decentralized Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), a Quebec union federation.
“This [non-autonomous] form of organization is common to most of the North American labour movement (including the non-CSN unions at McGill), especially outside of Quebec. The CSN is one of the few exceptions in that its ‘local unions’ are legally autonomous,” said Burnett in an email to The Daily. “The autonomy we have as a part of the CSN is extremely important to us.”
TRAC is not the only union that has struggled with its relationship with PSAC. SÉTUE, the student workers’ union at Université du Québec à Montréal, has also had problems.
“Members of SÉTUE experienced this [lack of autonomy] when, on dubious legal grounds, PSAC refused to allow the bargaining committee to respect the mandates from their General Assembly,” said Burnett.
“We made a complaint, the complaint was found to be valid, and we were fired.”
SÉTUE’s relationship with PSAC remains strained. According to Marie-Ève Tremblay-Cléroux, who was an elected member of SÉTUE’s union council from May 2013 to November 2014, SÉTUE attempted to disaffiliate from PSAC with a campaign that began last summer.
“We had many reasons, but the most important is the lack of self-government in the PSAC structure […] it’s possible for PSAC to bypass the local executive committee decisions anytime,” Tremblay-Cléroux told The Daily in an email.
According to Tremblay-Cléroux, three members of the SÉTUE executive were removed by PSAC during the campaign, although unlike TRAC, SÉTUE was not put under complete trusteeship.
SÉTUE’s campaign to disaffiliate was ultimately unsuccessful and ended last October. “It’s not because members didn’t want to quit PSAC. […] It’s [in] part because PSAC use[d] a lot of judicial procedures to stop the campaign,” said Tremblay-Cléroux, adding that the disaffiliation had seen substantial support at SÉTUE’s September general assembly.
While there does not appear to be mobilization within TRAC to leave PSAC, the final result of the investigation into its executive’s behaviour has yet to be determined. The investigation report will be presented to a TRAC general assembly on January 19, where they will vote to approve or deny the report’s recommendation that the executives be removed and a re-election be held.
Sonin is not sure whether he will seek re-election, or even whether he can. Although the report recommended that only Nodoushan be barred from running again, Sonin said that Nodoushan instructed Concordia Human Resources not to deduct union dues from the pay cheques of the executives, meaning that he is unlikely to meet the electoral qualification of being a “dues-paying member.”
“At any rate, PSAC’s performance does not inspire me with confidence,” wrote Sonin in an email to The Daily. “I’m not sure I want anything to do with PSAC.”

Council addresses fourth executive resignation this year, budget deficit
Correction appended January 26, 2015. 
Principal Suzanne Fortier and Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens made an appearance at the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Legislative Council meeting on January 14 to field students’ questions and discuss negotiations between AUS and the administration over their Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Councillors also formed a contingency plan to fulfill the newly-vacant VP Internal position’s responsibilities, and VP Finance Li Xue presented a review of the AUS budget.
The 2014-15 AUS budget includes an operating deficit of $12,703, which Xue attributed primarily to unforeseen Frosh week expenses. The AUS currently has over $265,000 in idle funds from the operating surpluses of previous years, which will be used to balance this year’s budget.
President Ava Liu argued that a lack of surplus is indicative of the organization better serving the needs of its constituents – a substantial surplus would indicate that, as a not-for-profit organization, AUS was overcharging students for its services.
Xue acknowledged that work can be done to reduce deficits while increasing the value of services. “We’re trying to streamline our internal processes,” she told The Daily. “We have an internal audit we’re conducting right now.”
With Fortier and Dyens present at Council, councillors took the opportunity to express their dissatisfaction with the current status and enforcement of the MOA – the document that outlines AUS’ legal relationship with the University – which is set to be renegotiated later this year. Councillors were particularly concerned with the newly-enforced ban on the sale of sandwiches and prepared foods at the student-run food outlet SNAX.
Dyens emphasized students’ responsibility to respect the existing MOA. “I think the University has shown flexibility in not coming down very quickly on students,” he said, while also noting a desire to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement when the MOA is renegotiated.
Concerned that the University views SNAX as a liability, a SNAX staffer told Council that they are working to get health and safety certification for employees, have undergone a health inspection, and are insured under AUS.
One councillor asked Fortier to reconcile the increasing support for divestment and her apparent commitment to engaging with the McGill community with the fact that McGill still has financial holdings in fossil fuels.
Fortier replied that she did not have personal authority over this type of decision, which must proceed through official channels, namely the Board of Governors’ Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR).
“[Many expect me] to impose, and to act in fact as a dictator, that is not the way we work,” she said.
Council once again grappled with the logistics of a vacant executive position, as VP Internal Roma Nadeem will not be at McGill this semester due to health problems.
While Council does have the authority to appoint a temporary replacement in accordance with the AUS constitution, it elected to leave the position vacant for the time being at the suggestion of President Ava Liu. Aspects of the VP Internal’s portfolio will be distributed among the remaining AUS executives, while the position’s crucial administrative responsibilities concerning room rentals and liquor permits will be taken over by a student employee.
Although this is the fourth resignation the AUS executive has seen this semester, VP Academic Erin Sobat emphasized that there is no need for emergency appointments.
“There is still someone in the position, they’re on leave, and we are filling the administrative requirements of that position through other means,” said Sobat.
On recommendation of the Constitutional and By-Law Review Committee, Council passed a set of changes to electoral bylaws for AUS and departmental associations. Council also voted to add an ad-hoc Event Planning and Implementation Committee (EPIC) seat to Council in order to “strengthen communication between councillors and members of EPIC,” according to the motion.
A previous version of this article stated that Liu would be appointing a new VP Internal in the future. In fact, the position’s requirements will continue to be filled by other AUS executives and an internal student administrator. Additionally, the article originally attributed the argument “a lack of surplus is indicative of the organization better serving the needs of its constituents […]” to Xue. In fact, this was said by Liu. The Daily regrets the errors.

Administration resists formalization of “core values”
At the last meeting between the floor fellow bargaining unit of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) and the administration, the floor fellows, unable to accept what the administration brought to the table, ended negotiations early.
Both parties are now preparing to resume negotiations, although it is not yet known when a collective agreement will be reached. The McGill floor fellows unionized under AMUSE and became an established bargaining unit last May, and negotiations between the administration and the unit began on October 31.
The floor fellow bargaining unit aims to attain greater autonomy and job security, and to ensure that the collective agreement reflects its core values. Although a full list of specific demands has not been released, AMUSE VP Floor Fellow Christina Clemente told The Daily that the bargaining team has drafted a set of core values that they believe are central to the floor fellows’ philosophy.
“We had a vision set for what we would not budge on, specifically the inclusion of our core values,” said Clemente. “Two in particular that we are really keen on fighting for is the anti-oppressive mandate and framework as well as the harm reduction approach.”
“Our main priorities are [to ensure] that floor fellows have a degree of power in residence decision-making processes, [increase] job and housing security of floor fellows, recognize and formalize the use of anti-oppression and harm reduction in our roles, protect our autonomy in our roles and our flexible work schedules, ensure [that] we do not come to hold disciplinary roles in residences, and ensure that we are remunerated in a way that complies with [the] Quebec labour code,” continued Clemente.
A key issue of contention with many floor fellows has been the implementation of three full-time Rez Life managers for McGill’s downtown residences this fall. Prior to this change, each of McGill’s nine residences had its own part-time live-in hall director.
“[…] We are really keen on fighting for is the anti-oppressive mandate and framework as well as the harm reduction approach.”
“We want to make sure that someone new in a position of power is not able to come in and completely change the system to, for example, what you see in the U.S. school system with ticketing for the use of [illegal] substances,” said Evan McIlroy, who is one of two elected bargaining representatives for the floor fellows.
When asked about the administration’s response to the demands, McIlroy remarked that “we’ve had a surprising amount of frustration in getting [the administration] to solidify past practices. I think we expected less resistance in terms of putting our values in the agreement.”
The parties are holding a discussion after each bargaining session. So far, three discussions have occurred, focusing on “the purpose of the agreement, union recognition, management rights and definitions,” according to McGill’s Director of Labour and Employee Relations Robert Comeau.
Comeau commented on the administration’s participation in the bargaining process in an interview with The Daily.
“The administration is striving for flexibility and agility in how the collective agreement will be managed, and in maintaining the same quality of service to students.” Addressing the roadblock in negotiations at the last meeting, Comeau remarked that the first collective agreement of a new bargaining unit usually results in a longer negotiation process.
According to Clemente, the timeline for the bargaining process is still developing. “We ideally wanted to be done by the end of this academic year,” she said. “That being said, it is still very early in the bargaining process. We still have a long way to go.”

BRIEF
The Midnight Kitchen (MK), the non-profit, volunteer- and worker-run collective dedicated to providing pay-what-you-can vegan food, is closed until further notice due to mandatory renovations.
Originally expected to reopen within two weeks of the start of the semester, MK remains shuttered because of a problem currently facing many buildings on campus: rodents.
Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP Clubs & Services Stefan Fong characterized the closure as a proactive measure meant to protect the kitchen against any possible pest invasions.
Though MK is, as of most recent reports from Fong, vermin-free, rodent activity has increased in the Shatner bulding, as the recently-completed construction on McTavish and cold weather have forced the rodents to seek alternative housing.
Mice have been reported as far up as the third floor. Fong said that SSMU is addressing this issue head-on because of the extent of last years’ mouse infestation, which affected the entire building. MK has been closed because, as a food service, it is at high risk for an infestation. At this time, no other food services have been closed.
In addition to the potential rodent contamination, MK’s operational permit is also due to expire on January 21, reported Fong. Before MK can reopen, collective members are required to attend a certification course given by Quebec’s Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, which will be offered before MK’s permit expires.
Ministry certification is a legal requirement for food service in Quebec, but it is something MK has trouble enforcing due to the high turnover of volunteers the collective sees each year.
While MK refused to comment on the issue, a message on the collective’s Facebook page indicated that the closure was “mostly out of the collective’s control.” The post also said that “SSMU is not permitting us to enter the kitchen or give out any food until these changes have been completed.”
This closure is not linked to the vandalism suffered by MK last semester, an issue which has, according to Fong, been resolved. However, the details behind the vandalism have not yet been disclosed publicly.
The kitchen will still be present in room 302 of SSMU on Mondays and Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. with free coffee and the occasional film.

Benefits insufficient to satisfy basic needs, advocates say
On January 1, the Quebec government increased social assistance payments by $6 per month, which corresponds to an indexation rate of 1.06 per cent.
In a press release sent to The Daily on January 1, the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec (FCPASQ) – an organization representing people who receive social assistance – denounced the low indexation rate as insufficient in comparison to increases in prices of consumer goods, which averaged 3.1 per cent for food and 1.6 per cent across all sectors over the past year. Hydro-Québec electricity prices, meanwhile, increased by 4.3 per cent last April.
“People on welfare are finding themselves in a more and more precarious situation, they are going deeper and deeper into poverty,” Cathy Inouye, community organizer at Project Genesis and FCPASQ spokesperson on the issue, told The Daily.
Intended as a form of “last-resort financial assistance,” the social assistance program dispenses $1.4 billion yearly to over 319,000 households, the basic monthly rate being $616 for an individual. When the program was first established in 1969, the monthly payment was $217, which would correspond to over $1,300 today when accounting for inflation, according to a document published by the FCPASQ.
Jean Lalande, coordinator at the Welfare Rights Committee of South-West Montreal, spoke to the insufficient amount of payment in an interview with The Daily.
“It would be very important to have a social program that ensures that those basic needs [such as food and housing] are covered, that the benefits are calculated to cover the basic cost of living,” said Lalande. “We thought it would become a priority [over the years] but it has not happened.”
Source: Ministère de l’Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale
Although beneficiaries with “severely limited capacity for employment” qualify for “social solidarity” payments, which amount to $937 monthly for a single individual, Inouye noted that about 60 per cent of people who receive the base rate of $616 are also unable to work.
“Welfare has a long history of punishing those who [the government feels] should be working, even though they know that there is a high unemployment rate, so a lot of people can’t find work,” said Inouye. “Poverty and health go hand in hand, so a lot of people – they might have depression, or anxiety, or even people who have major illnesses like cancer – these people might also be on the base rate even though their sickness is such that they are not able to work.”
Lalande echoed Inouye’s concerns, asserting that the welfare program has become “merit-based” over the years, since it takes into account the beneficiary’s ‘employability.’
“It makes [people on welfare] even less and less employable [when their needs are not being met],” said Lalande. “It becomes even harder to look for work.”
In its press release in French, the FCPASQ recommended that the government restore previously repealed fiscal measures to increase revenue and be able to “support the development of a more egalitarian society in which everyone can live in dignity.”
Inouye also suggested that the government lift undue restrictions on access to welfare, and allow beneficiaries to supplement their income without fear of having a potion of it deduced from their welfare cheque, as is current practice.
“It’s also about people’s inherent dignity, and their ability to make it to the end of the month and still have food in the fridge,” she said.

Winter General Assembly pushed to March
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council saw discussion on austerity and changes to tuition rates with Principal Suzanne Fortier at its first meeting of the Winter semester on January 14. Council also approved changes to bylaws regulating the SSMU Nominating Committee, and President Courtney Ayukawa announced the hiring of a new General Manager.
Ayukawa brought to Council a set of changes to bylaws regulating the Nominating Committee, which oversees the hiring of Elections SSMU staff and Judicial Board justices. The changes were originally intended to be part of a bigger set of changes to presidential portfolio regulations, the drafting of which has not yet been completed.
The motion will change the structure of the nominating committee to consist of four councillors and four members-at-large, compared to the previous composition, which had six executives and three councillors. It will also be chaired by the General Manager, a permanent, non-student position, instead of the President.
VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan said that the changes were meant to increase the objectivity of the committee. “We were looking to shift away from this extremely executive-heavy nominating committee, since these positions are supposed to be very distanced from SSMU, given that they [involve] elections and Judicial Board justices.”
Ayukawa announced in her report that the Winter 2015 General Assembly (GA) will be held in March, the week following reading week, as opposed to the originally scheduled date of February 11.
This, she said, is intended to put the GA during the SSMU Winter referendum and election campaign period – which runs from March 9 to 20 – when students are more passionate about SSMU, and to allow more time for SSMU to find a space to accommodate a large turnout of students.
“I have heard that there is likely going to be another very controversial motion coming to the GA,” said Ayukawa. A Palestine solidarity motion was responsible for most of the turnout to the Fall 2014 GA, which saw 800 students attending.
The date for the Winter GA will be announced at the next Council meeting.
Ayukawa also informed Council that a new General Manager has been hired and will begin work in February.
VP Clubs & Services Stefan Fong notified councillors that the SSMU building, along with other buildings on campus, is facing a mouse outbreak, noting that it was “not surprising” due to the amount of construction that has been taking place outside the SSMU building and throughout campus.
Fielding questions from councillors, Fortier reiterated her position that she does not oppose the government’s austerity measures. She said that she is in favour of capping the ‘clawback’ of international student tuition by the government in times such as these, when government contribution to the university is lower.
One councillor voiced concerns that with the proposed deregulation of out-of-province and international tuition, McGill might become a university for the financial elite, to which Fortier responded that the administration will do its best to keep McGill a university where admission is based solely on academic achievement.
Citing the high success rates of the Arts Internship Program, Fortier said that she is making the funding of student internship opportunities a priority, and that certain donors may create endowed funds to support these opportunities for students.
A common concern with some at SSMU has been with the legitimacy of McGill’s supposed dedication to community engagement. In response, Fortier listed instances of community learning in curriculums and student-led initiatives as examples of this dedication manifesting in real life, adding that that her main concern is being able to better communicate these initiatives to local community leaders.

Legal dispute over membership dues to continue into 2017
Updated January 19, 2015 with comments from the PGSS External Affairs Officer.
Members of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) voted to leave the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) on January 16 after a disaffiliation referendum five years in the making.
Over 2,000 graduate students cast ballots, more than doubling the 10 per cent turnout required for quorum, with 2014 students voting “no” to continued membership and 56 voting “yes.” The vote must now be ratified at a general meeting of CFS member unions, as mandated by CFS bylaws, after which PGSS will be officially decertified from CFS starting June 30.
“We understand that our members have a lot of work on their plate and often don’t have a lot of time to devote to student politics. We were therefore extremely happy to see that they genuinely cared,” wrote PGSS External Affairs Officer Julien Ouellet in an email to The Daily.
In 2010, PGSS held a disaffiliation referendum, in which 86 per cent of members voted “no”; however, CFS did not recognize the results of the referendum. This prompted PGSS to sue CFS, asking that the federation acknowledge the validity of the referendum. 
This year’s referendum was ordered by the Quebec Superior Court last September after PGSS Internal Affairs Officer Gesa successfully sued CFS for the right to hold a disaffiliation referendum. Gesa filed his case after CFS failed to acknowledge a petition, submitted earlier in 2014 with over 20 per cent of PGSS member signatures, requesting that CFS permit PGSS to hold a disaffiliation referendum. 
According to CFS bylaws, PGSS had to pay all its outstanding membership dues to hold the referendum, which amount to over $300,000 since 2010. Thus, despite the result of the vote, the case over the 2010 vote is still ongoing, as PGSS seeks to recover the fees for the period since the last referendum.
Jonathan Mooney, chair of the “no” committee and former PGSS Secretary-General, told The Daily in an email, “Now the case about the 2010 vote is mainly just about the question of these dues.” 
A court hearing is expected for 2017.
Asked about potential alternatives to CFS for representation at the national level, Ouellet said, “It might be worthwhile to create a formal research [study] on the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations to weigh the pros and cons of affiliating with them.”
In an email to The Daily, CFS National Chairperson Jessica McCormick commented on the results. “The Federation respects the right of individual members to vote on the question of continued membership through the democratic processes set out in the Bylaws. The outcome of the vote will be put before the voting member local students’ unions at the next national general meeting pursuant to the Bylaws.”
