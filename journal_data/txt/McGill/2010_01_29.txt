Thursday night Council sessions are like an excerpt from Jean-Paul Sartre’s No Exit: a bunch of people eating Tiki-Ming and talking at each other for what feels like eternity.
Most of the discussion seems to revolve around procedure and housekeeping motions, and the occasional “contentious issue” is either introduced by a member of the executive or one of two councillors. If by chance any action is taken in Council, it is usually added to a long list of SSMU directives and quickly forgotten about.
This year’s procedural rules also seem to have deterred casual observers: the format is boring and indiscernible to anyone who’s not a seasoned gallery member.
While the SSMU executive often bears the brunt of The Daily’s criticisms, it’s really Council that has failed this year. At the fall General Assembly, many councillors were late or absent. They also drafted few motions, and took little initiative to advertise the event.
Besides introducing new ideas at Council or actually showing up for their jobs, councillors might find their work less futile if SSMU amended its bylaws so policies were implemented in a more effective manner.
For starters, they might want to drop by Thomson House.
While PGSS isn’t perfect, they have a much more coherent approach to matters of policy, as Neilson and Olle have both pointed out. PGSS adopts very few official positions after a rigorous review, but they are on the books for five years. Council motions expire each year, presumably to accommodate political fluctuations that come with a new year of councillors.
Adopting the PGSS approach might make Council politics more coherent to students, and encourage outsiders to get more involved if they see that their contributions will actually mean something.

President
Turn ons:
Along with the president’s usual task of jumping from meeting to meeting, and keeping up to date on McGill and SSMU policy, Ivan Neilson has taken on a few pet projects to help support student initiatives. In the past year, he has taken it upon himself to see through many of SSMU’s green efforts, from helping to organize the Plate Club and Farmers’ Market, to bolstering student demands for funding to support eco-friendly research projects. He has also taken an active interest in promoting McGill athletics.
Turn offs:
Although Neilson is well-informed on SSMU issues, his knowledge doesn’t always come through at Council meetings. Neilson says he likes to work in the background on things, helping his fellow VPs with their individual portfolios ­– but since that generally happens behind closed doors, it’s sometimes hard to tell exactly what he’s been doing.
Desperately seeking:
This year the executive has focussed on making SSMU more “user friendly.” Call us populists, but one way to do that might be to have a president who’s just a little louder and more visible as a leader. Neilson’s demure presence in Council means that he’s been outshone a few times this year by Olle, Dooley, and Arts Senator Sarah Woolf. He could work on garnering more popular support by taking stances on issues like tuition or federal and provincial post-secondary funding. A second project we hope Neilson follows through on is to revise SSMU Council’s bylaws, so that the policies remain in the institutional memory.

Sarah Olle set out at the beginning of the year to make SSMU more accessible to students, and she has made progress. Room and table bookings are now online, and both fall and winter term activities nights were a success. Olle has started slogging through the difficulties resulting from the McGill Tribune’s move to go independent. Olle has also created a vision for the Shatner building, setting priorities for space and looking at how an increase in student-run tenants could be made possible. With long-term planning in mind, Olle  commissioned a researcher to review the past 30 years of SSMU history to understand its progress, and direction in the future.
Turn offs:
Initially voting in favour of Choose Life’s club status last year – citing free speech – Olle showed backbone last term when she moved to censure Choose Life after the club violated its agreement with SSMU regarding the display of graphic images. Though Olle’s willingness to uphold SSMU policies is commendable, she must work closely with clubs to create an understanding  and improve communication.
Desperately seeking:
We would like to see Olle follow through on her second semester plans, and continue to be effective at working closely with clubs on problems.
While we criticized Olle for not having “big dreams” in our fall review, she has followed through on her promises to cut red tape and make SSMU more accessible. Now that we have seen her administrative and political skills, it would be interesting to see what she could do with some more ambitious goals. On her agenda are possible negotiations with McGill about lowering the rent for the Shatner building.

VP University Affairs
Turn ons:
Rebecca Dooley was instrumental in creating the Sustainable Projects Fund, which passed in referendum by a wide margin. She kept up demands for student interests at the Senate, lobbying hard for greater transparency when McGill’s research policy came up for discussion. She has also worked hard to get a task force going that will increase institutional cooperation between SSMU and faculty associations, seeking to represent their interests as well. Dooley joked in September that she was “VP H1N1,” and that flu planning has taken up a lot of her time. She succeeded in lobbying for greater illness-related flexibility – an effort that led to the famous “red button” option for students, and more trust in dealings between students and the University.
Turn offs:
The way Dooley handled revisions to the University’s sexual harassment policy, bringing together SACOMSS and the Senate, should be a model for future endeavours. As a leader she should look for more University policies to get students excited about, like intellectual property or French on campus.
Desperately seeking:
While Dooley insists that she is constantly pushing for student interests at committee levels, and has tried to construct some institutional apparatus for listening to student initiatives and concerns, she could do more to lead the way. Dooley insists that she will only press for things that the student body has asked her to, but at the same time she needs to acknowledge her role as a student leader. Dooley has also been hamstrung by the difficulty of finding interested students to fill committee positions.

Jose Diaz has done a lot this year to improve Gerts, from buying new pool tables to improving          its music selection. Last Thursday’s concert in Gerts, co-hosted with CKUT, sold more drinks than any other event this year. Diaz’s efforts are starting to show in the bar’s financial ledgers. Gerts will run a deficit this year, but it’s still about $10,000 better off than it was last year.  In the financial sphere, SSMU outperformed its budget this term. From this, Diaz was able to allocate $50,000 toward a new SSMU department to organize conferences, concerts, and speakers. Diaz has also taken steps to create more financial transparency, posting financial statements from 1992 and onward online, along with SSMU’s budget.
Turn offs:
The recent revelation that SSMU invested in companies inolved in the tar sands, as well as natural resource exploration, raised a few eyebrows. On the one hand, we’re happy that Diaz called attention to investment in a project that poisons water, displaces populations, and isolates workers from their families, among other things. On the other hand, we wonder why he didn’t wave the red flag sooner. We’re also concerned that SSMU may overlook the equally damaging side effects of other kinds of natural resource exploration. Haven Books, which is set to lose $65,000, may represent Diaz’s most pressing challenge.
Desperately seeking:
Diaz has beaten us to the punch on recommendations. He’s taken steps to start working on a concrete investment policy this term with SSMU’s Financial Ethics Research Committee. We hope, though, that it extends beyond the tar sands to mining, natural resources, and exploration in general. Diaz is also trying to turn around Haven Books with a project to review the store’s options, with proposals from students, Haven employees, and SSMU councillors alike.

The SSMU executive has been mostly successful in their initiatives, and they have achieved significant administrative victories. However, many executives continue to bring up the spectre of “student apathy,” which has led to their committees being understaffed and their events (at times) under-attended. SSMU’s logistical and institution-building plans have built a significant platform for student action, but perhaps it will take something more to actually get students involved. Our critique of the executive at the beginning of the year, and now, points to their lack of political vision. Since SSMU has proven itself to be capable of managing their sometimes-modest plans, perhaps it’s time the executive considered what they could achieve by choosing issues to support on campus and taking a lead on them. It seems like what campus politics needs is some energy – but there is, of course, the problem of choosing the issue. The largely failed “Reclaim your Campus” campaign last year might have have laked form and direction, so any new action should try to remedy both these failings. With new institutional structures and connections to different campus bodies established this year, SSMU should choose an issue requiring action, and with their administrative skill, mobilize support and organize more effective events. Along with this sense of student apathy comes an institutional apathy – not enough advisers, a cold University bureaucracy, fragmented student body, privatization of tuition and food services, and, to top it off, an evasive administration. SSMU exec should make it their job to rally a halfhearted Council and student body beyond chipping away at some part of this edifice.

Alex Brown’s greatest legacy to SSMU may be replacing the annual financial hemorrhage that was Snow-AP with the Gerts-based Week 101 in January. She has also kept up crowd-pleasers like 4-Floors, while piloting non-alcoholic events like film screenings.  Brown promised Council that a big name recording artist will perform at McGill in the spring, though she has yet to reveal who it’s going to be. Brown also took a more efficient approach to SSMU web site upgrades, opting to introduce them as they become available rather than all at once. SSMU’s web site became fully bilingual this fall, and online room bookings were made easier.
Turn offs:
Brown’s greatest challenges are for the most part institutional, like student apathy toward the General Assembly. Frosh could also use some revision, to address the alienation felt by students who don’t like to drink en masse. SSMU events tend to attract a certain crowd, drawing a high percentage of first-years. Nevertheless, Brown still has to find a way to make these events relevant to more of the McGill population. Brown has been collaborating closely with Diaz to diversify SSMU’s social calendar, but we can only hope she keeps up the momentum.
Desperately seeking:
Brown has her work cut out for her in attracting students to February’s GA – though her initial advertising is an improvement from last term. For inspiration, Brown could take a line from the PGSS social calendar, especially for non-alcoholic events. Post-graduates have a green-themed month of events, as well as a love/sex-themed week in February, which includes everything from S&M or sex toy parties to speed dating. Brown doesn’t have to start ordering complimentary dildos en masse, but she could try drawing on the diverse interests around campus.

Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan’s big project this year is working on TaCEQ, a new coalition formed by SSMU and four other student unions, into a student lobby group. Despite the remaining administrative kinks, TaCEQ cut its teeth in protest against  two provincial university governance bills. While Ronderos-Morgan says it has been difficult to deal with all the jargon and big personalities that make up the Quebec student movement, his efforts have managed to create an institution that will give SSMU some clout on post-secondary education issues in the province. Ronderos-Morgan has also been working alongside Hélène Brisson of the Milton-Parc Citizens Committee, to create a group that will periodically bring together SSMU, McGill, and the Citizens Committee.
Turn offs:
Ronderos-Morgan has focused primarily on institution-building; his initiatives haven’t been that popular. He needs to work harder to make it apparent to all students why TaCEQ is relevant and why McGill needs to be involved in provincial lobbying. SSMU’s mobilization efforts have also been mixed. SSMU bussed students to climate change rallies in Ottawa, but failed to attract more than a few students to a Montreal rally against university governance bills.
Desperately seeking:
Ronderos-Morgan has a lot of big picture ideas for SSMU institutions, but he needs to think more about how to fight student apathy on a day to day basis: from Facebook groups to small DIY projects. He could also learn a thing or two from student groups, like QPIRG or GRASPé who specialize in grassroots issues.
