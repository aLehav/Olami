Councillors lay out vision for education summit
At last night’s October meeting of the Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Council, Provost Anthony Masi said that until McGill gets a written directive from the government, it will not refund the already charged higher tuition rates.
“A verbal agreement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” Masi said.
Université du Québec à Montréal is in the same boat as McGill, having already charged their students the increased rates, while Université de Montréal and Université Laval had been waiting for government directive to charge their students fall tuition.
Masi said that several issues surrounding the tuition freeze are still unclear, including whether universities can start indexing their tuition to inflation this year or next.
McGill’s plan to raise tuition was thrown into confusion last spring, Masi said, after Premier Jean Charest’s Liberal government changed its plans for the hike amidst student protests. There has been no communication between McGill’s senior administration and the new Parti Québécois government, according to Masi.
Other PGSS council business concerned ongoing communication with the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), the provincial lobbying organization of which PGSS is a member.
Councillors also discussed their vision for the upcoming Quebec Education Summit. The summit, organized by the new Parti Quebecois government and expected within 100 days of the September 4 election, is billed as a consultative forum to address issues like university governance, funding, and tuition.
FEUQ plans to ask the government to create a “presidential committee” of four members: a student, a faculty member, an administration representative, and a government representative.
PGSS Council voted yesterday to ask FEUQ to add a fifth member – a graduate student – to the hypothetical committee, as well as to ask FEUQ to ensure that the meetings of the committee be public and accessible.
Council also voted unanimously to endorse Social Work student Leah Freeman for Vice President of FEUQ’s National Council of Graduate Studies. Freeman would become one of only a few anglophone members of FEUQ’s executive committee.

McGill’s involvement with war industry discussed
About fifty people gathered yesterday at the Y-intersection on campus for a “teach-in” on the possibility of war with Iran and McGill University’s involvement with the war industry in general.
Canada closed its embassy in Iran on September 7, declaring all Iranian diplomats persona non grata in the country. This decision had a ripple effect across the international community, including at McGill, where many Iranian students now face difficulties obtaining study permits and vital travel documents.
McGill Law student and teach-in organizer Kevin Paul explained that the teach-in was designed as a precursor to resistance to the current sanctions in Iran, as well as to the possibility of military intervention in the future.
“Iranian civilians and Iranians living in Canada are living the impacts of severe economic sanctions, and that includes students right here at McGill, so there’s already conflict with Iran, it just isn’t taking the form of military intervention yet,” Paul told The Daily.
The teach-in included four presentations, followed by an open-megaphone period where people were free to share their opinions on militarization and Iran. The formal presentations relied heavily on the parallels between the build-up to the war in Iraq and the current Iranian conflict.
Among the few people who took the megaphone to share their thoughts was a Montreal activist who goes by the name Smoke. He emphasized the importance of looking at foreign military intervention in the context of the larger geopolitical system.
“I want to end with a reminder that we don’t like the Iranian regime either, but it’s not up to us to overthrow it,” said Smoke.
U2 McGill student Claire Stewart-Kanigan also helped to organize the teach-in. She argued that the McGill community is necessarily implicated in conflicts like the one with Iran, because of McGill’s contributions to the defense industry and its reliance on the military-industrial complex for funding.
“If we have anti-war support coming out of McGill, even if it is just in the form of editorials or departmental associations or student associations passing motions against the war, I think that that can speak especially strongly,” Stewart-Kanigan told The Daily. “McGill does have a strong role to play in Canada’s defense apparatus, so as students of McGill, we have the opportunity to create disruption.”
The University has a long history of involvement with weapons research. In 2010, McGill opted against regulating such research, leaving out a clause in its Regulations on Conduct of Research policy that would require researchers to disclose the potentially harmful applications of their findings.
The organizers hoped that the teach-in would revive a dialogue around anti-war protest, specifically in relation to Iran.
“One of our goals is that, if it does come to the point of military intervention, we want to have a wide base of consciousness about this issue set up so that we can take action against it quickly,” explained Stewart-Kanigan. “Having the base set for some kind of action, like a strike or demos in opposition.”
Prashant Keshavmurthy,  a professor in the Institute of Islamic Studies, stopped by to listen to the presentation on McGill’s involvement in military research.
Keshavmurthy said he pays attention to foreign affairs, particularly in relation to Iran, but found the teach-in valuable and informative nonetheless.
“What I specifically learned that was new to me and improved my awareness of what was going on were the facts on weapons research [at McGill].”

SNAX to start paying rent
Correction appended October 10, 2012.
The Philosophy Students’ Association (PSA) recently announced its intention to become an accredited student association to represent philosophy students at McGill, a move that would make PSA independent from its parent association, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS).
Early in the semester, AUS’ auditors advised the Association to provide the University with full audits of its finances as per their Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). Following this recommendation, AUS sought to change its financial structure by re-internalizing faculty associations with external bank accounts.
Four of the biggest associations – the Economics Students’ Association (ESA), the Department of English Student Association (DESA), the PSA, and the Political Science Students’ Association (PSSA) – raised concerns about the effects of internalization on their autonomy.
Following discussions about internalizing, the PSA instead contemplated completely externalizing, or becoming a separately accredited association.
According to PSA President Jonathan Wald, the Association is looking to incorporate – to change its financial structure and form its own bank account – this semester, and to accreditate – become the official representative for philosophy students – next semester.
In order to accreditate, a student association must first incorporate under Part II of the Quebec Companies Act (chapter 28), which means that the provincial government must approve the formation of a new bank account.
“At that point I hope to see our relation as analogous to that of the AUS and SSMU. Philosophy students will still be members of the Faculty of Arts; we will just have a stronger, more autonomous sub-representative group,” explained Wald.
The Accreditation Act also requires the PSA to obtain a majority of votes cast in a ballot poll, provided that this majority comprises at least 25 per cent of students registered in the program.
Being an independent accredited student association also means that in addition to having an independent bank account, PSA would be able to determine its own student fees.
“We would set in our voting process a student fee to be collected by McGill and then distributed to the PSA,” said Wald. “It’s the same law that applies to SSMU and AUS. So we would choose some fee, and when we were doing the calculations even if we chose a very low fee we would still be getting more money than what we’re getting right now from the AUS.”
According to an email from Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson to the AUS, allowing the departmental associations to incorporate is neither an option nor a solution to the problem that the AUS has in respect of its obligation to provide financial accountability in the form of annual audited financial statements under the MoA.
AUS VP Finance Saad Qazi told The Daily that he “doesn’t completely agree” with Mendelson’s letter, but that it would also depend on what fee payment structure the PSA decides to follow.
He also mentioned that the four student associations in question agreed to use QuickBooks, the AUS’ financial software, which will allow associations to retain their autonomous bank accounts while the AUS keeps track of their finances.
PSSA President Talitha Calder explained that although the PSSA considered separating at one point, it has ruled out the option now that internalizing bank accounts is not happening.
“We are now going to use the AUS’ online accounting system… this will allow us to keep better track records of our expenses throughout the year without having to give up our bank account,” said Calder.
According to Qazi, DESA and ESA also do not intend to secede from the AUS, although the ESA is looking to increase its revenues by receiving fees from both the AUS and the Management Undergraduate Society.
AUS SNAX
AUS has been in talks with SNAX, the food and beverage counter run out of the Leacock building lobby, about SNAX being responsible for the $3,783 yearly rent the University charges AUS for the space.
SNAX manager Marlene Benavides says that the snack bar is making a concerted effort to meet new ethical and environmental goals – eliminating water bottles, composting, providing more fair trade items – and that the nearly $4,000 loss could make achieving these goals much more difficult.
“This also defines the relationship between AUS and SNAX in a way that I wouldn’t have […] $4,000 is a lot less to the AUS than it is to SNAX,” Benavides added.
Qazi, however, said that the snack bar made a $30,000 profit before taxes last year and that it “can definitely afford to pay rent.”

An earlier version of this article stated that AUS has always covered the rent payed to the University for the space occupied by SNAX.

Pro-life activists maintain constant presence in park
Pro-choice and pro-life advocacy groups held demonstrations side-by-side at Parc Lahaie on Saturday. A footpath serving as a police-designated dividing line separated the two groups. Pro Choix Montreal, a pro-choice group, held a hot pink banner and placards, responding with cheers to the honks of passing traffic. On the other side of the footpath was Quebec Life Coalition, a pro-life group, who held prayer books as they stood in vigil.
The Quebec Life Coalition is currently participating in the now-international “40 Days for Life” campaign, a semiannual movement in which pro-life activists in over 200 cities worldwide fast and keep vigil outside local abortion clinics and hospitals.
In some locations, the vigils last 24 hours a day throughout the forty-day period.  Campagne Québec-Vie occupies its post outside the Montreal Morgentaler Clinic from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day.
Brian Jenkins, a worker at Quebec Life Coalition, said he ensures a constant volunteer presence throughout these hours despite the small pool of volunteers he has to work with.
There are 13 regular volunteers.
He said he sees himself and his fellow vigil-keepers as “representing the children, because no one’s speaking up for them. They’re being burned, dismembered, and chemically aborted…we are here to pray, and to try to bring it back around.”
This Saturday was Quebec Life Coalition’s eighth vigil of the campaign. All of their vigils have been challenged – hence the police-designated dividing line – but Pro Choix Montreal was not among the challenging demonstrators until 2010.
Pro Choix Montreal did not formalize its efforts until 2011 and still operates on a largely casual basis.
According to Pro Choix Montreal activists present on Saturday, a small core of foundational members coordinates the group’s demonstrations. However, it lacks a formal organizational structure and encourages members to initiate their own demonstrations and events via a Facebook group, which currently boasts over 1,200 members.
Unlike Quebec Life Coalition, Pro Choix Montreal has not maintained a constant presence during the forty-day movement, but supporters come to represent the cause during the hours they are available.
Members of Pro Choix told The Daily that they had aimed to be there every day of the campaign in 2011, but no longer aim for this level of constancy.
“We just want to be a visible presence here too, to show that there`s another side,” a demonstrator said.
In spite of the ideological differences between the groups, each group has a strict code of conduct for their demonstrators to ensure a positive atmosphere.
Quebec Life Coalition said they encourage non-confrontation and seeking common ground, while Pro Choix Montreal emphasizes inclusivity through the use of non-hateful, non-discriminatory language, particularly based on religion or sexuality.
In the upcoming weeks, Pro Choix Montreal will be holding bi-weekly picnics with food and live music. Quebec Life Coalition will maintain its constant presence in the park.

Judicial Board to make a final decision within 15 days of hearing
The SSMU Judicial Board (J-Board) heard the case of Bangs v. Calver and Cheng last Tuesday. Failing to appear at the hearing were the two respondents to the case, former AUS President Jade Calver and former Elections AUS Chief Returning Officer Victor Cheng.
The case, which contests the legitimacy of two questions passed during the Arts Undergraduate Society’s (AUS) 2012 Winter Referenda, was filed in April 2012 by Christopher Bangs, the chair for the No Committee of the two contested questions.
J-Board Chief Justice Joel Kwan announced 15 minutes into the hearing – which had been rescheduled multiple times earlier that day and finally set for 5:30 p.m. – that the respondents would not be attending.
He explained that although “today was a good moment” for the hearing to proceed, Calver and Cheng had made it clear that they would not appear and did not wish to continue with the case.
Kwan then explained that it would be up to Bangs as to whether or not he wished to proceed with the trial or resort to a “default judgment.”
According to Kwan, a default judgment would still require Bangs to present his arguments and provide a burden of proof for his case. Bangs immediately accepted to proceed, and over the next hour his arguments were presented to Kwan and J-Board members Charif El-Khouri and Rachel Tonelli-Zasarsky.
In his opening statement, Bangs told the J-Board, “I think as this hearing unfolds it will be very clear that many repeated violations occurred. I hope I can prove to you that these violations affected the results [of the election]… These violations are serious, they are repeated, and they are uncorrected.”
Bangs argued that no vote count was ever taken at Council, that Council ratified the questions in English only, and that no announcement was ever posted in a student publication, all of which, he alleged, violate AUS Bylaws.
He also said that the AUS’ failure to publicize the times and locations of polls, as well as their failure to distribute the amended version of the motions – which included restrictions of the campaign period by four days – could have affected both voter turnout and the way that people voted.
In the Petitioner’s Declaration submitted by Bangs on April 17, it was stated that “repeated and systematic violations of the AUS Bylaws by Elections AUS compromise the integrity of the elections, and asks that the Judicial Board of the Students’ Society of McGill University find the conduct of the Respondents violated the Bylaws of the AUS and declare null and void the referendum questions…”
In the respondent’s position, submitted on May 6, it is stated, “the validity of the 2012 AUS Winter Referendum Period is justified. Proper procedures were followed; questions were properly submitted through Legislative Council. Further, Elections feels as though the Referendum Period was properly announced in a way that did not compromise the integrity of the vote, evidenced by the high voter turnout in the referendum period.”
The respondents further alleged, “the petitioner is ultimately biased in his presentation of this case, given previous communications with the respondents during AUS Elections in his position as Chair of the ‘No Committees.’”
Tuesdays’s hearing had been delayed a number of times – over the summer because a full J-Board could not be maintained, and more recently because of complications involving intervener hiring.
The J-Board reserves 15 days from the hearing date to make a final judgment on the case.

Additional recruits and meal plan considered
McGill Student Emergency Response Team (M-SERT), formerly McGill First Aid, will initiate a referendum to increase its fee from $0.25 to $0.75 per semester for downtown campus’s full- and part-time students.
As discussed during last Thursday’s SSMU Legislative Council meeting, the motion seeks to increase the “Safety Network” fee in order to offset the service’s current costs and expand its coverage.
M-SERT is a student-run volunteer first-response service that provides emergency first aid to McGill’s downtown campus, residences, and the Montreal community. Registered under SSMU, M-SERT operates from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. with on-shift teams in the Molson and La Citadelle residences.
Regarding M-SERT’s fee affiliation with the Safety Network, SSMU VP Clubs and Services Allison Cooper explained that “McGill wants to limit the number of individual fees listed on students’ Minerva bills and as [the] M-SERT fee is already administered internally through SSMU… we made it an increase to the SSMU base fee instead.”
M-SERT is composed of 55 volunteers, including eight certified Red Cross instructors who offer first aid courses to the university community.
Currently, 60 per cent of M-SERT’s revenue is independently generated from first aid courses taught by the service’s Red Cross certified members throughout the academic year. M-SERT has received funding from other McGill entities in the past, but it has never received any funding directly from the University.
While M-SERT is able to provide operational first aid care to the university community, necessary expansions to M-SERT services have stretched the organization’s budget thin.
In an e-mail interview with The Daily, M-SERT President Ahan Ali and SSMU VP Finance Patrick Tohill wrote, “Our regular shifts have expanded from four upper residences and intramural hockey, to all of the Downtown Campus residences (except MORE houses), intramural hockey, and a steadily growing number of special events. Such expansion of our service requires us to stock more first aid supplies, replace more equipment, and eventually train more members which places a financial strain on our service.”
With any additional revenue, Ali and Tohill hope to reduce the financial burden of being an M-SERT volunteer. The organization currently subsidizes a large portion of the fees involved in the training of  new recruits, but would like to explore expanding recruitment numbers, and be able to further subsidize the necessary training its members receive.
They added that, “for many of our members, [our hours of operation] mean going directly from class to their 12-hour overnight shift. We have proposed introducing a modest meal plan for responders on shift,” they said.
SSMU’s Notice of Motion from the September 27 Legislative Council meeting notes that “a vote in the negative will result in M-SERT continuing its operations at the current level of funding, with no change to the current SSMU base fee.”
M-SERT’s referendum date has not yet been set.

Over 150 McGill students gathered in the Leacock auditorium on Saturday for a full day of workshops hosted by the National Geographic Young Explorers Grants Program. The workshops featured National Geographic explorers and past grant recipients, who provided students with tips on how to develop project ideas and write effective grant proposals.
The workshops were also part of an effort by National Geographic to encourage environmental conservation efforts among young people. The Young Explorers Grants give aspiring scientists and researchers between the ages of 18 and 25 a chance to conduct their own field research in topics ranging from archaeology to photojournalism to evolutionary biology.
Four McGill students have been awarded these prestigious grants in the past.
Masters Biology student Andrea Reid was awarded a Young Explorers Grant in 2011. The grant funded a three-month project in Uganda to research the effect of the Nile perch – a large introduced alien predator – on the native fish population of the Lake Victoria Basin.
At the workshop, Reid spoke about her experiences and gave advice to students looking to obtain a grant of their own.
“Apply for everything, and be really specific,” she said. “Don’t just say ‘I want to save the whales.’ What kind of whales? Where? How? You have to know what you’re after.”
The workshop was followed by a presentation by renowned alpinist Conrad Anker – who spoke about his most recent expedition to Everest – as well as Kenny Broad, National Geographic’s 2011 Explorer of the Year, who shared highlights of his world–famous diving expeditions to the Bahamas’ Blue Holes, the deepest underwater caves in the world.
