Plans to create a student-run cafe in the Shatner Building continue to develop as SSMU leadership considers different scenarios and the possibility of an extended time frame.
Brought forward last year, the project’s time frame has expanded significantly, and VP Finance and Operations Jean-Paul Briggs told The Daily that he does not believe the cafe will open at the beginning of the next academic semester as originally planned.
According to Briggs, “a fully functional and highly operational cafe…won’t be feasible for the start of next year. But we are still in the process of trying to make it happen.”
SSMU is currently carrying out a study to assess the feasibility of a student-run cafe. The project was allocated $200,000 last year and will
According to SSMU President Josh Redel, the undergoing lease negotiations with the University regarding the Shatner Building have affected the project.
“The lease negotiations have a huge impact on how much we get to spend on the cafe now and in the years,” Redel told The Daily. “Right now, the way negotiations are going, we are just so uncertain, it’s too up in the air.”
According to Briggs, students involved in the feasibility committee are looking at what “niches” in the University marketplace are available to the student-run café.
“The core tenants of a student- run, for-student enterprise is that it has to be accessible financially, socially, and every other way,” said Briggs.

Students file formal complaint for violation of Quebec law
McGill students Christopher Bangs and Mona Luxion released a statement on Tuesday claiming that the McGill administration had refused to disclose information related to military research on campus and the University’s ties to fossil fuel companies.
Bangs and Luxion also allege that the University is violating its responsibilities under the Quebec Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information.
According to the statement, several McGill students submitted access to information (ATI) requests five weeks ago regarding military research conducted by the Shock Wave Physics Group (SWPG) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
“Public records show that over the past decade, the SWPG has regularly engaged in explosives research with the support of Canada’s Department of National Defense,” the statement read. “This includes research on fuel-air explosives (thermobaric weapons) that has been used by the US Air Force.”
Students also requested information about the University’s ties to fossil fuel companies and Plan Nord, the provincial government’s controversial plan for the development of the natural resources extraction sector in the northern Quebec. The statement claimed that the purpose of these requests was to “better understand the links between the University and the corporations involved in these destructive projects,” claiming that at least 11 out of the 25 members of the Board of Governors profits from fossil fuels, and at least five are implicated in Plan Nord.
The University had an initial twenty-day period to provide the information requested under the Act, after which the University invoked an allowed additional delay of ten days. After the thirty days, the University demanded an extra three weeks to respond and denied parts of the requests.
In an email to The Daily, Bangs – the creator of McGilliLeaked, a website that publishes ATIs received from the University – explained that the University said they had to collect hard copies of the documents, which required more time. Regarding the parts of the requests that were denied altogether, Bangs said that they refused all requests for architectural plans of buildings.
Vice-Principal (External Relations) Olivier Marcil claimed that the University had not refused to provide the documents, but has been unable to do so within the time frame provided, citing the sheer volume of requests received by the University.
The Secretary-General’s office has received at least 26 requests containing 57 separate demands since the end of August and at least 155 requests since January, many of which are “broad in scope,” according to Marcil.
“For example, McGill has been asked to provide all documents related to all construction projects over the last five years. For the current year alone, that would be approximately 260 active projects – each involving thousands of documents,” Marcil wrote in an email to The Daily. “A conservative estimate puts the total number of documents at well over 100,000 pages. Each document needs to be read, redacted as required (under law governing access requests), and prepared for delivery. All within thirty days.”
Marcil also said that the Secretary-General’s office currently devotes two full-time staff members to meet ATI demands, claiming that the total hours applied to these requests including other branches of the University “amounts to at least five people.”
The students who requested the ATIs in question have filed a formal complaint with the Commission d’accès à l’information, which will initiate a review process.
“We have requested that our cases be taken forward collectively, as we believe this is a systemic failure to adhere to the law,” wrote Bangs. “At least six people have faced extra-legal delays in the processing of their requests in the last month and a half, and many others have faced similar delays in the past.”
According to Bangs, the review process involves going before a judge at the Commission and could take up to a year and a half.
Marcil claimed that the number of requests received places a burden on all affected University departments and requires the diversion of the University’s limited resources.
“If it is called before the Commission, McGill will be prepared to make this very clear,” he wrote.
Luxion and Bangs agreed that McGill’s behavior is not surprising.
“It’s not actually surprising that this administration is going to major, even illegal, lengths to avoid making public the extent of its involvement in research that ultimately enables armies to kill with greater efficiency,” said Luxion – a PhD student who submitted three ATI requests – in the press release.
“It was sadly not a surprise at all,” Bangs wrote to The Daily. “The only shock was the number of students faced with these delays.”
Marcil declined to comment on McGill’s current military- and fossil fuel-related research, as well as the University’s current lack of regulation on research with potentially harmful applications.

Administration’s definition of success remains unclear
On Wednesday, Rose Goldstein, Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations), presented to Senate an updated version of the University’s Strategic Research Plan, a document that highlights McGill’s “core commitments.”
Goldstein reviewed the University’s success in research as well as its challenges in funding. Although McGill has moved up from fourth to second place in “research intensity” among U15 universities for the total tri-council funding, less research-intensive universities have been increasing at a quicker rate than McGill, “working hard and capturing more than their market share,” according to Goldstein.
Goldstein described McGill as being in the “middle of the pack” in terms of its current growth in research funding.  While presenting a pie chart of the University’s current sources for research funding, she explained that McGill relies heavily on “traditional sources” of funding – provincial and federal government funds. Goldstein’s report thus stressed the importance of diversifying funding by soliciting funds from individuals, foundations, and philanthropists, among others.
A Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) document, submitted to the committee on October 9, outlined the graduate society’s comments on the Strategic Research Plan and expressed concerns over the Plan’s definition of success and excellence: “How will McGill measure and monitor how research is fulfilling these goals? Citations?  Publication in high-impact journals?  The feedback of other faculty members?  The social impact as expressed through media coverage, partnerships, etcetera?  The strategic research plan should articulate these metrics.”
Goldstein added that researchers have a responsibility in the Strategic Research Plan to “know our funders and what they want to fund” and to “seek out the strongest projects with the greatest possibility of success.”
Goldstein added that researchers have a responsibility in the Strategic Research Plan to “know our funders and what they want to fund” and to “seek out the strongest projects with the greatest possibility of success.”
The Strategic Research Plan includes seven “areas of research excellence” that the University should strategically support: Examine fundamental questions about humanity, identity, and expression; strengthen public policy and create a deeper understanding of social transformation; capitalize on the convergence of life sciences, natural sciences, and engineering; support health research and improved delivery of care; unlock the potential of the human brain and the entire nervous system; advance knowledge of the foundations and applications of technology in the Digital Age; and explore the power of the Earth, space, and the universe.
Multiple Senators expressed concerns about the limitations posed by the list, claiming that their departments were not consulted in the Plan’s development and were not reflected in the listed areas.
In response, Goldstein said that these areas were simply “examples,” and that the list was not exhaustive.
PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney had similar concerns. “There are some overall problems with the value of ‘categorizing’ research in this manner,” wrote Mooney in an email to The Daily. “We could easily come up with seven completely different categories showing different overlaps, so it is important to emphasize the limits of such an approach and note that categories are fluid.”
Later in the meeting, Professor Chandra Madramootoo presented a report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Recording and Transmission of Senate Meetings.
The practices of other universities in Canada and the United States, as well as the practices of the Supreme Court and National Assembly, the committee recommended that Senate grant permission for the live video recording and transmission of Senate meetings on a pilot basis from January to December 2013. The committee said that this recommendation was based on the need for Senate to “show some leadership in history with respect to openness and transparency with respect to decisions made by the University that have implications in academic life in the University,” as well as to bring about “engagement from the broad university community from staff, academic support staff, students, and alumni.”
However, the motion to adopt this recommendation quickly became contentious after an amendment was introduced to include archiving the recordings, rather than only allowing the live streaming of meetings.
SSMU President Josh Redel was among those pushing the amendment, which was officially introduced by Dean of Religious Studies Ellen Aitken.
Redel said that not archiving the recordings for later use would be a “step backwards” in terms of maximizing engagement and gave the example of people who work full-time and are unable to watch Senate meetings live.
Referring to the committee’s fourth recommendation, which cites Senate’s need to show leadership and maximize engagement, Redel said, “Leadership isn’t doing what other universities do. It’s going above and beyond what they do, not trying to catch up.”
In response, the committee cited its concerns that archived recordings could be leaked, reproduced, or recreated outside of McGill, and claimed that the current recommendation aimed to protect copywritten material.
Other Senate members expressed concerns over the possibility of legal action being taken over recorded statements.
After debate on the motion and its amendment, the amendment was withdrawn and the motion tabled to allow the committee to consult further with concerned Senate members.
The final portion of the meeting was dedicated to Interim Dean of Students Linda Starkey’s Annual Report of the Committee on Student Discipline, during which a group of students stood in the back with a sign that read “McGill’s Committee on Squashing Dissent” and periodically disrupted the proceedings with cheers, snaps, and boos.

Inconsistent sanctions and targeting of activists on campus
Correction appended November 15, 2012.
A group of roughly fifteen students and professors raised a banner reading “McGill’s Committee on Squashing Dissent” at Senate yesterday while Interim Dean of Students Linda Starkey presented the Annual Report of the Committee on Student Discipline (CSD).
During the question and answer period of Starkey’s presentation, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Senator Ashraf Ismail asked if the group holding the sign could be heard from, but Schulich Music School Senator Sean Ferguson, who chaired the meeting in the absence of Principal Heather Munroe-Blum, said that they were “not part of the discussion.”
A flyer distributed by one student partaking in the action stated, “We are here because the University’s rules and procedures related to student discipline are interpreted and applied inconsistently and with bias against known student activists.”
“We are here because we do not agree with the [Disciplinary Officer] policing student dissent on campus and the [Disciplinary Officer]’s empowerment to ban dissenters from university properties summarily…” it continued.
The flyer concluded, “We do not support the appointment of André Costopoulos as the Dean of Students following his involvement and promotion of the above named practices in his capacity as Disciplinary Officer during the 2011-2012 year.”
Arts Faculty Senator Catherine Lu asked about the challenges the disciplinary office faced in trying to adjudicate several cases of students involved in similar violations. “Was anything done to ensure that like actions received like sentences? Does anything need to be changed institutionally?” she asked.
Starkey responded that this was a “good question” being addressed by the Code Revision Steering Group, but that ultimately it was the responsibility of the disciplinary officer to “hear every complaint as an individual.” She said that what might be considered by some to be “the same or similar situation” could translate to “different lived experiences.”
A letter sent to Starkey on September 18 and signed by ten McGill professors who served either as advisors or witnesses for students during the disciplinary process last academic year outlined what they claimed to be “wildly disparate sanctions imposed upon students for identical or very similar actions.”
The letter discusses one case in length, in which a student – whose name was redacted from the copy of the letter obtained by The Daily – was admonished and faced no fine or conduct probation after having been found to have violated Sections 5(a), 6, 8(a), 8(b), and 10(a) of the Student Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.
The letter reads, “He was charged with [action deleted], the act that was the crux of the [Disciplinary Officer]’s argument that the #6party was not a peaceful demonstration immunized against disciplinary action by Article 5(c). Hence, it is natural to expect that none of the #6party demonstrators should face sanctions more serious than those faced by [name deleted].”
“In general, formal hearings resulted in less severe sanctions than did private interviews. Those #6party protesters who had private interviews with Associate Dean Costopoulos, with but one exception that we know of, face both monetary penalties and conduct probation, and yet their cases were disposed by private interview because the allegations they faced were less substantial!” the letter continued.
The letter also discussed disciplinary proceedings brought against students engaged in strike-related activities last spring: “There was no rhyme or reason to who faced summary judgments, who had private interviews, and who had formal hearings; nor was there any regularity in the sanctions imposed.”
The letter requested that all fines and levies of restitution be canceled, payments already made refunded, impositions of conduct probation be lifted, community service requirements imposed be cancelled, that students banned from campus have their records expunged, and that the Dean of Students formally apologize.
The signatories include associate professors Adrienne Hurley, Derek Nystrom, Hasana Sharp, and Michelle Hartman, assistant professors William Clare Roberts, Yuriko Furuhata, and Alanna Thain, professor emerita Abby Lippman, Canada Research Chair in Philosophy and Psychiatry Ian Gold, and James McGill Professor Thomas Lamarre.
In her response sent on September 25, Starkey stated that “there are processes within the Code to address the questions you request,” and that students that had only received decisions based on a disciplinary interview could request a full CSD hearing, and those that had had a hearing could submit an appeal request to the Appeal Committee of the CSD.
Incoming Dean of Students André Costopoulos, who served as the Disciplinary Officer for the Arts faculty last year, told The Daily in an interview this September that the “extreme privacy protection that surrounds the whole disciplinary process means that cases tend to be fairly self-contained. There are no precedents in our system.” He also said that inequitable punishments for the same Code violations could not be the basis of appeal because all information pertaining to particular cases is strictly confidential.
“Nobody can confirm or deny. So that’s a very odd situation, and we need to think about that very carefully,” said Costopoulos.
Science Senator Moe Nasr asked Starkey if there was any process in place to determine the credibility of complaints made against students before a formal disciplinary process was allowed to continue.
Sunci Avlijas, a graduate student “dragged through” the disciplinary process last year, partook in the disruption because of what she believes is a manipulation of the Code of Student Conduct to “squash dissent on campus.”
Though ultimately exonerated after a month-long process, Avlijas was initially charged with violating Article 5(a) of the Code after she attended the Board of Governors meeting disrupted by a group of protestors dressed in pirate costumes. Video footage submitted by Security ultimately exonerated Avlijas. She claims that it was Security’s knowledge that she was politically active on campus that initially led them to file the complaint against her, and that this same knowledge led the disciplinary officer to investigate further.
“I was exonerated, but the process was very time-consuming, and extremely intimidating,” Aylijas told The Daily.
Post-Graduate Student Society Senator Jonathan Mooney asked Starkey how the CSD understood Section 5c of the Code, which stipulates that “nothing in this Article or Code shall be construed to prohibit peaceful assemblies and demonstrations, lawful picketing, or to inhibit free speech.”
Starkey responded that the Committee regularly discusses interpretation of the Code, and that disciplinary officers regularly meet to ensure consistent applications and interpretations of the Code.
In an email to The Daily, Mooney said that he felt “it critical for the committee, the officers, and the Dean’s office to take action to clearly communicate the framework of understanding they share regarding Section 5(c) to students […] In criminal law, one can look to past jurisprudence in gauging how a particular statute is interpretedbycourts,whichprovides an essential safeguard for citizens in terms of being aware of their rights and in ensuring consistency of interpretation. I think more needs to be done to provide students with the same protections.”

During last Wednesday’s Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Council meeting, VP Events Josh Greenberg was notably absent. Speaking with The Daily following the closed session, AUS President Devon LaBuik stated that Greenberg resigned from his position for “personal reasons.”
Greenberg’s resignation took place last week according to LaBuik. As of Wednesday night Greenberg’s biography was still up on the AUS website.
When asked of a successor to Greenberg’s position LaBuik told The Daily that the search had not yet started but that a replacement would be found this month.
“Right now we are still deciding how to chose it, but hopefully we will have someone by November 28th. It will either be someone from within the AUS or we will hold an election,” he said. “Though that being said an election might be impractical at this point in time because we can’t hold it this semester because we can’t do it constitutionally.”
“If we were to hold it next semester we wouldn’t be able to have a VP Events until mid-February. So essentially we would have a VP Events for one month and then we would have to select a new one. So we are still deciding,” LaBuik continued.
In the AUS Constitution, article 12.13 states, “In the event that one of the Vice-Presidents positions is or becomes vacant, the Council or General Assembly shall elect a replacement, in accordance with the Electoral by-laws, from amongst its members until a by-election, if deemed necessary, is held.
Greenberg, as AUS VP Events, sat on the events planning committee. When asked if there would be any problems with the committee due to his resignation LaBuik stated: “We have taken care of it.”
Almost an hour of the meeting was spent in confidential session, previous to which council members had to sign confidentiality agreements.
The rest of the meeting, which continued in open session, was focused on approving money from the Fine Arts Council (FAC) to campus publications such as The Veg and Steps as well as to the Fridge Door Gallery and the Undergraduate Theatre Society.
On Monday, AUS will be holding its first General Assembly of the year in the FDA Auditorium. The next AUS Council meeting will be held on November 28.
