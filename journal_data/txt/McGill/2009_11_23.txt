The Daily sits down with Heather Munroe-Blum to discuss campus issues
In a week of engagement with the student body, Principal and Vice Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum met with campus media to field questions on critical issues that impact the McGill community. The principal responded to questions on military research, tuition fees, and the future of McGill as a vehicle-free campus.
Early this month, the administration announced that it would lift regulations on military-related research. The Daily asked the principal to account for the change in policy, and to explain why regulations which were previously accepted would no longer be applied.
Munroe-Blum responded that the policy change would bring McGill in line with the practices of other research-intensive universities, the majority of which do not apply unique conditions to research funded by military-related bodies.
“The line on military research [does not] appear in [any] other research policy guidelines at the federal level, or with any of our peer universities,” said Munroe-Blum. “We have so many protocols that govern the ethics of the research that we do, that it would take the onus off of us to review our own research proposals thoroughly if we just defaulted to a line and a policy on who the sponsor of the research was. And secondly, it is inappropriate in our view, including mine, to say that the sponsor of the research is what dictates the usefulness of the research.”
According to the principal, the research restrictions’ impact on McGill’s ability to competitively secure investment in science and scholarship influenced the policy change. The countries that invest heavily in basic science under a defence-related framework have also been those that invest the most in the fundamental sciences, Munroe-Blum said. She cited the U.S. as “the best example of that.”
Munroe-Blum added that the policy on military research “has no good policy bearing and it provided a false sense of reassurance on something that has to be at the end of the day [a matter of] good judgment and good process.” She stated that while this may not satisfy students, she felt “much more comfortable” with the new policy than with the prior one.
The principal also commented on the University’s efforts to address underfunding. The University has already raised $500-million through the Campaign McGill fund-raising drive, while McGill’s MBA program switched to a self-funded model, increasing tuition to $29,500 – a  jump of 1,663 per cent for Quebec residents. The Daily asked whether increasing tuition was part of the University’s long-term plan.
Munroe-Blum responded that the University needs stable and effective levels of public investment. “With respect to tuition my view is that we should not be aiming to have American tuition rates, [and] that we have a completely public university system,” said Munroe-Blum.
She added, however, that low tuition did not equate to a better system of education, and criticized the framework used to determine tuition levels and distribution in Quebec.
“Quebec has the lowest tuition fees in all of Canada…. We have the lowest degree completion rate, and the lowest participation rate in all of Canada, so it is not a success story,” said Munroe-Blum.
“If you come to McGill from outside Quebec and Canada…[your] fees just don’t come to McGill. Those fees go into a pool that funds the whole Quebec university system…so our students don’t get the benefit of the tuition fees they pay if they come from outside of Quebec. I think there is a principle of fairness that is unjustly applied there,” she added.
The principal also said that while she was proud to be leading a public university, she did not believe it was fair that those who could pay a fairer share of the costs pay such low fees, and advocated that Quebec tuition be raised to the Canadian average.
“If you are really lacking funds, you don’t need free tuition. You need a grant or a loan or some combination of things…because the only way you are going to get both accessibility and quality is by having enough revenues over all, and having a commitment to providing support for those who are qualified to come but don’t have the support to do it themselves,” said Munroe-Blum.
Munroe-Blum was also asked when McGill will realize its goal of becoming a car-free campus. While she declined to give an exact date, the principal stated that it was “a big desire” for the administration to carry out the plan, and hoped that the campus would be vehicle-free by the end of the year.
“We are going as fast as we can, and we are going faster than we thought we would be able to…. I would say a vehicle-free campus is not just about sustainability, but safety as well, and the culture, and sense of community,” said Munroe-Blum. “We seem to have stronger than ever engagement with the local government on it. We’ve got the bike path in, and these are all steps to getting there.”

Commissioner speaks on F.R. Scott and the evolution of language rights
Graham Fraser, commissioner of official languages, delivered the twentieth annual memorial lecture on Montreal poet, lawyer, and social activist F. R. Scott last Wednesday at Moot Court. His address illustrated the relationship between Scott and language rights legislation in Canada.
F. R. Scott was an ardent defender of French-language rights throughout Canada and a sometimes bitter defender of the anglophone minority in Quebec. His emphatic response to a separatist’s request for this minority to leave, “J’y suis, j’y reste,” was later co-opted by the “No” campaign in the 1980 referendum.
Scott felt it “morally reprehensible” that Quebec should be the only defender of French-Canadian culture and believed that every government in Canada had this function.
“Ottawa must remain…one of the governments for all the French people in Canada just as Quebec is one of the governments for all the English in Quebec,” he wrote for the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, which Lester Pearson asked him to co-chair in 1963.
Scott felt that weak provincial government allowed corporate interest to run rampant and believed that only a strong federal government would protect minorities. Fraser noted that this concern was enshrined in the Canadian Constitution of 1982, which contains more definite protection for group rather than individual rights.
He reflected on the paradox of official bilingualism, especially Scott’s concern that bilingual institutions preserve and protect individual unilingualism. Fraser, however, had a positive interpretation of the policy.
“It is a policy that both assures the individual’s right to deal with the federal government in the official language that individual chooses – and one that protects, promotes, and takes positive measures for minority language communities,” he said.
By the end of his life, Scott worried that he had lost his fight for bilingualism, especially in light of Bill 22 (Quebec Official Language Act), and later, Bill 101 (Charter of the French Language), which passed in 1977 and stipulates French as the sole official language in Quebec.
“It is true that [Scott’s] vision for Quebec and Canada did not survive. Canada’s language regime is characterized by remarkable asymmetry, with Quebec being unilingual French, New Brunswick being officially bilingual, the territory of Nunavut being officially trilingual, and other provinces having a wide range of minority-language policies from substantial to almost non-existent,” Fraser elaborated.
Scott’s vision, then, may have been as narrow as it was ambitious, as he dismissed the idea of having more than two official languages. But he accepted that a degree of unilingualism for each language was necessary to prevent one from dominating and assimilating the other.
Scott was a law professor at McGill, but temporarily left after being attacked for his involvement as a founding member in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the precursor of the New Democratic Party.
Lionel Smith, James McGill professor and director of the Quebec Center for Private and Comparative Law, attested that his spirit is still present in the faculty, indicating that cases Scott argued and won are still studied at McGill. He commented on the paradox of bilingual legislation.
“If there is some ambiguity, the reflex should be to look to other language for enlightenment, and it may be that the two texts together will speak with one voice, so one may come to understand the intent and meaning of the law. It suggests that you would need to be bilingual to understand the legislation, but if everyone was bilingual, you wouldn’t need bilingual legislation. Yet, it seems to be the consensus, that in order to understand that law, you need to be able to read both texts.” Smith said.
Before Fraser served as commissioner of official languages, he had a prolific career as an author and journalist in both languages. He defined his current job as one of both promotion and protection – promoting the idea of linguistic duality as a value and not just an obligation, while making sure that the government institutions live up to their obligations under the Official Languages Act.

Panellists discuss criminalization’s impact on HIV/AIDS stigmas and testing
Since May 2009, over 70 Canadians have been criminally charged for not disclosing to their sexual partners that they have AIDS.  On Wednesday, a panel hosted by McGill on the “Criminalization of HIV/AIDS” discussed the implications of such practices, and the impact they have on the HIV/AIDS community as part of World AIDS Week at McGill.
The issue of criminalization is one of the single most divisive issues existing in the HIV community today, according to Mark Wainberg, the director of the McGill University AIDS Centre.
As the first panellist, Wainberg began by explaining why he felt criminalization of those who transmit HIV to their partners is an ineffective method of dealing with the issue.
“We create, through criminalization, a situation which creates incentives not to get tested as opposed to incentives to get tested,” Wainberg explained. He went on to say that he felt such policies created a stigma around the illness, and do not reflect the reality that the majority of HIV-positive individuals try to limit their risk behaviour and disease transmission.
Wainberg also spoke about the case of Johnson Aziga, a Hamilton, Ontario native who was convicted last April of two counts of first-degree murder for failing to tell at least 11 sexual partners that he had HIV. Wainberg stated that in such a case he understood the desire for criminalization, and the desire for the female sexual partners to seek revenge. “If I was on the jury, I would have voted to convict that son of a bitch. There is nothing anyone can say to extol this man. He is pure scum. He lied to 11 women, two of whom died from HIV,” Wainberg exclaimed. However, he also pointed out that in many cases, criminalization fulfilled an emotional need. “Canadian society should be guided by what is right, and not emotional satiation,” Wainberg added.
Professor Alana Klein of the McGill Faculty of Law continued the criminalization discussion in a similar vein. “I believe that everyone should disclose [that they have HIV]; however, just because something is bad, doesn’t mean that criminal sanction is the way to deal with these moral failures,” she said.  Klein suggested giving public health officials a mandate to deal with the disclosure issue as a possible alternative to criminalization.
Like Wainberg, Klein also believed that there are too many uncertainties in the law to properly deal with disclosure issues, stressing the difficulties of applying the law effectively despite a disconnect between lawmakers and the minorities these laws affect. There are no laws specifically relating to HIV exposure. Instead, courts must apply general laws to HIV transmission, she explained. Klein noted, though, that many HIV activists have a problem with the equation of a lack of disclosure with murder, as in Aziga’s case.
“Most scientists, scholars, and activists involved with AIDS recognize that criminalization does little to prevent transmission,” she said in her closing remarks.
Norbert Gilmore, a senior physician at the McGill University Hospital Centre, ended the panel discussion. Gilmore, who has worked with AIDS patients since 1981, felt that the question of criminalization comes down to intent. “The law should be made not to criminalize people who carry the virus but to criminalize the behaviour of people who wilfully transmit the virus,” he explained.

Author discusses pollution, corruption by Canadian companies in Africa
Last week, McGill’s Faculty of Education hosted a seminar on Canada’s collusion with the international mining industry. The seminar was part of a series of lunchtime talks on global education and was organized by international education professor Aziz Choudhry.
The seminar featured Alaine Deneault, author of Noir Canada: Pillage, corruption et criminalite en Afrique and Dominique Caouette, of the small Montreal-based publishing house Écosociété which published Deneault’s book. They spoke of  the ongoing legal battle between Écosociété and Barrick Gold, the world’s largest gold mining company. Barrick Gold sued the publishing company last year for $6-million after  Écosociété published Deneault’s findings on the mining industry in Africa.
Deneault’s book details the disastrous effects Canadian mining companies like Barrick Gold have on the countries in which they mine. Resource mismanagement, extreme pollution, and corrupt governance have been linked to mining companies across central Africa.
Deneault suggested that during the so-called “Mining Wars” of 1996 and 2003 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, mining companies colluded with both the sides in conflict. He further explained that the Canadian government had become intrinsically linked with these companies, and that these companies have extracted vast amounts of resources from the Canadian Treasury.
Apart from the rather direct methods in which Canada has helped the companies, such as using diplomatic efforts to further their cause, Deneault also mentioned the many benefits – such as tax rebates, havens, and other state policies – that are available to the entire mining industry.
Deneault regretted that there has not been a loud enough public outcry against these practices. He concluded that Canada has retained colonial structures and has even become an agent of colonial economic practices, through mining’s extraction of resources.

Public commission tells Ministry not to demolish St. Henri housing for highway remodelling
Quebec’s Bureau d’audiences publiques sur l’environnement (BAPE) published a report last week encouraging the Ministère des transports du Québec (MTQ) to “go back to the drawing board” on its plan to reconstruct the Turcot interchange – the junction of highways 15, 20, and 720 that lies between St. Henri and the borough of Westmount.
The MTQ’s original plan, released in 2007, calls for an 18 per cent increase in the interchange’s traffic capacity and for the demolition of almost 200 neighbouring homes in the Village des Tanneries complex. The project has met with fierce opposition from coalitions of local residents, community leaders, and urban planners.
Jody Negley, a local resident and the founder of the Citizens’ Committee of the Village des Tanneries, explained her misgivings with the project. “The plan would demolish about 160 or 170 houses,” said Negley. “About 400 people would lose their homes.”
Hemmed in by the Turcot to the north and east and by railroad tracks to the south, the Village des Tanneries occupies an obscure and often-overlooked pocket of St. Henri. Each of the houses on the north side of Cazelais, plus an adjacent building of loft apartments, are slated for demolition if the MTQ implements its initial plan for the new Turcot.
“Most people to look at it wouldn’t be terribly impressed and couldn’t understand why we’re fighting to save this community,” said Negley, as she drove through the interchange, passing the row of houses that are absent from the MTQ’s blueprint for the area.
“I think the Ministry of Transportation also feels like they’ll be doing us a service by getting rid of what most people would consider an unhealthy area of the city,” she said. 
Negley explained that this attitude echoes events in the sixties, when hundreds of people were displaced by the construction of the Décarie and Ville-Marie expressways (highways 15 and 20, respectively). “[It’s] the same mentality,” she said. “‘Let’s clean up the slums, let’s get rid of the poor areas, and basically replace it with progress’ – and they saw this as progress.” 
Negley was one among the dozens of people to bring their grievances to a BAPE commission held in June, when stakeholders were invited to share their thoughts on the MTQ plan. During the five-day hearings, Montrealers submitted over 100 “memoires” to the commission, many of which criticized the plan for overlooking public transit options for suburban commuters, failing to address greenhouse gas emissions, and further isolating parts of St. Henri already largely cut off by the surrounding network of highways.  Members of Mobilisation Turcot and the Conseil régional de l’environnement and the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) were especially vocal opponents of the MTQ proposal.
After the hearings, the concluding BAPE report explicitly condemned the idea of expropriating local housing in the new development – something many of the locals saw as a victory.
The infrastructure kill-zone
The mammoth structure of the Turcot’s off-ramps and concrete pillars – an “aerial spaghetti of roads” in the words of journalist Henri Aubin – sits on top of an expansive landscape of mostly-unused vacant lots. A number of trucking and construction companies are headquartered in the warehouses to the south of the junction. A nearby hotel and spa for dogs and cats represents the lone outpost of the gentrification that has slowly crept into St. Henri in recent years.
Built in the run-up to Montreal’s Expo ’67, the Turcot’s now-crumbling frame has needed attention for years. With chunks of concrete occasionally falling off the ramps and injuring drivers or pedestrians, much of the structure has now been fitted with iron netting. A local construction firm has been contracted to repair the structure on an ongoing basis.
“The error in our cities is that in the forties and fifties we invested massively in this car model, and all that investment is coming to the end of its useful life,” said Jason Prince, the coordinator of CURA at McGill, and a co-editor of the book Montreal at the Crossroads: Superhighways, the Turcot and the Environment.
“We’re in this 25-year kill-zone where fundamental structure decisions have to be made,” said Prince.
The MTQ claimed its plan would cost $1.5-billion, though critics expect the cost of the project to overshoot its initial target. More importantly, though, critics have pointed out that the MTQ’s proposal contained virtually no plans for improved public transportation in Montreal’s east-west corridor.
“The MTQ, when they designed their project, only thought of cars,” said Mobilisation Turcot activist Denis Lévesque. “They’re plumbers working on building a bigger, better pipe for cars to flow into, but what they didn’t take into consideration is that there are other projects on the table that will change how commuters move about the city.”
Prince asserted that there is a swath of reasons that the City needs to divert commuter traffic into public transit. “Building more roads means more pollution, more accidents, more greenhouse gases, and more congestion,” he said. “Following this other path means less of all these things, so the public policy decision is clear: we ought to pursue this mass transit alternative.”
The MTQ plan calls for many of the ramps to be lowered onto raised-earth embankments, which would expand the footprint of the highways into land currently occupied by neighbouring apartment buildings in the Village des Tanneries.
MTQ spokesperson Mario St-Pierre said that such a structure would be more economical than the existing interchange.
“Maintenance on these roads would be a lot cheaper than the above-ground ramps that we have now, which have cost a lot of money over 40 years,” said St-Pierre, adding that the embankments would also make the structure safer than it is now. “Based on data we have looked at, we know that there will be an increase in cars. That has nothing to do with any plan or will of the MTQ.”
Prince, however, said that increasing highway capacity will only defer the problem of clogged traffic for a few years. He stated that the new plan needs to allow the Turcot’s frequent logjams to continue, while diverting commuters into a new public transit system. 
“Congestion is in fact what you want,” said Prince. “You need to have a problem in the transportation system before you can act. Traditionally, the reaction is to build more roads…which often become congested within a few short years. There’s a maxim in urban planning that you can’t build your way out of congestion.”
Governance schism
Prince explained that the section of the MTQ responsible for highways is separate from those responsible for public transit, and mainly concerns itself with regional transport, not city development – a major problem for the future of transit in Montreal.
“The [car side] should never work in isolation, and they have to work hand-in-glove with the mass transit sector. They should also think about this transit-oriented development…at a city scale, a neighbourhood scale – because all these things are interconnected,” Prince said.
He explained that the Montreal city government has been planning to shift away from cars for some time, but that highway projects such as the Turcot have historically been imposed by the province against the City’s will. 
Lévesque agreed, and hoped the MTQ would recognize the systemic importance of the Turcot, and other highway infrastructure like it. 
“We sincerely hope that [Quebec Premier Jean Charest], who pretends to be the next climate leader when he goes to Copenhagen…addresses transport,” Lévesque said.
“It’s worth taking the time to do it right – because when it’s done, we are stuck with it for half a century.”

Opponents say proposed legislation threatens public safety
Correction Appended.
Twenty-one members of the opposition are supporting the Conservative Party’s bid to pass Bill C-391, a move that would eliminate the federal long gun registry.
Supporters of the bill say the registry is overly complicated and punishes responsible hunters in rural communities, where stringent registration is unnecessary.
C-391 passed its second reading November 4 with support from all Conservatives, as well as eight Liberals and 12 New Democrats. The bill will now be reviewed by a group of parliamentarians.
New Democrat Nathan Cullen, who represents a riding in northern British Columbia, echoed the view that the registry is difficult to navigate when he explained why he voted to eliminate the registry. “The people that I listen to are what I would call the more reasonable elements of the gun community…. They hunt once a year. They bring me these stories of trying to register a weapon four, five, six times,” he said.
If passed, the proposed legislation would eliminate the 10-year-old long gun registry, along with all existing information on approximately seven million long guns – weapons like rifles and shotguns. The registry for handguns, however, would remain in place.
Larry Bagnell,  the Liberal MP for the Yukon and the official opposition critic for northern affairs, also voted to scrap the registry. He spoke of his constituents’ difficulties registering long guns. “[When registering a car] you spend about 30 seconds at the counter and it’s done. To register a gun, some of these people have had to run around for months and months,” Bagnell said.
Wendy Cukier, president and  co-founder of the Coalition for Gun Control, contended that supporters of C-391 have misrepresented the registration process. “[Registry opponents have] successfully conflated licensing – which is more cumbersome – with registration,” Cukier said.
Obtaining a firearm license involves classes, written and practical examinations, and background checks, while registering a firearm involves filing forms that can be submitted online or by mail.
Still, Bagnell’s and Cullen’s views are illustrative of strong opposition to the registry in rural communities.
Many members of the opposition who voted to scrap the registry represent ridings outside of major urban centres.
The long and short of it
Cullen distinguished between handguns and long guns based on utility. “We deem handguns to have a different purpose than a long gun,” he said. “A handgun…is not a tool – it’s a weapon.” However, the Commissioner of Firearms’ Annual Report of 2008 casts this distinction in doubt. The report states that outside urban centres, long guns are the most common weapons used in homicides.
Heidi Rathjen, co-founder of the Coalition for Gun Control, who became an involved gun control activist after being present during the 1989 massacre at École Polytechnique, said the current distinction between long guns and handguns fails to account for particularly dangerous weapons.
They both pointed to the Ruger Mini-14, the semi-automatic rifle used by Marc Lépine during the massacre at École Polytechnique in Montreal in 1989.
Classified as a long gun, the Mini-14 is capable of firing the same ammunition as the M-16 rifle used by NATO troops. The Mini-14 is regularly stocked at firearms stores in the Montreal area.
“If this legislation becomes reality you will be able to buy not one but 50 Ruger Mini-14s and no one will know you have them,” Cukier said. “Something like the RM-14 uses NATO-standard ammunition and…we saw the results at [École] Polytechnique.”
Rathjen expressed similar frustration and anxiety. “We believe this is a military assault weapon…. What kind of a hunter needs 30-bullet ammunition clips?” she asked.
Those backing C-391 point to the high cost of the gun registry.
A 2002 report from the auditor general showed that the cost of gun registration would hit $1 billion by 2005.
But Cukier emphasized the significance of a 2006 report from the auditor general, which stated that since most guns in Canada have already been registered, eliminating the gun registry would only save taxpayers $3 million a year.
“Most of the cost is associated with licensing and registering gun owners,” Cukier said.
Bagnell added that despite the costs, his constituents are not worried about money.
“It’s not the money. It’s a point of principle. They see it as an infringement on their freedoms and their rights,” Bagnell said.
Hunting for hits
Cullen stated that there is an important difference in the way members of rural and urban communities handle firearms. “For somebody who hunts…they associate to [firearms] differently. They’re part of their set of tools…. It’s something I’ve had to learn as an urban-born Canadian,” he said.
Closer to home, proponents of gun control contend that the dissolution of the registry will endanger members of both urban and rural communities. Rathjen said that she sees the registry as a useful tool in reducing gun violence, especially violence against women.
“The long gun registry is one of the reasons why…murders of women with firearms have decreased substantially,” Rathjen said. She pointed to a Statistics Canada report, which states that murders of women with firearms per year decreased from 85 in 1991 to 32 in 2005.
The online registry also allows police to search for a person’s name, address, firearms’ license number, or a firearms’ serial number, and access other relevant information. However, Bagnell, who expressed doubt that the registry is an effective means of curbing firearm violence, was unconvinced of the important role it could play as a consultative tool for police officers arriving at a potentially dangerous scene.
“They always have to assume that there could be firearms there,” said Bagnell.
Cullen agreed. “When you talk to a lot of the police that work in my part of the world, they always assume a weapon is in a home that they are being called to,” he said.
The Commissioner of Firearms’ 2008 report stated that the online registry was consulted by law enforcement 3,441,442 times that year. Supporters of C-391 claim these numbers are inflated, because a hit is counted anytime the police use the registry – even for license plate numbers.
Earlier this month, journalists in a media scrum criticized Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan for releasing the report two days after the House voted on C-391. The registry contains information on the 6,659,534 registered long guns and 478,487 registered restricted firearms in Canada.
For Rathjen, the number of firearms and consultations provided sufficient reason to maintain the registry. “[Police] say they need the registry and that they use it on a daily basis for a range of reasons. That’s good enough for me,” she said.
Opponents of the registry maintain that it is ineffective in quelling firearm violence.
“No one’s offered one shred of evidence…in my riding…that it’s effective at reducing gun crime,” Bagnell said.
Mark Holland, the Liberal opposition critic for public safety and national security, voted against C-391. He pointed to the fatal shooting of four RCMP officers in Mayerthorpe, Alberta in 2005.
“That conviction was made possible because of the gun registry,” Holland said.
Cukier was concerned that support will continue for C-391 as those supporting rigourous long gun control remain apathetic. “If I came to McGill and I said…‘How many think we should license gun owners? How many think we should register guns?’ most people would raise their hands. And if I said ‘How many have done anything about it?’  most people look at their shoes.”
The original version of this article included the line: “Both Holland and Cukier argued that a registered firearm left at the scene was instrumental in convicting the shooter.”
Holland and Cukier were referring to the convictions of two men following the Mayerthorpe incident. While the two men were convicted for involvement in the incident, neither was the shooter. The shooter, James Roszko, was a convicted felon, but he committed suicide at the scene and was not convicted.

Commission des droits de la personne calls for police to end harassment
Reports issued at Quebec’s National Assembly earlier this month demanded that the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) cease their frequent harassment of the homeless, and called on the City to re-evaluate policies that allow for over-ticketing of the group.
“We received complaints that the police were giving tickets to the homeless for minor infractions that regular citizens do not get ticketed for,” said Paul Eid, who co-authored the CDPDJ’s report.“Instead of the police applying the law equally to all citizens, they socially profile – targeting specific groups like the homeless, prostitutes, and people who appear to be poor and enforce those laws to them in a much stricter manner.”
Eid cited a study conducted by the Commission des droits de la personne, the SPVM, the City, provincial government, as well as grassroots organizations between 2004-2007, which found that 30 per cent of tickets issued by the police for minor offenses were given to the homeless, even though they represent only one per cent of the population.
The CDPDJ also found that two City bylaws are discriminatory against the homeless; a bylaw which outlaws dogs being brought into certain parks, and another which prohibits access to certain parks after they have closed. Homeless youth frequently stay in parks and often keep dogs.
The CDPDJ has asked that the City repeal the two by-laws, and that the SPVM improve training for its police officers.
According to Eid, the Commission des droits de la personne and some grassroots organizations decided to investigate the issue after the City failed to investigate the possibility of discrimination.
“The police have always denied the claim that certain bylaws or standards are responsible for this problem of over-ticketing, which only causes the homeless people to fall into a cycle they cannot get out of. They cannot pay the fines so they are sent to detention centers for minor offenses and feel like they have no way out,” Eid said.
The SPVM argued however, that the frequent ticketing of the homeless is not unfair treatment, but an indication that homeless people commit more infractions. Denis Desroches, assistant director of the SPVM, said that the police give warnings, but that sometimes they are forced to issue tickets.
However, Eid said that his findings indicated that the police did not always follow proper procedure. “[The police] say they give warnings [before tickets] but that’s not what we found out. From our many testimonies, we have found that the warning approach is not really applied. It’s a legitimate reason to fine citizens for infractions, but we have to make sure the police are applying the law when there is a valid reason to do so,” Eid said.
Geoff Kelley, president of the Commission de la santé, said that ticketing was not the way to solve the problems of the homeless.
“We have to find a a way for people to respect each other’s space. The police need help as well. They’re often called upon to be referees when there are disputes between the homeless and other citizens – often business owners and merchants – and they are not the best person for that job. We recommend that other groups, like social workers and health care workers, work together to find a better solution,” said Kelley.
Although the Commission de la santé does not have the power to enforce recommendations, they do intend to pursue the issue until a policy change is implemented.
“The short-term plan right now is to wait to hear from the Minister of Social Affairs, who said she will have a plan based on our recommendations by Christmas,” said Kelley. “In the long-term, we want to pursue a governmental policy change on dealing with the homeless, to ensure the policy and different social services are all coordinated in dealing with this problem.”

Montreal resident found guilty of distributing pro-jihad videos
Last week, Crown prosecutors announced they will seek the maximum punishment – life in prison without parole for 10 years – for Montreal resident Said Namouh, who was convicted last month on charges of terrorism. If the Crown succeeds, a precedent could be set to lower the bar for the sentencing of crimes prosecuted under the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
Thirty-seven-year-old Namouh, who emigrated from Morocco in 2003, was arrested and charged in September 2007 for editing and uploading a hostage video of the kidnapping of BBC journalist Alan Johnston by Hammas to a well known jihadist web site, and for advocating holy war in jihadist chat rooms.
Namouh’s defence attorney, René Duval, argued during the case that the evidence against Namouh failed to prove that he intended to kill anyone. Duval criticized the Crown’s prosecution efforts, explaining afterward, “I think this approach is mistaken. This is not very different from any other case, except the criminal code makes for aggravating circumstances if the person is performing something that they call ‘terrorism.’”
The Crown prosecutor, Dominique Dudemaine, focused on Namouh’s chat room declarations of intent, saying that “because Namouh had plans that said he wanted to die a martyr, there’s no protection for the future that said he wouldn’t be a danger to society.”
Duval, however, drew a stark difference between his client’s case and those where the Crown had sought a life sentence in the past.
“In my view of the matter, this is highly distinguishable from other cases, where people had plotted to bomb places such as the Toronto Stock Exchange,” he said, referencing the 2006 “Toronto 18” case. The suspects of that case received no more than 10 years in prison, though they were arrested after purchasing 3 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a crucial bomb-making component.
“The Crown is trying to make an example. In our case, we are very far from the last case in which the Crown sought life,” Duval said. “We are talking about someone putting things on the Internet.”
Duval also referred to the case  of  Younis Tsouli, who was convicted in 2007 in the United Kingdom under similar provisions in British anti-terrorism laws. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was later increased to 16 years.
Namouh was convicted under a number of charges, notably section 83.19 of the Canadian Criminal Code. The law states that anyone who “directly or indirectly participates in enhancing the ability of any terrorist group to facilitate or carry out a terrorist activity” can be charged – whether or not the said terrorist group actually carries out the terrorist activity, the accused’s contribution actually enhances the terrorist group’s ability to carry out the act, or the accused is even aware of the specific nature of the planned terrorist act.
Section 83.19 contained a maximum sentencing of 14 years until 2001, when it was amended by the ATA, which expanded the maximum sentence to life.
Namouh’s sentence is expected to be handed down in February of next year in Montreal. Duval declined to comment on whether or not his client would appeal the sentence.

Mexican ruling on New Gold mine sets precedent
Last Wednesday the Mexican environmental enforcement agency closed the Canadian-owned New Gold mine in the town of Cerro de San Pedro. The government’s actions ratified decisions made last month by the Federal Tribunal of Fiscal Administration and Justice, as well as the Ninth Circuit Administrative Courts that deemed New Gold’s operating permits illegal.
The closure marks the end of a 10-year battle by the Frente Amplio Opositor (FAO), the international coalition that worked to close the mine on the basis of its environmental and social impacts on the nearby community of San Luis Potosi.
Cleve Higgins, of FAO Montreal, commented on the unprecedented importance of the closure. “It’s really significant for the people of Cerro de San Pedro, also for the people opposing mines in Latin America and all over the world…. This is the most high profile, widely known opposition to a mine of this kind.”
On November 14, the FAO filed complaints with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The FAO accused these bodies of misrepresenting and withholding information that was of “central importance to shareholders.”  Since the closure announcement, New Gold’s stock dropped by 18 per cent, though some analysts expect it to recover.
George Albino, an analyst with Macquarie Equities Research, expects the company’s shares to suffer, but only until the situation is resolved as he anticipates. “In our view, Mexico is a pro-mining country and will ultimately allow New Gold to resume mining operations at [Cerro de San Pedro] in spite of the current setback,” Albino said in a memo.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Curran echoed the sentiment in a memo to clients. “We do not believe that the mine is an environmental liability that warrants permanent closure,” Curran wrote.
New Gold announced that it plans to appeal the decision, although it has made no mention of how it will conduct the appeal. The ruling that New Gold operated under null permits is unappealable under Mexico’s highest court.
According to a press release circulated by the FAO and Mining Watch Canada, FAO lawyers are currently pursuing charges against New Gold and its Mexican subsidiary. The coalition is also launching a “Mega-remediation project” to restore the mine’s detrimental effects on the historical and environmentally distinctive valley of Cerro de San Pedro.
“They are proactively taking steps to ensure mines of this kind don’t happen in the future,” Higgins elaborated.
