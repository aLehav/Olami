Day two of the conference featured a lecture series and panel discussion focused on the roles and responses of international agencies to the ongoing food crisis. Among the high profile speakers were representatives of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the World Bank, speaking to an audience of primarily self-described technocrats.
Henk-Jan Brinkman, a senior adviser for economic policy at the WFP, opened his segment by solemnly declaring, “the food crisis is not over, and the global economic and financial crisis has even worsened it over the last year or so…. Hunger has broadened, and it has deepened. There are some green economic shoots, but there are very few social ones.”
Brinkman went on to describe the manner in which a global food “shock,” or a massive sudden increase in prices, as seen in 2008, negatively affects malnutrition and education rates in developing countries as families move to cheaper and less nutritious food, diversify incomes, pull children out of schools, and sell “productive assets.”
The WFP issued an emergency appeal in March 2008 for additional aid from developed countries to meet a $755-million budget shortfall in light of soaring food and fuel prices.
Jim Cornelius, executive director of the Canadian Foodgrains Bank, a partnership of 15 church-based agencies, spoke of the necessity for a mobilized, engaged citizen population in policy-making.
“[Food] will fall out of the news again, it won’t remain, it will slide down. Unless we build a base of support of citizens, I think the possibility of support declining is very real. Technical and technocratic answers wont always get us there,” Cornelius said.
Christopher Delgado, coordinator of the Global Food Response Program of the World Bank (WB), in line with the prevailing attitude of the WB, criticized the protectionist export taxes and bans during a food shortage while praising the effectiveness of lowering food taxes.
Robert Patterson, senior liaison officer for North America in the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), surprised the audience with his disgust for technocratic obfuscation.
Patterson explained that his comments were those of a 30-year FAO employee, and not those of the FAO.
“I’m unqualified [to speak here] because I tend to be institutionally illiterate, and I aggressively pursue and maintain that ignorance,” Patterson said.
“We have been using, over and over again, the words ‘global financial crisis.’ But in the places I work, nobody uses these words. These people have always been poor. You can’t sink into a crisis if you have no money in the first place….Food security and insecurity – the people that I work with never use these euphemisms. The words I hear are hungry, sick, or ‘my child’s belly is empty.’ I think we can get away from some of these euphemisms and talk clearly about what’s going on and encourage people to get active in practical solutions.”

The University kicked off the conference on Monday by inviting several speakers from various countries to describe the impact of the financial crisis on their nation’s experience with food production.
The dean of McGill’s Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Chandra Madramootoo, introduced the event, which featured speakers from Ghana, Haiti, Central Asia, India, Nigeria, and Canada.
Mukuteswara Gopalakrishnan, Secretary General of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, mentioned that the financial crisis has presented a significant challenge.
“India could withstand the impacts of 2008’s economic downturn, particularly with respect to food security…. However, this year, things are going to be much more difficult,” Gopalakrishnan said.
He also said that while India has made progress in areas such as food production and caloric intake, hunger remains a serious problem.
Gopalakrishnan explained that the majority of farms rely on rainfall, and that deficient rain in recent months may cause Indian food production to suffer.
“India has made impressive strides,” Gopalakrishnan said.  “But we must also simultaneously admit that the total riddance of food insecurity is still at a distance.”
Victor Dukhovny, director of the Interstate Coordination Water Commission of Central Asia, asserted that Central Asia’s governments must make progress in protecting their farmers financially.
“If you want to have food security, we need to protect the farmer by a proper system of financial support,” Dukhovny said.
Dukhovny argued that the amount of irrigated land in the region decreased following the collapse of the Soviet Union because of a failure to subsidize agriculture appropriately, and went on to cite the European Union and United States as examples of countries with successful agriculture subsidy programs.
Dukhovny also focused on water’s role in agriculture, and suggested the creation of a global campaign to strengthen water rights with regards to irrigation.
Daniel Uza, vice-chancellor of the University of Agriculture in Nigeria, offered a description of his nation’s efforts to ensure food security.
Nigeria, Uza noted, has experienced an increase in food prices as a result of government efforts to subsidize tractors, irrigate more land, and manage livestock.
Uza stressed the nation’s need for improved farming technology and emphasized the Nigerian government’s focus on private-public partnerships to achieve its goals.
“Because of the stable, democratic government which we have had in Nigeria for the past 10 years, we are very hopeful that the food security situation in Nigeria will continue to improve.  And it is our desire that in the year 2020, Nigeria will be one of the most developed 20 countries.”

On Wednesday, experts weighed in on the effects climate change could have on agriculture in the coming years.
At the panel discussion, “Climate Change: the Challenges for Food Security,” four presenters pointed to several general anticipated climate changes that could affect agriculture: rising carbon dioxide levels, rising air temperature, and more extreme environmental events.
Bano Mehdi, a McGill PhD student working at the Brace Centre for Water Resource Management, said that the gradual increase in air temperature and subsequent droughts could have a major effect on crops that are already struggling in hotter climates.
“Crops are already at the threshold of their temperature limits,” said Mehdi.
Sam Gameda, a McGill alumnus who works for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, talked about the effect climate change could have on Canadian and East African agriculture.
“The [Canadian] prairies suffer from relatively frequent droughts,” said Gameda, citing a drought in 2001-2002 that resulted in economic losses upwards of $5 billion for the Canadian crop industry.
Issues are considerably worse in East Africa.
“Areas of East Africa are under stress of food security because of drought. [East African countries] are experiencing droughts, groundwater depletion, and disruption of rainfall,” Gameda said.
“Rainfall is a critical factor,” said Gameda, who pointed to an increase in variability of amounts of rainfall as a major concern. He cited a 23 per cent reduction in rainfall in the past Indian monsoon season as an important indicator, adding that these factors have put 24 million East Africans at risk of hunger and destitution.
Bert Drake, a plant physiologist for the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland, added that greater environmental stress could reduce crop production.
“More intense hurricanes and rising sea levels could affect low-lying areas, particularly rice production areas,” said Drake.
The projections weren’t overwhelmingly negative, however. “Possible climate changes create favourable conditions for plant growth,” said Galina Stulina, of the Central Asian Scientific Research Institute for Irrigation in Uzbekistan.
A rise in carbon dioxide levels and an increase in season length due to rising air temperature may be positives for plant and crop growth.
“There will be an increase in productivity in developed countries that have strong agricultural markets,” said Mehdi. “There will be opportunities for farmers to plant higher value crops.”
Despite the immediately beneficial climate change effects for Canada, Mehdi warned that the global effects will be far worse.
Mehdi described an anticipated northward extension in crop land, as the northern regions get warmer and southern regions get too hot. North America and Russia may be some of the only regions to benefit from this change, leaving already impoverished nations worse-off.
Mehdi said that the global population will have risen to nine billion by 2050, and as the crop yields of southern nations decrease due to the various climate changes, it will be the responsibility of countries with growing yields to provide for the growing population.
Those in attendance were left with the loaded question of how to distribute limited agricultural goods around the globe.
“There will be higher demands on agricultural commodities,” Mehdi said, “But it has to be done in a sustainable way.”

Nobel Peace Prize winner emphasizes the importance of compassion
This Saturday, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama made two presentations in Montreal, one to a 500-person invite-only event hosted by McGill’s Faculty of Education, and a second to a crowd of 14,000 people at the Bell Centre.
The 74-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner felt compelled to request a private audience with education students after he learned of the provincial government’s introduction of a controversial ethics and religious culture class to primary and secondary students throughout Quebec.
During both addresses, the Dalai Lama emphasized the need for a balance between intellectualized faith and secular ethics.
“His Holiness was interested in speaking with students involved to support the notion that human values, ethical issues, and respect for religious and secular traditions is a positive initiative,” said education professor Spencer Boudreau, McGill’s ombudsperson and the main organizer of the event. “[Religion] is part of our culture and history; it’s a powerful force in the world [that] we’ve neglected,” Boudreau said.
Due to the limited tickets available for the McGill talk, the McGill organizing committee decided to stream the two-hour event on learnquebec.org, where it is still available to site users.
During the McGill address, the Dalai Lama stressed to education students that instilling a positive religious tolerance in youth was critical for a compassionate society.
“Please carry your profession with sincere motivation and a sense of global responsibility,” the Dalai Lama said. “At least, with some aim or goal [that] out of this century, a more compassionate world [will come].”
Mitchell Miller, the president of the Education Undergraduate Society, had the opportunity to sit with the Dalai Lama. Miller was selected to thank His Holiness on behalf of the anglophone universities in Quebec.
“Sometimes it feels like there is a lot of unnecessary self-deprecation among students in this faculty. [The Dalai Lama’s visit] was a reaffirmation for us as educators of the power that we can have,” Miller said.
Heather Monroe-Blum served as the master of ceremonies.
Later that day, during his presentation at the Bell Centre, His Holiness asserted that he had no political or spiritual agenda. Instead, he hoped to articulate the need of shared links between humanity, to be compassionate, and work to make the world a better place.
“I am talking as a human being to another human being. Not as a monk, Buddhist, or Tibetan,” he said.
Nonetheless, the event took on a political tone as Chinese and Uyghur protesters assembled outside. Tibet has been administered and controlled by the People’s Republic of China since it occupied the territory in 1950. The Dalai Lama, recognized as the exiled political leader of Tibet, fled the territory in 1959 and is seen as a threat to the national identity and integrity of China.
“It’s our country. We love it,”one Chinese protester said, standing calmly with several others in objection to the Dalai Lama’s visit to Montreal. A couple of Tibetans yelled at them to leave Canada and go back to China.
Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority from Western China, also demonstrated in solidarity with the Tibetans. They called on China to recognize their human rights, stating that they were “the other Tibetans.”

Three-year legal dispute over membership dues resolved this year
The Students’ Society of McGill University has settled a three-year legal battle with the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA), agreeing to pay $35,000 to the federal student lobby. SSMU confirmed the settlement earlier this week, although the agreement was finalized last May.
McGill undergraduates voted to leave CASA in October 2005. Following SSMU’s withdrawal, CASA claimed that SSMU had failed in membership dues for the year, and filed a lawsuit of $28,000 against the Society. The case was due to be heard in court last December, but was postponed to May when SSMU changed legal counsel.
Max Silverman, who served as SSMU VP External from fall 2006 until spring 2008, argued that since McGill undergraduates had disaffiliated from CASA in October of that year, they were not obligated to pay eight months’ worth of fees to the Alliance.
“Because we left in the fall of that year…and for us the school year is eight months long, it didn’t make sense that we should have to pay all eight months for only one month of membership. I know that basically that was our moral claim to the money,” Silverman said.
In 2007, SSMU had offered to pay CASA $8,000 to settle the claim. Silverman considered the offer to be a reasonable compromise since the Society had already paid its first installment of fees – understanding that CASA had planned for the revenue in its budget.
CASA national director Arati Sharma said that while CASA does not often go to court when members leave, unpaid membership dues are cause for legal action.
“We are a small organization and don’t have a large budget, and so when a school leaves and doesn’t give proper notice, it significantly impacts our budget, impacts our work here in Ottawa for the rest of our membership, and means that we have to pursue legal action,” said Sharma.
SSMU president Ivan Neilson said that although last year’s executive had finalized the terms of the settlement, he welcomed a conclusion to the case.
“It doesn’t serve our interest to have the organization be burdened with legal battles unnecessarily and we are happy to have reached a decision,” said Neilson.
Neilson also said that while SSMU’s former legal counsel had recommended legal action, Rena Kermasha, the Society’s new legal representative, decided to settle out of court after having reviewed the facts.
 “Most cases that get introduced into the court record end up being settled, and it’s not a reflection of good faith or bad faith, but a question of leverage,” said Kermasha.
 “[In this case], both parties were interested in negotiating, which is why we ended up settling outside of court.”
The financial cost of the case, however, is not limited to the $35,000 settlement. According to Jose Diaz, SSMU VP Finance, the case will eventually cost SSMU approximately $70,000 in legal fees.

Improving access to markets for small land holders and local farmers is the most important factor in achieving global food security, according to experts speaking at Wednesday’s panel “Markets and Trade: How They Affect Food Security.”
Despite the fact that market failure was the primary cause for the price spikes in foods that occurred in late 2008, panel speakers argued that markets and trade must not be abandoned if global food insecurities are to be resolved.
“Market and trade are the tools that we have, [in order] to be able to deal with the realities of the world we face,” said Neil Conklin, president of Farm Foundation.
Conklin emphasized that national protection mechanisms, such as local subsidies and export restrictions, are strategies that will only deepen the unequal distribution of food around the world.
“We will only be food secure if we are secure globally,” Conklin said.
But security for the world’s hungry and poor is complicated by the fact that they spend 60-70 per cent of their income on food, making them particularly sensitive to market fluctuations. Maximo Torero from the International Food Policy Research Institute explained that an increase in international food prices is very quickly passed to consumers.
“What this means is that the international price of wheat [for example] was significantly affecting the price of commodities in [Latin American] countries. So that the consumers in rural areas were paying more for these goods,” Torero said.
Henk-Jan Brinkman, a senior advisor for economic policy at the United Nations World Food Programme, added that information asymmetries between the rich and the poor, the lack of access to markets, and risk aversion among the poor are all drivers of market failure. Brinkman said that correcting these factors requires increased attention to the poor.
“It is very critical for households that are poor and hungry to have a good safety net so that they are able to take on the risks that markets generate. Whether that is through food, cash, vouchers, or through insurance mechanisms is dependent on [a country’s particular situation],” Brinkman said.
“Employment security programs, preventive school feeding, and early-child nutrition programs are essential, because we [need solutions] for the people who are in the worst conditions,” Torero said. “But we also need to link farmers to markets. And for that, we need to capture their unique produces; one solution doesn’t fit all.”
Conklin affirmed that the key component to achieving global food security is reforming the international trading system.
“We have no shortage of creative thinking of ideas that it will take to achieve the kind of reform that we need,” Conklin said.
