As students head back to campus after a year of online classes, student services are reopening and Queer McGill is preparing to reopen their doors. This student-run service, created in 1972, provides queer students at McGill with a wide range of resources and advocates for queer student  rights at McGill and in the greater Montreal community.
In an interview with the Daily, Resource Coordinator Cal Pease described Queer McGill’s role within the university: “[Queer McGill] works to uplift queer voices through our multiple creative events, such as our zine launch, art shows, and open mics. This work is fundamental because of how much queer voices are usually oppressed in these fields.”
The organization is set on advocating for queer students’ interests. “We work with the Gender and Sexuality Commissioner to focus on improving the queer student experience at McGill within the SSMU,” Pease said. “In addition, our administrative coordinator sits on numerous committees that advocate for queer students such as the McGill Joint Board-Senate Committee on Equity (JBSCE) Subcommittee on Queer People.” This Subcommittee has, among other things, spoken out against speaking events that are harmful to trans and nonbinary youths and hosted worshops and conferences for queer students.
In addition to providing queer students with a community and a voice within SSMU, Queer McGill also aims at offering support for the broader queer community. Administrative Coordinator Brooklyn Frizzle highlighted Queer McGill’s political purpose: “We take stances on relevant queer related political issues in order to heighten student awareness, actively promote queer issues, and prevent prejudicial action against our members and allies.” 
On August 29, Queer McGill launched their Summer Zine, which is accessible through their website and Facebook page. It features art pieces submitted by McGill students, in accordance with the organization’s  goal of providing more queer representation and visibility. The zine also serves  as an update of the resources and events Queer McGill offers, both material and informational. Among those are “safer sex supplies such as condoms, dental dams, HIV self test kits and more; gender affirming gear such as binders, gaffs, packers, […] and menstrual supplies such as menstrual cups and reusable pads,” according to Pease. Students can access their full catalog on Queer McGill’s website; to request resources, students can fill out their resource reservation form. 
Pease also added that within the SSMU building (located at 3600 McTavish Street), Queer McGill facilitates a staffed safer space in Room 432, where students can take advantage if a room free of overstimulating lights and scents. and an English language queer-specific library in Room 408. The organization additionally serves as a resource for information about other queer organizations in Montreal.  
Regarding this year’s events, Pease specified, “Queer McGill will be hosting our weekly Gaymes Nights/Movie Nights alternating between in person and online. Every month will also have one online event and one in person event. We’ll be hosting some events that you may remember from pre-Covid times, such as our Bob Ross Night and Palentine’s Gay, as well as another Zine Launch.”
Queer McGill kicked off this year with their first in-person movie night on September 1 and welcomed everyone back with a picnic in Parc Jeanne-Mance on August 28. They also have brand new events planned for this year, such as a virtual escape room on November 13 and gingerbread house decorating on December 11.

On September 1, the first day of classes of the Fall semester, students congregated in front of the James Administration building from 9 AM to 5 PM in a protest organized by SSMU. Protest organizers called on the University to create more comprehensive guidelines and equitable accommodations relating to COVID-19 and the return to in-person classes. Protesters were masked and socially distanced. Organizers shouted their demands through megaphones, while attendees were encouraged to write postcards to be delivered to the McGill administration listing their concerns.
In an August 31 email, SSMU called on students to attend the protest and outlined five specific demands: (1) accommodations for international students unable to return to Canada at this time, (2) accommodations for students who are unable or for whom it is unsafe to return to in-person activities, (3) proper and equitable support for students, (4) a comprehensive and equitable vaccine mandate, and (5) student consultation in decision-making concerning COVID-19. 
Participants expressed frustration at the university’s failure to require vaccinations for students returning to campus. According to protest-organizer Claire Downie, SSMU VP University Affairs, McGill is failing its students. “We’re one of the last big universities in Canada without a vaccine mandate,” she explained at Wednesday’s protest. The statement was made two days after UBC’s announcement that proof of vaccination or regular rapid testing would be required for students on campus, leaving McGill even further behind other universities’ policies. 
In a media roundtable held August 27, Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau stated that in creating health policies – specifically those related to a vaccine mandate – the University is bound by the existing Quebec legal framework; “Having the choice [to undergo a medical procedure or not] is a fundamental right to the individual here in Quebec,” he explained. He further stated that there’s a way that the university can go above this precedent if “it is absolutely necessary to do so,” specifically if the situation were to worsen and the university had “no way to operate without a vaccine mandate.” Labeau did not clarify the threshold at which this would be possible. In the meantime, however, he claimed that given the university’s high vaccination rates and the health measures put in place on campus, there is not enough to “warrant that we infringe on these basic rights.” These statements were made after an open letter, published on August 23 by 35 lawyers within McGill’s law faculty, began circulating online. This letter highlights the inconsistencies between Quebec law and the legal reasoning put forth by the university, and ultimately argues that a vaccine mandate would be possible in the province. 
Sacha Delouvrier, SSMU VP External affairs, also highlighted the ways in which McGill’s preparedness pales in comparison with other universities and lacks adequate accommodations for students. “We have a set of demands that aren’t that hard considering that almost every other university in Canada has implemented them,” he told the Daily, “We want accommodation for immunocompromised individuals, remote learning options, [and] student consultation on COVID policies.” In the August 27 media roundtable, when questioned about remote learning accommodations for students who feel unsafe or uncomfortable returning to in-person activities, Associate Provost Chris Buddle stated that “we are confident in what we’re doing in terms of layers of protection in the classroom environment, so students can feel good about coming in and taking their in-person classes.” He explained that there is a COVID accommodation form available on Minerva that students may fill out if their situation inhibits them from coming to campus (for example, if a student tests positive for COVID). He added, however, that “direct accommodations for students who are feeling […] fearful of coming to campus [are] not likely.” Labeau further claimed that “we do realize that a lot of people don’t feel safe, and I think it’s important to realize that in many cases that doesn’t mean that they are not safe.” 
Despite Buddle and Labeau’s claims, student and faculty anxieties remain unappeased. “I’m very worried about catching COVID on campus and spreading it later to vulnerable loved ones and members of the community,” Downie said, “Students shouldn’t have to worry about catching COVID on campus, and that’s the reality of where we are.” She explained that in response to the protest, SSMU has received a wide range of support from students and faculty regarding their list of demands. “We’ve been chatting with people since this morning, and people are really receptive,” she said, “most people agree that everyone should feel safe on campus.” 
“Students shouldn’t have to worry about catching COVID on campus, and that’s the reality of where we are.” 
Downie stated that SSMU has not heard a response from the University regarding their recent open letter nor the protest. Campus security, however, was sent to kick media recording off campus around mid-morning. Delouvrier explained that CTV and CBC were on campus for less than an hour before they were removed: “[McGill] knows that their accommodations are lacking, they know that they should be ashamed, and they forcibly, with security, kicked off free speech and free press from a public campus,” he commented, “that’s unacceptable.” 
As the semester progresses, the future remains unclear. “There is a strong commitment to remaining in person with our teaching and our research activities,” according to Buddle. He explained that should the situation worsen, the university has plans to reinstate distancing and even online classes should it come to it. In the meantime, however, student and faculty demands for comprehensive, equitable accommodations and vaccine mandates remain unheeded.

A selection of new student organizations at McGill
SSMU’s annual Activities Night is taking place online this week, on September 13 from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. SSMU is also holding an “After Hours” party on September 14 to celebrate the return of student life at McGill. This year, Activities Night boasts over 250 booths showcasing the clubs and societies which McGill has to offer. With the return of in-person, student-run organizations comes the creation of new organizations as well: here, the Daily has rounded up some of the new organizations that McGill students have recently founded.
Black Students’ Financial Society
This is a new organization within the Management Undergraduate Society founded by third-year student Vanessa Richardson. It seeks to “Promote financial literacy and the growth of Black-owned businesses in the McGill and greater Montreal community.” Their plans for the year include starting an annual Black Student Entrepreneur Showcase and High School Outreach Program, along with coordinating seminars, grant opportunities, and workshops.
Making Drugs More Accurate
Officially launched on September 10, Making Drugs More Accurate offers drug-checking services and education on harm reduction to McGill students. Organizers will distribute drug-testing reagents to students upon request via an anonymous Google Form. Additionally, members of the organization say they will circulate QR codes throughout campus, leading students to a Google Document with information on the necessity of harm reduction, how testing kits can be requested and used, and how reagents work. They currently have a Google Drive with more information on how students can access their services.
Course Comics Club:
Founded by Vera Lynn, this organization seeks to give a creative outlet to McGill students by having them illustrate comics about the material they learn at school. According to a Facebook post that Lynn made regarding the founding of this club, teaching the content of a lesson is a way to develop a deeper understanding of class material – thus, participation in the club can serve as a way for students to study both effectively and enjoyably. The deadline to apply for executive positions is September 15.
Interested in applying to start your own club? See https://ssmu.ca/student-life/club-resources/how-to-start-a-club/ for more information. Applications for the 2021-2022 school year close March 26, 2022.
