Administration states they will not negotiate with students
This story is in development. The article will be updated to reflect any changes as they occur. Follow @mcgilldailynews for immediate updates.
Three days in to the “surprise resignation party” in the office of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson, 11 students remain on the sixth floor.
On Thursday morning, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa announced in a mass email to students and staff that the James building would remain closed for the day. The building was closed on Wednesday as well.
In a statement released by the students on the sixth floor on Thursday afternoon, the group stated that they had not been in contact with Mendelson in 48 hours.
“Hence we are pleased to announce Morton J. Mendelson’s resignation from the position of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) of McGill University. One of two demands of the sixth-floor partiers has been met,” the statement read.
The students on the sixth floor have demanded since the start of their action for the resignation of Mendelson and the validation of the results from the fall 2011 QPIRG and CKUT existence referenda.
The last round of negotiations between students and McGill took place Wednesday night at 5 p.m. with Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell. The negotiations – in which no progress was made between Nicell and students – concluded when the students’ negotiating team refused to leave the designated negotiating room on the sixth floor. Students are now occupying the room, which allows them access to a window.
Students and faculty have attempted to deliver food to the students on the sixth floor since last night, when reports were released stating that food supplies were dwindling.
At 1:15 p.m. on Thursday, a group of six professors asked security agents stationed around the building to permit them to deliver food to students on the sixth floor.
“We went up to the front door and we identified ourselves as professors and we said that we were concerned about the students not having had food,” said East Asian Studies Professor Adrienne Hurley.
Associate Professor of Islamic Studies Michelle Hartman, who participated in the effort, said that professors were told, “The building was closed and that no one was allowed to go in or bring anything in… We tried to figure out what regulation or what kind of policy led to the whole building being closed.”
Hartman said professors were told to get in touch with Provost Anthony Masi for an explanation regarding the closure of the building.
“We thought it was a cruel response to deny people access to food,” she added.
Around 2:30 p.m. oranges were successfully thrown to students on the sixth floor by a group of students and staff, who have gathered outside the window on the building’s east side.
Two students slept outside by the building’s east side Wednesday night.
Student Patricia Lahoud, who was outside the building and participated in the occupation of the James lobby on Tuesday night, said that students are “trying to find out different ways to get food to them.”
“There are a few plans in action,” she added, but would not elaborate on details.
One student left the sixth floor at 2:45 p.m. due to a virus, which had worsened after the group ran out of medication. When the news was spread on Twitter, McGill sent a doctor in to check on the remaining students.
Di Grappa’s email on Thursday morning details the administration’s stance on negotiating with the students on the sixth floor. The email states McGill will not negotiate regarding the two demands made by the students.
“We will not negotiate with anyone disrupting university activities in this manner. We are interested only in talking about a safe, peaceful end to the occupation.  In addition, we do not feel that these individuals have a mandate to represent students,” wrote Di Grappa.
Di Grappa also noted that McGill has been in discussions with CKUT and QPIRG in regards to the fall 2011 referenda questions since before the students entered the James building. He adds, “We intend to continue our discussions.”
Both CKUT and QPIRG have confirmed to The Daily that the organizations were not aware of students’ plans to occupy the James building prior to Tuesday when the action began.
At 5 p.m. reports from the sixth floor state that power has been cut off. Security told students outside the cause of the power outage is a blown fuse. Power is visibly on in other parts of the building. Internet in the building was cut off Tuesday night.

Camilo Ballesteros speaks in Montreal about student movement
Camilo Ballesteros, former president of the University of Santiago student federation, executive council member of the student confederation of Chile, and Chilean student activist, spoke in Montreal last Saturday as part of a nationwide tour discussing Chilean student activism.
Tens of thousands of Chilean students took to the streets beginning last May, calling for education reform in Chile. Students have criticized the lack of accessibility of post-secondary education – tuition in public and private universities in the country has increased by over 60 per cent in the last decade – as well as a lack of accountability over the allocation of government funds.
Ballesteros has been travelling through Canada for the past few days, meeting with various protest groups – namely, Occupy Toronto and the Canadian Federation of Students – and said at his talk that he is impressed with the level of autonomy and independence that the Canadian movements have (universities control the funding of student organizations in Chile).
Ballesteros said he first became aware of the extreme degree of inequality in Chilean education in 2011. Along with fellow activists Camila Vallejos from the University of Chile Student Federation, and Giorgio Jackson from the Student Federation of the Catholic University of Chile and Confederation of Chilean Student Federations, he started the Chilean student movement “with a communication campaign looking for people who wanted knowledge,” he explained in Spanish. Later, the group looked for “angry people [and began] telling people about their movement and improving their organization.”
Ballesteros further explained that, in Chile, not only is education very expensive for most people, but the universities are not keeping pace with the labour market.
He blamed this statistic on the lack of technical courses available in schools.
According to Ballesteros, the movement informed itself of how the education systems of the world worked, and explained to Chileans, “What they thought was normal was not actually the case.”
Eventually, he explained, the Chilean movement grew to include demands for health reforms, lodging and pension schemes.
Aurelian Basa, a Concordia Urban Planning student, said he hoped that Ballesteros’s tour of Canada will inspire students across the country to protest against their own governments.
“People should look at what Quebec is doing right – not wrong,” said Basa. “The other provinces should lower their tuition rates or have education be free.”

“Quartier de l’innovation” raises questions over private and public partnerships
A proposal by McGill to build a new campus near the Bonaventure Highway in Griffintown has raised questions over the efficacy of private and public partnerships.
The plan, which was submitted to Senate last month, calls for the construction of a “Quartier de l’innovation” (QI) to enhance the visibility of the University and foster innovation in “all realms of creative endeavors.” According to the McGill VP Research and International Relations Rose Goldstein’s report to Senate last month, the success of the project will depend on the strength of its relationships with private and public entities.
The report states that “corporate partners are anxious to have access to [McGill’s] pool of highly trained individuals. We recommend that QI-based businesses be given unique access to this pool.”
QI reflects a larger trend, in which universities increasingly rely on private and public partnerships to build new facilities, expand into new neighbourhoods, and increase their international visibility. In California, cash-strapped public universities have used Private and Public Partnerships (PPP) in around sixty different projects since the University of California system began in the mid-20th century, with projects ranging from the construction of medical office buildings and research facilities, to new housing for students.
In Canada, the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, the Emily Carr institute of Art and Design, and the British Columbia Institute of Technology have all been involved in the Great Northern Way Trust private limited company, with business partners since 2001.
While a full business proposal for QI is not due until March, the Senate report already stresses the need to attract private partners. However, a look at the history of PPPs in the education sector reveals a mixed track record. Despite a tuition fee of $10,000 per semester, the campus of Great Northern Way incurred “significant annual operating losses” over the last five years. A global study in 2007 on the effectiveness of PPPs revealed that, while they have been successful in the transportation sector, the effectiveness of such projects in education are less clear.
With a focus on fostering innovation in information and science technology, the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto is similar to the QI. While it is not affiliated with any university, the project was also based on a PPP model. But the Discovery District has had issues with financial accountability. The senior executives at MaRS are some of the highest paid in the Ontario public sector, and the contribution of the private sector has been negligible.
In Montreal, plans for an expansion by l’Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) ended in failure. Two of its construction projects, the Pierre Dansereau Building and the Ilot Project, brought the university close to bankruptcy. The Ilot was built through a PPP with Busac Real Estate, a subsidiary of a U.S company. It went $106 million over budget.
While it is still unclear what role the city of Montreal will play in the project, similar bids in the United States were usually funded by significant contributions from the city. In New York City, for example, a proposal by Cornell University to build a new campus on Roosevelt Island is being partly financed by more than $100 million from the City.

President Harman discusses Frosh, political stances, and an upcoming referendum 
Vanessa Harman, president of the Education Undergraduate Society (EdUS), leads one of the smallest faculties at McGill. Education has only 1,600 students, including those in Kinesiology and Physical Education. According to Harman, her role as president is an “overarching” duty by virtue of the uniqueness of the program.
“[The President’s role] is essentially to act as a spokesperson for the undergraduates and to represent the student views and concerns in the faculty council and in the department meetings,” said Harman.
Harman, a U4 Secondary English student, was motivated to become the faculty association president after experience as VP Academic and U2 Secondary Representative.
“That really inspired me to want to take it to the next level, and be able to really be a leader in my faculty,” said Harman.
The primary mission of the EdUS this year, under Harman’s leadership, is to engage its students and get them more involved with the community.
“The main headspace of the previous years has been one of being more distant from the rest of the campus physically. We are far away from main campus and also the fact that we have placements every year – and every [class] goes out on placement at different times – makes for a very disjointed student body,” said Harman.
According to Harman, because of the nature of the co-op program, the EdUS has not taken a “specific stance” on prominent political issues this year, including the potential general strike against Quebec tuition increases.
“It is difficult for Education students to see their place in getting involved with political decisions,” Harman said.
“We are hosting a Town Hall next Thursday, to get our students talking about these issues,” she added.
Harman explained that she “doesn’t necessarily see the EdUS moving to strike.”
She explained that the nature of the Education program is such that “we can’t really just not go and teach the students.”
Earlier this year, a conflict arose between the EdUS and Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) after the latter increased the fees for Education students who wanted to participate in Arts Frosh.
Harman explained that the conflict between the EdUS and the AUS did not escalate.
“We haven’t had any issues following what happened with Frosh,” she said.
Following these difficulties and student demand, EdUS formed a subcommittee to work on planning an EdUS Frosh.
“We have felt for a few years that it’s important that we have our own Frosh, so we are very excited to plan that for our students,” said Harman. She said EdUS’s Frosh would be implemented in fall 2012.
Harman said that, this year, EdUS has been able to offer more events and resources for students than in past years.
“We brought in someone to do a workshop about teaching children with autism, but that is just one example among others. It is just kind of refreshing for the faculty just because we haven’t seen a whole lot of student engagement in the past,” said Harman.
Harman said she plans to spend the remainder of her term trying to amend the entrance requirements for the program. EdUS is also trying to revamp career advising services to have “substantial and meaningful” services for Education students.
“We just finished the process of writing a referendum question to be voted [on] in the upcoming elections to implement a student fee for our career advisor and our career advising services. We will be submitting that referendum question and hopefully implementing this $25 per semester student fee,” said Harman.

Sixth floor occupiers: “Our demands haven’t been met.” 
CKUT has an agreement in principle with the McGill administration recognizing the existence portion of their controversial fall 2011 referendum question. They will submit a new question for the winter referendum period asking that their fee become non-opt-outable.
The announcement comes as a student occupation of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson’s office – demanding, in part, that the administration recognize the results of both CKUT and QPIRG’s fall referenda – enters its third day.
The sixth floor “partyers” are also demanding Mendelson’s resignation.
Caitlin Manicom, funding and outreach coordinator for CKUT, confirmed that the campus radio station has reached an agreement in principle with the administration.
“[The administration] will not be recognizing, as it stands right now, the validity of the question in its entirety. We’re currently negotiating for existence to be recognized, and those negotiations are ongoing,” said Manicom.
“We won’t be releasing further information until the occupation is settled, and hopefully the students’ demands will be met,” she continued.
Manicom said that CKUT had been negotiating the agreement before the occupation started, and that they had no idea the occupation was going to take place. As a result, Manicom said, “There are a lot of different factors at play.”
Manicom said that the station informed the students on the sixth floor of the agreement in the interest of transparency.
“We wanted to be as transparent as possible to the people who are occupying, without jeopardizing their occupation and their demands,” she said.
“The reason that we were discussing getting the administration to – at the very least – acknowledge existence, was because that was the basic requirement that we need from them to negotiate our MoA [Memorandum of Agreement],” she continued.
The agreement would allow CKUT to negotiate and sign its MoA with McGill, while simultaneously trying to implement an alternative to the current online opt-out system that has resulted in increasingly lower revenue from student fees since the administration implemented the system in 2007.
Manicom spoke to what would happen to CKUT if they don’t change the opt-out system.
“That would leave us in the position that we’ve been in for the last few years, which is struggling to find financial stability, struggling to run a radio station when the costs of running a radio station increase every year, and we continue to lose increasing amounts of finances from the opt-outs,” she said.
In an email to all McGill staff and students on Wednesday, Provost Anthony Masi described the history and the administration’s rationale behind online opt-outs.
“In consultation with students, an easy-to-use on-line system was introduced for opting out of voluntary fees,” read the email. “We believe this process is more convenient for students.”
Masi’s email added that, “individual student groups do not have the right to change an opt-out system to a method less convenient for all students.”
The James Administration occupiers are demanding that the CKUT student fee be only opt-outable through CKUT, which was the request of CKUT’s fall referendum question, invalidated by the administration a month ago.
One of the sixth floor occupiers said that the recent agreement in principle is “something that CKUT was forced into.”
“That’s something that emerged in a coercive process, in which McGill held all the cards and could force an organization that should be autonomous to do what it wants,” he said.
“Clearly it’s in the direction of our demands, but our demands are the complete recognition of both the CKUT and QPIRG referenda results, and so until that happens, our demands haven’t been met,” the student continued.

Councillors: Students protesting tuition hikes not representative of engineering student body
The Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) Council met last Monday to discuss impending tuition hikes, as well as the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students’s (CFES) annual congress.
Discussion centered on how students protesting against tuition increases do not properly represent the engineering student body. Ethan Landy, president of the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Society, noted that the views of most engineering students are not being heard.
“Radical action is not the best representation of students,” said Landy. “I don’t think most engineering students are against tuition hikes.”
VP Academic Harold Day agreed with Landy, stating that most engineering students have more pressing concerns. “We have to find a way to make [Principal Heather Munroe-Blum] understand that the majority of students don’t care about the issue,” said Day.
The Arts Undergraduate Society has held two General Assemblies (GAs) as part of mobilizing around tuition hikes. The Science Undergraduate Society also recently announced it would hold a GA on the issue on February 29. President Josh Redel later confirmed with The Daily that the EUS would not be holding a GA.
Redel also announced to council his intention to run for SSMU president this semester.
The meeting also featured a report on the CFES Congress. The CFES, which represents 60,000 engineering students across Canada, holds an annual congress meeting that brings together various Canadian engineering student associations. The CFES held the conference, which ran this year from January 4 to 12, in Whitehorse, Yukon. Redel, EUS VP External Myriam Desranleau, and former EUS President Dan Keresteci attended the conference.
During the Council meeting, Redel, Desranleau, and Keresteci noted some conclusions from the congress that could be applied to improve EUS in the future. Redel observed that schools in the CFES stress integrating engineering logos on their clothes, adding that the EUS needs “more widespread branding.”
“It identifies you as an engineer,” added Keresteci.
Nonetheless, Redel, Desranleau, and Keresteci all agreed that the CFES congress itself could be improved. Notably, Redel stated that the CFES fails to lobby to industries and the government on behalf of engineering students. “[CFES] will never budge on lobbying, because it is not what CFES believes what it is,” said Redel. Currently, lobbying is not included in the mandate of the CFES.
Last year, the EUS co-signed a letter accusing the CFES of mismanagement and questioning its leadership; holding the annual conference in the Yukon was one of the issues the EUS raised at the time, as well as the lack of CFES lobbying.
