Union for Gender Empowerment urges administration to follow suit
The McGill branch of the Solidarity ID Project is trying to catch up with various Concordia-based cooperatives in issuing self-identifying Solidarity IDs. Funded by the Union for Gender Empowerment (UGE), McGill students Julia Wilk and Lydia Ould Brahim have issued the IDs to a hundred students since September.
The McGill branch of the project has had a hard time getting off the ground. Of the four founding members of the ID project at the UGE, only two are still working on it. Wilk told The Daily that both of them are often too busy with other volunteering work to make the IDs.
Wilk urged anyone interested in the project to volunteer, or at least to get an ID themselves.
“If more people were really involved we could go a lot further with the project,” she said.
A photograph is placed next to essential personal information on the Solidarity ID, including name, address, birth date, and choice of gender – though information is optinional in each category. Many people include names other than their legal names, and occasionally “non-normative” gender designations, like “Gender Queer,” or simply gender classifications different than their sex at birth.
The project is thriving, driven by the food cooperative Frigo Vert at Concordia. In September 2008, the co-op decided to design a new membership card and, after coordinating with Concordia’s 2110 Centre for Gender Advocacy, the Solidarity ID Project began.
Frigo Vert’s web site cites the imposition of “patriarchy and white supremacy” on groups like immigrants, indigenous, or transgendered people as the reason for creating an alternative ID. According to Gab Stensson, a staff member of Frigo Vert, the co-op has issued at least 2,000 Solidarity IDs over the past year.
All Frigo Vert members are issued a Solidarity ID. There is no club or organization at McGill that requires its members to have a Solidarity ID.
“It’s been really helpful having a membership base,” said Stensson.
Telyn Kusalik, one of the founding members of the Solidarity Project at McGill, pointed out that in most Canadian provinces it is impossible to get a government-issued photo ID that does not include a male/female gender signifier. Another issue Kusalik saw being addressed by the Solidarity IDs is McGill’s policy of using students’ legal names, and not their chosen names, for everything from dissertations to McGill IDs.
Kusalik acknowledged that McGill’s policy from 2005-2006 shifted to include students’ names of common usage on class lists, alongside their legal names. The problem with the class list policy, Kusalik said, is that “students whose legal name is of a gender other than the gender they appear to be are still ‘outed’ as trans to their teachers, and possibly subject to discrimination by those teachers.”
Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) Morton Mendelson said of the class list issue, “This is the first time I’ve heard that the issue had been brought up again.”
“We have certain legal obligations toward the government in terms of reporting gender,” added Mendelson. “We are obliged to indicate their sex, and the options are male and female.”
In greater Quebec, citizens have to prove that they have lived under a certain name for five years before being able to legally change it.
“I have noticed, in my activism, that it’s often easier to create an alternative to the system than it is to change it,” said Kusalik. “And that’s exactly what the Solidarity ID project is: an alternative to the system of photo IDs that both McGill and the provincial and federal governments are part of.”
Members of Frigo Vert met last year with Concoridia Dean of Students Elizabeth Morey about including the names students commonly use, rather than their legal names, on their student IDs. Morey seemed sympathetic to the initiative, according to Stensson.
At McGill, when asked whether the administration would consider dropping given names in favour of names of common usage, Registrar Kathleen Massey said that that it was “an interesting request.” She added that she “would be open to exploring the idea.”

Speaker addresses memories of both East and West Berlin 20 years after
Stefan Wolle, an East German historian and the current scientific director of the German Democratic Republic Museum in Berlin, spoke at Montreal’s Goethe Institute this Monday in commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. His presentation broached the subject of East and West German relations in what was mainly a narrative meditation on the chronology and symbolism of November 4, 1989.
Wolle was actively involved in the dissolution of the East German Ministry of State Security, commonly known as Stasi, in 1990-91. On the afternoon of the fall however, Wolle was on his way to the cinema, only to find that the Australian film Crocodile Dundee had been replaced by an unprecedented Q&A session with Communist Party members in open dialogue with citizens.
By 11 p.m., all inner city checkpoints were opened, allowing Berliners to stream through the gates. Next came what Wolle called the “great liquidation” – the flow of Western products into the Eastern market, capsizing small businesses. Although two worlds were reunified, memories of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) remain multivalent.
“When people speak with each other, the impression arises that they lived in different worlds. Some remember records for five pennies, the good kindergartens, and the nice rugged evenings in the workers’ collectives. Others point out the deaths on the Wall, the political verdicts, and the corruption of the political leaders,” said Wolle.
Wolle eased into his native German as he took questions from the audience. The first question addressed the wish shared by many in East Germany who would rather have seen socialism amended than hurtle into capitalism.
“I myself was one those enthusiasts of the Prague Spring model of 1968 – of the synthesis of socialism and freedom – and bade farewell to these ideas as just an illusion. At that point, socialism was overrun by the sheer need to exceed quickly to freedom,” Wolle said.
He added that the economic and personal aftermath has been difficult for those in the former GDR. In the nineties, many felt that the reunification was not liberation but rather a devaluation of their own biography and a loss of their professional position in life. Although business and employment has increased, some still feel cheated or “torn from the past.”
Katy Geissler, a German teacher who is involved with the Goethe Institute in Montreal, was an 18-year-old living in Leipzig, East Germany when the Wall fell.
“[Wolle] was always looking for both sides – he was truly between two chairs. You cannot say that everything is better or not better. Many things were changed for the better, but many things were also lost,” Geissler said.
Jerzy Adamuszek, a Polish writer who was living in West Berlin, recalled the difficulty of crossing into East Berlin. At times he was told to undress at the checkpoints, or would have flyers removed from his vehicle by guards.
Adamuszek was also one of a small contingent of audience members who questioned why Wolle placed so much emphasis on the role of the Berlin Wall, and were discontent with how the narrative of the Wall has come to eclipse the wider history of Eastern Europe, and other independence movements.
“[Wolle] didn’t mention Jean Paul II, Reagan, or Polish Solidarity. If you want to talk about the fall of the Wall, you have to talk about historical background,” Adamuszek said.
Wolle agreed that the collapse of the Wall should not overshadow other events.“The whole process wouldn’t have been possible without countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland and Hungary. There are always some clever people who say it was all done from the outside, but wouldn’t have been possible without people starting revolution from the inside,” Wolle said, especially in reference to questions about the role of Mikhail Gorbachev in German reunification.
Raymond St-Pierre, a Radio-Canada journalist who was present on the day of the fall moderated the discussion. He commented on how the media has shaped the retelling of the day.
“There were tens of thousands of stories in those streets. You could hand the microphone to anybody – and it was a positive story,” St-Pierre said. “TV likes a good picture – and try to beat that. For us it was a dreamland.”
Wolle also acknowledged the irresistibly strong symbol of the Wall.
“The media finds it difficult to put things back in perspective, but this is the task of the historian,” he said.

Sovereigntists disrupt Prince Charles’s state visit
Prince Charles’s visit to Montreal Tuesday was met with anger by Quebec sovereignty activists, who said they had no intention of letting “monarchist passéisme [traditionalism] invade [Montreal] with impunity.”
By 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, several hundred protesters had assembled on the sidewalk across from the Black Watch armoury, where the royal couple was expected. Under Quebec, Acadian, and even French flags, sovereignty activists chanted slogans denouncing the monarchy, Ottawa, and the Quebec premier, Jean Charest.
The guests entered the armoury of Montreal’s oldest Scottish regiment, wearing poppies on their lapels. Many of the visitors seemed confused by the protest, but chose not to comment. Michel Boire, a Black Watch veteran who served for 43 years, was the master of ceremonies and conciliator for the evening.
“Our soldiers in Afghanistan are fighting to preserve these protesters’ liberty of expression. They’re my fellow citizens and I’m happy they can express their opinions. That’s democracy,” Boire said.
Asked about the appropriateness of a foreign prince being welcomed like a military leader, Boire pointed out that Charles is the Canadian regiment’s colonel-in-chief.
“Don’t forget that his mother is our head of state,” he added.
On the other side of the street, spirits were heated. Some wanted to pick a fight. Word spread quickly that, “at 5 p.m., we’re crossing.” Three to four hundred protestors eventually moved as a block to take Bleury, which was soon closed to traffic.
The prince was expected shortly after 5 p.m., but the mass of protesters blocked his arrival. When an officer of the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal tried to address the crowd, the crowd’s boos stifled his voice. Protestors threw eggs and other projectiles forcing the officer to take refuge inside the armoury.
It soon became clear that the anti-riot squad were coming. The protesters, more determined than before to demand “democracy for Quebec,” energetically proclaimed, “le Québec, un pays.”
Despite the arrival of the anti-riot squad, the protesters sat down in the middle of the street. One of the leaders told the press, “We’ve folded too much already; we’ll move no more!”
After the police had arrested three people, the crowd was pushed back 200 metres to permit Prince Charles’s arrival, through a concealed door, 45 minutes late.
When asked about their demands, the protesters first evoked their “disgust for a foreign, imperialist monarchy that has nothing to do in this country.”
Responding to the idea that the royal couple are only symbolic, Patrick Bourgeois, president of the Réseau de resistance du Québec (RRQ) and senior editor at the sovereigntist paper Le Québécois, said, megaphone in hand, “In national liberation struggles, symbols are fundamental.”
One of those symbols, according to protesters, is the 1775 deportation of 12,500 Acadians by the British government, which left between 7,500 and 9,000 Acadians dead. This event is called “le Grand Dérangement” by Acadians.
“Those people have blood on their hands,” said Michelle, a woman in her sixties, who, like others, was incensed by the monarchy’s refusal to apologize.
Suzanne Morton, a specialist in Canadian history at McGill, confirmed that even if they’re very difficult to quantify, these figures correspond to those generally agreed upon by historians. She pointed out, however, that a 2003 royal proclamation recognized the Crown’s errors.
The other most commonly heard grievance Tuesday was the “theft of the 1995 referendum.” Allegations of fraud surrounded the vote, but Morton said, “Investigations took place. The debate is over.”
Some protests commented that the event was a success because it allowed the RRQ and other sovereigntist groups to measure the level of mobilization. They felt this will be important  as the battle against Law 104, on the presence of English in Quebec, begins to intensify.

SPHR-McGill discussion explores options for peace
Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR-McGill) held a panel discussion Tuesday called Israel & Palestine: The Next Step. The panelists included McGill political science professor Rex Brynen, Concordia political science professor Eric Abitbol, and Professor Jim Joyce of John Abbott College. The three professors discussed a variety of obstacles to peace – including ongoing settlement expansion, Israeli monopolization of West Bank water aquifers, and increasing religious fanaticism on both sides of the conflict. The Daily sat down with Abitbol, who specializes in peace studies and global governance, and Joyce, who is also Amnesty International Canada’s Coordinator for Israel and Palestine, to discuss the way forward for both nations.
—————————————-
Interview with Eric Abtibol, Concordia political science professor
McGill Daily: During yesterday’s panel discussion, you mentioned the idea of a conflict ethos existing in Israeli and Palestinian society. What exactly is a conflict ethos in this context?
Eric Abitbol: I would define it as an attachment to a particular interpretation of the conflict, and to a sense of victimization. It is a need for a strong sense of self-sufficiency, unity, and emancipation rooted in exclusivity and collective security, and a sense of delegitimization of the other.
MD: How can Israelis and Palestinians get past this mentality?
EA: By creating relational spaces with one another, in ideology and in practice, that reflect the desire to cultivate cross-boundary relationships, and by constructing, on the level of the imaginaire, a picture of future peace in the region.
MD: What are some of the organizations involved in this process, and what is their potential?
EA: I am particularly inspired by three of these organizations…. These three, specifically, are Friends of the Earth Middle East, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, and the Israel-Palestine Centre for Research and Information.
These organizations, and others like them, situate their efforts on a trans-boundary level. They contribute to constructing a trans-boundary base of knowledge. They work at a grassroots level, and deal with eco-political sustainability as well as peace education. They engage in a relationship of advocacy and lobbying, and do a great deal of intra-civil society work.
They reflect very much the discourse of cultivating a political agenda with the “other” instead of in opposition to the “other,” and as such it can be argued that they are in the process of contributing to the development of a trans-boundary community, incorporating Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians, and others in the region and worldwide. These organizations are doing some of the grassroots and multi-sectoral work that encompasses slowly building a security community.
MD: In what ways can this culture of dialogue enter the mainstream of Israeli and Palestinian civil society and government?
EA: There are many obstacles to making this an effective political movement. In a sense, we can begin by imagining how we may dismantle these obstacles…. There is a lack of inclusive regional civil space. Regional and international funders must attempt to build this.
Other obstacles include separatist visions of peace, militant terrorist attacks, and continued settlement activities.
The issue of leadership in civil society is very important. There are grassroots leaders who are taking risks and trying to facilitate dialogical encounters. We need this leadership to expand to encompass inter-generational work in the spirit of this culture. As well, these trans-boundary communities need to lobby the government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas in order to eliminate specific obstacles.
The transformation of the attitudes and imagination of a society takes place through risk-taking. Individuals need to recognize their participation in political culture, and take the risks of encountering the other, without simply accepting societal frameworks of how to relate to the other, and do this in places that are both comfortable and uncomfortable. People need to set the table for dialogue, and take place in encounters where the table is set by the other, as well. If we can begin to do this, we can begin to transgress some of the material and ideological objects that prevent a culture of dialogue. This culture has the capacity to influence and shape dominant political relationships.

Interview with Jim Joyce, John Abbott College professor and Amnesty International expert
McGill Daily: During the SPHR panel discussion you mentioned the possibility of a “shared Jerusalem” and a more dynamic version of a two-state solution. Can you elaborate?
Jim Joyce: While Amnesty International as a organization will not express views about what are desirable political outcomes, it will continue to comment about such outcomes inasmuch as they are consistent or not with the human rights agenda. The human rights of one individual cannot be founded on the loss of rights of another individual. In the conflict over the final status of Jerusalem, partisans on both sides make maximum claims to the city, exclusive of the other.  Within proposed two-state solutions, there is the assumption of a divided city, perhaps enshrining the green line between West and East Jerusalem.  A third – or fourth – proposal would return to the original conception within UN Resolution 181 of a “shared” city, an international city, open to the citizens of both Israel and Palestine.
MD: Do you think it is more important to be critical of the injustices committed by Hamas and the Israeli government, or to push forward with a purely “relational” approach, as recommended by Eric Abitol?
JJ: Amnesty International, basing its work on a commitment to international human rights standards, understands that Israelis and Palestinians themselves must define and develop the human rights principles that will provide a just and durable foundation for peace.  To account for past human rights violations should be part of the same process. The cycle of violence of the past decades has permitted both sides to justify their next act of violence as a legitimate response to the act of violence of the other side. The Goldstone Report, by calling for both the Government of Israel and the Hamas de facto administration in Gaza to undertake credible, impartial investigations of the possible war crimes committed in Gaza and southern Israel from December 2008 to January 2009, is an important step forward in ending the impunity which has so long fed the cycle of violence.  Peace based upon justice would be served, not hindered, by such a process.
MD: The panel discussions did not touch on the influence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the wider Middle East region. What impact do you think the currently stalled negotiations will have on other countries in the area?
JJ: The State of Israel is not currently recognized by most countries in the region.  Its borders with Lebanon and Syria are not mutually agreed upon.  The territorial integrity of a possible Palestinian state is not determined. In the Madrid Process of the early nineties, the rights of Palestinian refugees were part of the discussion as well as the bilateral relations between countries – Lebanon-Israel, Syria-Israel, as well as the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.  In all subsequent bilateral Palestinian-Israeli talks, the concerns about Palestinian refugees have been pushed to the side, and no agreement has been reached.  Canada undertook within the Madrid Process responsibility for guiding possible outcomes on the refugee issue – and made considerable progress on possible mechanisms.  This work was put on the back burner when the Oslo Process became the only game in town.  Oh yes, the Israelis and Jordanians did achieve mutual recognition after the Madrid Process.  The ongoing “peace process” between Israelis and Palestinians will continue to flounder until it is located in a truly and fully regional context.
