Government undermines Indigenous sovereignty, says Mexican activist
Updated October 7.
Zacualpan is a community of mostly Nahua people in the state of Colima, Mexico. In Fall 2013, members of the community approached the organization Bios Iguana, a non-governmental organization, to help them decide whether or not to declare their community mining-free (a common practice for communities seeking to keep mining companies out) after they had been approached by Gabfer, S.A. de C.V., a mining company seeking a concession for the exploitation of gold, silver, copper, and manganese in the area.
Rural communities in Mexico contact environmental groups like Red Mexicana de Afectadas por la Minería (REMA), and Movimiento Mesoamericano contra el Modelo extractivo Minero (M4), of which Bios Iguana is part, once a North American mining company expresses interest in the area. These groups then work together with the scientific, journalistic, and local authorities to educate the population on the risks of allowing mining operations to happen in their communities. Many of these rural communities are Indigenous communities with a history of abuse from multinational extractive companies and the government of Mexico. People working with Bios Iguana have recently received many threats from individuals linked to the  Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), which was formed by people who split from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1988.
The Daily spoke with Esperanza Salazar, a member of Bios Iguana who has been forced out of her community and country by repeated threats against her life.
The McGill Daily (MD): Could you tell me a bit about yourself and what brought you to Canada?
Esperanza Salazar (ES): I am here because I had to leave my community and my nation. I am Esperanza Salazar, and I belong to an organization called Bios Iguana. We work in the province of Colima, Mexico, which is the [fourth] smallest province in Mexico. In Colima, two years ago, a community [Zacualpan] approached us to solicit our help, because a Canadian [mining company] showed interest in mining gold in their territory. The concession that they sought was for gold, silver, copper and manganese. [The people] had a few assemblies to vote on these issues.
[…] In [these] communal assemblies, they decide what to do when things are happening to the land. […] There had been assemblies where mining operations had been proposed and the community had said no. [Usually] the presidente de bienes comunales [elected executive official of the Indigenous community, who was Carlos Guzmán in Zacualpan] is supposed to bring this decision to those concerned and say, ‘No, this community does not want a mine here, please stop the project.’
However, [Guzmán] kept insisting. […] He was giving money to people in the community to vote in favour of the mine. The people of the community came to us and asked for our support so that we could come and explain the risks involved with a natural resources project like this.
“I want the Canadian government to know that they have a major role in the violence in Mexico.”
We did some video screenings. Within a few days of arriving in Zacualpan, we showed videos and photos of the damage caused by the mine at Carrizalillo in Guerrero. [Guzmán], immediately told us, “I do not want you here in our community. You are not welcome; you have come only to misinform the people.” The public garden where we were showing our videos was where the attacks began.
Later, we continued doing meetings with the people, giving more information and one day we were […] preparing to present a video about the mining in Central America, Latin America, [and] one of our comrades was illegally detained.
Salazar also explained that Bios Iguana faced many more direct threats. At one point, they decided to hold an event, where they brought scientists, journalists, and members of communities affected by the actions of mining companies. The event was sparsely attended, because, as Salazar found out later, there was a bomb threat that their opponents employed in order to prevent people from hearing what they had to say. Eventually, Salazar explained, Guzmán was removed from his position, but the two women who replaced him, according to Salazar, were not able to fully do their jobs due to government intervention.
MD: Two years ago, REMA began to work on a new legislation in the Mexican parliament that would prohibit open-pit mining, as has been passed in Costa Rica. I would like to know if these efforts have been successful, or if not, how has the process been so far.
ES: In fact, REMA has left the legal process because there was a manipulation of the participation of the social organizations within the Senate of the Republic [national senate], where this proposal was presented. First, we, the many organizations that make up REMA, worked on the proposal. […] Well, [the Senate] got the proposal, but it wasn’t the one that we had worked on. And after this, we said that it is not acceptable to put forward a proposal that isn’t ours. If the proposal they receive is not the work of the communities and the organizations, we cannot sign it and we cannot be a part of this process.
Without consulting us, [PRD] put this proposal to the Senate as a part of the Party’s political project. And we, the social organizations, including Bios Iguana and other people that are inside the REMA, we are not part of any political party. And we do not support any political party. And we support even less those political parties that use our work and the work of the people to make a power move. […] This same party, on the same day, put forth its own proposal to a different deputy, a different senator, but from the same party. This new proposal was actually in favour of the mining companies.
We realized that there was manipulation and a political game that we did not want to engage in, and we retreated. From then on, REMA and Bios Iguana decided that our time would be best spent working on prevention within the communities instead of the courts.
MD: Canada keeps a list of countries that it recommends Canadians avoid travelling in – Mexico is not on this list. There are regional advisories against travel in the northern states, but the whole country remains ‘safe’ for Canadians. What are your thoughts on this?
ES: I want the Canadian government to know that they have a major role in the violence in Mexico. This violence toward rural communities is a consequence of the entry of Canadian mining companies and is fomented by the companies’ disrespect for the people attempting to defend their territory.
There are two kinds of violence to consider here. There is physical violence which spills into the streets, which is often tied to organized crime. The Mexican government responds to it with more violence, sending the military and police into the streets to fight it. They tell the people they are ‘defending’ them, when in reality they are bringing terror directly to the people living in these communities. This campaign of terrorism against social organizations like Bios Iguana is a specific example of [state-sponsored] physical violence.
The title of this article has been changed from “Esperanza in Canada” to “Nahua community in Mexico resists Canadian mining.”
A previous version of this article referred to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as the political party that has been threatening Bios Iguana. In fact, this party has been the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). The Daily regrets the error.

#ConsentMcGill just the first piece in the puzzle
September 28 marked the beginning of #ConsentMcGill, a one-week campaign aimed at promoting consent throughout the McGill community. Among the many events on the agenda were a research symposium with various talks concerning consent, cyberviolence, love, and communication, a film screening of Flirting with Danger accompanied by a panel discussion, and an array of workshops addressing consent, sexual violence, and power dynamics.
“Our goal this year was to reach a group of people who would otherwise not get involved,” said McGill Liaison Officer (Harm Reduction) and main organizer of the event Bianca Tétrault, in an interview with The Daily.
According to Tétrault, who cited statistical research, about a third of the McGill student body does not engage in sexual activity, as such the promotion of consent in its broadest terms helps to reach out to a greater number of students. Also, the campaign had a presence both on the downtown and MacDonald campuses to ensure maximum outreach, and events such as the research symposium at the downtown campus were live-streamed at the MacDonald Campus.
Although #ConsentMcGill is only in its second year, its visibility has increased since its launch. Tétrault estimates that the Facebook group and its related events were viewed by three to four times more people than last year. The increased amount of student groups reaching out to the campaign results in more events being added to the agenda, and greater visibility of the campaign.
“Sexual violence is prevalent on college and university campuses. […] We can’t stay silent about it any longer.”
“It truly shocks me how complicated people make this idea of consent to be. […] It’s such a basic concept to grasp. Although there are obviously many different interpretations of this word, for me, consent is an active, sober, and verbal ‘yes,’ not the absence of a ‘no,’” said U0 student Dania Chatila.
U1 student Chelsea Oki-Gillan was enthusiastic about the events on the campaign’s agenda. She was especially interested in the “Trivia Night @ Gert’s” event because “it makes [consent] fun to learn about.” She also pointed out the importance of learning about consent at school by explaining that the first time she was introduced to a concrete definition of consent was in a high school sex education class.
According to Tétrault, the importance of the #ConsentMcGill campaign is twofold. Its first purpose is to help create meaningful conversations regarding consent. “When we come to university, we’re met with a whole bunch of new people, creating new relationships. People are coming from all over […] so how do we create a conversation where people are all on the same page as to what is a respectful, healthy relationship?”
At the same time, the campaign aims to reduce sexual violence and its traumatizing effects by creating a safe(r) space where students can discuss the issue, as well as their personal experiences. “Sexual violence is prevalent on college and university campuses. […] We can’t stay silent about it any longer.”c
However, Tétrault explains that the #ConsentMcGill campaign, being a discussion platform, is only one part of a larger vision. Other events are run throughout the year and Tétrault hopes #ConsentMcGill can increase their visibility. According to Tétrault, another event, Alcohol 2.0, is in the early stages of planning and should be launched in the coming years. Its goals will be to address the link between alcohol and consent, as well as create clear boundaries for students to follow.
The main area that Tétrault is aiming to augment in upcoming years is support. However, she is also open to other ideas. Tétrault explained that “instead of a top-down approach, [we’re] really working with the student body to see what they want, keeping in mind that this is just a platform for conversation.”

Protestors march in support of teacher strike
Around 15 McGill and Concordia students congregated at the Roddick Gates on September 30 to stand in solidarity with Quebec’s French-language teachers who are striking to protest the state of negotiations with the provincial government. The one-day strike was organized by the Fédération autonome de l’enseignement (FAE), which represents approximately 34,000 French-language teachers.
While many teachers voted to strike, some are also opting to work 32-hour weeks, with no extracurricular activities. Approximately 275,000 students were affected by the strike.
Demonstrators carried flags from their respective unions and banners with phrases such as “Your decision affects my future,” and “The government is abandoning public schools.” FAE President Sylvain Mallette also made a speech at the demonstration.
“We will not lower our eyes. We will not bend our backs. We will protect public schools.”
The crowd marched from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m., beating drums, and blowing on whistles and horns, and singing chants such as “We will not lower our eyes. We will not bend our backs. We will protect public schools.” The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) was also present at the strike and escorted the marchers.
Protesters aimed to pressure the government to renew the teachers’ collective bargaining agreement, but many demonstrators also attended to take a stand against austerity more broadly. Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP External and organizer of the McGill-Concordia contingent Emily Boytinck said, “Austerity isn’t something that we talk about a lot at McGill, and these demonstrations show the real impact of austerity and where it’s really hitting – it’s very much hitting primary education. With the new legislation, teachers can’t work longer than certain hours per week, extracurricular activities are cut, and class sizes are becoming larger and larger.”
Martin Bibeau, a member of the Alliance des professeures et professeurs de Montréal, told The Daily that the budget cuts compromise the quality of education in order to fulfill other government agendas.
“The government actually de-invested in public schools, cut the taxes, raised the number of students in classrooms, and removed services for students with difficulties. […] We are no longer able to educate the children and instruct them, and to offer a quality public school. Actually, for the government, their priority is austerity and to arrive at a deficit of zero. They want to do that at all costs, and by compromising and sacrificing [the] future of our youth,” said Bibeau. The new government proposals include increasing the work week from 32 to 35 hours, as well as increasing class sizes.
“The government has made it very clear that it doesn’t take education seriously. Teachers do.”
Marie-France Lacombe, a teacher and member of FAE said, “The government wants to give us more students in class, they want to cut our payment […] and they want us to do more hours by week. They don’t give us the support to help students. […] But we can’t do everything. […] We are there to teach them, but when we have every kind of struggle, we can’t teach.”
Jonathan Turcotte Summers, a Concordia Masters student in educational studies, voiced students’ concerns about the Quebec government’s position on education. “The government has made it very clear that it doesn’t take education seriously. Teachers do. Unfortunately, teachers are in a position where they have to take increasingly drastic measures, but that’s the position that the government has put them in,” said Summers.
Summers further noted that the impacts of austerity measures are not confined to education, but extend to other social programs as well. “The government is cutting from education, cutting from healthcare, cutting from all these public services that people really depend on. Especially low income people who are in difficult positions.”
“Ultimately, teachers working conditions are students learning conditions, so students [standing in solidarity with teachers] are acting in the best interest of not only themselves but [other] students and parents. I think the student role is to forge alliances, to show solidarity, and forge relationships because all of these struggles are interrelated,” commented Summers. “We may not see it because we focus on our individual struggles, but we need to form ties between teachers and students and workers and the unemployed […] and realize that it’s one big struggle and that we need to work together on this.”
Carlotta Esposito, a U0 Arts student attending the strike, emphasized the importance of student support. “I think as youth, we have a lot of voice. I think we have more voice than we realize, especially in the era that we’re living in. […] Teachers are striking, risking their jobs for us, so I think students can really make a change with this, whether it’s a big change or a little change, it’s worth a shot,” said Esposito.

New deal does not include increased hours
On September 30, McGill teaching assistants (TAs) ratified a collective bargaining offer from McGill at a General Assembly (GA) of AGSEM, McGill’s union for TAs and invigilators. The offer was ratified by a vote of 172 to 101. The proposal will improve TAs’ harassment protections and grievance procedures, while also increasing their wages by a total of 9 per cent until the agreement’s expiration in 2018.
Since the termination of the last contract in June 2014, the two sides have been meeting to negotiate a new agreement. At the GA, several students recognized the advances that both McGill and AGSEM have made since they opened deliberations in August 2014.
“The last time we had this meeting, we were concerned about McGill’s unwillingness to negotiate,” said an AGSEM member during the debate. “But there are a lot more changes here than I expected us to get based on the University’s position and our demands, and this is a substantial list of demands,” they added. Harassment protections and wages adjusted for inflation were just two of the breakthroughs the TA mentioned.
Reaching an agreement, however, was not without its roadblocks. In response to these obstcles, on April 16, the first day of the exam period, the TAs went on strike. Additionally, some invigilators respected the picket lines and opted not to cross them.
AGSEM President Justin Irwin stated that the strike was galvanized by McGill’s refusal to index the TAs’ hours. “We had a proposal that would effectively establish a ratio of the number of students enrolled and the hours available for TA-ships, […] but McGill was not amenable to that language,” Irwin said.
“We had a proposal that would effectively establish a ratio of the number of students enrolled and the hours available for TA-ships, […] but McGill was not amenable to that language.”
In May, following the strike, McGill and AGSEM convened twice. Unable to resolve their disagreements, the two parties agreed to suspend talks for the summer and reopen discussion in September.
On September 1, McGill proposed its final offer, which ignored AGSEM’s demand for a revision of the TAs’ hours.
AGSEM Bargaining Committee Chair Giulia Alberini clarified that over the past few years, TAs’ weekly hours have remained largely unchanged despite a steady increase in yearly undergraduate enrolment. Throughout the negotiations, AGSEM lobbied on behalf of the TAs for several iterations of language that would address the TAs’ work-rate demands.
One proposal suggested that for every 50 students, a TA would work 90 hours. In this way, the agreement would compensate for the increased hours each TA would have to work given the increased pool of students. Nonetheless, Alberini stated at the GA, “McGill did not want to talk about any of these issues.”
TAs grievances about the agreement were diverse. One TA explained that the proposed wage offer would not be sufficient to cover the cost of living without an increase in the number of paid hours. “For many of us, a TAship is the difference between making rent or not,” he began. “Last year, there were a bunch of TA-ships that were 80 hours, and now they are 16.”
“Having only 110 hours for 103 students, I was, at one point, having to spend just three minutes for every paper so I would not go over my hours.”
Many who spoke at the debate argued that insufficient ratios of TA hours to students in a course meant a decline in the quality of the class experience. They contended that this was as much an undergraduate student issue as it was a graduate student one. One TA added that her students wished that she had more time to work with them individually.
A TA from the Faculty of Music said, “Having only 110 hours for 103 students, I was, at one point, having to spend just three minutes for every paper so I would not go over my hours. I came here not only to do my PhD, but because I want to teach at a university level – and I want to be able to do that job properly. So when I have a limited number of hours to do that job and little face time [with students], it doesn’t give me the experience that I need.”
TA reactions to the ratification of the agreement were largely mixed. Many TAs left the assembly happy and relieved that they would not have to “go through the legalities of another strike.”
Others, however, felt differently. Mona Luxion, a TA in international development studies, a PhD candidate in urban planning, and a former Daily columnist, expressed dismay at what they called a “surprising outcome.”
“I don’t think that the vote was representative of what I have heard at previous general assemblies,” they said. “Namely, that many of us actually were preoccupied with and concerned about the dwindling hours we were getting. I feel like what we can infer from these results is that many of us feel disempowered, and more importantly, cowed by McGill’s unpredictability and uncompromising nature.”
