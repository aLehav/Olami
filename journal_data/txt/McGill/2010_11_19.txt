Three speakers discuss the changing role of universities
On Wednesday, Free Education Montreal and Concordia’s Arts and Science Federation of Associations hosted three speakers who discussed the new role of the university in the knowledge economy. The speakers included Martin Robert from the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), Roddy Doucet, Advocacy Manager of Concordia’s Graduate Students Association (GSA), and David Bernans, author and former Concordia assistant professor.
Speakers discussed how Quebec universities’ funding structure has become more reliant on tuition fees and private sponsorship than on government funding. Robert said that “tuition fees are increasing, with the possibility of Quebec tuition fees reaching the national average.” He went on to say that the increase would impact post-secondary accessibility in that it may “prevent 22,000 people in Quebec from going to university.”
In an interview with The Daily, Robert discussed the effects of shifting funding sources.
“The logic of a corporation is different to that of a public service … A corporation’s first goal is to make profit while a public service is to make people healthier and more educated,” he said.
GSA’s Doucet discussed how the new funding structure has impacted the student experience. “[The] physical structures of universities are changing in terms of building new buildings that cost a lot but don’t apply to a great number of people in terms of student body,” he said. “Universities see public space as wasted space in terms of revenues … post-secondary institutions’ general goal is to make sure that all space on campus is used for profit creation.”
Doucet added that the “role of university is to create new labourers to serve the universities’ private partners  …  Universities encourage graduates to enter the workforce through the heavy amount of debt that people graduate with.”
Bernans, the keynote speaker, addressed how corporatizaton is affecting Concordia. He said that “there is an ongoing battle between those who want to make Concordia work for private [interests] and those who want to make it work for public interests.”
Some university administrators differ sharply from the assessments of Wednesday’s speakers.
In the November 11 issue of The Daily, McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum was quoted as saying  in French to a Délit reporter, “I’m not afraid of businesses, of corporations … I don’t think there’s a corporatization of universities, not at all.”
“There is room for us to have a much more productive relationship with the private sector,” she added.
The issue of private involvement in post-secondary education has also been discussed at McGill. In a recent lecture, Rachel Kiddell-Monroe, who co-teaches a course in McGill’s International Development department and is president of Universities Allied for Essential Medecines (UAEM), talked about how pharmaceutical companies dictate university research.
Kiddell-Monroe described an incident with UAEM in 2001, in which the NGO Médécins sans frontières (MSF) wanted to gain access to a cheap generic version of the drug d4T for treating HIV/AIDS in Africa. MSF asked Yale University for a patent to produce these cheap drugs. Yale refused because of a $40-million patent license that the university had with the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Meyers Squibb. UAEM stepped in, and later in 2001 Yale agreed to consult with the pharmaceutical company and let the cheaper generics be produced.

Senators pose questions and receive canned responses
At senate last Wednesday, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum announced that she had met with the board of the organization representing Quebec’s university bosses – or CREPUQ – the previous day to consolidate the message she would be bringing to the Rencontres des partenaires de l’éducation.
One-hundred-thirty to one-hundred-forty groups and individuals will participate in the day-long Rencontres, an annual education policy meeting, on December 6. Thirty people will sit at a special table to deliberate on three key themes: accessibility, performance and funding.
The four major student lobbying groups, various trade union representatives, several private sector representatives, and three MNAs from the provincial opposition parties – Parti  Quebecois, Action démocratique du Québec, and Québec Solidaire – will be in attendance. (See Page 5)
Munroe-Blum will bring two colleagues from other universities with her and stressed that she will not be there to represent McGill’s point of view.
“We will not be there as individuals or representing individual institutions – we will be there to represent the CREPUQ framework,” she told Senate.
CREPUQ’s position is premised on their assertion that the Quebec university system is underfunded and falling behind the rest of Canada. According to Munroe-Blum, Quebec is “dramatically behind on high school graduation rates and dramatically behind university participation and degree completion rates.”
 A report released last week by the Fédération étudiante universitaire de Québec (FEUQ) found that nearly fifty per cent of full-time undergraduates abandoned or interrupted their studies for financial reasons. (See page 5)
The CREPUQ position thus far has been increasing tuition rates “while maintaining a strong commitment to accessibility,” in Munroe-Blum’s words.
“It would be a complete miss if all groups didn’t come together on a common front,” she said. The administration has been “working with student groups over the last week to see if we can’t get a common message,” Munroe-Blum continued. On November 10, the principal met with a handful of SSMU executives to discuss the financing of Quebec universities and tuition.
 VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki does not think that student groups and the administration would agree on the need for tuition increases, but did point to some common ground.
 “We are both opposed to Bill 100. We both definitely believe that the federal and provincial governments need to invest more in post-secondary education, and that universities should be able to keep a greater share of the subsidies – of the amount of money that they get due to increased tuition, but then with a cap,” he said.
At Senate, Abaki asked McGill administrators to reaffirm their commitment to promises made in the Principal’s Task Force on Excellence, Diversity and Community, Engagement (PTSFLL), a 2005 document that appeals to the idea of a  “student-centred” university.
“There is no evidence to support observation that [Principal’s Task Force] recommendations have been dismissed,” said Provost Anthony Masi.
 Abaki said, however, that he was “not entirely” satisfied with Masi’s response.
“I think there’s been a lot of recent decisions that didn’t exactly live up to the promises made in the document [such as] the decision made on the Arch Café, the one made on the athletics board, the ones regarding the exchange fee, raising tuition for international students taking French as a second language courses,” he said.
 “All these positions are made without student consultation,” Abaki added. “That’s contrary to the promises that were made in the PTFSLL, so we just wanted to make sure that there is a reaffirmation [from] the principal to that line and that argument. We wanted to make sure that while the principal emphasizes being research-intensive, that the undergraduate experience is at the top of the list.”
 Management Senator Matt Reid pointed out that certain courses, especially first-year Science courses, have been closed off to students from other faculties, and asked what was being done to address overcapacity issues that have led to registration restrictions.
 According to Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson, students in a given program take priority in registering for those courses, adding that “courses may be capped to enhance learning experience, but the two main constraints are space and personnel.” A Student Enrolment Management program is underway and will be presented to Senate in February.

Former British MP and anti-war activist appears at UQAM after 18-month legal battle
George Galloway received ten standing ovations during his brief talk at UQAM last Wednesday – a stark contrast from being barred from the country, as he was in March 2009. Wednesday’s was the first lecture of a cross-country speaking tour he has planned in support of the NGO Canadian Boat to Gaza. After an 18-month legal struggle, the controversial former British MP has regained the ability to enter Canada.
A long-time supporter of the Palestinian political party Fatah, Galloway became the subject of media scrutiny in 2009 when he sent an aid convoy to the Gaza Strip, which is governed by Fatah rival Hamas. Galloway also sent a personal donation of £25,000 and several cars to prime minister Ismail Haniyeh.
When he tried to visit Canada for a lecture tour in March of that year, he was denied entry to the country by the Canadian Border Service Agency. The Ministry of Immigration later contested that by dealing with Hamas, Galloway had aided a terrorist organization.
Galloway was notified of the decision by letter and was advised that, should he attempt to come to Canada, he would be detained. As a result, he was forced to deliver his talks via satellite from New York. Only one other – Egypt – has banned Galloway.
“The letter that was written to Galloway said they believed he was a member of a terrorist organization because he had given money to Hamas,” said Galloway’s Canadian lawyer, Barbara Jackman. “The purpose [of the aid] was that the money be used to aid the Gazans. And that’s what the [Hamas] minister used. It’s really a perversion of what Parliament intended. … Aid wasn’t being passed to Hamas as Hamas; it was being passed to Hamas as the government of Gaza.”
On September 27, Justice Richard Mosley ruled that Galloway had been denied entry for illegitimate political reasons, and the ban was lifted.
“What makes George Galloway’s case entirely different is that it wasn’t even initiated by a civil servant,” said Jackman. “It came from the minister’s office. They wanted to keep the man out. … This was a misuse of the legislation, a misuse of the ministerial power to induce him [Galloway] not to come to Canada to speak.”
Galloway now intends to sue the Canadian government. “I believe in freedom of speech, but with some limitations. There must be laws of libel and denigration,” he told the audience at UQAM. “And Mr. [Jason] Kenney [Minister of Immigration], you’re going to find out all about those laws in the legal system in Canada.”
Galloway was also harshly critical of McGill’s recent partnership with Tony Blair in his talk. During his time as a British MP, Galloway was renowned for his opposition to the Iraq War, famously calling the British government “Tony Blair’s lie machine.” These opinions eventually got him thrown out of the Labour Party in 2003.
Galloway’s ban from Canada, and subsequent return, has stirred up media coverage, and seems to have increased public interest in his situation. What was to be a five-city tour has become a ten-city tour and, according to Galloway, lecture halls are selling out.
“I am not afraid of you,” said Galloway of his opponents. “You can’t intimidate me because I am not afraid. I am afraid only of God and as long as God gives me breath, I will continue to say the same thing.”
Galloway’s saga has sparked a debate in the Canadian press about the role of freedom of speech.
“George Bush and Harper’s governments are very similar in their sort of neo-right-wing Christian approach to things,” said Jackman. “The United States has Obama. We still have Jason Kenney and Stephen Harper, who are intolerant to the political views of others.”
Michael Taube, a columnist for the Toronto Star and former speech writer for prime minister Stephen Harper, argued in a November 15 article that the decision to keep Galloway out restricted his freedom of speech, “with questionable intent.”
However, Mosley ruled that, since Galloway had been allowed to deliver his talks via satellite in 2009, there had been no serious infringement of the latter’s right to free speech.
Ehab Lotayef, a member of Canadian Boat to Gaza, told The Daily, “I applaud that decision [to allow Galloway into Canada]. … I have seen over the past seven or eight years how the misuse of the issue of terrorism brings down our freedoms and limits our ability to debate issues that are much better being debated than just swept under the carpet.”
Others are less pleased with Galloway’s return, however. This group includes conservative pundit Ezra Levant, who has been an outspoken opponent of letting Galloway into the country, calling the former MP “pro-terrorist” in a March 20, 2009 blog post.
“George Galloway should be legally inadmissible to Canada because he has given money to a terrorist organization, contrary to section 37 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,” Levant told The Daily. “It’s got nothing to do with the fact that he’s an offensive bigot. It’s got everything to do with the fact that he gives money to murderers, and that’s against the law.”
The Daily was unable to reach Kenney for comment.
Despite the opposition to Galloway’s presence in Canada, Jackman said it is unlikely that any concrete action will be taken to have him banned again. In his talk at UQAM, Galloway said, “I’m here to stay as a political factor in Canadian politics.”
