Charges of sedition against students in India spark criticism worldwide
In response to controversies surrounding the arrest of students at India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) following a pro-Kashmiri separatist event, a group of McGill students have responded to a call for an international day of protest and action on March 2, creating a statement of solidarity for students at JNU and collecting signatures.
On February 9 students at JNU, a university in New Delhi, held an event to discuss the struggle of Kashmiri people for their democratic right to self-determination. Students also questioned the controversial hanging of Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri separatist convicted as a terrorist who played a role in an attack on India’s parliament in 2001.
On February 12, Kanhaiya Kumar, president of JNU’s Students’ Union (JNUSU), was arrested after the university administration had let police, who were wearing civilian clothes, into the JNU campus to find students who were involved in the event.
Kumar was charged with sedition after “anti-India” slogans were allegedly shouted at the February 9 event. According to The Indian Express, Kumar and his supporters were allegedly beaten by lawyers on court premises, in police presence. Home Minister Rajnath Singh, in a tweet, said that any individual who opposed the sedition charge has been labelled as an anti-national by the Indian government, which is currently led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has close ties to Hindu nationalist ideology.
Kumar has now been released from jail on a bail period of six months, based on a lack of any evidence that Kumar participated in anti-national slogans. However, two other students, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, remain in police custody under charges of sedition.
Kumar’s arrest and the subsequent handling of the situation by the government have generated massive protests across India and international criticism.
In an interview with The Daily, Vertika, a first-year McGill PhD candidate and alumnus of JNU, said, “The stance of the JNU community has been that [the arrest] was a pre-planned political move by the right-wing forces […] so as to generate this polarization in [India] about nationalism, and then define who is an anti-national.”
“India is such a diverse country. How can there be only one idea of nationalism?” Vertika continued.
Bayar Goswami, a first-year McGill Law student, and a member of Stand With JNU, told The Daily that the sedition charges themselves are problematic.
“The Supreme Court has a clear ruling that for sedition to exist in any act, incitement of violence has to occur,” said Goswami, yet noted that the students charged with sedition were not violent. Additionally, many separatists have called for the freedom of Kashmir in the past and were not charged with sedition.
Speaking to The Daily about India’s political state, Arunima Sharan, a U1 Economics and International Development Studies student who signed the statement of solidarity and is a member of the Indian Students Association, said, “We call ourselves the biggest democracy in the world but are we getting our rights as a democracy?”
Vertika, Goswami, and Sharan, along with Gaurav Singh, a first-year MBA student, and Aishwarya Nair, a first-year PhD candidate, organized a meeting to support JNU’s cause and created a statement of solidarity from concerned individuals of McGill, which has gathered fifty signatures so far.
“As students […] we need to stand up for the rights of other students across other parts of the world for the right of freedom of speech and expression. Why? Because universities are spaces where students should be able to critique even the ideas of the state, critique the policies of the government,” noted Vertika.
Universities across the world have also created their own statements, with some holding public rallies. According to Goswami, “This kind of peer solidarity […] creates pressure on the government to think about its actions.”
The pressure resulting from international statements of solidarity has undeniably had an effect, said Vertika, as media that was aggressively branding students as anti-national have had to back down, and the administration of JNU no longer lets police enter the campus to arrest students.
Vertika suggested that McGill faculty could write public letters to the administration of JNU. Vertika has also submitted a motion for the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) to take a position on the issue in order to raise more awareness in the McGill community.

SSMU executive candidates answer questions from the press
On March 8, candidates for the upcoming Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) elections participated in this year’s press debates, held in the SSMU Ballroom. The voting period for the executive elections will begin on March 16 and end on March 18.
The candidates – with the notable exception of VP External candidate Alexei Simakov, who did not attend the debates – were given the opportunity to present their electoral platforms and to answer questions from members of the student press.
U2 Environment student Ben Ger and U1 Biomedical and Life Sciences student Jordan Sinder are competing for the position of SSMU President.
Le Délit asked both candidates where they stood regarding the controversial amendment to the SSMU Constitution which, if passed, would block “external and divisive” motions from being discussed at General Assemblies (GAs).
“I am for direct democracy,” said Ger. “As a student government, we should represent exactly what the student body wants, and the GA is an amazing way for students to come out and mandate their executives to do certain action.”
He continued, however, by asserting that “there is something to say for the idea that the [motions would require a] two-thirds majority [to] stay on the agenda.”
“If it passes,” he concluded, “I will support it.”
Sinder argued that “there is a distinction between de-politicizing SSMU as a whole and making sure our executive council is politically neutral.”
He explained that while his presidency would avoid political stances, he would feel a strong obligation to support activist groups on campus – even those that might bring forward potentially divisive GA motions.
“As a member of the executive council, I think it’s wrong for us to assert certain stances on these divisive issues,” finished Sinder.
U4 International Development Studies student Alexei Simakov and U3 Philosophy and Political Science student David Aird are competing for the VP External position. However, Simakov was not able to attend the debate, and told The Daily that was owed to schoolwork.
Most of Aird’s relevant experience has been with the McGill Against Austerity campaign. When asked by The Daily how he would support other campaigns on campus – such as Divest McGill and Demilitarize McGill – Aird replied, “My involvement with other campaigns is definitely less pronounced than with the anti-austerity campaign. […] I intend to appoint someone who is very knowledgeable [about] those campaigns as Political Campaigns Coordinator.”
Aird continued, “I think these campaigns benefit from having a certain independence from [the VP External] position, from SSMU in general. […] I find [these campaigns] to be more or less self-manageable and self-sustaining at this point. […] I’m open to giving them all the institutional support that they need.”
U3 History and East Asian Studies student and Arts Senator Erin Sobat is running unopposed for the VP University Affairs position.
During his opening remarks, Sobat told the audience, “I want to do a lot more to inform you about [the VP University Affairs’s] role in advocating for your needs at the University level.” He also emphasized his experience in both “project-based” and “administrative portfolio-based” positions.
Responding to a question from The Daily about his opinions on political neutrality and how that would affect the dynamics of next year’s SSMU executive team, Sobat said, “Next year in general will be a restructuring year and there will be a lot of conversations about what SSMU’s priorities are in terms of advocacy as well as service provision, knowing that cuts will have to be made. […] I will say that I do feel that SSMU does have an important role on campus and will advocate for that.”
U3 Strategic Management and Accounting student and SSMU Club Auditor Niall Carolan is running unopposed for the VP Finance position, one of the two positions that have been created out of the former VP Finance and Operations position.
When asked by the Bull & Bear about how exactly he is planning to ensure SSMU’s financial stability given the recent failure of the membership fee increase referendum, Carolan mentioned the Student-Run Cafeteria (SRC) among the items that would need to be reconsidered, should the SRC run a deficit in the long term.
Nevertheless, Carolan said, “I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable saying that I am going to cut this and this at this meeting right now. […] I think that there are specific places that do get cut quickly, like the Club Fund. […] However, I believe that that’s one of the most [significant] things that students benefit from by paying their student fees.”
U3 Biochemistry student Sacha Magder is running for VP Operations, the other half of the former VP Finance and Operations position.
Among Magder’s campaign promises is the addition of a “sleeping space” in the Shatner building. Pointing out the conflict between the number of specialized spaces that SSMU would like to add to the Shatner building and the building’s physical limitations, The Daily asked Magder how he would approach space reallocations.
Magder said, “There are spaces that are available and can be moved. […] I think there are a lot of other ways we can optimize the space and use it better and more efficiently.”
U1 Materials Engineering student Daniel Lawrie is running unopposed for the VP Internal position. His platform centres on communication, organization, and trust.
“I believe that through these values, we’ll be able to fix some of the issues that are currently [affecting] the VP Internal’s portfolio,” Lawrie said.
The Bull & Bear asked Lawrie how exactly he plans to motivate students to be more engaged, apart from just communicating with them. Lawrie emphasized that SSMU needs to go beyond simply using the listserv, and start using mobile platforms such as the MyMartlet app.
“It’s crucial for everyone to have access to information as easily as possible. […] People will be able to get these notifications on their phone. If you look at our generation, we are the millennial generation. […] Everyone’s on their phone 24/7,” Lawrie said.
Elaine Patterson, a U2 English Literature student and Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) VP Communications, and Dushan Tripp, U3 History student and Clubs & Services Representative to SSMU, are competing for the newly created VP Student Life position, which is replacing the VP Clubs & Services position and taking over the mental health portfolio from the VP University Affairs.
The Daily asked both candidates what they saw the role of VP Student Life within SSMU Legislative Council to be, considering the scope and political nature of topics discussed.
Tripp responded, “As much as I might keep my political opinions to myself, which I probably will, I do believe that SSMU is a democracy and that the voice of the people that vote and debate in SSMU should be [respected].”
Patterson said, “As a SSMU councillor, I would do my best to make sure that my personal opinions did not interfere [with] opinions I received from [those] who are part of certain clubs and services, making sure that what they want to see happens in SSMU Council, even if it’s something I would not like to see happen.”

Alumni encouraged not to donate until military research ends
On March 16, McGill will be running a 24-hour fundraising campaign, McGill24. According to the campaign website, the one-day campaign will “unite alumni, students, parents, friends, faculty and staff in support of the causes that matter to all of us.”
However, which causes “matter to all of us” is a controversial topic for some groups on campus.
Demilitarize McGill, which organizes against military research at McGill, is running a counter-campaign called ChangeMcGill24 which encourages alumni to take a pledge not to donate to McGill until military research is ended at the university.
According to the Demilitarize McGill website, there are six different research groups involved in military research at McGill: the Aerospace Mechatronics Lab, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Laboratory, the Institute of Air and Space Law, Missile Guidance Research, the Network Dynamics Lab, and the Shock Wave Physics Group.
In an interview with The Daily, Jason,* a member of Demilitarize McGill, highlighted the Shock Wave Physics Group’s research on thermobaric weapons, also known as fuel-air explosives (FAEs), as particularly concerning.
According to a Human Rights Watch report, “FAEs are more powerful than conventional high-explosive munitions of comparable size, are more likely to kill and injure people in bunkers, shelters, and caves, and kill and injure in a particularly brutal manner over a wide area. In urban settings it is very difficult to limit the effect of this weapon to combatants, and the nature of FAE explosions makes it virtually impossible for civilians to take shelter from their destructive effect.”
According to the Demilitarize McGill website, these weapons have been used in the Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars, among others.
Demilitarize McGill also documents direct linkages between McGill researchers with the American and Canadian militaries, including collaboration with researchers in the military and publishing papers which include research partially funded by military agencies.
“If you hold that standard […] I do think there’s an obligation to not be complicit in war crimes and violent, aggressive warfare.”
According to McGill’s mission statement, the University will create and disseminate knowledge “by carrying out research and scholarly activities judged to be excellent by the highest international standards, and by providing service to society.”
Jason claimed that by engaging in military research, McGill is being hypocritical because “if you hold that standard […] I do think there’s an obligation to not be complicit in war crimes and violent, aggressive warfare.”
Demilitarize McGill also questions how the McGill administration handles the research. Jason accused the administration of being secretive and “[bringing] students to court over access to information requests.”
For example, in the Fall of 2012, some members of Demilitarize McGill submitted access to information (ATI) requests in response to questionable activities by McGill’s CFD Laboratory. These students were brought to court by the University, which claimed these students orchestrated a “complex system for acquiring documents” as “retaliation” for unknown events during the 2012 student strike.
Jason also voiced concern about the fact that “there’s really no regulation on the ethics of military research at McGill.”
As part of a McGill review of general research ethics in 2009, Demilitarize McGill called for “an ethical review of any research conducted in conjunction with anyone receiving military employment or funding.”
“There’s really no regulation on the ethics of military research at McGill.”
However, the final draft adopted by Senate in 2010 “lacked any ethical review for potentially harmful research,” says Demilitarize McGill’s website, and today McGill has no mechanism for investigating the potential harm of its military research.
Anand Patwardhan, a documentary filmmaker who graduated with an MA in Communication Studies from McGill in 1982, has taken the pledge not to donate to the University.
In a statement to The Daily, Patwardhan said, “I am deeply disappointed to hear that McGill, my alma mater, is involving itself with military research.”
Derek Cassoff, McGill’s Director of Strategic Communications for University Advancement, informed The Daily in a written statement that donors can choose where they would like their donations to go.
“I am deeply disappointed to hear that McGill, my alma mater, is involving itself with military research.”
“McGill24 donations won’t support researchers or research labs directly. Some donors may choose to give to the Deans Development fund in a particular faculty, which supports a range of needs and emerging priorities over the year, as determined by the Dean. Some of these could involve research, but this would be a very small percentage of overall donations,” Cassoff added.
“McGill24 donations won’t support researchers or research labs directly.”
Regarding the University’s stance on military research, Cassoff said, “there will be no change to McGill’s policies based on this specific campaign” because “those who support the Demilitarize McGill campaign represent a tiny fraction of the approximately 30,000 donors who give to McGill every year.”
Patwardhan, however, believes educational institutions like McGill “should set an example for the rest of Canada and the world,” and said he would be “both grateful and proud” if McGill ended its military research.

On March 10, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council met to discuss Committee Terms of Reference and a motion to oppose Bill 56.
In June 2015, Bill 56, the Lobbying Transparency Act, was introduced to the National Assembly of Quebec to replace an older bill governing lobbying activity. The new bill extends the definition of a “lobbyist” to include any director, officer, or employee of a non-profit group who lobbies on behalf of the non-profit.
This extended definition would encompass SSMU, meaning that SSMU would be required to register its staff as lobbyists.
“This motion changes what it means to be a lobbyist.”
Council adopted a motion to object to this change of definition. According to this motion, “through the office of the VP External, [SSMU will] prepare a memorandum detailing its opposition to the inclusion of non-profits and community organizations in the Bill for presentation at any parliamentary commission on this issue.”
“This motion changes what it means to be a lobbyist,” said Environment Representative Chelsea Kingzett. “It makes it much more difficult for groups to lobby the government.”
VP External Emily Boytinck has been informally meeting with undergraduate student union representatives from the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities (U15). They have formed a coalition lobbying the federal government for, among other things, the Canada student loans program and the advancement of international students’ interests.
U15 is a group of 15 Canadian public research universities which represents its members’ interests at the provincial and federal levels.
Boytinck mentioned her discomfort with the inefficacy and the informal nature of the coalition and noted her decision to end SSMU’s involvement with the group.
“People are advocating for predictable tuition growth but that is not SSMU’s position, whether predictable or not.”
“I just think that the informal nature […] doesn’t work. Their research briefs are not prepared in the slightest,” Boytinck said. “People are advocating for predictable tuition growth but that is not SSMU’s position, whether predictable or not.”
The coalition has been meeting via Skype and is planning a meeting in Ottawa in three weeks, which Boytinck says she will not be attending.
President Kareem Ibrahim mentioned that negotiations with the administration regarding the Sexual Assault Policy (SAP) may not be completed during this academic year.
“But we are confident now that from this point, negotiations have become more consensus-based than previously, so hopefully we can pass the policy this semester.”
“We’ve been stalled numerous times and it is a pretty frustrating process,” said Ibrahim. “But we are confident now that from this point, negotiations have become more consensus-based than previously, so hopefully we can pass the policy this semester.”

Incarcerated politician and pilot a “symbol of Ukraine”
On the evening of March 8, roughly a hundred members of Montreal’s Ukrainian community gathered in Phillips Square to stand in solidarity with Nadiya Savchenko, a Ukrainian politician and military pilot who has been incarcerated in Russia since 2014, when she was captured by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Accused by the Russian government of killing two journalists, she has vehemently asserted her innocence, and was reported to be on a hunger strike last week.
Protesters began arriving in the square shortly before 6 p.m., carrying Ukrainian flags and placards expressing support for Savchenko. After roughly half an hour of mingling and discussion, prominent members of the Montreal Ukrainian community gave a series of speeches, praising Savchenko’s defiant attitude toward her captors, and calling for her release.
Karina Grinenko, who addressed the crowd in Ukrainian, explained that she had been a volunteer in the same unit as Savchenko during the summer of 2014. This unit, the Aidar Battalion, has a history of links to the far right, and has been accused of human rights violations by Amnesty International.
According to Grinenko, Savchenko joined the Aidar Battalion in May as a volunteer after having been turned down three times for missions to territory illegally occupied by Russia as a pilot.
“They were freed, but the group Nadiya was a part of was still in captivity. During the following month most of the combatants were released, but one of them was killed in the basement of a Luhansk prison, and Nadiya was taken to Russian territory by the end of June.”
“A month later, on June 17, she was captured while trying to help a group of military agents. They were freed, but the group Nadiya was a part of was still in captivity. During the following month most of the combatants were released, but one of them was killed in the basement of a Luhansk prison, and Nadiya was taken to Russian territory by the end of June,” Grinenko said.
Oksana Gerych, who also gave her speech in Ukrainian, highlighted Savchenko’s importance both as an individual and a nationalist symbol.
“Nadiya Savchenko can be said to be a symbol of Ukraine: […] unbreakable, patriotic, strong, confident, and stubborn, who, not with words but with actions, said that she would fight until the very end. We would very much not want this end to come for her, and to lose her. […] So we are here so that she lives,” Gerych said.
“Nadiya Savchenko can be said to be a symbol of Ukraine: […] unbreakable, patriotic, strong, confident, and stubborn, who, not with words but with actions, said that she would fight until the very end.”
Several members of the McGill Ukrainian Students’ Association were present at the demonstration.
“A member of my family, he actually was in the war zone, so he was part of the Ukrainian troops,” explained one student in attendance. “A lot of people are [going] through certain physical or mental issues after that. I mean, [that member of my family] had a big, big problem; he couldn’t adapt to normal life after he [returned]. And still, I feel that he’s not recovered from that.”
“It’s not really in the news lately, but it’s still very much happening, and people are dying both on the Russian and Ukrainian side every day.”
“I think it just comes down to human rights,” said Nadia Demko, another McGill student at the demonstration. “I think you can sympathize with someone being illegally captured from their country, and this is all in the context of the war that’s happening in eastern Ukraine. It’s not really in the news lately, but it’s still very much happening, and people are dying both on the Russian and Ukrainian side every day.”

Women of Diverse Origins denounces austerity
On the evening of March 8, around 200 women and allies gathered in Cabot Square to celebrate and stand in solidarity with women for International Women’s Day. The march was organized by Montreal-based feminist organization Women of Diverse Origins.
The March began at 6 p.m. near Atwater station along Ste. Catherine, with the crowd chanting and waving banners from their respective organizations. The march was accompanied by the Service de police de la ville de Montréal (SPVM).
“To bring back the militant tradition of International Women’s Day to Montreal.”
According to a statement by Women of Diverse Origins, the march was against patriarchy, colonialism, racism, Islamophobia, austerity, capitalism, and imperialism. Marie Boti, a spokesperson for the organization, told The Daily in an interview that the march sought “to bring back the militant tradition of International Women’s Day to Montreal.”
Multiple organizations participated in the march, such as the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, and the South Asian Women’s Community Centre. “We are women from different cultural communities, from different generations, many immigrant and racialized women,” said Boti.
Some held banners that said “Immigrant workers against austerity and for their dignity.”
Boti continued, “Because many of our members […] have ties with countries in many other parts of the world, we have direct links and are affected by what is going on elsewhere as well.”
Boti emphasized that the march specifically opposed austerity, noting the disproportionate impact of the provincial Liberal government’s austerity measures on women. “The issues that affect us are the issues that […] affect most working people in Montreal, only often we have it worse,” Boti said. Issues such as cuts to social services particularly hinder gender equality, she added.
“The issues that affect us are the issues that […] affect most working people in Montreal, only often we have it worse.”
She said that the Women of Diverse Origins and the march also support Indigenous women who are on the front lines of resistance against “transnational, multinational corporations [that] have no qualms about engaging in aggressive extractivism and mining projects.”
A moment of silence was also held for Berta Cáceres, a Honduran Indigenous woman and environmental activist who resisted dams and mining projects to protect the waterways in Honduras, and was killed on March 3.
Carlos Hernan Cerpa Mallat, a member of Fight Back, told The Daily in an interview that attending the march was especially important for them because women are denied access to political engagement in most societies. “I’m here because I think it is very important to defend women’s rights, especially today, in the political moment we live in,” said Mallat.
“I think we have to recover the very sense of women’s day,” they continued. “For example, in [the U.S.] with the elections, with Hillary [Clinton], the question of feminism and women has been taken to the scene in a very narrow and confused sense.”
“I think it sheds light on the fact that women everywhere face some kind of disadvantage by virtue of being women.”
Firdaous Sbaï, a U2 Arts student, also attended the march and told The Daily, “It’s a good way to have awareness on issues that affect women in a more general way and […] connect these issues, and through that illustrate that women’s oppression is systemic and every individual issue is connected in a bigger way.”
“I think it sheds light on the fact that women everywhere face some kind of disadvantage by virtue of being women,” Sbaï concluded.

Panel discussion, coffeehouse commemorate International Women’s Day
The Women of Colour Collective of McGill Law organized a series of events in commemoration of International Women’s Day last week. The first event, a panel discussion called “Our Voices,” took place on March 7, and focused on the experiences of women of colour and Indigenous women in law. The second event, the “Speak our Minds Coffeehouse,” was held on March 8, and celebrated art created by women in forms of musical performances, spoken word, poetry, and dance.
The panelists, who come from diverse fields of law and with unique identities, discussed barriers that women of colour and Indigenous women face in law. They highlighted the importance of creating a community in the workforce, among other ways of overcoming obstacles in a field dominated by white men.
Panelist Amanda Ghahremani, founder of Women’s Charters & Declarations and Articling Fellow for the Canadian Centre for International Justice, emphasized the importance of questioning hegemonic classroom practices.
“This is the most important message I want to impart to current law students of colour: your presence is the best way to disrupt the status quo.”
“This is the most important message I want to impart to current law students of colour: your presence is the best way to disrupt the status quo,” Ghahremani said.
“Challenge your professors, challenge your classmates, challenge the course materials, challenge assumptions, and also challenge yourself. As you engage actively and authentically in this space, don’t ever forget that you deserve to be here.”
Adelle Blackett, a professor of Law and William Dawson Scholar at McGill, highlighted the importance of community-building in law school. “Classrooms are not safe space, you need to find a group of people and carve your space,” she said.
“Challenge your professors, challenge your classmates, challenge the course materials, challenge assumptions, and also challenge yourself. As you engage actively and authentically in this space, don’t ever forget that you deserve to be here.”
In a message to The Daily, Ghahremani mentioned that an email was sent to the Law admissions committee asking them to reconsider their policies in light of some of the experiences expressed by the panelists.
Romita Sur, a member of the Women of Colour Collective and an organizer of the event, said, “As women of colour, we don’t see ourselves represented in the law and events. And so we wanted to have a space where we would hear from women of colour and Indigenous legal [professionals] on their experiences and how they navigated law school and their careers.”
The second event focused on the experiences of women of colour broadly in society. The larger theme of the event was a tribute to the ways in which women resist violence in their communities, and performers also focused on themes of sexual assault, genocide, white supremacy, and diaspora, among others.
Alice Rougeaux, a U2 English Literature student, told The Daily that the event was simultaneously humbling and empowering.
“That is because the women who performed celebrated friendship, motherhood, laughter, sexuality, survival, solidarity, achievement, and the satisfaction of saying ‘fuck you’ to oppressors.”
Sponsors of the event included the Feminist Collective of McGill Law, Contours, the Black Law Students’ Association of McGill, Aboriginal Law Students’ Association, Rad Law McGill, and McGill Students for Feminism.
“Despite how harrowing the experiences are that call for resistance, I felt like what we were ultimately left with was positive energy […] and joy,” Rougeaux said. “That is because the women who performed celebrated friendship, motherhood, laughter, sexuality, survival, solidarity, achievement, and the satisfaction of saying ‘fuck you’ to oppressors. I didn’t really know what International Women’s Day meant before tonight, but now I think all of these things define it perfectly.”

At a brief meeting of McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Legislative Council on March 9, a presentation was given by students campaigning against a controversial amendment to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)’s Constitution, which will be voted on in this week’s online referendum. Council also passed three motions with virtually no discussion.
Councillors Julie Skarha and Erik Partridge delivered a short presentation on behalf of the campaign opposing the proposed amendment to the SSMU Constitution.
If passed, the amendment would empower an unelected steering committee to remove motions deemed “external and divisive” from the agenda at SSMU General Assemblies (GAs). The committee’s decision could be disregarded should a two-thirds majority of those present at the GA vote to return such a motion to the agenda. The motion in question would then require a two-thirds majority to pass, instead of the usual simple majority.
There’s no set criteria for [divisiveness] in the [amendment], so really it would just be whoever was sitting on this committee deciding what they deem divisive, […] probably [based on] their own political opinions.”
The amendment has caused significant controversy on campus since being brought forward at the February 25 meeting of SSMU Council, and will be voted on in the online referendum that will take place from March 16 to 18.
Skarha argued that such an amendment would be undemocratic. “There’s no set criteria for [divisiveness] in the [amendment], so really it would just be whoever was sitting on this committee deciding what they deem divisive, […] probably [based on] their own political opinions,” she said.
Responding to Skarha’s comments, one councillor called the amendment “an extension of [the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) SSMU GA motion].”
“I’m not speaking to either side of the BDS campaign […] but I know why this was put forward. It’s not about stopping the student democratic voice. When you have [issues] students are going to therapy for on both sides, and it turns the whole student body upside down for two weeks, this is what [the amendment is] trying to minimize,” the councillor said.
“It’s not about stopping the student democratic voice. When you have [issues] students are going to therapy for on both sides, and it turns the whole student body upside down for two weeks, this is what [the amendment is] trying to minimize.”
VP Academic Gabriel Gilling disagreed, saying, “The way that I see it, most contentious issues ought to be discussed, and this is just another way for students that disagreed […] with BDS […] to stifle a debate that should be had. Regardless of the vote passing or not, it’s still good for these discussions to come to SSMU and be discussed. That’s what democracy is about […] and that’s how we achieve real progress.”
Following the presentation, three motions passed unanimously and with virtually no discussion.
The first increased the McGill Panama Field Study Program Fee from $4,980 to $5,500, to retain “the academic richness of the program and its viability” in the wake of the recent devaluation of the Canadian dollar.
A second motion amended Council’s financial bylaws to allow Council to use a credit card in certain exceptional circumstances. Previously to the amendment, Council was only permitted to use a debit card for such transactions.
The final motion approved a series of allocations of the Arts Student Employment Fund’s undesignated resources.
