March culminates in potential new occupation spot
On Monday evening, a demonstrator called out, “Hochelaga under attack. What do we do?” and was met with the reply. “Stand up, fight back.” Around 200 demonstrators gathered at Préfontaine metro station at 6 p.m. to protest the eviction of the Moreau Lofts residents on September 6, in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve area, and act against gentrification in the neighbourhood.
“There’s one thing in your life you care about, and that gets taken away. That’s what gentrification is for you,” said Guillaume Vallée-Rémillard, a squatter who was living at the occupation at Ontario east and Moreau for six days before the 6 a.m. eviction a few days ago.
According to La Presse, on September 3, due to the negligence of the owner of 2019 Moreau, Vito Papasodaro, the City of Montreal told the artists and other residents of the Lofts to leave their homes after they were declared uninhabitable by city inspectors. In an interview with La Presse a few weeks earlier, Papasodaro said that he planned to renovate the Lofts after the eviction, but admitted that this would likely mean raising the rent.
The loft space was the site of short film La Maison des rêves in 1998, and has been an art space and workplace for many decades.
The residents began occupy the empty lot next to the Lofts, living under tarps, to protest what they felt was the ongoing gentrification project in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve – more commonly called HoMa. There was a community kitchen, daily general assemblies, and live music every night.
Now, the former squatters find community and shelter with their friends that pay rent, living on couches or the street.
“We need to change the peoples’ minds,” said Vallée-Rémillard, who believes that gentrification and rent increases do not have be inevitable.
“You put some nice coffee shop where a small coffee costs three dollars, where it use to cost only one dollar. And you put a restaurant which used to be a little potato shop on the corner where it was $15 for a good lunch, and now you have a steakhouse,” he added.
The march took off from the station at 6:30 p.m. and took a route around the HoMa area, culminating in an empty parking lot beside an empty building, which demonstrators announced was going to be the new location of the Moreau Lofts occupation.
According to an unnamed demonstrator, the lot had not received an eviction notice and so the demonstrators could legally live there.
The police advanced on the demonstrators several times – prompting chanting from the group – but did not directly confront the group. No arrests were made. The demonstrators eventually left the lot and headed south on Moreau toward the Préfontaine metro station, where the demonstration was declared illegal.
“Every demonstration is a step for the struggle,” said Vallée-Rémillard, adding that this will not be the last action against gentrification and in solidarity with the former residents of Moreau Lofts.

University alleges it is “victim of systematic demands”
As McGill’s legal fight against a number of access to information requests (ATIs) makes its way through Quebec’s justice system, two disputing parties met in front of the Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec on Thursday.
The hearing centred around whether the Commission has standing to decide McGill’s request for the authority to deny future ATI requests from anyone on a list of specified categories of individuals or submitting requests on specified topics.
The right to access administrative documents, according to the Commission’s website, covers over 2,800 Quebec public bodies. ATIs are typically used by students, journalists, activists, and other interested parties to legally obtain information from public bodies  such as McGill. If a public body refuses to grant ATI requests, the Commission acts as an administrative tribunal to mediate negotiations and make decisions.
At the hearing, the University’s two lawyers advocated for one of two responses from the Commission: either that the Commission grant the University the right to disregard future ATIs from select categories of persons, or the requirement that those within the categories receive authorization from the Commission before submitting ATIs to the University.
The select categories of persons that the University seeks to prevent from submitting ATI requests includes blanket terms such as “persons associated to McGilliLeaked” or “persons that could reasonably be linked to such requestor,” and that show characteristics such as being “overly broad,” “frivolous,” “target[ing] trivial documents and information,” or “associated to one or more categories of documents and information published on McGilliLeaked.”
Prior to this summer, the University also sought to include the term “students of McGill,” but later dropped that part of the language when the Daily Publications Society asked to be made a respondent on the case, on the grounds that the motion would directly affect student journalists.
At the hearing, which was held in French, the respondents’ lawyer labelled McGill’s request to deny future ATI requests at its discretion as having a “discriminatory character,” and claimed that the University is asking to change the law in order to suit its demands.
Essentially, the respondents’ lawyer argued, McGill would be asking the Commission to delegate its power, giving the University the power to decide on and dismiss ATI requests, typically the responsibility of the Commission – and a move that would be unprecedented if decided in McGill’s favour.
“This type of demand has no precedent in the law,” she said in French at the hearing.
In response, the University’s lawyers argued that a large number of ATI requests from students and others created a complex set of “systematic demands,” a phenomenon that they claimed reduced efficiency and cost money to fulfill.
McGill’s lawyers argued that the University, as a public organization, has the right “not to be the victim of systematic demands.”
Quebec law allows for public organizations to disregard ATIs – if the ATIs in question are deemed to be “improper” in nature, due to a repetitious or systematic character.
Respondents argue that the “systematic and abusive” nature of the requests has been “manufactured by artificially grouping together a number of students and non-students who have made ATI requests on vastly different subjects,” Kevin Paul, one of the respondents present at the hearing, told The Daily.
Another of the respondents present at the hearing, Isaac Stethem, expressed similar sentiments. “I just find it really frustrating and disingenuous,” he said. “[It’s] frankly disturbing and saddening that the University is using this kind of language and allegations and tactics.”
The University defended its decision, and disputed the notion that it is seeking to circumvent existing access to information laws. According to Secretary-General Stephen Strople, who is responsible for responding to ATI requests at the University, “The University is seeking authorization from the Commission to disregard applications for access to documents that are improper because they were too broad, repetitive, systematic, frivolous, and asking for information that is obviously personal and therefore cannot be disclosed – all of which is not permitted by the law,” he wrote in an email to The Daily.
“The law provides a recourse to seek authorization to disregard such requests. This is the recourse we used and that is now in front of the Commission,” he said. “[The law] also gives rights to those from whom the documents are requested.”
Speaking to the University’s amendment regarding pre-Commission approval of ATIs, Strople added, “If the Commission does not want to grant us permission to ignore future requests of the type we describe, then it could require that such requests for access first be submitted to the Commission for review before the University has to deal with them.”
Ultimately, Stethem said, the University’s request to disregard future ATIs comes down to power. “It’s fairly clear where the balance of power lies here,” he said, pointing to the University, which has more legal, financial, and labour resources than students typically do. “The commission is there to mitigate that imbalance, but the University is seeking to exempt itself from that oversight.”
The requests named in the current motion date back to November 2011, after the campus strike of non-academic workers.
The requests named in the current motion largely revolve around several categories: fossil fuel investments, alleged military research at the university, and administrative finances. In the motion submitted by the University, the requests are grouped together in “waves” – despite the respondents’ denial that any collaboration was made.
“They’re lumping all of these information requests together in order to make the point that there are too many requests being made, that there’s some coordinated effort,” Mona Luxion, a former Daily columnist, and one of the respondents, told The Daily in January.
However, respondents deny that there was any collaboration between groups on the requests, as alleged by the University.
The Commission is expected to decide over the next few weeks on which elements of McGill’s motion – most significantly, its request to deny future requests at its discretion – are within its purview. Following this, if the case is not resolved in mediation, it will go to trial later this year, with dates tentatively set for October and December.

AUS moves to hold October by-electons 
During the September 4 meeting of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), the Council saw the resignation of Steven Curran, one of the three Arts Representatives to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU). The resignation is the second to hit the AUS in just over a month, as the VP Academic left their position in late July. At that time the AUS had issued a press release stating that the Council would discuss the vacant position at their first meeting.
In accordance with AUS elections bylaws, any AUS council member could have put their name forward for the interim VP Academic position; however, James Chan, AUS Sponsorship Coordinator, was the only candidate in the running for the interim VP Academic position.
After a secret ballot, the Council decided not to assign an interim VP Academic.
In an email to The Daily, Enbal Singer, AUS VP Internal, commented on the vacancy of the VP Academic. “There may be challenges for us as an executive for the next month, but in taking these positions, we were aware that resignations do happen, and that our top priority is to provide the best representation and services to students.”
“We hope that an election produces the most qualified candidate as it comes from the entire Arts Undergraduate Society, rather than a limited pool of Council members and AUS Committee members,” she continued.
The AUS voted instead to have elections in early October to elect the now-vacant positions of VP Academic and Arts Representative to SSMU.
The nomination period for the two positions will take place between September 16 and 24. Any student fitting the criteria set forth by AUS Electoral Bylaws will be able to put their name forth for either position. Students will be able to vote online from October 3, at 9 a.m. until October 8, at 5 p.m..
In an interview with The Daily following the council meeting, AUS President Justin Fletcher explained the reasoning behind the move. “From my end, having an interim and then going into an election, having the interim campaigning during that election period, and then possibly bringing someone else new in, could be more disruptive to our overall work plans for the year.”
In response to the resignation of the Arts Representative to SSMU, the AUS decided to appoint Fletcher as an Arts Delegate to fill the vacant seat at the SSMU Council.
Singer explained that the absence of the VP Academic has not proved much of a burden to the executive committee.
“The VP Academic role is very important for our relations within the University, but not as time sensitive of a position, such as the VP Events that has to put on Frosh, or the VP Finance who has to complete the audit before a deadline,” Singer said.
Sue Jeong, Arts Representative to SSMU, stated, in an email to The Daily: “In regards to this decision, made by the AUS Council as a whole, I do not think that this would hamper his [Fletcher’s] duties as president.”
“In fact, I think that it might even allow him to directly serve as AUS’ official spokesperson, which is one of his main roles,” she added.
Council also moved a motion that amended some of the AUS Electoral Bylaws, changing campaigning policy to include a wider definition of social networking sites.
In addition, Council also voted on motions regarding the approval of the new AUS bookkeeper, equity committee officers, hires under the portfolios of the President, VP Finance and VP Communications, and Fine Arts Committee hires.

Protesters take to the street in sardonic ‘celebration’
In the early evening of September 4, a group of just over 100 people met at Metro Jarry for a ‘celebration’ of the one-year anniversary of the election of Premier Pauline Marois and the Parti québécois (PQ) government.
“It’s a way to show the PQ that a year after the election, the people are not asleep,” explained Steve, a demonstrator, in French. He also told The Daily that he didn’t see any real difference between the current government and the former. “The PQ has the same politics as the Parti libéral du Quebec (PLQ).”
Judith Barnett, another demonstrator, shared similar sentiments, adding that she thought the government had actually changed for the worse over the past year.
Following St. Denis from Metro Jarry all the way down to Émilie Gamelin Square, the crowd swelled from around 100 to approximately 300 people, many of them banging pots and pans in the casserole style of protest. After speeches at the square, the group marched east on Ste. Catherine before finishing at Ontario and Moreau.
Despite the fact that the protest was declared illegal almost immediately under bylaw P-6 – which allows police to deem marches unlawful if organizers do not divulge their route beforehand – it remained peaceful.
Bylaw P-6 also prohibits protesters from wearing masks, scarves, or hoods that obscure their face. To circumvent the law, protesters put cardboard masks of Marois’ face on their bikes, sticks, or the backs of their heads.
“She couldn’t be here tonight,” one of the protesters, Geneviève, said in French, pulling the mask over her face, “but she is… sort of.”
Protesters waved communist flags, wore red squares, pushed their bikes, and held their children, but all were there for a similar reason: to show the government that they were not pleased. The previous year of the PQ government provided plenty of fodder for outrage – from anti-union legislation, to state-enforced secularism, to tuition hikes. Here’s an overview of some of the most important – and most criticized – issues of the year.
Anti-union legislation
In August, over 175,000 unionized construction workers in Quebec went on strike, citing wages and work conditions as their crucial grievances. While over 98,000 workers managed to negotiate an end to their strike after only a week, over 77,000 workers remained on strike.
When negotiations broke down for the second group of workers after the second week of the strike, the PQ pushed through Bill 54, a highly unpopular piece of back-to-work legislation. If union leaders, employees, and associations did not respect the legislation, they were threatened with fines from $100 for an individual offender to $125,000 for a union or employers’ association.
Both the workers who negotiated an end to the strike and those who were forced back to work received annual pay increases of 2 per cent per year – 1 per cent lower than they initially asked for.
Plan Nord
While Plan Nord was announced by the previous Liberal government in May 2011, it was carried on by the PQ. Plan Nord is a 25 year long, $80 million development and resource exploitation project, touted by the government as an economic booster that will create or consolidate 20,000 jobs per year in Northern Quebec by digging mines, expanding forestry, and damming rivers.
The Plan was heavily criticized by environmental activists, Aboriginal peoples, and labour unions for its destructive potential – not only to the environment, but to the Aboriginal peoples whose communities are on the land. It was also criticized for its lack of transparency and consultation with Quebec’s Aboriginal population.
When the PQ introduced their new “North for All” plan, which will invest $868 million over five years into Northern Quebec, they were blasted for the plan’s similarity to Plan Nord. The PQ admitted that the two plans were similar, but highlighted promises to work more closely with communities on sustainable social and environmental infrastructure.
At the protest on September 4, a demonstrator named Dominic told The Daily he was upset that the PQ, which he believed had run as a socially and environmentally friendly alternative to the PLQ, had simply renamed this environmentally destructive plan instead of shutting it down.
Summit on Higher Education
In February, the PQ held its Summit on Higher Education, a day-and-a-half long summit that involved the government, 61 different organizations, and leaders from student federations. Quickly criticized as being simply for show – Heather Munroe-Blum, then-principal of  McGill, called it a “farce” – many thought the PQ had already made its decisions behind closed doors.
While the PQ government stood in solidarity with students during the student strike of 2011-2012, opposing the PLQ’s proposed tuition hike from $2,168 to $3,793 over five years, the summit saw the government unveil a plan to increase tuition by 3 per cent annually. Although the PQ called it indexation, students and protesters took to the streets to decry what they saw as the government’s empty gesture.
Many of the protesters who attended the demonstration were there to support students. One protester named Valerie stated that she felt that students had been “abandoned” and that she was there “in solidarity with the students arrested during last year’s riots.”
Bill 14 and French language laws
Bill 14, formerly known as An Act to amend the Charter of the French language, saw sweeping legislation introduced into the National Assembly late last year that would amend the use of French in schools and workplaces.
While the Bill has yet to be passed, the debate surrounding it was reignited in the spring when the PQ introduced hearings over the proposed Bill, which was met with fierce opposition from the PLQ.
Amendments proposed included allowing the provincial government to revoke the bilingual status of a municipality if the anglophone population drops below 50 per cent. Another proposed amendment specified that businesses with 26 employees or more needed to make French their everyday work language. The proposed amendments would also give inspectors the ability to seize anything they believe is an offence against the Charter.
Additionally, the Bill could see diplomas denied to CEGEP students if they do not meet a government-approved level of spoken and written French.
Selective secularism
Most recently, the PQ has provoked outrage across Quebec and Canada for its planned Quebec Charter of Values. Before the election in September, the PQ announced it was drafting the Charter, which would prohibit the wearing of religious symbols by public-sector employees in workplaces such as hospitals and schools.
The Charter has come under fire as it proposes a ban on symbols such as hijabs, veils, and kippahs, but does not extend to the crucifix – although it violates the Charter – which the PQ claims is part of Quebec’s history.
Marois was blasted for her comments, published in Le Devoir, that equated what she called the English model of multiculturalism with bombings. Despite outrage across Canada, with many calling the Charter xenophobic in its selectiveness, the PQ still plans to slowly implement the plan in a step-by-step manner.

Construction completion date pushed to December
The annual McGill Book Fair will be cancelled this year due to ongoing construction outside of Redpath and McLennan libraries. This is the first time since its initiation in 1971 that the fair has been cancelled.
The late August press release announcing the cancellation stated that the fair was scheduled to run this year from October 22 to 24. According to Sally Cooper, the coordinator of the Book Fair, the 2013 date had been known “for about three years,” as most dates are scheduled years in advance.
The fair is usually held in the autumn of each year, and is entirely volunteer-led. Over the decades since its inception, the fair has raised funds of over $1.6 million, with all proceeds donated toward providing McGill scholarships.
Dan Doran, the Associate Director of Project Management in Facilities, Operations, and Development – part of University Services – addressed the ongoing construction in an email to The Daily.
“The Book Fair had always been scheduled at a time that would conflict with the terrace construction,” said Doran.
Prior to construction, during the planning portion of the project, a meeting occurred between Doran, the project manager, and all the project stakeholders where “it was explained that the Book Fair this year would not be able to be held in its normal location.”
Cooper said that the “decision to cancel was taken by a group of volunteers during the summer,” and was then brought to the attention of Vice-Principal (Development and Alumni Relations) Marc Weinstein and the McGill community.
Despite the fair’s cancellation, Cooper told The Daily that the staff has continued sorting and pricing the books they have received, and intends on collecting books again in the spring for next year’s fair.
According to Cooper, as construction continued earlier this year around Redpath, the prospects for the fair appeared dimmer. “At first it seemed that [the construction] wouldn’t be too big a problem, but then we heard more details and discovered that they would […be] closing all the doors that open onto the terrace,” she said.
As construction regulations required that a wall be built across the fair’s space in the basement in order to replace the Redpath windows, volunteers were left without an adequate entrance or exit.
“We tried to find another way to keep bringing in the books, but nothing worked so we made the decision to stop accepting books after June 6,” Cooper said.
That lack of space, combined with delays from the Quebec construction strike, left few options to fair organizers other than to cancel.
Despite the cancellation being “unfortunate,” Cooper confirmed that “the only safe thing to do was cancel the sale,” and acknowledged that the ongoing construction is “very badly needed.”
The projected date of completion for the construction was November 15, but because of construction strikes during the summer, the date has been extended several weeks.
The province-wide strike involved 175,000 construction workers in Quebec. After two weeks, the 77,000 workers that had not negotiated an end to the strike were forced back to work by Bill 54, which threatened to fine groups and individuals who refused to comply.
The tentative completion date for the library construction has now been set for early- to mid-December. According to organizers, the annual Book Fair will resume in October 2014.

Services suffer after budget cuts
As of September 1, McGill Mental Health Services and McGill Counselling Services have both implemented a one-time $20 registration fee for new and returning students who wish to use their services. In addition, both services have put a flexible cap on the number of sessions a student can have at 16 and 15, respectively.
The decision to implement this direct fee was envisioned years ago as a way of managing demand for services that increased faster than enrolment, according to Jana Luker, Executive Director of Student Services. She also strongly emphasized that no student would ever be turned away if they could not pay the fee.
Both Mental Health and Counselling Services fall under under the funding of Student Services. 70 per cent of the Student Services budget comes from student fees, while the other 30 per cent comes from McGill’s operating budget.
It was in this 30 per cent that budget cuts hit the hardest, Luker explained. Student Services lost almost $500,000 due to university-wide budget cuts. Instead of limiting clinical hours or increasing wait times, the $20 fee was the “best thing in a not-so-great world,” in Luker’s words, that could be done to mitigate the loss.
Dr. Vera Romano, head of Counselling Services, told The Daily that all of the money would go directly toward access for students through paying staff and preserving innovative services. “It’s not like an accumulation of funds to be used elsewhere or later, it’s like now,” Romano said.
However, Romano admitted that as a service relying on a social justice model, they were “worried about privatization” but felt it was necessary to keep the quality of service.
According to Dr. Robert Franck, head of Mental Health Services, paying for the contracts of salaried staff is a big expense for Mental Health Services, and the $20 registration fee will help cushion the blow. “Last year, our mental health budget was in a severe deficit because we had put on contract a number of psychologists who were specialised in certain services, especially cognitive behaviour therapy,” Franck told The Daily.
Long wait times at Mental Health and Counselling Services have been a common complaint of students. According to Franck, in November 2012, Mental Health Services had 480 students on their waiting list, 280 of whom were waiting for a first appointment. According to Romano, getting a session at Counselling Services takes around four to six weeks, but without the fee and cap, would shoot up to eight weeks or more, she estimated.
Both Franck and Romano told The Daily that compared to getting a first appointment, obtaining regular therapy involves longer waiting times. “That is what we are trying to address with the 16 session limit,” Franck said. “[We want] to create turnover, so that students [… would] not have to wait on the waiting list for therapy.”
15 or 16 sessions, according to Romano, was not just an arbitrary number. “Usually Counselling Services works from a short-term model because we work from a positive psychology, resilience-based model,” Romano said. “We don’t believe that most students will need counselling or psychotherapy for years and years. But some do, so we do provide those as well.”
“Honestly, because we don’t have enough staff, the reality is, even if we did not have the session limit, in reality most students could not be seen more than that, because there’s more and more students seeking services,” Romano added.
However, Franck was careful to point out that the cap was flexible, and that no student would be turned away if they needed more help. According to Franck, if students needed long-term care and had access to their parents’ insurance, one solution would be to refer them outside of McGill. If not, “we will follow them, we’re not going to just abandon somebody who […] is going to need ongoing care.”
Because of emergency intake, possibilities for long-term care, and other services provided such as group therapy, “we don’t believe that vulnerable students are falling through the cracks,” Romano said.
SSMU VP University Affairs Joey Shea acknowledged that it was unfortunate that Student Services, one of the most “pro-student” units at McGill, had to take these cuts, but pointed to the larger picture.
“It’s part of a trend where services can no longer be provided by the University and therefore students are paying more directly, or are responsible for the financial burden essentially,” Shea said.
