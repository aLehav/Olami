Students grow impatient with University’s lack of communication
McGill has yet to confirm student refunds on the tuition fee increase following its official cancellation last week by Quebec premier Pauline Marois.
In August, McGill billed students the first $254 installment of the tuition hike planned by the Liberal government. Tuition was set to increase by $254 every year for seven years.
McGill students were required to pay their tuitions bills by August 31. Students receiving financial aid could request to defer payment.
According to Le Devoir, other Quebec universities also billed students the tuition fee increase this summer.
In response to the September 4 election of the Parti Québécois (PQ), which promised to cancel the tuition hike, McGill published a “Statement on changes in Quebec tuition policy.” In the statement, the University said it was waiting on “official directives” from the government before updating student bills or beginning a refund process.
McGill did not email students about the statement, which was published on the Student Accounts page of the University’s website.
The PQ government officially cancelled the tuition hike by ministerial decree on September 20.
McGill Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet told The Daily, “we have yet to receive official confirmation, but we expect that student accounts will be credited with the difference between what they paid in tuition and the new fee structure soon after we do.”
Sweet could not confirm that refunds would be offered. “Refunds may be issued, but I don’t have details of the process,” he said.
Matthew, a U3 History student who wished to be identified by first name only, told The Daily, “The government, the day they were elected, said the hike was over. It has been almost a month and the school is still waiting for so-called official word.”
“Is this supposed be a secret thing? Are we going to find out one day that the money reappeared in our account?” he said.
McGill’s slow response has affected the start of the semester for students like Matthew. “It would be important to actually have the cash back, as someone who pays my own tuition, so I can finish buying my textbooks,” he said.
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser told The Daily that the student union “will be asking the University about [the tuition refund] next week if it still looks like they aren’t doing anything about it.”
U4 Middle East studies student Robert Bell said he is not satisfied with SSMU’s response to date. “They are not responding adequately to the issue, but when have they ever? It is a shameful abdication of their responsibility to ensure the economic welfare of their constituency,” he said.
McGill’s operational budget will be unaffected by the change in tuition in 2012-2013 because the PQ government has promised to maintain expected levels of funding by making up the difference caused by the cancellation of the tuition fee increase, according to Sweet.
“The longer view remains cloudy and we’ll have to wait for the summit on higher education to get a clearer picture of where we’ll stand,” said Sweet.
The PQ government is planning a summit on higher education this fall. Strategies for funding higher education, such as the indexation of tuition fees to inflation, will be discussed.
Newly-appointed Higher Education Minister Pierre Duchesne is expected to invite major student federations Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec, and Coalition large de l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante to the summit, as well as Table de concertation étudiante du Québec, SSMU’s official negotiating representative.

On July 12, La Presse reported that the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) had seen a 25 per cent decrease in sexual assault reports since 2007. However, SPVM spokesperson Laurent Gingras told The Daily, “in reality the number of reports of sexual assault since 2007 has been going up.”
This statement is supported by the 2011 SPVM annual report, which reported 1256 cases of sexual assault last year – a slight decrease from 2007, when 1320 cases were reported, but nowhere near the 25 percent decrease reported by La Presse.
2010 also saw a jump in the number of sexual assault cases, which numbered 1,597, according to the SPVM report.
Gingras said that some of the increases in reports could be due to recent media coverage.
“There have been a couple incidents that have been publicized because they happened to known persons of the public, which has made more people come forward with these assaults,” said Gingras.
Deborah Trent, director of the Montreal Sexual Assault Centre, said that the organization has not seen any decrease in the number of people who require their services.
“[The police statistics] are just the reported ones,” Trent told The Daily.
“Many [survivors of sexual assault] don’t come forward because they’re afraid. They’re afraid of violence or retribution…they’re afraid that they’re not going to be believed, they don’t believe it themselves, they want to forget about it,” she said.
However, Trent expressed optimism at survivors’ increased willingness to report assault. “I think that over the years there are more people that report [sexual assault] than used to years ago,” she said.
Vancouver has seen a similar confusion over sexual assault statistics.
In reaction to the Vancouver Police Department’s release of statistics showing a decrease in sexual assault, the Vancouver Rape Crisis Centre (VRCC) stated that they have been receiving a consistently increasing number of calls for their services and are especially concerned with whether women are able to view the police as a safe service.
“It is clear that while women trust women’s services to assist them after being attacked, they obviously do not trust the state agent that is responsible to protect women from male violence: the police,” VRCC spokesperson Hilla Kerner told The Daily.
“There is nothing to celebrate about the decrease of sexual assault reports to police in British Columbia,” added Kerner.
This summer, a class action lawsuit was launched against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) regarding the sexual harassment of female officers, with at least 200 complaints, according to the CBC.
In July, RCMP Recruiter Supt. Maria Nickel stated that women “need to rely on that inner strength” when faced with harassment on the job.
Kerner explained that this lack of concern for sexual harassment issues within the RCMP’s own ranks may inhibit survivors from coming forward with their own complaints about sexual assault.
“Their behaviour toward sexism within the RCMP just reinforces distrust,” she said.

Pledges support to Gay Village and Iranian LGBTQ community
Queer McGill (QM) held its Fall General Assembly (GA) on Tuesday in the wake of internal restructuring.
GA chairs Grace Khare and Aliénor Lemieux-Cumberlege began by introducing a new organizational structure based on working groups, which according to Lemieux-Cumberlege would “involve more people, incite more discussions and debates, and be more inclusive of member interests.”
These would include first years and newcomers, francophone, queer people of colour, and trans* working groups.
There will also be a political action working group, a social working group, and Allies Montréal and QueerLine working groups.
Following a financial report by the Finance Coordinator and the election of Kimberly Bae as the new External Communications Coordinator, two motions were put forth.
The first, “An Inclusive Village,” was a critique of the increased policing of Montreal’s Gay Village due to the alleged presence of “undesirables,” a term sometimes used to refer to the homeless, drug addicts, and sex workers who reside in the Village.
The motion received an ambivalent reaction from the constituency as many felt it ignored the necessity of the presence of vigilance in the area.
It was amended to affirm QM’s commitment to the introduction of social work organizations to the Village as an alternative to an “oppressive increase” in police presence.
The amended motion passed with 15 for, seven against, and seven abstentions.
The second motion, “War With Iran,” condemned the “ill-treatment of LGBT communities in Iran” but “opposed it being used as a justification for a potential war on the country.”
A number of people at the GA claimed that the motion had misplaced intentions.
Former QM Resource Coordinator Edward Langstone said, “Queer people don’t necessarily want to be contextualized in a political light.”
Another attendee felt that the motion was too “queer-centric” and that it ignored the much larger context of the Iranian conflict.
QM council member Eliot Hautefeuille claimed that the motion was “not representative of all the [constituents] of Queer McGill,” as it unnecessarily politicized what was meant to be a social group.
Many others, however, were in favour of the motion and its message.
One attendee – who said she was Iranian by birth – supported the motion and stated, “Wars are never fought over human rights. They never have [been] and never will. The use of queers as an excuse for a dreadful thing like war is unacceptable.”
In the end, the motion passed on computers at the GA.

Plans for a student-run cafe in the Shatner building are ongoing, according to SSMU VP Finance and Operations Jean-Paul Briggs, but they are also contending with several major hurdles.
Chief among them is SSMU’s precarious financial situation as a result of the University requiring SSMU to begin paying for part of Shatner’s utilities – a sum entirely covered by McGill in previous leases.
“That’s not to say that we’re not committed to [a student-run cafe], or at least seeing if it’s possible,” said Briggs.
Because lease negotiations are ongoing and confidential, SSMU executives could not tell The Daily the percentage of utilities SSMU expects to pay in coming years, nor by how much their rent is set to increase.
The preliminary SSMU budget for 2012-2013, however, forecasts a $214,478 deficit, the majority of which Briggs ascribes to increased rent and utilities cost-sharing.
The student union has traditionally broken even in years past.
While a student-run cafe has been a potential project for SSMU in the past, the 2010 closure of the Architecture Café precipitated campus-wide mobilization and spurred last year’s executive to spearhead a two-year plan with the goal of opening a Shatner building student-run cafe in fall 2013.
A major problem, however, appears to be significant miscommunication between this year and last year’s SSMU executives. Both Briggs and SSMU President Josh Redel said they took office assuming that a lot more had been done in terms of detailing the actual business model that the student-run cafe would adopt.
“It’s very frustrating, because we’re very dedicated to making this project happen, but a lot of the legwork we expected to be done wasn’t,” said Briggs.
“This was always supposed to be a two-year project,” said former VP Finance and Operations Shyam Patel, who led the student-run cafe initiative last year. “We did this strategically, other SSMU executives tried to rush the project…which is exactly why this was supposed to be a two-year brainstorm.”
The McGill Tribune reported on September 17 that plans for the cafe had been complicated by exclusivity contracts held by current Shatner lease-holders, which would prevent the student-run cafe from selling specialty coffees and teas, as well as a lack of space in the building.
However, Briggs told The Daily that these issues are in themselves are “not insurmountable” and that SSMU’s Operations Management Committee is conducting a feasibility study to assess how they might be dealt with. The feasibility study working groups will also charged with drawing up a detailed business plan for the cafe in conjunction with dealing with sustainability issues.
The groups will be finalized this week, said Briggs, and will likely begin meeting on a bi-monthly basis next week.
While the Shatner building is at fully occupancy, a lease with a current tenant could be allowed to expire. The problem, says Briggs, comes with the loss of revenue for the student union incurred by giving a space once occupied by a paying tenant to the student-run cafe, which would likely pay little to no rent to the union.

Statistics Canada admits data may be flawed
Statistics Canada released another set of data from its recent 2011 Canadian census, showing a general decrease in nuclear family structures since the last census was conducted in 2006. In particular, the census reported a diversification of family structure with an increase in same-sex couples and families.
In the past five years, the number of married couples has increased by 3.1 per cent, while the number of common-law couples saw a rise of 13.9 per cent.
The last census, taken in 2006, was taken months after the Civil Marriage Act made Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.
Since then, legal same-sex marriages have increased by 181 per cent, according to the National Post.
Despite this growth, the total number of legally married same-sex couples is still under 1 per cent of the wtotal married couples in Canada.
The National Post recently stated in a news article that the census results show that “The sanctity of marriage as the bedrock of the Canadian family is steadily eroding.”
According to Celine Le Bourdais, Canada Research Chair in Social Statistics and Family Change and professor of sociology at McGill, “There was no backlash here – especially not in Quebec – as there was in the United States.”
Mona Greenbaum, director of the Coalition des Familles Homoparentales, told The Daily she was skeptical about the reported increase in same-sex couples.
One possible reason for this is that the census may have counted roommates as married gay couples.
“Roommates who are married – just not to each other – could have been counted as a couple,” reported the CBC.
As a result, Statistics Canada admitted they could not tell in many cases whether two people were a cohabitating couple or strictly splitting the rent and may have overestimated as many as 4,500 same-sex married couples, according to the CBC.
“I know that in Quebec, there is a larger proportion who are cohabitating. Four out of five were common-law couples – they were not married. This goes along with [the fact that] in Quebec people get married less,” said Le Bourdais.
The census also reported that more cohabitating couples, which includes both same-sex and heterosexual couples, were having children.
Although the majority of married same-sex couples were male, those with children were overwhelmingly found to be two females.
“Since the 2002 reform of the Civil Code we have had different ways to start our families,” said Greenbaum.
