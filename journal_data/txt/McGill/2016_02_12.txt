Documents reveal company had taken legal action against McGill

On February 11, the McGill Board of Governors (BoG) voted to grant the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) the right to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline through two tracts of land in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, in which McGill owns an interest, bequeathed to it in the 1950s.
According to McGill’s Internal Communications Director Doug Sweet, although McGill did not purchase this property, it has “continued to pay small amounts of tax annually, as is its responsibility as a property owner,” apart from a small delay in covering approximately $150 in 2014.
According to the Building and Property Committee’s report to the BoG, “the property is valued at US $11,000. Transco has offered to pay US $15,418 in compensation.”
The Daily discovered that Transco filed a “complaint for condemnation of pipeline right-of-way and servitude and/or surface servitude” on November 18, 2015, against McGill and other entities holding interest over forty acres of land in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.
“The property is valued at US $11,000. Transco has offered to pay US $15,418 in compensation.”
According to court documents obtained by The Daily, “Transco is the holder of a Certificate for Public Convenience and Necessity issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),” which gives it the right, under the U.S. Natural Gas Act, to legally acquire the right-of-way over private property.
More specifically, the certificate allows Transco to “construct, operate, and maintain a pipeline or pipelines for the transportation of natural gas” even if Transco and the owner of the property – in this case McGill – cannot come to an agreement. When that is the case, the company “may acquire the [rights to do so] by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court.”
Sweet told The Daily in an email that “Transco […] has the right to take the property for public use […] in the event no agreement is reached on obtaining a servitude.”
This seems to be the case, as court documents indicate that Transco had attempted to “amicably purchase” the property rights from McGill and other landowners “for at least the true fair market value of the property interests,” however the landowners “rejected that offer.”
McGill was issued a notice on December 11, 2015, explaining that “Transco [had] the right of eminent domain under the Natural Gas Act […] because it cannot, despite good faith efforts, acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with owner of the interest sought to the compensation to be paid for the necessary right-of-way to construct, operate, and maintain the project for the transportation of natural gas.”
When this was brought to the BoG’s attention at the February 11 meeting, some directors expressed their concern about the lack of study done regarding the pipeline’s environmental impacts.
“We kind of have a gun to our heads here.”
Speaking at the meeting, Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Secretary-General Danielle Toccalino said, “The goal of McGill being in the forefront of mitigating climate change and moving to a more carbon-neutral economy should be taken into consideration.”
In response, BoG Chair Stuart “Kip” Cobbett said, “We kind of have a gun to our heads here.”
Sweet said, “The Board [of Governors] decided [on February 11] that it would better serve McGill’s interests to accept that offer rather than be subject to whatever a court might decide in terms of compensation for a right of servitudes that, under U.S. law, would be granted in any case.”

BRIEF
Just before the McGill Board of Governors (BoG) meeting on February 11, around thirty demonstrators, organized by the campus climate justice group Divest McGill, rallied outside the James Administration building.
The demonstrators stood in front of the main entrance of the James Administration building, holding signs that said “Divest McGill” and chanting, “Get on the podium, divest from petroleum.”
In an interview with The Daily, Benji Astrachan, U2 World Religions and International Development Studies student and a member of Divest McGill, said, “We just wanted to make sure that our presence was loud and clear, and that they knew that we’re there and we’ll continue to be there.”
“Climate, today, is at the intersection of several struggles which link racialized people and people who are socioeconomically disfavoured.”
Since 2012, Divest McGill has submitted several petitions to the BoG’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), urging the University to divest from Canadian tar sands and the fossil fuel industry.
Divest McGill has since garnered the endorsement of faculty and staff. For example, in November, the Arts Faculty Council voted to endorse the campaign.
Three years of consistent campus advocacy have failed to influence McGill’s investment portfolio. Divest McGill alleges that the University has incurred an estimated $43 million in losses stemming from its current investment holdings during the time it has spent considering Divest McGill’s petitions.
At a CAMSR meeting on October 22, CAMSR Chair Stuart “Kip” Cobbett had said that “[CAMSR would] have a decision by early next year. Certainly by the March 30 deadline.” However, Cobbett had also added, “This is not a drop-dead deadline, because stuff happens.”
In an interview with The Daily, Gregoire Beaune, U3 Political Science and Philosophy student and a participant at the rally, said, “For me, [climate justice] goes beyond just the climate. […] Climate, today, is at the intersection of several struggles which link racialized people and people who are socioeconomically disfavoured.”
“Divesting from fossil fuels […] is more than just asking for a green campus. It’s asking for an ethical campus – one that is aware of the repercussions of its investments and also aware of the world around it,” Beaune said.
