Kiosks around campus will offer safer sex items
The Shag Shop will provisionally open up as an online store this fall after closing in April. As no replacement has been found for its previous physical location next to the Student Health clinic, free safer sex and health items will now be available at Student Health Services, as well as at other locations around campus such as Dave’s Store (in the basement of the Bronfman building), and the main floor washroom of Thomson House.
The Shag Shop opened in 2005 as a sexual health boutique run by Student Health Services. Its former location is being repurposed as an accessible entrance to the First Peoples’ House.
According to Amanda Unruh, the health promotion coordinator at Student Health Services, the online store should be live by October, offering a subset of its previous selection. “We’re going to focus more on health items,” Unruh told The Daily in an interview. “The plan is to provide more connections with other online retailers that have a wider variety of sex toys.”
In addition to safer sex items, such as condoms and lube, the new kiosks around campus will be offering various other health-related items. “Right now we’re handing out a lot of sunscreen and sunglasses, but then throughout the year perhaps [we’ll have] more pertinent health items like earplugs, [dams], and moisturizers, things like that,” said Unruh.
Former Shag Shop volunteer Alice Gauntley expressed disappointment with the fact that, although some of the products remain available, students have lost access to a space where they could receive information and advice on their sexual health.
“I was sad to learn that the Shop will no longer be able to offer students a private, accessible, non-judgemental physical location in which to access sexual health items and information,” Gauntley wrote in an email to The Daily.
“A move to an online store and smaller kiosks all over campus might reach new and different folks, which would be super exciting,” added Gauntley. “But I remain frustrated that the shop, which has proven itself a haven for myself and many others, was not offered a suitable place elsewhere on campus to relocate.”
Unruh indicated that the search for a new location will continue after the online store is set up, but noted that the Shop has particular requirements that make the search difficult.
“It needs to be in a discreet location, and it needs to be in a place that is easily accessible and that is easy to direct people to, but [such that it’s] not obvious that people are going there,” explained Unruh.
“There [were] a number of options […] but we do need to have more privacy when it comes to the store. So, there would have to be additional walls and sound barriers installed so that people felt private when they were shopping, and also so that if they asked questions about their sexual health, they would feel as though it was a private matter and that people outside couldn’t hear.”

April Fools Day election invalidation no laughing matter for Tariq Khan
McGill undergraduates found themselves perplexed on April 1 as they received an email announcing the invalidation of the election of Tariq Khan as Students’ Society of McGill University’s (SSMU) president. This decision, rendered by Elections SSMU, appointed runner-up Courtney Ayukawa as president.
Before the invalidation, Elections SSMU had publicly censured Khan once during his presidential campaign for having “explicitly asked a non-campaign committee member to send unsolicited text messages to members of the public.” The public censure was announced on March 21, the last day of the campaign period and also the day of Khan’s election as SSMU president by a margin of only 78 votes.
The bylaw infractions that caused his invalidation, Elections SSMU claimed, included the participation of “individuals external to SSMU in his campaign,” the sending of “unsolicited messages regarding his campaign,” “inconsistencies with campaign expenditures,” as well as the “impingement of the spirit of a fair campaign and of the voting process.”
Khan’s invalidation led to the retraction of a then-ongoing SSMU Judicial Board case against Elections SSMU alleging improper handling of Khan’s campaign team’s bylaw infractions, the details of which were leaked to The Daily in early April.
Following his invalidation, Khan appealed to the Judicial Board. However, the Judicial Board unanimously upheld the invalidation on April 29, and the decision was ratified by SSMU’s Board of Directors on April 30.
A month later, Khan informed The Daily of his decision to file a case to the Superior Court of Quebec against Elections SSMU to contest the invalidation of his presidential election. He charged Elections SSMU with violating his basic human rights throughout the process of his invalidation, such as his right to a presumption of innocence and his right to cross-examine witnesses.
On May 29, Khan filed a request to the Court for a preliminary injunction to reinstate him as SSMU president until the case was heard in its entirety. The Superior Court dismissed the application in a decision rendered on June 3 on the basis that a provisional injunction would cause undue inconvenience and inflict additional costs on SSMU.
The full hearing of Khan’s case will be taking place this fall.

Presiding judge expresses confusion over CFS disassociation procedures
Update: On September 9, Ge Sa informed The Daily that the lawsuit was successful. PGSS will be holding a referendum to decide whether or not it will leave CFS.
On August 28 and 29, the Superior Court of Quebec held a trial regarding the lawsuit of Ge Sa, Internal Affairs Officer of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), against the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS). The suit was filed in response to CFS’ failure to process a petition submitted by Sa asking to hold a referendum to disassociate PGSS from CFS; if the case is successful, PGSS will be allowed to hold the referendum.
Sa’s suit, filed as an individual and not on behalf of PGSS, comes after a hearing on March 18 where the courts voted to allow Sa’s case to be heard. This occurred after CFS failed to respond to Sa’s petition to hold a referendum to leave CFS; however, the petition was recognized as valid by CFS on August 26, just two days before the trial.
In 2010, PGSS filed a case against CFS after CFS refused to recognize the results of a referendum to leave the organization in 2010. The lawsuit is still in progress, which, last March, prompted Sa to file an individual suit to prevent CFS from collecting membership fees during the duration of PGSS’ lawsuit.
“I believe that the McGill students have spoken [in the 2010 referendum], and CFS has refused to recognize this,” said Sa in an interview with The Daily. “It’s important to reiterate the fact that […] the students still want to have our voices heard, and to make sure that the members of our society still support our court case.”
In the motion they presented at the trial, Sa’s lawyers requested that the court compel CFS to let PGSS present its members with the following referendum question: “Are you in favour of continued membership of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society of McGill University Inc. in the Canadian Federation of Students?”
“You can’t keep collecting fees from us, and putting us on your website, and denying our rights to be heard.”
François Viau, the lawyer representing CFS, argued that Sa’s case constituted an abuse of power under article 54.1 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, which allows for a court to declare that an action or pleading is improper and, as a result, to “impose a sanction on the party concerned.”
Referring back to the case launched by PGSS in 2010, Viau argued that there was a contradiction between these two cases. PGSS’ official stance in its case is that it is no longer a member of CFS, while in Sa’s case, according to Viau, it is assumed that PGSS is still a member and is willing to abide by CFS’ bylaws.
“Can’t have your cake and eat it too,” said Viau during the trial.
However, Sa argued that it is CFS that is trying to have it both ways. “They are saying things, whatever suits them in different situations,” said Sa. “On their website they list us as members because it is good publicity for them.”
“In the first court case with PGSS, I think they are claiming we are still members to get the $300,000 [in unpaid fees] in question. And in my case, [CFS argues that] we are clearly not members, so that they don’t have to give us a referendum. You can’t keep collecting fees from us, and putting us on your website, and denying our rights to be heard,” Sa told The Daily.
Viau further noted that even if a referendum was held, CFS would not have a fair shot at holding an electoral campaign, given that PGSS has been considering CFS to be persona non grata on campus since the 2010 referendum. During her cross-examination, CFS staffer Lucy Watson said that PGSS has not been giving positive visibility to CFS, even though CFS have been trying to contact PGSS members and collaborate with them over various issues.
Watson told The Daily that, as she is not an official CFS spokesperson, she could not answer questions from the press.
Sa emphasized why the opportunity for a disassociation referendum was important. “I, personally, and many other people in PGSS, believe that CFS has no presence in Quebec, and higher education is a provincial matter, and they have not been representing McGill students.”
Gérard Dugré, the presiding judge, expressed during the trial that he was hesitant about making a judgement that could contradict the outcome of the ongoing litigation between PGSS and CFS.
At the end of two days of hearings, Dugré was not able to reach a final verdict and said to the court that he would deliberate over the weekend. However, he did comment on the peculiarity of CFS’ disassociation process. “Shouldn’t you be able to associate and disassociate as easily as possible? If it’s easy to associate, normally, it should be easy to disassociate.”

Highlights from the summer
It’s been quite a summer! While you were away, activists took to the streets of Montreal on numerous occasions, while the university has seen drama in student politics, new hirings in the administration, and changes in the labour scene. In case you missed anything, here is a look at some highlights from the last four months.
On May 6, the McGill floor fellows’ union drive came to an end when their request to unionize under the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) was accepted by Quebec’s Commission des relations du travail.
On August 29, the floor fellows held their first annual general meeting and elected Christina Clemente as VP Floor Fellows. The unit is entering into collective bargaining this fall.
In June, student organizers who were active in the 2011-12 Quebec student strike hosted a four-day international convention during which they shared lessons and experiences with like-minded attendees from across North America. Members of the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), a student union federation, led a variety of workshops and discussed their organizations direct democratic decision-making process. Organizers of the convention also dedicated a significant amount of time to workshops on feminist and anti-racist practices, highlighting the challenges students face as they attempt to build an inclusive movement. The convention allowed participants to make connections with other activists and build international solidarity, though some attendees found many workshops too theoretical and hard to apply.
August 9 marked the sixth anniversary of the shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Fredy Villanueva by a Montreal police officer, who has yet to face serious consequences for his actions. Montreal North community members held a candlelight vigil at the site where Villanueva was shot to commemorate his life and demand justice. On the same day, a few hours before the vigil, another unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown, was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, leading to an uprising in the Ferguson community. A week later, nearly 100 Montrealers gathered for a vigil in solidarity with the Ferguson protests to speak out against police violence and its intersection with institutionalized racism.
On July 7, the construction of a three-story condo began on a razed laneway garden that was known as Parc Oxygène in the Milton-Parc community. The neighbourhood’s beloved green space was destroyed on June 26, a few days after the Superior Court refused a safeguard order to the Milton Park Community (CMP) housing cooperative network that would have stopped a condo developer from bulldozing the garden. The board of the CMP has chosen not to appeal the decision for the time being.
On June 14, about 75 people staged a dance-a-thon at Place de la Paix. The demonstration was part of a national day of action during which sex workers and their allies protested the content of the proposed Bill C-36, which criminalizes sex work more severely than ever before in Canada. Bill C-36 is the Conservative government’s response to the Supreme Court’s December ruling on Canada v. Bedford, in which the court unanimously struck down three central provisions of Canadian sex work legislation and left the government one year to draft a new law. 
McGill has hired Sophie Leblanc as its new Chief Investment Officer to oversee the endowment fund and pension plan. Leblanc will take advice on the ethical side of McGill’s investments from the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), whose terms of reference were recently updated to expand the definition of social injury, which now includes ìgrave environmental damage.î In light of these developments, it remains to be seen whether Leblanc will be more receptive than her predecessor John Limeburner to Divest McGill’s demand that McGill divest from the fossil fuel industry.
On July 25, Accessibilize Montreal organized a protest outside the Place-des-Arts metro station to speak out against the inaccessibility of Montreal’s public transportation system for people with disabilities. Accessibilize called on the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) to install more elevators in metro stations and install more ramps on buses, as currently only seven out of 68 metro stations have elevator access – of which only four are on the island – and not all STM buses have ramps installed.

University reacts to news with investigation of hiring practices
On July 23, CBC broke the news that Ian Sheriff, one of the former McGill Redmen football players facing sexual assault charges, was working at a youth program run by McGill Athletics for children ages 6 to 15. The public outcry following the story prompted reactions from the administration, including a statement from Provost Anthony Masi condemning Sheriff’s hire, and the formation of a committee with the purpose of reviewing the hire, as well as general hiring processes at McGill.
Sheriff, along with his then teammates Brenden Carriere and Guillaume Tremblay, was charged in July 2012 with the sexual assault of a former Concordia student. The three faced no disciplinary action from McGill or the Redmen football team, and only after the charges were publicized in the Montreal Gazette in the fall of 2013 did McGill commit to addressing the issue of sexual assault. In March, McGill held a Forum on Consent and created a Liaison Officer (Harm Reduction) position.
The CBC article has now brought to light the fact that Sheriff had been working at McGill for the past three years despite the sexual assault charges. An anonymous source told The Daily that his job at the camp involved working with children of all age groups, and that in the summer of 2013 he was a counsellor for a group of eight- to ten-year-old boys, even though, according to Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens’ comments in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, McGill had been made aware of the charges in May 2013.
The Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS) expressed disappointment at the news of Sheriff’s hiring.
“SACOMSS was surprised and dismayed to learn that one of the people involved in this case continued to be employed by McGill and acting as a University representative late into this summer,” read a statement released by the organization.
SACOMSS also urged the administration to review its hiring policies, and called for the creation of a sexual assault policy at McGill, “which would assist in navigating areas such as University employment.”
“It is clear that much work needs to be done on and off campus for McGill to be a safer space for survivors of sexual assault,” SACOMSS concluded.
SACOMSS’ comments followed a statement released by Masi on behalf of the administration on July 23, in which Masi condemned the hiring of Sheriff at the university’s sports camp and implied that it likely occurred due to an error by the Athletics department. Masi claimed that, as of that evening, Sheriff was no longer working at the sports camp. He also asserted that Sheriff would not be returning to the Athletics department or to McGill – which would have been unlikely in any case, as Sheriff graduated from McGill’s Economics program in May.
Masi told CBC that he had found out about Sheriff’s employment at the camp only after reading its article on the subject, published earlier that day.
In an interview with The Daily, Dean of Students Andre Costopoulos was unable to confirm whether Sheriff had been fired or had quit. Indeed, all he added to Masi’s statement was that an ad-hoc committee had been formed to review the situation.
“The mandate of the committee will be to look into this particular incident and to look at policies and procedures more broadly,” explained Costopoulos. The committee’s terms of reference have been established, though it has yet to release any reports.

Three Redmen football players – Ian Sheriff, Guillaume Tremblay, and Brenden Carriere – allegedly sexually assault a Concordia student.
The three players are arrested for sexual assault.
Sheriff, Tremblay, and Carriere are officially charged with sexual assault with a weapon. They are also charged with forcible confinement, though this charge is later dropped. The players face no disciplinary action from the University.
McGill is made aware of sexual assault charges, according to Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens’ comments in an interview with the Montreal Gazette.
The Montreal Gazette publishes an article that details the now 16-month-old sexual assault charges, noting that all three players are still on the football team. The three Redmen players involved quit the football team after the charges against them are made public. Dyens releases a statement from McGill that addresses the case.
[/raw]
Full statement from SACOMSS:
After we learned last November that three McGill students are under investigation for sexual assault and continued to act as student ambassadors on the football team during this time, many difficult and productive conversations began regarding the appropriate role of these students on campus and within McGill athletics. Therefore, SACOMSS was surprised and dismayed to learn that one of the people involved in this case continued to be employed by McGill and acting as a University representative late into this summer. We remain concerned and confused regarding this update, and we hope that Provost Masi and McGill’s stated commitment to a thorough review of their hiring policies will be followed through in the very near future. We also remain committed to the development of a sexual assault policy at McGill, the creation of which would assist in navigating areas such as University employment. It is clear that much work needs to be done on and off campus for McGill to be a safer space for survivors of sexual assault.
