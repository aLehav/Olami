On September 17, 2019, Israel held snap elections to elect the 22nd Knesset, with Benjamin Netanyahu (Likud) and Benny Gantz (Blue and White) competing to form a coalition government. The vast majority of Palestinians were, as usual, deprived of the right to vote.
Netanyahu has been given 42 days to create a coalition government by negotiating with the other parties that form the Knesset. His last attempt, in April of 2019, was the first failure to form a coalition government in Israeli history. If he succeeds this time, Netanyahu will enter his fifth term, becoming Israel’s longest-reigning prime minister.
Netanyahu ran his campaign on violent colonial promises and racist, hypernationalist anti-Arab statements, including a promise to annex the Jordan Valley. In a segment for the BBC World News, human rights attorney and Jadaliyya co-editor Noura Erakat discussed this promise and the election as a whole. Erakat explained that there is “very little difference between [the two parties] except in rhetoric,” clarifying that the Blue and White claimed that “[Netanyahu] stole the idea [of annexation] from them.” Both parties in question are advancing further violence on Palestinians in the Jordan Valley, which is already under a de facto annexation, which stands in violation of international law.
The Joint List, an alliance of Arab-Israeli parties, was the third largest coalition in this election cycle – something Erakat finds encouraging. The Blue and White party is opposed to allying itself with the Joint List, directly due to Gantz’s refusal to align with non-Zionist parties. The head of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, expressed that he would be interested in working with the Blue and White only if they shared common direction, and stated that the Joint List is “not in his [Gantz’s] pocket. He will have to come to us.”
For Palestinians already living under a violent occupation, the election has no positive outcomes. The international community’s inaction in the face of illegal occupation is itself a violation of human rights. Responding to the threat of further, explicit annexation of the Jordan Valley, Erakat asks, “Why are we leaving it to an election and to an Israeli leader to decide what international law has already prohibited?”

Vote To Take Place At Next Council
The second SSMU Legislative Council of the year took place on September 26, at which SSMU President Bryan Buraga spoke on the Motion Regarding Policy on Moratorium on McGill Fees Until Fossil Fuel Divestment.
If passed, the motion would, per Buraga, “establish a moratorium on all new ancillary fees, or other fees that require a referendum to our student body” and not affect bursaries, scholarships for students in need, or funding that faculties receive from McGill.
“We must demonstrate our resolve in the face of continued inaction on fossil fuel divestment by McGill University,” he told Council. “I trust that you will find that [your constituencies] will be willing to use our financial power to demonstrate just how important fossil fuel divestment is to our student body.”
The motion will be voted on at the next Council, which will take place on October 10.
An extended article on the past SSMU Legislative Council by Alex Karasick will also be available online.

AUS Meets Quorum for General Assembly
On September 26, approximately 900 Arts students filed into Leacock 132, filling every seat, sitting on the floor, stairs, or leaning on any wall space available. For the first time in years, the 500 Arts students needed to meet quorum were present, and the General Assembly (GA) was called to order. Earlier this month, Climate Justice Action McGill (C-JAM) sent a petition to the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) to call a GA, responding to the McGill Senate’s rejection of the student-led motion to cancel classes for the climate strike.
Ayo Ogunremi, political coordinator for the Black Students’ Network (BSN), co-founder of C-JAM, and an organizer of the AUS strike, opened the GA, calling out the University’s inaction in the movement for climate justice. Drawing attention to the fact that McGill is the only university in Montreal not to declare a climate emergency, as well as the sole university in Montreal not to cancel classes for the demonstration on September 27, Ogunremi argued that these decisions show a “total contempt for both the escalating environmental crisis that threatens the future of humanity, and the urgent demands of universal emancipation from oppression.” The room clearly agreed with Ogunremi’s ideas, which were met with clapping and cheering.
During question period, students requested clarification of the motion, including what the effect of a strike would be on students and the greater Montreal community; in response, organizers explained that students’ graduation would not be affected by a one day strike, but C-JAM spoke to the possible detriment on the province’s revenue, as well as the potential loss of skilled labour in Quebec’s economy, should McGill students undertake an extended strike. Another student asked how the soft picket lines would be enforced, to which organizers stated people would not be physically barred from Arts classes, but that they would be informed of the strike.
Ahead of voting, the motion’s official demands were stated. In their demands, AUS called on McGill to acknowledge the climate crisis and its disproportionate effect on “traditionally marginalized and oppressed populations that have also contributed least to the climate crisis.” They also press McGill to divest from its investments in fossil fuels, and to use its platform to pressure the Quebec and Canadian governments to recognize Indigenous peoples’ rights to the conservation and protection of the environment and their land, as stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Article 29. The meeting was concluded with a unanimous vote in favour of the motion.
The Faculty of Law, McGill’s MacDonald Campus Students’ Society, the McGill Environment Students’ Society, the Earth and Planetary Sciences Graduate Student Society, the Faculty of Nursing, and the Medical Students’ Society have all committed to striking as well. The Science Undergraduate Society has issued a statement in support of the climate strike, urging professors in the Faculty of Science to cancel classes and encouraging students to participate, but not officially striking.
On Friday morning, the vote was ratified with a 35.9 per cent voter turnout: 2887 students voted yes, 82 voted no, and 53 abstained their vote.

XR Recruits at McGill
On September 20, Extinction Rebellion (XR) gave a presentation at McGill entitled “Heading to Extinction,” introducing XR’s mission and strategies to students, with the ultimate goal of forming an autonomous XR cell at McGill. Also present were two professors, Derek Nystrom and Darin Barney, who stepped down from the Board of Governors earlier this year in protest of the Board’s likely decision not to divest from fossil fuels. While XR is a group that centres itself around the issue of climate change, this presentation went far beyond the environmental impacts of climate change. Specifically, it recognized how the environmental aspect of the climate crisis is a product of a greater system unsuitable to humanity’s longevity.
XR is a movement that began in the United Kingdom but has since spread internationally, likely due to their strategy of autonomy and decentralisation. They offer groups the tools and guidance to join the movement and then encourage groups to plan direct action, offering to support them with legal aid. This method is part of what they call “creating a regenerative culture.”
Their activism is based upon the principle of non-violent civil disobedience. Ultimately, they imagine a future where civil disobedience – resulting in widespread arrests – disrupts the economic and political systems enough to the point where those in positions of authority are forced to submit to change. In July of this year, 25 XR climate activists were arrested outside of McGill’s Roddick Gates after staging a sit-in in front of Premier François Legault’s office. This action is just one of many that they have carried out and plan to execute in the future, including a two week-long international rebellion event beginning on October 7.
XR’s presentation at McGill invited students to join their movement. At one point, the presenter asked audience members to raise their hands if they were willing to be arrested, to which a few of the audience members did so. The presenter told them to “remember who you are,” and later told the audience members to write an “A” next to their name on the sign-in sheet if they are willing to be arrested for their cause.
The attentive audience asked XR a series of tough questions, raising concerns regarding the place of marginalized groups within this style of activism. By default, encouraging mass arrests is a strategy that lends itself to be undertaken by the white majority, since marginalised groups face far greater risks when interacting with the police.
The presenter validated the importance of the question, and admitted that XR is still figuring things out as they go. Ultimately, they said, the issue of climate change and how to create a just transition for all is quite possibly the largest issue in human history, simply by the sheer number of individuals impacted.

Senate Reconvenes For The First Meeting of the Year



Content warning: mention of sexual violence
Continue or go back to the main page

On September 18, the first McGill Senate meeting of the year began with a question posed by Senators Madeline Wilson and Bryan Buraga regarding student concerns in light of Bill 21. This provincial legislation restricts public workers in positions of authority – including teachers and principals – from wearing religious symbols. Specifically, Senators Wilson and Buraga raised concerns about how students in the Faculty of Education who wear religious symbols will be affected when they complete their internships at primary school institutions. Further, they asked what McGill was doing to protect these students. Dilson Rassier, Dean of the Faculty of Education, explained that McGill is responding on a case-by-case basis, dealing directly with the institutions where affected students are interning.

“We have a few cases of students that showed some concerns,” Dean Rassier added that they “have contacted some specific schools” to ensure a safe environment for students in their placements. Just recently, a Francophone school board in Montreal refused to hire two teachers because they were wearing religious symbols.
Senate then addressed a motion to cancel classes on September 27 from 11:35 a.m. – 3:55 p.m., put forth in order to accommodate any students who planned to participate in the climate strike. Senator Wilson advocated in favour of the motion, saying that “to cancel classes would symbolize a clear stance on behalf of McGill with regards to the matter of climate justice.” Out of the four post-secondary institutions in Montreal – Concordia University, UQÀM, Université de Montreal, and McGill University – McGill is the only to not have canceled classes.
Dean Buddle failed to mention whether McGill would be giving up something of its own – perhaps its $1.3-billion endowment fund of fossil-fuel investments.
However, Dean of Students Christopher Buddle disagreed with the motion to cancel classes, contending that “the decision is not simple despite the magnitude of the problem of climate change.”
In response to Senator Wilson’s statement that numerous other Quebec universities have canceled classes, Dean Buddle went on to add that McGill is “ by no means […] obliged to follow other institutions; we do what is right for us and we lead by our example.”
With regards to the University’s moral stance, he stated that McGill “lead[s] by the principles that actually Greta Thunberg put forward which says strikes, by their very nature, are rebellious, and you have to give up something for impact.” However, Dean Buddle failed to mention whether McGill would be giving up something of its own – perhaps its $1.3-billion endowment fund of fossil-fuel investments.
“I will say that this has nothing to do with my commitment to climate action,” Dean Buddle stated, noting the personal decisions he makes with regards to environmental justice. He then added that he did not believe Senate to be the right place to bring up matters of class cancellations. Buddle seemed to imply that students needed to sacrifice their grades and studies, in order to make their point. “I actually don’t love the fact that we’re seeing widespread cancellation, because that’s not giving up something,” he stated. “I’ve been involved in many social justice movements in my life.”
“I think we have to make a decision as an institution – are we on the side of the people who are rebelling against this, or are we aligning ourselves with the institutions that are maintaining the status quo and asking the young people to do the heavy lifting of rebelling?” – Senator Nystrom
In response, Senator Nystrom told the Senate he agreed “this kind of activism requires a sacrifice,” but disagreed with Dean Buddle’s sentiments.
“I just don’t think we should just be asking young people to make that sacrifice, whereas we do not,” he stated, adding that climate change was mostly the fault of their generation as well as previous generations. “I think to turn to the young people and say ‘this is all on you’ – well, it’s already all on them. They’re the ones who are going to have to live with the consequences,” Senator Nystrom told the Senate.
“I think we have to make a decision as an institution – are we on the side of the people who are rebelling against this, or are we aligning ourselves with the institutions that are maintaining the status quo and asking the young people to do the heavy lifting of rebelling?”
As the debate ended, the motion was called to a vote. Out of the 111 eligible voting members of the Senate, only 21 voted in favour of canceling classes. The 21 votes in favour of the motion mostly consisted of student members; the motion failed with the majority voting against it.
Next, Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies) Angela Campbell presented the annual report on McGill’s Policy on Harassment & Discrimination Prohibited by Law. The report outlines the procedures for reporting harassment, as well as the official definitions of “harassment” and “discrimination prohibited by law.” The report also includes details about workshops and training that happened in the last year, which aim to prevent and address these issues.
Associate Provost Campbell started by quoting some of the statistical details from last year’s report, specifically noting the significant increase in harassment complaints. However, 89 per cent of all cases of harassment stopped at the inquiry stage. Specifically regarding cases of sexual harassment, she noted that they all involved the harassment of women, perpetrated by men. Out of these five specific cases of sexual harassment, four were deemed to be founded. However, out of the 12 cases investigated (not under the category of sexual harassment), none were deemed to be founded in the past year. In response, Senator Buraga asked Associate Provost Campbell why she thought there was an increase. Senator Campbell expressed her hopes that the increase in reporting could be attributed to an increase in awareness about reporting channels and the procedures available.
Deputy Provost Labeau told the Senate, “resilience is a skill you can learn.” Any mention of what’s being done to help students with existing mental illnesses and health issues remained sparse.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Fabrice Labeau also discussed the state of student mental health services, under the purview of the Committee on Student Services. He emphasized the impact of academic stress on student mental health and the need to revise McGill’s Assessment Policy. Senator Eperjesi asked for an elaboration on these efforts to address mental health, to which Deputy Provost Labeau reiterated the issue of academic stress, and pointed to the Wellness Hub as a way to help manage it. Characterized as a means for “healthy living training,” he described the Hub’s role as providing “early intervention and prevention of mental health issues.” Deputy Provost Labeau told the Senate, “resilience is a skill you can learn.” Any mention of what’s being done to help students with existing mental illnesses and health issues remained sparse.
Finally, Associate Provost Campbell presented the annual report of the Joint Board Senate Committee on Equity. SSMU Arts Senator Chloe Kemeni posed the question of whether the budget of $1000 for the Senate Sub-Committee on Racialized and Ethnic Persons would be increased in the future. In the report, the subcommittee stated that the current funding “is not a sustainable situation, and more funding should be provided to finance activities that support the McGill community, such as is done for other groups like Management Forum.” To name a few of these projects that are underfunded, they include inviting guest speakers to campus and developing a program for racialized student support. In response, Associate Provost Campbell stated that future increases in funding were unclear.
