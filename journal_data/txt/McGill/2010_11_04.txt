McGill’s new Board of Governor’s appointee target of possible suit
Concordia student Laura Beach has issued a mise en demeure – a notice of potential legal challenge – to three members of Concordia’s administration, including one who will take up a post at McGill later this month.
The mise en demeure is the latest in a series of student reactions to the renewal of Concordia’s exclusive beverage contract with Pepsico last Friday. The university’s current contract expires on December 10. Several student groups, including Sustainable Concordia and TAPThirst (Tap Drinkers Against Privatization), which Beach founded, opposed the renewal of the contract. They pointed out that renewing the exclusive contract would contradict the advice of Concordia’s own environmental advisory committee.
The discovery by Concordia students that a new contract was being signed on October 29 prompted a rally and sit-in to oppose both the contract and the secrecy with which it was negotiated. Beach was among the speakers at the rally, which took place on October 27 in Norman Bethune Square at Guy and Maisonneuve.
The mise en demeure, however, does not address the contract itself, but rather the lack of student consultation about the renewal of the contract. Beach claims that the university acted in bad faith by signing the contract while claiming that negotiations were not taking place.
Beach, also the Sustainable Ambassadors Coordinator for Sustainable Concordia, wrote in an email to The Daily, “The members of admin (Marc Gauthier and Johanne De Cubellis) made a verbal agreement with myself and Faisal Shennib that no negotiations/decisions regarding the beverage contract would be made prior to a meeting with myself, Faisal, Johanne, Marc and a representative from Pepsico. This verbal agreement was made in a meeting on May 12.”
“This promise was reiterated in an email from Johanne De Cubellis a month later,” she continued. “In September I received another email from Johanne, stating that there had been ‘no movement on the Pepsi file’ – however, by all administrative accounts an agreement in principle had already been signed with Pepsi at that time.”
The administrators to whom the mise en demeure was given are Marc Gauthier (Executive Director, Finance and Business Operations) and Johanne De Cubellis (Associate Director, Hospitality Concordia), with whom Beach claims to have made an agreement, as well as Michael Di Grappa.
For Di Grappa, the mise en demeure came during his last days as an administrator at Concordia. Di Grappa, who served as Vice-President (Services) at Concordia, is starting as McGill’s Vice-Principal (Administration and Finances) on November 15. He could not be reached for comment.
The mise en demeure is not a notification of a lawsuit, but instead the notification of the potential for one. “It pre-empts the legal procedure. It requires someone to address the situation or to admit wrongdoing,” explained Pawel Porowski, External Communications Officer at Sustainable Concordia.
Thus far, however, none of the Concordia administrators have moved away from their position on the contract, maintaining that the university is not guilty of breach of trust. Chris Mota, the university’s Director of Communications, told Concordia’s The Link that, “the university is confident that we handled everything according to the best practices.”
“The admin have responded by denying having acted in bad faith, denying having ever made a verbal agreement, despite the email evidence I have provided,” Beach responded. She has not yet decided whether she will go ahead with legal action.
“I would be happy with a formal apology from the administration, a formal commitment to the creation of an institutionalized framework for student consultation on future contract negotiations, and a formal commitment to the creation of an enforceable ethical purchasing policy.”

First child soldier tried since Nuremberg
Omar Khadr was sentenced to a symbolic forty years in Guantánamo Bay prison on Sunday, although the 24-year-old Canadian will only serve eight years, as per the terms of a plea bargain negotiated last week.
The conviction concludes the first ever trial of a child soldier accused of war crimes since the Nuremberg hearings after the Second World War, and the first trial of a terrorism suspect by the Obama-led military commissions.
Khadr pled guilty last Monday to the murder of Sergeant Christopher Speer, an American medic killed in a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002. In exchange for his guilty plea, Khadr was offered a sentence of eight years in prison, and permission to apply for transfer to Canada after one year.
In a statement released to 28 journalists, The Daily among them, Khadr’s lawyer Dennis Edney said that justice had not been served.
“The fact that the trial of a child soldier, Omar Khadr, has ended with a guilty plea in exchange for his eventual release to Canada does not change the fact that fundamental principles of law and due process were long since abandoned in Omar’s case,” Edney wrote.
“We may choose to believe that through his plea Omar finally came clean and accepted his involvement in a firefight when he was 15 years of age, or that this was one final coerced confession from a victimized  young man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time because his father placed him there,” said Edney.
The plea agreement limited the number of witnesses Khadr’s defense could call to four individuals, while the prosecution was able to call ten witnesses to the stand. Moreover, the commission judge refused to recognize Khadr’s status as a child soldier, although he was only 15 at the time of arrest.
Finally, the commission did not permit evidence that Khadr had been threatened with murder and rape while being interrogated by U.S. officials, although the incriminating statements elicited from Khadr while “under duress,” and without the presence of a lawyer, were accepted.
Nathan Whitling, another lawyer for Khadr, called the forty-year sentence “astonishing,” particularly because the prosecution had only asked for Khadr to be sentenced to 25 years.  
“To hear the [military jury] come down to that forty number was quite shocking. We knew that number didn’t mean anything, because there is a deal in place that will ensure Omar will serve only eight,” said Whitling.
“These people on the panel were all soldiers, and Sergeant Speer was one of their own. … In that sense, it is no surprise at all that there was such a harsh sentence,” added Whitling.
Though the Canadian government has stated that it was not involved in negotiating the plea agreement, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon confirmed on Monday that Khadr would be permitted to apply for transfer in one years’ time.
According to Whitling, Khadr’s defense team will seek his release as soon as possible following Khadr’s return to Canada. Khadr’s lawyers will focus on the parole process since the International Transfer of Offenders Act does not permit Khadr to challenge his foreign conviction.

Relying on ethics committee to review portfolio
With the help of a rebounding world economy, SSMU has begun to generate more and more revenue through its investments in corporations.
SSMU’s investment portfolio – ranging from investments in banks like RBC and BMO, to telecommunications companies like Telus and Bell, and energy companies like the Power Corporation of Canada and the TransCanada Corporation – is managed by Ken Lester, CEO of Lester Asset Management and a professor in McGill’s Faculty of Management. The portfolio is regulated by SSMU’s Financial Ethics Review Committee (FERC).
“Our mission is [for investments] to generate $100,000 of revenue per year,” said Nick Drew, VP Finance and Operations.
Drew said that the value of an investment “usually fluctuates depending on the success of a business,” and therefore attributed the growth in SSMU’s investment revenue to the general recovery of the economy. Drew said the value of SSMU’s investments had dropped down to $1.5 million last year, but bounced back to around two million dollars over the summer.
“SSMU has investments in a number of different portfolios. It really is a diverse investment portfolio,” said President Zach Newburgh.
SSMU’s investment portfolio was started in 2008, from the $1.8 million the Society received after being bought out of their share in Haven Books, the former SSMU-operated off-campus bookstore.
“We thought it was the best way to put our money away,” said Drew. “It’s one of the lowest-risk portfolios [you can have].”
Drew said that SSMU rarely changes its investment portfolio, but that when there are changes, they are usually based on recommendations from Lester.
“Sometimes we’ll drop a company, and buy a new one. It’s generally based on what Ken [Lester] believes,” said Drew. “He usually contacts us and asks us for permission first.”
SSMU monitors the ethical standards of the companies they invest in through FERC. A SSMU by-law mandates the Society to “avoid” investing in companies with material interests in “socially harmful areas” like guns and tobacco, human rights abuses like child and sweatshop labour, and environmental harm like pollution and habitat destruction.
SSMU also prioritizes investment in companies with “a proven track record of” positive contributions to the environment, the promotion of sound employment practices, and high standards of corporate governance and transparency.
“We are in the process of currently investigating ethical investments – determining which companies we should be investing in and which we should not, and we are weeding out those which we shouldn’t, to ensure that our investments are at the standards set by our constitution and at the standard that is expected by the student body,” said Newburgh.
Any member of SSMU can ask FERC to investigate a company in which SSMU invests over $10,000. In past years, FERC had met on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, but Drew is requiring them to meet at least once a year for 2010-11.
Drew identified environmentally harmful areas as “a very grey area” and “something FERC needs to look into.”
Last year, FERC investigated RBC’s involvement in tar sands corporations, but this year Drew concluded that the bank’s activities did not warrant divestment. Drew also said that the FERC report was “a bit biased” against RBC, as it only referenced one source, instead of a variety of sources that would corroborate the information.
According to an email from RBC’s Client Care Specialist Paula LeBlanc to Drew, RBC was “actively working toward support for a number of water-related projects in Northern Alberta, where the oil sands are located.”
“Banks do not control the pace and nature of energy sector growth, and we do not believe it is responsible or reasonable to eliminate potential funding for entire sectors of the economy. RBC subjects our lending and investment banking activities to a suitable level of social and environmental due diligence. … We check that our clients in the energy sector (and other sectors) are appropriately managing and reducing their impacts, and we support them in those efforts,” LeBlanc wrote.
“RBC is the worst bank we’re involved in. … [But] it’s not a company you want to divest [from],” said Drew. “We have to invest in banks.”

Report by Quebec profs argues instruction is suffering to pay for maintenance and new buildings
According to a report released last week by the Fédération québécoise des professeures et professeurs d’université (FQPPU), Quebec’s universities are funneling increasingly large amounts of money – initially earmarked for teaching and research – into the maintenance of infrastructure, most notably in the form of building acquisitions and renovations.
The report addresses the financing of Quebec universities’ infrastructure projects, and found that the government subsidy per student earmarked for capital funds – the budget sections dedicated to infrastructure – was getting smaller every year. In ten years, it has gone from $1,935 to $1,535 per student, which amounts to a roughly twenty per cent reduction. For its part, McGill is plagued by $650 million in deferred maintenance costs.
Meanwhile, funding cuts to infrastructure have been compounded by a spike in university enrollment, putting pressure on schools to improve their infrastructure to accommodate more students. Contrary to predictions made by the Ministry of Education in 2000, Quebec universities have seen a sharp rise in enrollment over the past decade. There are about 23.4 per cent more full-time students enrolled in Quebec universities now then there were twelve years ago. At McGill alone, there were over four thousand more students attending full-time in 2009 than in 2002.
“Over the past 12 years, the total growth in the student population can be compared to a university about twice the size of the Université de Montréal appearing in the system,” said Martin Maltais, a professor at Télé-université, UQAM’s correspondance school, and one of the report’s researchers.
To offset the costs of new students, universities have had to dip into their operational budgets.
Diverting money away from teaching and research has been a standard practice for university administrations for the past twenty years, according to Michel Umbriaco, the lead researcher on the report, in an article for Le Devoir. However, the extent of this practice has reached a critical point in the past four or five years, with universities paying for nearly fifty per cent of their infrastructure costs with money originally intended for operational budgets. The report, which was sent to education minister Line Beauchamp, recommended that the province place restrictions how much money universities siphon off from their operational budgets.
Diverted funds have eroded the quality of instruction in Quebec, according the report’s authors. “Now, we have universities where people are completing entire bachelor degrees without ever actually seeing a professor,” said Maltais.
Joël Pedneault, a McGill undergrad and Vice-Secretary General of the Quebec Students Roundtable (QSR), a provincial student lobbying group of which SSMU is a member, believes that governments should step in to fill funding gaps.
“The main problem is that schools have to make these decisions – between instruction and infrastructure, between what type of maintenance…while the government has made a conscious political choice to decrease taxation on the private sector, which could provide some of the necessary revenue,” he said. “Obviously the problem is multi-faceted, but the bottom line is that schools are under-financed.”
The FQPPU’s report is the second in a three part series they are producing in an effort to explain why, despite the Ministry of Education’s increased investment in sectors of post-secondary education, universities have seemed to suffer from chronic underfunding.
The first report addressed the financing of the universities’ operational budgets. It found that the ministry had nearly doubled its investment in the operational budgets of universities in Quebec over the past ten years.

Part one of a two-part series
Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson has disclosed a series of hitherto-confidential documents relating to the Architecture Café, showing that the cafe posted a small deficit in fiscal year (FY) 2009-2010. The development follows a motion proposed by SSMU President Zach Newburgh at the September meeting of McGill’s Board of Governors demanding the publication of the numbers.
The documents, prepared by Mendelson’s office at the request of the Board of Governors and presented to the Board on October 22, reveal that before McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS) was compensated for its services, the cafe ran a $171 deficit in the 2009-10 school year. Its gross profit was $33,186, though after the payment of student employees and managers, repairs and maintenance, and overhead costs, the numbers dipped slightly into the red.
Questions remain about the specifics of the MFDS’s role in the management of the Arch Café, as MFDS director Mathieu Laperle was out of town and unavailable for comment. The document states, for instance, that the Arch Café was costing the MFDS an additional $15,000 in salary and benefits and “other expenses.”
“The Architecture Café did have problems while it ran under the radar,” wrote former Café manager Carly Roualt in an email to The Daily. “But it never lost money until 2007. And it appear[s] to be the managerial apparatus that was forced upon it in 2007 that ran it, technically, into the red.”
The café was put under a “mixed management model” involving the Architecture Students Association (ASA) and McGill three years ago, after the administration threatened to shut it down. The responsibilities were shared between students and MFDS (and its precursor, Ancillary Services) with students managing “purchasing” and MFDS taking control of “food costs and labour costs.” The nature of these costs remains unclear.
After reviewing the released documents, SSMU President Zach Newburgh said that “there was an opportunity for the University administration to assure the financial stability of this café by working with students but it did not do so.” The document, however, maintains that MFDS officials met with students from the ASA throughout 2009 and 2010 “on the need generally to be environmentally and financially sustainable, and more specifically on matters related to managerial sustainability.”
Mendelson stressed that the café “was not being run professionally and could not be run professionally because students are not professionals in this industry.”
The report’s projected expenses for the 2011-2012 school year show that the Arch Café would have lost $73,211 in FY2011-12. The lion’s share of this expense stems from an apparent decision that a full-time manager with a salary of $49,200 would have been hired if the cafe’s operation had continued. The document also projected an increase in the cost of casual labour from about $30,000 to roughly $39,000. There is no projection for the current school year.
The cafe’s financial statement attributes the salary increases and the new management position to “the unionization of casual staff.” Mendelson confirmed that this is a reference to the last year’s union certification campaign of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE). AMUSE officials have said that the figures are “hypothetical,” as the union has not yet entered collective bargaining with the administration. Dan Ahmad, AMUSE’s Communications Officer, wrote in an email to The Daily that the “salary of managers has nothing to do with any union at McGill and is dictated by the University.”
Former SSMU councillor Alex Shee also examined the document, part of which reads, “At the end 2009-10, we were forced to conclude that the [mixed management] model was not financially or managerially sustainable, and there did not appear to be a viable alternative.”
“What I would ask is this,” said Shee, “If you really, really, really looked at the alternatives, did you look at funding through SSMU? Did you look at the possibility of an opt-outable fee? … If their response is ‘We looked at it from a financial point of view and it just didn’t seem right,’ then how come it made money in the past?”
