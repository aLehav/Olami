Employees reject contract proposal
Two-hundred-and-fifty-three employees were locked out of the Journal de Montréal last weekend after they rejected a new contract proposed by Quebecor Media, the conglomerate that owns the publication.
The workers are opposed to Quebecor’s failure to amend their contract to include an increase in the work week from 30 hours to 37.5 hours, adding a fifth day to the work week with no extra pay, as well as a 20 per cent reduction in benefits. Workers at the paper also want the management to reassign employees to multimedia work.
Their contract expired on December 31.
Quebecor has cut and altered its “business model.” These changes were necessary, the company said, due to the vast expansion of cheap Internet alternatives for news.
“Quebec is not immune to the turmoil in the paid-circulation newspaper industry, caused by factors such as the advent of Internet news sites and other free news sources, changing readership habits, the distribution of content in digital formats, the availability of regularly updated real-time information, and falling revenues from advertising and classifieds,” represntatives from Quebecor stated in a press release.
But these changes could threaten the quality of the paper and of the reporting, said Raynald Leblanc, president of the Syndicat des travailleurs de l’information du Journal de Montréal to the Montreal Gazette.
The popularity of web sites such as Craigslist and Kijiji have diverted much of the Classifieds content, a key source of revenue, away from newspapers, while blogs and other free new sites have taken away readership.
On Sunday, January 25 – the day after the lockout at the Journal – the Montreal Gazette found itself in a similar plight. Their management submitted a new contract that divided advertising against editorial and readers sales within the Montreal Newspaper Guild.
According to the Guild’s vice president, Irwin Block, the publisher of the Gazette said the jurisdiction was not good enough.
While the disputes within the Journal de Montréal and the Gazette continue to unfold, it is not clear that a solution will be reached anytime soon.
The last time a clash occurred between the Journal de Montréal’s management and the union in 2007, an agreement was not reached until 15 months after the lockout.

Administration listens to Senate on guidelines
Students will now be able to seek an exemption from McGill’s travel guidelines, which provide University-wide standards on curricular or co-curricular travel to specific countries or regions.
The updated version of the guidelines – which include an exemption clause outlining how a student may receive permission to visit prohibited country and clearer language describing rules regarding employment in foreign nations during study abroad – were revealed to the McGill Senate on January 21, at which Senators were invited to give feedback, though not their approval, before a finalized version of the guidelines is released by the end of February.
Senate voted to suspend the directive on November 5, demanding that it pass consultation with Senate’s steering committee before being approved, but the adminsitration claimed that the directive did not fall under Senate’s academic purview, and rendered the November vote void. However, a draft of travel guidelines was later sent to select members of the Senate for review over Winter Break.
According to Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) Morton J. Mendelson, whose office drafted the travel directive in September 2008 and all of its subsequent updates, the number of students requiring exemptions will likely be so low that McGill can grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis. He cited schools such as the University of Saskatchewan and Duke University as having similar policies.
“In other universities that have this kind of exemption, the number of requests per year is about a dozen,” Mendelson said.
The guidelines follow travel advisories issued by Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) to determine where students can travel, prohibiting travel to countries or regions with a level-three “avoid all non-essential travel” or level-four “avoid all travel” warning. The exemption will only apply for level-three travel in which a student considers travelling to be essential. According to a clause in the present draft, exemptions must first be approved by the relevant faculty’s dean and department chair before undergoing review by the Deputy Provost, who can set conditions on approval.
SSMU VP University Affairs Nadya Wilkinson asserted that the approval process required for travel exemptions contributes toward an unwieldy bureaucracy.
“I know that [the deans and Professor Mendelson] are busy people,” Wilkinson said. “And I know that undergraduate travel to dangerous places is not something they want to [look at too quickly]. There will be less [exemptions], as it’s clear to students that their applications aren’t processed with haste.”
As some travel cases include examples in which a student would be prevented from travelling to their home country because it’s listed by DFAIT, Mendelson indicated that the exemption system could take this into account.
“Students with certain kinds of experience would be in a better position to have exemption than other students in a specific area,” he said.
Wilkinson explained that while the guidelines have become more reasonable, their creation was unnecessary.
“We do need guidelines that make sure students are informed and safe, but there has to be a much more local decision process that respects autonomy,” Wilkinson said.  “My main issue with this is that students also care about safety and have the capacity to make informed decisions.”
Mendelson predicted that the finalized guidelines will mostly resemble those sent recently to the Senate for discussion.

Event urges McGill to incorporate Disabilities Studies
Calls to integrate Disability Studies into McGill’s curriculum will be heard this week at the “Disability on Location” symposium, the first of its kind, running today through Wednesday.
The event – organized by a partnership of SSMU, QPIRG, and the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) – will bring together academia, cinema, and comedy in order to draw attention to an area of study which, according to the organizers, is largely overlooked in many university curriculums.
“[Academia] hasn’t really studied this…and it’s glaring in its absence,” said Roshaya Rodness, co-organizer of the event and a U3 Cultural Studies student. “These issues have been on the radar since the seventies, but the academy has been a little slow to pick them up.”
The event is co-organized by SSMU’s Equity Commissioner Iris Erdile, and held in conjunction with the student society’s Social Justice Days
Erdile emphasized that integrating Disability Studies into McGill is crucial to sensitizing society to the daily realities faced by disabled people.
“It has to start with [academia],” Erdile said. “People come here to become leaders, so what better place to begin this process?”
The event will include a keynote address on Wednesday from Lennard J. Davis, a prominent Disability Studies professor from the University of Illinois. The symposium will also feature lectures from a variety of McGill professors shown in conjunction with disability-themed films.
Tuesday night will feature the “sit-down” comedy of Ottawa native Alain Shane, who delivers his routine from his wheelchair.
According to organizer Rodness, Shane’s comedy brings a human face to disabled people.
“The great thing about having a disabled comedian is that they make you laugh at them, which is in many cases is a cultural taboo. It really makes you think about your own assumptions about disabled people,” she said.
In the past, the administration has been largely skeptical of integrating Disability Studies courses at McGill, citing their inability to offer courses in all areas of academia. Rodness, however, compared this attitude to that toward Women’s Studies when it emerged in the 1970s – saying that eventually the University community will feel a responsibility to engage in the issue of disability.
The organizers were largely critical of the administration’s current policy toward people with disabilities on campus, and called on McGill to improve transport for disabled students to the inaccessible classrooms on Peel street. However, they praised the work of the OSD in implementing accessibility programs at McGill.
According to Rodness, while sympathy for people with disabilities is admirable, programs like those offered by OSD must be expanded.
“When it comes down to implementation, people’s feelings change, and they have to recognize that part of their willingness to recognize people with disabilities is that process of implementation,” she said.
Events at the symposium will be wheelchair accessible and free of charge. American Sign Language translation for Davis’s keynote address and comedian Shane will be provided.

McGill students’ French stagnates in all-anglo environment
McGill students seeking to integrate themselves into Quebec culture should strive for biliteracy, not simply bilingualism, according to a recent report released by a Quebec community group that represents the anglo minority in Quebec.
The report, Creating Spaces, was commissioned by the Quebec Community Group Network, and called biliteracy “a powerful tool to tackle many multi-faceted barriers English-speakers face in participating fully in Quebec society.” It also declared full biliteracy for Quebec youth as one of its top goals. Bilingualism designates functionality in both languages without specifying the user’s full capacity in either, and biliteracy is best described as full spoken, reading, and written fluency in two languages.
According to Gregg Blachford, Director of McGill’s Career Planning Services while functional oral bilingualism is probably most common in the workforce, biliterates have a much broader range of opportunities available to them.
But biliteracy is not valued as highly in McGill society as functional or even minimal bilingualism: upon graduation, many students seek careers outside of the province, where standards for English-French bilingualism are much lower.
Blachford noted that McGill may make an English life all too easy for students. Many, even those with backgrounds in French immersion programs, allow their French to stagnate in McGill’s anglo environment. This isn’t always evident, as McGill is located in the centre of one of the world’s most culturally diverse cities; fluency in two languages might seem like a given.
“Within the McGill ghetto walls… [students’] confidence and ability in French drops, despite Montreal,” Blachford said.
Low confidence in French is a common excuse for settling into an English rut and one of the greatest barriers to biliteracy, according to McGill Psychology professor Fred Genesee, who specializes in bilingual education and psycholinguistics.
“It’s a two-way street,” Genesee said. “The more you use [French], the more confident you’ll become.”
Students who can improve their French confidence and become functionally bilingual are in good shape. In Genesee’s experience, English to French bilinguals often have little difficulty segueing into biliteracy.
Blachford encouraged students to feel confident in their French, even if they perceive it as sub-par.
“Don’t giggle; don’t apologize; don’t signal bad confidence in your French,” Blachford said. “Know a few key phrases, some opening chit-chat, and don’t be self-conscious.”
Genesee noticed French students who come to McGill with little or no English background leave comfortable and confident with the language, bolstering both Genesee’s and Blachford’s conclusion that immersion is key.
Genesee also urged anglophone students to take full advantage of the opportunities in Montreal for obtaining biliteracy.
“[Biliteracy] is where the rest of the world is moving,” Genesee said. “Montreal has a good start; we just need to take advantage of it.”

Kay Turner President
Kay Turner knows she’s nearing the end. She’s looking to change and looking to do it fast. And so, realizing that some of her earlier goals are just too ambitious, Turner has shelved them for new, more realistic ones. Kay had once hoped to revamp Council, with big dreams for a more-informed committees, yet other projects interfered, like the nursery in Shatner for student parents and needing to pick up an extra portfolio. Former VP Finance Tobias Silverstein’s resignation in January has clogged Turner’s schedule with money matters, distracting her from focusing on presidential tasks. She has managed, though, to check a few to-dos off of her list. The lease for the new nursery in Shatner is almost signed, with that for Café Supreme hopefully following shortly. With one sustainability report under her belt so far and another that includes a five-year plan chocked with small decisions SSMU can make for a better environment, Turner’s proud that SSMU is taking green steps.
Nadya Wilkinson VP University Affairs
Sometimes we can’t help but feel like Nadya Wilkinson is Captain Planet incarnate. Somehow, between battling administrative double-speak and untangling the bureaucracy, she successfully got the Office of Sustainability on its feet, and she’s improving relations between SSMU and the University. Wilkinson has built a strong student-staffed Senate caucus, which she’s used as a tool to lobby the University on its draconian travel directive – although not to the ends she wanted to see. If that’s not enough, Wilkinson now has the Financial Ethics and Responsibility Committee to deal with – a VP Finance portfolio she says she’s going to have to rebuild. She’s also trying to track down a new ombudsperson, tackle the issue of room-bookings for student groups across campus, and launch a McGill Food Systems project that explores sustainable options on campus. The list is long, but based on Wilkinson’s enthusiasm and track-record, we’re optimistic that she’ll make a sizeable dent in her workload before her term is up. We only hope that she continues to engage with students in the process, and starts preparing a new student for her position to facilitate the transition.
Devin Alfaro VP External Affairs
Devin Alfaro is struggling, and he’s blaming the dying political spirit of McGill students. But an apathetic student population is not a valid excuse: it’s Alfaro’s job to make sure students stay aware and engaged in the community. Alfaro faltered in his attempt to repopularize Reclaim Your Campus and to improve low student voter turnouts during the Canadian and Quebec elections. We’ve had high expectations for Alfaro, especially because he seems to be one of the SSMUshies with the least going on in other areas; Alfaro didn’t absorb any portfolios with the disintegration of VP Finance.Luckily, Alfaro may be able to turn his frustration into a couple of new projects before his term wraps up. He’s talking about lobbying trips to Ottawa and Quebec City for increased government funding for education, starting workshops in the Milton-Parc community in conjunction with the Dean of Students Office, and fortifying a table de consultation with other Quebec schools. Alfaro’s got a point when he says that student disinterest makes his job more difficult, but he’s going to need to stoke the fire of McGill’s undergraduates if he ever wants to been seen as a facilitator.
Samantha Cook VP Clubs & Services
VP Clubs & Services Samantha Cook received a few curve balls this year. Yet the emergence of contentious pro-life group Choose Life and the surplus work she inherited from the VP Finance portfolio don’t seem to have ruffled her feathers too much. Cook has handled both incidents well, and she said she’s actually enjoyed taking over Gert’s from Silverstein. Before the end of her term, she’s planning on investigating the future of food kiosks in the Shatner Cafeteria. Their leases expire two years from now, and she’d like to replace them with student initiatives.  Cook has abandoned several of her campaign promises, including fighting opt-outs and for the right of clubs to use the McGill name. She blames the administration and lack of applicability, respectively, for her neglect. With other pressing issues, Cook has only delivered moderate success. She’s made some headway in improving the issue of student space; the administration has granted students use of two more rooms in the Arts building. One of the greatest challenges to her portfolio, Cook said, has been working with students who are only engaged when riled by a negative incident. We hope she can prove the contrary.
Julia Webster VP Internal
Julia Webster is partied out, and rightly so. The graduating VP Internal has produced a greener Frosh, a conservatively budgeted SnowAP, a re-introduction of 4Floors, which sold out, and a smattering of other faculty events. She’s got the Varsity Booth up and running for athletes to sell tickets for games, and has kept up events like Francofete, which celebrates French culture, and the self-explanatory Fill the Stadium. Yet she may not have saved SnowAP, and it’s likely that students will be staring at a big white field instead of a big white tent next January if it’s decided the event is too much of a financial sinkhole. Webster has also struggled with the new SSMU web site launch, as the English version still lacks content and the French translation is nonexistent. Haven Books, mini courses, and the SSMU sponsorship portfolio landed on Webster’s desk when Silverstein ditched, but Webster assured us that they’re all doing well. We beg to differ, though. Haven won’t break even this year, and there is not enough sponsorship funding available to run the year-end concert that Webster promised. With all these projects looming over her head, Webster must also nail down a new beer contract for SSMU by years end.

Omar Khadr remains in prison, despite Obama’s recent decision to close Guantanamo
In the aftermath of President Barack Obama’s decision to close Guantanamo Bay on January 20, experts and supporters are urging Canada to repatriate a Canadian child soldier who has spent six tortured years in the off-shore prison.
The U.S. army captured Omar Khadr when he was 15, accusing him of throwing the grenade that killed Sergeant Christopher Spheer in Afghanistan during a fire fight in July 2002. He has been charged with war crimes in military tribunals.
In Guantanamo, he was subjected to extreme temperatures, forced nudity, and sexual humiliation. Guards even attached him to short-range chains for hours until he urinated on himself. They then poured pine-scented cleaning fluid over him and used him as a mop.
Amnesty McGill directors Margoth Rico and Silvana Lovera protested with a handful of sympathizers at the Roddick Gates last Tuesday as part of their campaign to demand Khadr’s repatriation.
While access to a fair trial is a step in the right direction, Rico believed that justice can only be achieved once Khadr is allowed to return to Canada.
“We should not be asking ourselves ‘Why should Omar Khadr be repatriated?’ but ‘Why has he not been repatriated?’” Rico said. “By not taking responsibility of Omar Khadr, Canada is overlooking the rights that every Canadian citizen should be entitled to.”
Hours after accepting the presidency, Obama issued an executive order suspending all military trials, including Khadr’s, which was scheduled for January 26. Judith Rae, a University of Toronto law student and founding member of The Omar Khadr Project, an organization of Canadian law students and young lawyers advocating for Khadr’s repatriation, criticized the Harper government for shirking responsibility for Canada’s last remaining detainee.
“Stephen Harper’s continued silence is inexcusable. It has always been important to assist a Canadian citizen who is locked away facing an unfair trial abroad,” said Rae. “We know President Obama intends to end these illegal proceedings, which are contrary to the normal rules of human rights,” he said.
“The game is over. We would be happy to see Khadr face trial in Canada; there is no reason why he cannot be tried here.”
Lieutenant Commander Keubler, Khadr’s Pentagon-appointed attorney to the case, explained Khadr’s military trial has run out of steam.
“I think Omar’s military prosecution is effectively dead and that there are significant obstacles to any future prosecution of Omar Khadr by U.S. authorities,” said Keubler. “The ball is now squarely in the Prime Minister’s court to help President Obama clean up the Guantanamo mess by offering to take Omar back to Canada.”
Rae questioned the validity of the evidence held against Khadr.
“The U.S. altered documents dating from around the time of the incident which made reference to another person alive who could have thrown the grenade,” said Rae. “Furthermore, some of the evidence used against him is unreliable, including alleged admissions that date from the time he was subjected to serious mistreatment, quite possibly including torture.”
Canada is legally bound by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to rehabilitate minors like Omar Khadr and to reintegrate them into society.
Canada has widely supported rehabilitation programs for child soldiers from countries such Sierra Leone, Colombia, and Sri Lanka. Ishmael Beah, UNICEF Ambassador and former child soldier captured at age 15, called Canada’s treatment of Khadr a double standard.
“If a 15-year-old kid in Sierra Leone, in Congo, in Uganda, in Liberia, if they kill somebody and shoot somebody in the war, it’s fine, but as soon as that kid kills an American soldier…they are no longer a child soldier, they are a terrorist.”
It will be many months before Guantanamo is shut down and the files of the detainees facing military trial are reviewed. Having spent six and a half years in pre-trial detainment, many believe Khadr’s ordeal has already continued for far too long. With Obama and Harper due to meet in the coming weeks, the issue of Khadr’s return to Canada is more pressing than ever. Dennis Edney, Khadr’s Canadian attorney was disappointed with the public’s indifference to Khadr’s plight.
“Here we have a young boy who is blind in one eye, his other eye damaged, and we can’t even get him protective glasses. What are we doing for him as Canadians? What has McGill done?” Edney asked. “When we talk about Omar Khadr, we are talking about Guantanamo and the lack of rule of law in that hellish place. Where are the voices of outrage?”
