Labour casualization leaves employees vulnerable, says union
The Association of McGill Research Employees (AMURE) passed a motion at its January 21 General Assembly (GA) to implement a domestic violence and sexual abuse counselling service for its members.
AMURE President Sean Cory told The Daily that there were two main justifications behind the pilot project: the heightened emphasis on issues of sexual assault – in the context of the student-led development of a sexual assault policy at McGill – and the lack of benefits available to casual employees at the university.
Casual employees, hired on a contractual basis, do not generally have access to employment benefits or assistance. AMURE estimates that nearly 50 per cent of all employees at McGill are casuals without access to benefits. “We could not sit back and let our members be without anywhere to turn […] we passed this motion to look at providing counselling to some of our members who would have nowhere else to turn,” said Cory in an email.
The service, which will provide anonymous access to counselling, will undergo a one-year trial period, during which it will be funded by AMURE’s savings. According to Cory, the project’s future funding source will be determined by how frequently it is used by members.
“It’s hard to say how much it will be used by our members, but we’ll give it a shot,” said Cory. If the service is widely used and presents too large of a financial burden to be sustained through savings, AMURE may ask members to vote on a dues increase to cover it.
According to Cory, the pilot project has a lot of support from AMURE members thus far, and the motion passed almost unanimously.
Last November, Provost Anthony Masi announced that McGill would implement a hiring freeze for administrative and support staff to help mitigate the effects of provincial budget cuts. However, according to Cory, this hiring freeze is with respect to ‘regular’ (non-casual) employees, and does not preclude the hiring of casual labour.
“[The administration still] call[s] it a hiring freeze, and in some ways this shows what they think of casual labour,” said Cory, who noted that AMURE had seen a member employed for twenty years at McGill through a series of one-year casual contracts.
“There’s a severe gap [in support] when a person could be working forty hours a week for the university on a year-long contract, and McGill does not lift a finger or spend a dime towards their emotional health and well-being. We decided that, at least for these cases, we should try to do something.”
McGill Director of Labour and Employee Relations Robert Comeau did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment.

Campaigns form against private prison industry in U.S.
Correction appended February 2, 2015.
Scroll down for the audio version of this story.
Only a few years ago did the growing clout of the U.S.’s for-profit prison industry come into sharp relief. 2011 and 2012 saw a flurry of investigative journalism documenting the industry’s political influence, combined with its steadily increasing prison expansion over the course of several decades.
Less apparent in the media landscape, though, are the financial holdings that keep the system of private incarceration running. The two largest for-profit prison companies in the U.S. – the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and the GEO Group – are publicly traded. Investors range from cities, to investment firms, to mainstream banking institutions and hedge funds.
And perhaps unexpectedly, mixed into the fray of investors in these companies’ portfolios, there are universities. Students at some American universities have found concrete evidence of their schools’ investments in the prison industry, and there are certainly others where the investment portfolios have yet to be revealed.
A student group at Columbia University discovered in 2013 that the university was not only invested in CCA, but also G4S, a British multinational accused of abuse of prisoners in its South African prisons. The group’s information was limited: they knew that in June 2013, Columbia held 230,432 shares in CCA, worth a market value of roughly $8 million, but they only have access to 10 per cent of the university’s investment portfolio.
“We outlined three main demands that we delivered to our [university] president in a letter in February,” said Gabriela Pelsinger, a core organizer with Columbia Prison Divest. “We saw that they had these investments, and we didn’t want our tuition, our school – our community – profiting off of what we see as profit from putting bodies in cages.”
The letter demanded that the university divest from its direct holdings in CCA and G4S. It also requested that university fund managers urge other companies the university is invested in to divest from private prison companies, and asked for more transparency in the university’s investments.
Since then, the group has been working within their community and with neighbouring organizations to shed light on the structures of mass incarceration – to, as Pelsinger put it, see how “these structures of incarceration and criminalization and profit work together and how we fit into it. And how us being kind of aloof college students at this university kind of played into these larger structures.”
“Our objective is to break the lobbying power of the private prison industry, so that we can get to a place where criminal justice reform and immigration policy reform are possible in a way that will allow people to live with dignity.”
Columbia Prison Divest has been negotiating with the university’s ethical investments committee, and succeeded in meeting with the university’s president in November 2014. They have also been working with the Responsible Endowments Coalition (REC), a national organization that focuses on university divestment.
“University investments have become increasingly complex,” Ian Trupin, a national organizer with REC, told The Daily. “In the eighties, most universities had most of their endowments invested directly in the stock market – so it was relatively easy to see what universities were invested in. […] Universities [now] invest in vehicles like hedge funds, commingled funds, whereby they’re all about maximizing returns, but there’s no emphasis whatsoever on transparency or accountability.”
While current prison divestment campaigns are small in number, there are more on the horizon. The Daily spoke with student organizers at two separate universities who are spearheading upcoming campaigns. The organizers spoke to the difficulty of obtaining information on university investments, both direct and indirect, and the importance of building a network of support before going public.
“We’ve been trying to get support under a veil at this point,” one organizer at a private university in the northeastern U.S. (who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the upcoming campaign) said. This support has come from certain deans, administrative units tasked with supporting diversity and students of colour, and other student groups.
Beyond prison divestment, the movement will push against the criminalizing elements of university policy – promoting a “ban the box” campaign for university employees, and lobbying to banish regulations that allow for the revoking of financial aid when students are convicted of drug misdemeanours.
Nancy Uddin, another organizer in a public university in the northeastern U.S., began her school’s campaign after a retreat with groups like Enlace, which runs the most prominent prison divestment campaign in the country, and REC. The fledgling campaign has requested information about its university’s investments under the Freedom of Information Act, and is still waiting on a response before taking further steps.
“We’ve been meeting down low and discussing ways to begin our campaign, and we haven’t been publicized because we don’t want to scare anyone off or tell the administration that we are coming,” she told The Daily.

While G4S did not respond to an email request for comment from The Daily by press time, CCA pushed back against private prison divestment.
“Discussions about important issues such as criminal justice and corrections are only productive when informed by facts and rooted in honest discourse,” Jonathan Burns, Senior Manager of Public Affairs at CCA, told The Daily by email. “These campaigns are yet another unfortunate example of the lack of seriousness with which political activists approach the very real and practical challenges our nation faces.”
Mariame Kaba, the director of Project NIA in Chicago, which works against youth incarceration, and who tweets and blogs under the handle Prison Culture, noted the limited scope of prison divestment campaigns.
“The concept that prisons are about profit-making [is] putting us in a place where I think it’s comfortable for people who are liberal to latch onto that as the thing,” she told The Daily. “But the focus isn’t on profit-making. It’s on the friggin’ inhumanity of locking people up in the first place. It’s on the root problem, which is that we are actually using prison systems and punishment systems to control, manage, and oppress […] black people, poor people, and people who are trans, LGBTQ.”
However, Jamie Trinkle, Campaign Coordinator at Enlace, noted that to a large degree, private prison divestment campaigns do not aim to end the prison-industrial complex as a whole.
“Our objective is to break the lobbying power of the private prison industry,” she said, “so that we can get to a place where criminal justice reform and immigration policy reform are possible in a way that will allow people to live with dignity.”
Private prison companies – CCA being the most prominent – engage in extensive lobbying, campaign contributions, and political relationships, with their political influence largely being used in the interest of securing contracts for prisons, detention centres, and other security-related ventures. According to a Justice Policy Institute report, the three largest private prison companies spent $6,092,331 in gifts for state politicians from 2000 to 2011.
While many of the companies’ lobbying efforts have been focused on securing contracts in both prisons and immigration detention centres, they also benefit from harsher legislation that increases incarceration and criminalization overall.
Within this context, prison divestment campaigns will continue to spring up, with a continuing push for anti-private prison activism, compounded by the as-of-yet unseen investments hidden within university portfolios.
Ultimately, though, prison divestment makes up one piece of the spectrum of prison abolition. “This is not the end-all, be-all,” Kaba said. “The thing is, this is one way for us to chip at the huge behemoth of an issue that has its roots in the basic fabric in how our societies are operated and how they’re structured. This is a window for us to use – to try to get people to care about this issue in a very significant way. ”
A previous version of this article stated that REC was a university divestment campaign. In fact, REC is an organization that supports several campaigns. The Daily regrets the error.

Divest McGill questions process and motives of study
On January 6, the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) of McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) submitted an application to the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) for funding to “commission a study on a range of socially responsible investment practices.”
“The study is supposed to compile the best practices of socially responsible investments for similar institutions, like other universities in the world [and] in North America, and other corporations,” Courtney Ayukawa, Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) president and member of CAMSR, told The Daily. This will provide McGill with a basis to proceed with its investments in a more socially responsible way.
Updated last May, CAMSR’s terms of reference now mandate it to proactively meet at least once a year to make recommendations to the BoG on its investments. The first such meeting was held on October 30, where CAMSR made the decision to go ahead with the study. The application was submitted two months later.
“I am extremely pessimistic about this process. I think it’s just a way to appease campaigns that are fighting for something that is really important to them and to quiet them down.”
According to McGill’s Secretary-General Stephen Strople, whose office was responsible for spearheading the application process, the committee “did a scope of the study, what it actually was that we wanted the study to do, and then we met with the director of the [Office of Sustainability] to talk about whether the SPF would be open to funding [it].” Afterwards, they compiled the application.
“You could say we are slow, but we are slow because we don’t have the expertise and we have to do a lot of research and figuring things out as we go, because this is new territory for the committee,” Strople said in an interview with The Daily.
Strople was confident that the SPF would fund the project. “If this is not something the SPF can fund, then I would find it quite surprising,” he said.
However, some members of the McGill community questioned the assumption that the study is an appropriate use of SPF funds. SSMU VP External and Divest McGill member Amina Moustaqim-Barrette expressed worry over the impact of the study on the group’s fossil fuel divestment campaign.
“The funds were originally there for the McGill community to use them for sustainability projects,” Moustaqim-Barrette told The Daily. “I don’t think it would be SPF funds put to good use, because who knows what will come out of this research or how it will affect future divestment campaigns.”
Indeed, Strople remarked that divestment is not an “immediate direct outcome of the study.”
Victor Frankel, another Divest McGill member, expressed concern over the unclear scope of the study.
“I think the commissioning of this research report could be an excellent use of SPF funds if its conclusions are applied to McGill’s investment practices, but there is a lack of clarity on the scope of this and the extent to which actionable steps will be taken by the [BoG] from the recommendations of this report,” Frankel told The Daily.
Moustaqim-Barrette also argued that the study might be a way to silence the Divest McGill campaign and delay action.
“I am extremely pessimistic about this process. I think it’s just a way to appease campaigns that are fighting for something that is really important to them and to quiet them down,” she said. “The administration needs to revise a lot of the ways it does things.”
For Frankel, a similar study should have been conducted much earlier, when Divest McGill first presented its case for divestment to the BoG in 2013.
“It is a step that could have, and should have, been taken two years ago when Divest McGill first submitted the first research report to the [BoG],” said Frankel.
“We want McGill to manage its endowment responsibly – it is there to fund the university – but when McGill’s investments contradict its mission and abuse human rights, it’s time to invest in something else,” added Frankel. For Divest McGill, the University’s choice to invest in 35 of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies goes against McGill’s mission statement to “provid[e] service to society,” as well as CAMSR’s new terms of reference, which include grave environmental damage as a criterion for social injury caused by companies.
On February 2, Divest McGill will be re-submitting a divestment petition to CAMSR, two years after its first attempt. The group also plans to “work actively with other social justice and environmental groups to address the drivers of climate change,” according to Frankel.
“Addressing this geo-political, economic, engineering, and ecological challenge is a complex and daunting task,” added Frankel. “We’re in, for life.”

Environment students seek SSMU Council seat
At its meeting last Thursday, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council saw discussion on tuition deregulation and a proposal to add a seat for an Environment councillor. At the meeting, President Courtney Ayukawa introduced the new SSMU General Manager, Jennifer Varkonyi. Council also passed a motion regarding interim provisions with respect to elections and referenda.
Council passed interim provisions to its bylaws, which will temporarily add General Assembly (GA) ratification provisions to the bylaws and delineate unfair campaigning practices, alongside other minor changes to the constitution. The approved changes will be in effect until the end of April, by which point a more comprehensive set of bylaw changes will be presented.
Council also heard from Arts Senator Jacob Greenspon, who is working on creating a website that would summarize and ‘de-jargonize’ McGill’s University Student Assessment Policy for students. “It’s written in very heavy policy language,” he said. “We want to break down that barrier to the policy.”
The website would help students facing unfair assessment practices instituted by professors by providing them with the information necessary to understand and assert their rights.
“We know that in 2008 when the [six] programs were deregulated, for example, doing an MBA went from around $13,000 a year to $30,000.”
Various councillors added examples of unfair assessment practices that students commonly faced. “Profs can deny students accessibility requests even after the OSD [Office for Students with Disabilities] has approved them,” noted Arts Senator Kareem Ibrahim.
Arts and Science Senator Chloe Rourke raised the point that if a student is ill or has two conflicting midterms, professors sometimes interpret it as the student “forfeiting” their ability to take the midterm, and implicitly consenting to a final that constitutes 100 per cent of their mark.
Greenspon also noted the potential for the website to be used for advocacy for students who have been subject to unfair assessment practices.
Provost Anthony Masi presented an update on the University’s budget and strategic plan. He also voiced his support for the deregulation of tuition for international students.
Since 2008, deregulation has been in effect for Law, Management, Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Applied Sciences.
“Deregulation means that the government of Quebec provides zero subsidy for international students studying in those disciplines,” Masi said.
“The concern that some students have expressed is whether or not deregulating would automatically mean a huge increase in tuition,” noted Masi. He addressed this by stating that tuition would be fixed for the four-year period during which a student attends the university.
VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette told The Daily that, despite Masi’s reassurance, many councilors were unsure how to view the University’s stance on deregulation.
“We know that in 2008 when the [six] programs were deregulated, for example, doing an MBA went from around $13,000 a year to $30,000, so that’s what precedent tells us,” she said.
At the meeting, Masi explained the process of regulation currently in place. “The government of Quebec sets a tuition fee, the University collects that tuition fee, and then remits to the government everything except what a Quebec student would pay,” Masi said. “In exchange, the government gives us a subsidy that is equal to what they would have [given], had they been a Quebec student.”
“International students pay more than we get to keep for their tuition,” said Masi. However, under total deregulation of undergraduate and professional graduate programs, the university would only gain about $7 million – approximately 1 per cent of the University’s operating budget.
“Additionally, if we were to deregulate all of our other programs, it would be very difficult to raise the tuition rates in the presently deregulated programs because students might not pay $30,000 to come study Arts, but they would pay that to come study Commerce,” he added.
Masi also spoke about McGill’s deficit, citing government cuts as the reason for McGill’s money-saving procedures. Between 2014 and 2016, the Quebec government will have cut a cumulative $45 million from the subsidies provided to McGill. “But saving can only take you so far,” said Masi. “We have to have alternative sources of revenue.”
Jonathan Bouchard, the president of the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) was invited to speak to the councillors about what the organization represents. FEUQ is a federation of student associations, and represents over 125,000 students.
Bouchard stated that FEUQ opposed the administration’s stance on deregulation, and was concerned about “propositions on the table to deregulate all international student tuitions.” He went on to discuss the ways in which FEUQ had influenced post-secondary education in Canada, including calling strikes in 2005 and 2012, and staging protests against austerity.
Benjamin Ger, a representative from the McGill Environment Students’ Society (MESS), spoke about an amendment that would add a Council seat for the School of Environment. “Our needs are very specific,” he said. “It’s very hard to get our voices in.”
“I think we have not just a voice that needs saying, but a voice that’s worth saying,” Ger said.
Although most councillors were supportive of the proposal, some were concerned as to whether adding a seat for an Environment councilor would mean the removal of another councillor’s seat. Adding a seat for the School of Environment would necessitate a constitutional amendment, which would involve a referendum.
While the constitution could be amended by a referendum initiated by Council, Ger noted that a student-initiated referendum was already in the works. “It should be coming from the students and it shouldn’t be coming from the Council,” Ayukawa agreed.

Concordia to hold anti-austerity teach-in week
“This strike is not only possible, it is also necessary precisely in this moment,” proclaimed sociology student Valentin Bellec. “If there is no one to offer a response commensurate with these attacks […] the government will remember it for a long time.”
Bellec, a student at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), is one of many activists working to mobilize campuses across the province to strike in protest against the Quebec government’s austerity policies. Since its election in April 2014, the Liberal government has enacted a series of severe cuts to public services, with the education sector strongly affected.
In September, UQAM social science students voted to create a Comité Printemps 2015, or “Spring Committee,” with the goal of actively mobilizing students independently of student union federations such as the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), as well as to liaise with workers and community members affected by the cuts. Since then, a number of similar chapters of Comité Printemps have taken shape throughout the province.
“For the October 31 [anti-austerity] demonstration, there were about 82,000 students on strike on that day,” Bellec told The Daily in French. “The last time we saw anything comparable was in 2012 [during the student strike], and there’s an enormous amount of work that was done by the Comité Printemps to get there – in Montreal and also in the regions, in Quebec City, in Rimouski.”
The Comité Printemps has recently released a set of mobilization materials aiming to launch a strike on March 21 in the most active campuses, with others joining in later as the movement takes off. According to Bellec, a date toward the end of the school year was chosen to diminish the risk of missing too much school during the strikes, as missed classes could prevent participants from completing their semesters – an issue that arose during the strike of 2012. The choice of date was also made to inspire Quebec’s public sector workers – whose collective agreements are set to expire on March 31 – to join the strike.
“The last time we saw anything comparable was in 2012 [during the student strike].”
Although he recognized that mobilizing enough students in a such short period of time will be challenging, Bellec said that organizing is a lot easier than it was during the 2012 student strike, as the lessons of the strike are still fresh in students’ minds.
“There’s a wealth of logistical knowledge that we’ve already acquired, and that we’re now putting into application, and that’s really a legacy from 2012,” he said. “There’s a lot of work to do – we have to go mobilize all the campuses in Quebec – but the difference is that in 2012 we were working with mobilization committees of six to ten people, whereas today we’re thirty or forty.”
Bellec pointed to the ASSÉ Congress, to take place on February 21 and 22, as a “key moment” to bring ASSÉ’s effective structures into the movement toward the strike. So far, ASSÉ has focused on demonstrations and other protest actions. Some member unions also plan to bring forward propositions to include non-member unions in ASSÉ’s mobilization campaigns, as was the case during the 2012 strike.
“The ASSÉ Congress will also serve to put ASSÉ back on track and to dismiss people [who have not been effective],” said Bellec.
In an interview with The Daily, ASSÉ spokesperson Camille Godbout indicated that the direction of ASSÉ’s future actions is uncertain. “It’s really up the local student unions to decide what’s going to happen with the organization in the next few months,” she said.
“The most important thing […] is to go into the local student unions and mobilize students directly on their campuses,” noted Godbout.
This would allow them to not only participate in province-wide actions, but also resist the budget cuts to their own CEGEPs and universities.
At McGill, where the administration has repeatedly refused to take a stance against cuts to universities, student mobilization nonetheless remains a challenge, according to Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette.
“That culture [of student unions as sites of political action] is not present at McGill yet, and that’s the problem – people see the student unions as being more for events and for clubs,” she said. “That’s what I think needs to be changed, it’s the culture and the political awareness that needs to be reformed.”
To remedy this problem, Moustaqim-Barrette has hired an austerity student researcher, who will create informational materials tailored to McGill undergraduates, and also act as a mobilization officer working to get students to participate in demonstrations and workshops.
Moustaqim-Barrette said she also aims to reform the External Affairs Committee to make it more focused on mobilization. “The External Affairs Committee […] did not really have a purpose, but this way it will have a purpose: it will be acting as that support group to mobilize people,” she said.
Moustaqim-Barrette noted that McGill’s Mob Squad, which was a coordination point for campus activists during the 2012 strike, also remains active. “I think SSMU can play a complementary role to Mob Squad. I think Mob Squad is often not perceived to be as accessible to the general population,” she said. “Side by side, it’ll be really good to have those people on the ground being more aggressive at Mob Squad, and SSMU pushing that along as well.”

At Concordia, meanwhile, a campaign called Solidarity Concordia has formed to organize against austerity measures and in support of a general strike, and will be holding a teach-in week from February 2 to 7.
“Solidarity Concordia is a movement that was started last October by people who felt concerned about austerity measures,” said Aloyse Muller, Concordia student and Solidarity Concordia organizer, in an interview with The Daily. “We already organized a town hall on austerity in November, and this week of teach-ins [fits into] trying to spread awareness in the universities about austerity measures and social concerns in general.”
Presentation and workshop topics for the week include the history of student movements in Quebec, direct democracy, resistance to capitalism, as well as the relationship between austerity and environment.
“After this week, we will probably regroup and see how we can assist different student groups on campus, who’s become interested in austerity since our teach-in, and where the next step will be,” added Marion Miller, also one of the organizers. “We’ll probably reassess, but we’ll definitely try to keep this momentum going.”

Quartier de l’innovation called “theoretical” as project approaches third year
The Quartier de l’innovation (QI), a social development project spearheaded by McGill and L’École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), is close to entering its second year since the launch of the program in spring 2013. The project has turned sections of southwest Montreal into a “living laboratory” in which students and professors can conduct research in Montreal communities and then create projects they think will fit the community’s needs.
In Little Burgundy, QI has done work in schools and is currently restoring an old church. In Griffintown, projects include repair to underground infrastructure and the creation of six new green spaces.
Nevertheless, in its time working in these communities, the project has faced some obstacles in its attempts to bring about positive change.
Vicente Perez, coordinator of the community group Coalition de la Petite Bourgogne, told The Daily that the QI presently operates from a very high-minded, intellectual level.
“It’s not very grassroots. That must be improved,” said Perez. “I think it’s a little bit theoretical. It’s more the theory, not the practice.”
However, Perez added that he did not believe QI contributes to the gentrification of the areas in which it works. “The gentrification is more from the private housing market […], and the fact is that there are not [rules in place] to preserve the community space.”
Chloé Vadot, a member of the QI Student Working Group (SWG), told The Daily in an email that there are sometimes clashes between QI initiatives and for-profit development projects.
“The QI has projects that are focused on creating spaces for the community, spaces that retain the culture and neighbourhood feel of the place. On the other hand, developer projects have projects geared toward making money, and attracting investment for the city,” stated Vadot.
“Those projects go pretty fast, whereas the redevelopment projects that the QI deals with have a harder time dealing with, say, land zoning and public funding.”
Perez said that the initiative has its benefits, noting that QI gives community organizations access to technologies that they could not otherwise afford, and that the expertise of McGill professors can be helpful.
Asma Manssouri, another member of the SWG, said she appreciated the QI for allowing her to leave the McGill bubble. “QI offers students the opportunity to fully get involved within the broader Montreal community – something perhaps missing at McGill,” Manssouri wrote in an email to The Daily.
“The main goal is to continue to do our research and teaching,” QI Project Director Isabelle Péan told The Daily, “but also to apply it as best we can to community needs.”
Péan explained that the projects of QI are based on the recommendations of a report released by the initiative last April. “We did a kind of mapping of what are the social needs and how McGill, with our different faculties […] can help and how students can work on these different projects,” she said.
From these recommendations, students worked with professors to devise ways in which they believed they could meet the communities’ needs. According to Péan, Concordia may join the QI partnership, and other universities in Montreal have also expressed interest in the project.

BRIEF
 Updated February 3. 
The Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) passed two fee increases in a ‘redo’ referendum after a procedural mishap invalidated the results of a referendum that took place at the end of last semester. The most recent referendum was able to meet quorum, with an 11.6 per cent turnout.
An increase to the Science undergraduate base fee passed with 352 voting “yes,” 179 voting “no,” and 20 abstentions. It will raise the base fee to $12.50 for full-time Science undergraduate students, $6.25 for part-time Science undergraduate students, $6.25 for full-time Arts and Science students, and $3.13 for part-time Arts and Science students.
“The base fee increase will allow the next generation of science departmental councils to expand their portfolios and undertake larger projects/events,” SUS President Shannon Herrick told The Daily in an email. She said it may also be used for new undertakings by the SUS executive, such as a possible laptop-lending program that could begin as early as this semester.
The introduction of a Student Space Improvement Fee passed with 356 voting “yes,” 161 voting “no,” and 34 abstentions. The motion will add a fee of $7 and $3.50 for full-time and part-time Science undergraduate students respectively, and will add a fee for part-time and full-time Arts and Science students of $3.50 and $1.75 respectively.
Herrick explained that this fee will be used for renovations for spaces used by students, such as the Burnside basement, “making the limited space into a more effective, comfortable, and useful study space for students,” she wrote.
The results of last semester’s referendum on the same questions were found to be invalid because the questions were submitted to SUS constituents as part of the Fall 2014 referendum, but only subjected to the standards of online ratification, which normally takes place after a General Assembly (GA) and has lower quorum requirements than a referendum.
The turnout for the vote last semester was 6 per cent, which is sufficient for quorum in an online ratification process, but not for a referendum, where at least 10 per cent is required. The online ratification was not required since the Fall 2014 SUS GA did not meet quorum, and the referendum questions were sent directly to the General Council.
However, it was only after the SUS executives had put in an official claim for the fee that the executive realized the procedural mistake.

BRIEF
The McGill floor fellows’ collective agreement negotiations with the University made “some solid movement” this week after the floor fellows boycotted a staff training session held last Sunday.
Floor fellows – upper-year students who live in residence and provide support to first-year students – were unionized with the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) last spring, and have been negotiating their first collective agreement with the University since the fall.
According to AMUSE VP Floor Fellows Christina Clemente, the mobilization took place because the administration had not been receptive to the floor fellows’ demand to formally include their “core values,” which include a harm reduction approach and an anti-oppressive mandate, in the collective agreement itself.
The floor fellows met again for negotiations with the University nearly a week later on January 30; this time, the meeting had a different outcome.
“They came to us with a new proposal and they want to have some time to develop a way to include our values in the collective agreement,” Clemente told The Daily.
According to Clemente, the University will take the next month to develop a set of guiding principles to include in the collective agreement. They will meet with the floor fellows again in March to discuss this new proposal.
