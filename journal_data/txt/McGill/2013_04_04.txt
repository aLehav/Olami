External Affairs Officer claims executives cultivated culture of intimidation
In an atmosphere of distrust and animosity, Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) executives squared off yesterday at a meeting in the Thomson House Annex on allegations of bullying and sexual harassment brought forward by External Affairs Officer Errol Salamon and Equity Commissioner Gretchen King.
In a letter to the PGSS Board of Directors obtained by The Daily, Salamon and King alleged that some members of the PGSS executive routinely engaged in “sexual harassment, psychological intimidation, and discriminatory behaviour.”
The meeting was the culmination of a year-long conflict between members of an executive team where mistrust and divisions run so deep that officers regularly record each other’s public and private conversations without prior knowledge.
“It seems as if that these days, everybody is recording things. […] I feel like I need to practice what I’m going to say,” a member of the executive told The Daily.
The hostility pushed several members – including Salamon – to seek external help. 
“People are extremely upset.  […] We see each other every day and it has been getting worse and worse every day,” the same executive added.
For nearly an hour, several executive officers argued with Salamon over the validity of his claims. 
According to Salamon, an officer on the executive team exposed themselves and masturbated in front of  him and another executive officer after a meeting in June. “I was appalled, I was shocked. I couldn’t believe anyone would do that, especially in front of someone [they] didn’t actually know very well,” Salamon told The Daily.
The executive officer in question said they only removed their pants. 
“We were drinking, we were socializing. It was not PGSS business […] there was some consumption of marijuana by some people, and during that time, I did remove my pants, that’s true, but I never exposed myself, I never took out my genitalia,” they said.
The executive further alleged the claims were fabricated in response to disagreement that erupted between the two over a motion to censor Salamon at Council.
“I was willing to entertain alternative solutions to a censor motion, […] during this meeting [Salamon] stated ‘I will retaliate’ if a censor motion was brought forward, stating that [he] would accuse me of sexual harassment…” 
For Salamon, the June incident marked the beginning of a series of inappropriate sexual conducts from the same executive member, including making sexual advances at Salamon prior to the team’s departure to the executive retreat in Mont Tremblant and sexualized comments that were uttered toward another PGSS member who sat on one of Salamon’s committees.
“We’re talking about ten months of discomfort. […] I feel so uncomfortable. I’ve been bullied throughout this term,” Salamon said.
Other members of the executive team also made additional sexualized comments toward Salamon, he said. In one instance, an executive officer asked Salamon why he had not considered sleeping with the executive officer who had allegedly exposed themselves. 
In another instance, Salamon alleged that another member of the executive team threatened to reveal his relationship with a member of Divest McGill before an endorsement vote on the divestment campaign. According to Salamon, the threat was made in an attempt to sabotage the campaign. The allegation was denied by the executive officer in question at yesterday’s meeting.
Salamon is currently on a leave of absence, citing hostility with his co-workers.

Retrospective on the Principal’s ten-year term
In 2003, when outgoing Principal Heather Munroe-Blum began her first of two  five-year terms at McGill, her first meeting with student organizations touched on issues that still ring true today.
“I think the contribution of students to the total costs of student education is extraordinarily modest,” she told SSMU Council at that meeting. Such a comment would not be out of place nowadays.
Ten years later, as she prepares to pass the baton to Suzanne Fortier, Munroe-Blum’s term has seen recurring themes surrounding issues like university funding and labour negotiations, constituting an overarching shift in the University’s top priorities that will have repercussions for a long time to come.
Munroe-Blum began her term with the explicit goal of unfreezing tuition rates to allow for increases, while at the same time lobbying for additional funding from the Quebec government. She quickly went to work to achieve these goals.
In her second year of office, Munroe-Blum oversaw the privatization of international tuition, which allowed for significant increases in rates up to 8 per cent a year, and petitioned the Quebec government to lift its former freeze on rates for in-province students. Despite widespread student mobilization against tuition increases since 2012, Munroe-Blum has continued to push for their implementation, and most recently has started a campaign against $38 million in budget cuts imposed by the Quebec government.
Privatization of tuition fees continued in 2009, with the Desautels Faculty of Management MBA program. The administration turned down provincial budgetary subsidies in favour of charging its own tuition rates, which were raised to $29,500 at the time. This engendered a 1,663 per cent hike for in-province students – a move that sparked outrage amongst the Quebec community.
Munroe-Blum has also overseen significant changes in University and administration structure. In 2004, she personally drove a significant restructuring of McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG). In the name of efficiency, the BoG’s body was cut in half, from 45 to 25 members. Student voting seats went from four to two, with the non-voting seat reserved for the SSMU President eliminated. Today, there is one undergraduate seat which is appointed by SSMU. This voting seat is usually held by – but not reserved for – the SSMU President.
Seemingly innocuous changes, such as the implementation of the Principal’s Task Force in winter 2006, led to frustration within the student body – questions directed at the administration involving contentious issues such as the eviction of SACOMSS (Sexual Assault Centre of McGill Students’ Society) from its former setting often met the deflective statement, “The task force is looking into it.”
The privatization of university resources has been another source of controversy: from the renaming of the Faculty of Music in 2005 due to a $20 million donation from businessman Seymour Schulich to debate over the University’s involvement in investing in 645 publicly-traded corporations, including 14 directly involved in tar sands, Munroe-Blum has been accused of pushing priorities oriented toward a more business-friendly model.
This falls in line with other conflicts, including tensions with labour unions such as  the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) and Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE). MUNACA went on strike during the Fall 2011 semester, eventually ratifying a collective agreement with the administration at the end of that year.
Ultimately, Munroe-Blum’s term has been characterized by several overarching narratives, often perceived as oriented toward the administration rather than the student body. Certainly, not all reforms have been for the worse – such as the creation of the Arts & Science degree in 2004, among other new programs – and a mere half-page cannot begin to cover the lengthy reforms undertaken during her term. But as students face steeper fees for fewer services and hostility from the administration on a variety of issues, it remains essential to question, critique, and challenge the initiatives taken by the administration over the past ten years.

Prof, students vouch for program’s academic freedom
For the past three years, McGill has been the only Canadian university to receive an academic grant from the Charles G. Koch Foundation, an arm of the formidable political advocacy operation of Charles and David Koch, two American billionaires who have bankrolled the Tea Party movement and various climate-change deniers in recent years.
The $10,000 grant funds a political theory fellowship in which students meet to discuss seminal liberal texts under the guidance of libertarian theorist and McGill professor Jacob Levy. Undergraduates receive $500 for their participation in the Fellowship over the course of the year; graduate students get $750.
Over 200 American universities receive funding from the Foundation. The grant application page of their website reads, “the Foundation focuses its grantmaking on a select number of programs it believes are best positioned to support principles of liberty and long-term prosperity.”
Levy and several students interviewed by The Daily are adamant that the Fellowship – officially called the Research Group on Constitutional Studies Student Fellowship – meets the highest standards of academic freedom.
Byron Taylor-Conboy, a Master’s candidate who describes himself as a “progressive, left-leaning social democrat” said, “one of the reasons why I thought [the funding] was acceptable in this situation is that there was no sort of constraints on what we could talk about.”
Jake Bleiberg, U3 Political Science, echoed this. “In being exposed to those texts, you’re certainly getting a liberal perspective on the world. But I don’t feel as if there’s a political push behind it,” he said. “I think we’re looking at the books in the same critical way you would in a class.”
While all of the students contacted by The Daily thought the McGill Fellowship in question was free from overt interference on the part of the Foundation and were happy to be a part of it, some felt that Koch grants were symptomatic of larger problems in academia.
“I think the Koch brothers have been an example of using big money to privilege certain views, which I would say is anti-democratic,” said Isaac Stethem, who graduated last semester and has been a Fellow for two years.
Asked if he would be comfortable seeing a Koch grant at every Canadian university, Taylor-Conboy said, “Of course not.”
“I think it’s problematic, a massive private investment in universities, and we see it increasing now,” he went on. “I think it opens the door to a curtailing of intellectual thought and academic freedom.”
“Everything is dirty money. Anything we do now is dirty money – dirty money circulates in the system. So to say, ‘Oh, you know, this Koch Foundation money is dirty money,’ – maybe that’s correct, but the problem isn’t just the Koch Foundation, it’s the system.”
The Koch brothers have been explicit about the ideological control they try to wield over the organizations they fund. In 2007, David Koch told the libertarian journalist Brian Doherty, “If we’re going to give a lot of money, we’ll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes along with our intent. And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we don’t agree with, we withdraw funding. We do exert that kind of control.”
Presented with the quote, Levy countered that the McGill Fellowship was too small to merit such interference. “There’s one important part of that quote that you read, which is ‘a lot of money.’ […] $10,000 grants to universities aren’t like that,” he said.
In recent years, the Kochs have been in the spotlight for aggressively funding right-wing political causes. Greenpeace called Koch Industries, the brothers’ multinational corporation involved in various industrial and manufacturing activities, a “kingpin of climate science denial,” for spending more than ExxonMobil to fight against climate change legislation between 2005 and 2008.
In 2004, David Koch co-founded the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which recently has been involved in financing Tea Party groups and organizing anti-Obama rallies across the U.S.
Doherty has said that Charles Koch’s goal in entering political activism in the 1970s was to tear government “out at the root.”
“Do I worry about what other causes donors give to? Not as a rule,” Levy said. “I’m concerned about how they interact with their educational and university grants.”
• • •
The Foundation has no say over which students are admitted to the Fellowship, Levy says. Levy picks the Fellows himself, based largely on “the number and range of high-level courses in political theory, political philosophy, jurisprudence, and related fields, and the grades in those courses.”
Levy, who is listed as a guest lecturer on the website of the Koch-funded, libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, declined to show The Daily examples of his grant applications to the Koch Foundation, citing McGill’s donor privacy rules.
In an interview, he said the application consists largely of telling the Foundation what books he plans to assign. In the past three years, Fellows have read Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, Montesquieu’s Spirit of the Laws, and The Federalist Papers by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. This year, students are concentrating on Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville. Each book is a touchstone of liberalism.
Levy receives no money from the grant. He has been on sabbatical for four of the six semesters that the Fellowship has been in place at McGill. “This is teaching I’ve been doing in my spare time,” he said.
At the end of each year, Levy writes a report to the Foundation: “I say we met this many times, we successfully covered this many books, and for the students who are graduating, I say, here are the things that students are going on to do.”
The Foundation does not appear to be concerned with the Fellows’ ideological orientation, even if they are dramatically at odds with that of the libertarian Kochs. Mylène Freeman, one of the McGill students elected to Parliament as an NDP candidate in 2011, was a Fellow in the group’s first year at McGill. “I was happy and proud to include her accomplishment prominently in the year-end report I send to the Foundation of the impressive things our students go on to do,” Levy wrote in an email.
• • •
Last year, an employee of the Foundation visited McGill and sat in on one of the Fellowship’s discussions.
“Professor Levy mentioned beforehand, ‘just act the way you would normally act,’” Bleiberg said.
Still, when the employee – Stephen Sweet, Program Coordinator for Marketing and Recruiting at the Foundation – stood before the group and mentioned grants and internships that the Koch Foundation offered, some of the more left-wing Fellows bristled.
“At least one or two members asked questions that had to do with the ideology behind the group, or the principles tied up with it,” remembered Stethem.
“There were a good number of people last year who identified as part of the radical left,” Bleiberg said. “Someone tried to ask whether or not [the Koch Foundation was] open to employing people who really disagreed with them. I think he got a sort of non-answer to that.”
“[The Koch Foundation employee] was very directly challenged and from a radically different position. I don’t think the people who felt they had something to say to him tried to say it gently.”
Bleiberg said he saw this as evidence of the Fellowship’s academic freedom. After all, despite the testy exchange, McGill’s grant was renewed at the end of the year.
Levy says he intends to apply for the grant again this year.

As the five male journalists and photographers from The Daily, Le Délit, and the Bull and Bear sat down for the end of year interview with Principal Heather Munroe-Blum, she asked, in French: “Where are all the women?” 
Questions focused mainly on budget cuts and the recent protest protocol, as well as the reputation of McGill on the whole as an international institution. Munroe-Blum took the interview as an opportunity to reiterate the fact that the administration is trying its best to preserve academic quality throughout the cuts. She said that the administration has been lobbying the government against the cuts, and that its top priority is to get fair funding. She said that the government cuts are keeping universities “hostage,” and that this was the wrong way of going about cutting government spending – which she felt was important in light of the government’s deficit.
Speaking about the changes at McGill during her tenure, Munroe-Blum said that she thinks the biggest transformative factor has been globalization, motivating universities across the world to do research that “makes a difference socially and economically.”
She felt that democracy is currently in “full bloom” on campus, and she was happy that McGill is such an outspoken community. Student protests, she said, have not necessarily been bad for McGill’s reputation, and when asked about the new protest protocol, Munroe-Blum said that she was proud that McGill had seen “more demonstration in the last 24 months, of all kinds.” She felt that the new protocol managed to support the safety and sense of well-being of students and professors.
The McGill Daily (MD): McGill is the only university thus far that has decided to cut so drastically and immediately. Other universities are either dipping into their capital budgets, waiting on new directives, or counting on the promised $1.7 billion reinvestment. Why?
Heather Munroe-Blum (HMB): [McGill] dominantly delivers programs by our tenured professors, the majority of Quebecois universities run on a very different model, which is very much a chargé-de-cours and part-time student model. There’s no question that it costs more to run a research-intensive, graduate student-intensive university, with a range of professional faculties, and that is our mission […] Our credit rating is a credit rating that Quebec depends on. Quebec borrows money on our credit rating.
Le Délit (in French): Since the quiet revolution Quebeckers have been fighting against deregulating tuition fees, however, you have said that we have been treating tuition fees as a “vache sacrée,” that we have been giving this struggle too much importance. How can you say that McGill is part of Quebec but still have this view?
HMB: I don’t believe that professors should say things they don’t believe, and I look at the different data, and I see that in my first years here a frozen, low tuition fee, did not get accessibility, and it did not build quality. We don’t want American tuition fees here, but I think that it’s very important to be honest about what builds educational strength and what creates degree completion.
MD: The police have been especially heavy-handed with demonstrators this year. Do you think they could have had different tactics?
HMB: I don’t think I need to tell the police or the government how to run their circumstances. I was very surprised last spring that a range of universities in Quebec did not stand up for the right of students to attend their classes. And I did express this in the context of the university system.
MD: When we came in, you asked us “where are the women?” Do you consider yourself a feminist, and if so, what does this mean for you, and how does that translate into university policy?
HMB: I never thought of myself as a feminist or not, but I did hear my mother every day saying, education is the source of all things good. She believed very powerfully in that, and [she] lectured my brothers every day on how to treat women. That was the culture I grew up in. […] I saw in the days after [my appointment as Principal], how powerful it was, not just to women and girls, but to visible minorities, to older men who were immigrants, that McGill, this traditional university that everyone had seen as far off and untouchable, was suddenly open. And it was really a dramatic example, for me, of the power of symbols.

Troublesome reporting practices and infrastructural problems main culprits
Justin Marleau, the Vice-President of AGSEM, McGill’s teaching union, provided a critical appraisal of the University’s finances at March 22 presentation for Labour Week at McGill.
This analysis comes as University administrators across the province prepare to implement provincial budget cuts. At McGill, the cuts have taken a toll on staff, as the University asks different campus groups to accept wage and hiring freezes for the upcoming year and warns of layoffs.
In an interview with The Daily, Marleau explained that the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strike last semester, and the student movement of the past year, prompted him to look into the University’s finances.
“[I was] trying to figure out why McGill was always running deficits every single year. Because it is highly unusual that an organization would continuously run deficits every single year, unless there is something systematically wrong.”
One of Marleau’s problems with the University’s financial reporting practices is the significant gap between its projected and actual expenses and revenues. For example, operating revenues were projected to be $602.7 million in 2011 fiscal year (FY) and $652.7 million in the FY 2012 budget.  The actual operating revenues, however, were $630.9 million in FY 2011 and $709.8 million in FY 2012.
Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa told The Daily in an email that the inconsistency came in 2011 from changes to the measurement of the fiscal year, following a government mandate to change the end of the year from May 31 to April 30.
“FY 2011 was an 11 month reporting period. The difference is therefore based on real tuition not being prorated over the 11 month period while the budget had prorated tuition and fees for 11 months.”
Di Grappa attributed the discrepancy in 2012 “to sales of goods and services due to the operations of an additional residence (Carrefour Sherbrooke) and government grant adjustment, mostly related to enrolment.”
According to Marleau, some of the differences between budget projections and actual financial statements occur “because the assumptions behind the budgets turn out to be wrong.” To illustrate this, Marleau showed the enrolment projections included in the FY 2008 budget. At the time, the University calculated enrolment increases of no more than 2 per cent a year and decreases in almost every year of Doctoral enrolment. The actual enrolment of all full-time students, however, shows a different landscape, with increases of over 3 per cent for most years, including a 7.2 per cent increase for a year in which a decrease was projected.
According to Marleau, “there is no real explanation to be given, they just make assumptions, and for the enrolment data it is very surprising because you control it.”
Di Grappa told The Daily: “We have no control over how many students will accept the offers in any one year. Our past experience is that we have had more acceptances than anticipated,” he continued.
After this, Marleau focused his talk on the operating deficits the University has been running since 2007, and the decisions that cause these deficits.
McGill’s finances are divided into four funds: the operating fund, dealing with day-to-day expenses; the restricted fund; the Plant Fund, encompassing the capital assets of the University; and the endowment fund, essentially the University’s investment portfolio.
Marleau stated that operating deficits, as defined by McGill, occur only after inter-fund transfers.  “One should look at [the period] before the transfers to see if the operations are running the deficits or if it truly is caused by other activities.”
According to Marleau’s calculations, for example, in FY 2008, the University had an operating surplus of $7,198,000 before inter-fund transfer, and a $16,253,000 deficit after the transfer. This is the biggest discrepancy in the period between 2008 and 2012, but all years show a drop in the operating fund.
In the presentation, Marleau stated that the money transferred is going to capital purchases and to cover shortfalls created when payouts from the University’s endowment were reduced from 5 per cent to 4.25 per cent in 2010.
However, Marleau also pointed to the growth in expenses within the Operating Fund since FY 2007.  18 per cent was in academic salaries, which did not grow after 2010; 9.2 per cent in student salaries, 30.2 per cent in administrative and support staff; 39.1 percent in benefits, largely due to changes in benefits calculations, and 535 per cent in student aid, though he noted this growth only represents $22.7 million.
Within the administrative and support staff growth, Marleau also highlighted that the increase can be largely attributed to a 33 per cent increase in management positions from 2006 to 2011.
Speaking to this, Marleau suggested a reorganization of McGill’s managers, stating that the “increase in centralized administrative managers is troubling, as it is not clear why the growth is so large.”
Marleau later spoke to how choices could be made differently to avoid the current cuts McGill has to undertake.
“Maybe we should target those expenses that have raised too high a rate, rather than expenses that have not. That’s why I wanted to look at those specific items and then see where’s the money going, because you can’t, if you spend the money in a targeted manner and then force across the board cuts, you’re not doing it correctly,” Marleau told The Daily.
As such, Marleau has called for the re-evaluation of capital assets and needs. “The infrastructure is the problem, not the cost of employees, so from my perspective the operating fund normally would be fine if the infrastructure wasn’t problematic.”
In the presentation, he pointed to the $822 million in deferred maintenance costs for capital assets that are themselves only worth $1.2 billion.
When asked by The Daily if these costs could be reduced, Di Grappa stated: “The $822 million is the current value of work required to bring the buildings back to an acceptable state of operations. The $1.2 billion represents the cost of acquisitions of all our current capital assets. The two don’t relate.”
Marleau later pointed to potential discrepancies in the numbers and uncertain questions for the future.
“The evaluation of the capital infrastructure was done at the height of the corruption scandal here in Montreal for public works,” he said, “but to be quite honest, it may not actually be that high.”
“Should we try to have different buildings? Should we try to buy buildings off-campus, could that be cheaper, maybe it’s not worth it to repair certain buildings? Those are the type of questions that need to be asked.”

Widespread opposition to administration’s drastic measures
For non-unionized workers at McGill, the decision to freeze wages and hiring was made unilaterally by the administration, despite employee group representatives arguing that cuts on this scale would necessarily damage working conditions and compromise the quality of the University’s core mission. 
When the McGill University Non-Academic Staff Association (MUNASA) executive, which represents roughly 500 non-unionized workers on campus, met with human resources last Tuesday, they were told point blank that wages and hiring would be frozen, and that workers would be offered early retirement packages.
“It was presented to us as what the University was going to do,” MUNASA President Ron Critchley told The Daily. “We looked at [these measures], and we said, ‘In no way can we support this, this is going to really hurt our membership.’”
The decision to freeze professors’ salaries was made by the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT) executive along with a joint MAUT-administration compensation committee, and was never brought to the association’s council or membership.
MUNASA released a bulletin to its members Tuesday saying that the association “strongly [opposes] the approach put forward by the University,” which it believes will “have a profound effect upon all McGill staff and on services to students.”
“It is our conviction that not enough options have been explored to provide for an equitable solution that would have much less impact on staff morale and the operations of the University,” the bulletin continues.
In dealing with provincial cuts, McGill is taking some of the most drastic measures of Quebec universities, reiterating in several messages to the university community that it will have to slash its expenses to match government cuts in full.  In her latest message to the McGill community, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum also added September’s cancelled tuition hike to the administration’s calculus, pushing what the University needs to cut to $43 million, rather than $38 million – the actual amount withheld from McGill for this year and the next, following December’s cuts.
Université Laval, which was dealt a similar blow – $36 million in cuts for this year and the next – is taking a different approach. They will trim $3 million this year, $6 million next year, and deduct the remaining $27 million from the $1.7 billion reinvestment the province has promised in two year’s time.
A recent Montreal Gazette article quoted Laval’s vice-executive rector Éric Bauce saying that cutting $36 million would have been “impossible and unreasonable.”
Administrators say that McGill is unwilling to postpone cuts until they can be nullified by the reinvestment because it is conditional on Quebec’s economic situation.
Concordia is waiting until the end of April to make any decisions, and the Université de Québec à Montréal (UQAM) will be dipping into its capital funds to offset the cuts – something McGill has previously said it cannot do with such high deferred-maintenance costs.
MUNASA also takes issue with the manner in which information about the cuts and the University’s financial situation has been relayed to the community. They are “really troubled,” according to Critchley, by the $1.1 million jump in non-salary savings reported by the University in their latest message to the community.
“The lack of detail in the numbers driving these decisions troubles us greatly,” MUNASA’s statement reads.
In response to MUNASA’s bulletin, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa reiterated in an email to The Daily that these measures were intended to mitigate the need for layoffs in a second round of cuts.
“This is a very difficult situation for everyone, and we understand that these measures will cause distress for some members in our community,” he said.

Recent police crackdowns in Quebec spark international concern
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) joined eight international civil society NGOs in late March in writing a letter calling for the UN to amend a draft resolution protecting the right to protest. The letter directly cited police repression in Quebec as a primary example of recent violations of that right.
The letter addresses a need for more precise language involving peaceful protests, wherein current broad definitions can result in violations of democratic rights. It also calls for reduced state violence during peaceful protests, and identifies a need to regulate government protocols for the use of less-lethal weapons technology.
“We believe that protests need to not just be tolerated, but be facilitated in a democratic society,” Cara Zwibel, director of the Fundamental Freedoms Program at the CCLA, told The Daily. “It is through these protests that people deal with grievances in a democratic society.”
The CCLA is a national organization with a self-described mission to promote “respect for, and observance of, fundamental human rights and civil liberties.” Previously, the CCLA, along with fifty other organizations, called for a public inquiry into police actions during the Quebec student protests.
The letter addressed to the UN comes in light of ongoing observations of repressive state measures at peaceful demonstrations in Quebec, and seeks to shine a critical light on this issue.
In the past month alone, Montreal has seen at least three protests shut down by preemptive police intervention. Such intervention tactics typically employ frequent use of non-lethal weapons, such as CS gas bombs.
“In our experience, many countries deploy this technology at a much earlier stage […] using it to disperse peaceful protests or in lieu of other available de-escalation techniques,” the letter states. The letter recommends that established protocols be put in place to regulate the use of such weapons.
However, this is not the case in Quebec, where these weapons are used arbitrarily at protests. These measures have been attributed to the municipal by-law P-6, which requires protestors to provide the routes and dates of demonstrations to police for approval in advance.
In addition to the use of non-lethal weapons, the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) has used tactics such as kettling and mass arrests to contain protests.
“We are concerned that the police have chosen this by-law. In both [the] Quebec and Canadian charters there are protections from unreasonable detention when the police detain people. I can’t say if they’ve been adhered to,” said Zwibel.
“It’s an attempt to discourage protest activity, for sure,” she said. “The protests [in Montreal] have gotten much smaller. It could be a function of people deciding if it’s worth the trouble.”
Such tactics, Zwibel said, may discourage protest on a larger level.
“There will always be people who are very committed to the cause and willing to face the consequences,” she noted, “but even people who are committed to the cause may decide that the constant interaction with the police and the ticketing is detracting from the ability to protest.”
Additionally, the letter raised concerns about bystanders facing the brunt of these police tactics.
“The blanket classification of an entire assembly as non-peaceful has the effect of arbitrarily abrogating the peaceful assembly rights of a large number of individuals,” the letter states.
The letter also raises broader civil liberties concerns regarding increased state restrictions on protesting.
“Although protest management can be an important state role, excessive state regulation of peaceful assembly also has the potential to significantly chill peaceful protest,” the letter states.
The letter specified the need to “include a recognition that the state’s responsibility to protect, respect, and fulfill the right to peaceful assembly […] extends to the obligations to minimize legislative or regulatory practices that may chill the exercise of these rights, including measures such as prior approval permitting schemes.”

This year’s SSMU executive was characterized by a lack of ambition and an unwillingness to tackle divisive issues. Apart from their basic roles, executives failed to undertake any significant projects or truly engage with political issues. SSMU is, in many ways, no different than it was a year ago. Many of the problems our union faces, such as lease negotiations, persist to this day.
 
Josh Redel
As President, Josh Redel took the lead of SSMU following a highly politicized year with the intentions of keeping his executive, and the student body, undivided. This was shown in the successful integration of different faculties with the SEAMLESS conference and better integration during Orientation Week. However, this improved integration came at the expense of SSMU’s political role, which was minor throughout the year, sometimes even failing to support student groups and causes.
This semester, in lease negotiations, as well as in Board of Governors and Senate,  Redel adopted a stronger line – yet perhaps not strong enough. His role as a liaison could have benefited from better communication with the student body, so as to better elucidate the state of the budget and lease negotiations.
As with most past presidents, he tackled the recurring issue of poor attendance at SSMU GAs. Redel focused on technical solutions like clickers, which, although well-intended, were not enough to engage students and increase attendance.
Within his portfolio, Redel implemented some sustainability initiatives like the green GA. Redel also developed accountability measures in the Human Resources department, which have been useful given the lack of commitment by some members of the executive.
 
Allison Cooper
VP Clubs & Services Allison Cooper was by far the most politically active member of the executive team. Cooper was a strong advocate for student groups and an ardent supporter of student rights. She consistently brought forward motions at GAs, and her knowledge of issues outside of her portfolio made for an invaluable contribution to Council sessions.
Although she started the year slowly, Cooper launched a new informational website, Clubpedia, and has been working on an online club management portal, Club Hub. She also spearheaded the space campaigns, one of the most notable efforts undertaken by SSMU this semester.
 
JP Briggs
Throughout the year, VP Finances and Operations JP Briggs communicated poorly with students and student media, making it difficult to keep him accountable. Briggs contributed little to Council meetings, and his term was marked by a general disinterest in student issues.
According to the executive attendance report, Briggs consistently came in late to the SSMU office at 11 a.m., missed meetings, and was often late to other events. This lack of commitment was particularly troublesome, as the society faces financial uncertainty from the lease negotiations, and a projected deficit of $211,320.
Even though a two-year plan for a student-run cafe was created by last year’s SSMU executive, with the goal of opening in Fall 2013, no concrete steps have been taken, and the project’s time frame has expanded considerably.
 
Michael Szpejda
As VP Internal, Michael Szpedja did the bulk of his work over the summer overseeing the restructuring of Orientation Week. Following this effort, however, Szpejda seemed to have lost momentum and his work mostly went unnoticed. Like Briggs, Szpedja did not adequately communicate with student media, and rarely spoke up at Council meetings. He also failed to engage students through the weekly listserv, which was demonstrated by SSMU’s feeble advertising efforts to events such as the poorly attended GAs.
Szpejda could have undertaken initiatives to communicate more with other portfolios, and to implement the SSMU Equity Policy so as to prevent the mixed reviews on Frosh and incidents like blackface at 4Floors.
 
Robin Reid-Fraser
The portfolio of VP External is traditionally the most politically charged of the executive, but Robin Reid-Fraser’s political action failed to live up to expectations. The first Introduction to Quebec Week in January was undermined by miscommunication. Many events were cancelled, and the ones that weren’t were plagued with low attendance.
Reid-Fraser also failed to create an open line of communication between TaCEQ and the student body, making it difficult for SSMU and TaCEQ to establish a productive relationship. This was Reid-Fraser’s biggest failure, and she was often criticized for it by councillors.
However, Reid-Fraser cannot be blamed entirely for TaCEQ’s disappointment. The group itself has been characterized by disorganization and inefficiency.
The creation of two Community Ambassador positions for the Milton-Parc community was also one of Reid-Fraser’s initiatives. Although the initiative is too new to see many tangible results, the position is a step in the right direction.
 
Haley Dinel
Throughout her term as VP University Affairs, Dinel has not been a particularly strong voice in negotiating with McGill, whom Dinel characterized as sometimes being “a brick wall.” Although some initiatives are more invisible to the general student body, Dinel has lacked any real impact on student-administration relations.
Dinel, along with Redel, is responsible for handling a third year of lease negotiations with McGill for the Shatner building. Despite numerous progress updates, the negotiations seem set to roll over for a fourth consecutive year with the new executive.
One of her biggest accomplishments this year was the creation of a minor in the North American Indigenous Studies program.
Dinel, as the executive in charge of the Equity Policy, saw an important failure with the incident at 4Floors, where a student wore blackface. This semester, Dinel has been working with the VP Internal and VP Clubs & Services to shift the focus of the Equity Policy for next year from dealing with complaints to implementing preventative measures.

The McGill Daily
The end of the school year also marks the end of the tenure of Morton Mendelson as McGill’s Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning). Of all the administrators working at McGill, Morton Mendelson’s name has been in the pages of this newspaper and in other campus media more than any other, except possibly Principal Heather Munroe-Blum. After seven years in the position, The Daily sat down with Mendelson for an hour-long interview to put together an overarching picture of his time here, and the ways in which the position has changed McGill.
The position itself was created as a result of Munroe-Blum’s Spring 2005 “Task Force on Student Life and Learning.” The task force’s mandate was to “broadly examine and enhance the student experience at McGill.” Mendelson joined the task force in the fall of 2005, replacing Martha Crago, also an administrator.
Mendelson was appointed to the newly-created position in July 2006. The task force’s final report, submitted to the principal in December of that year, said that the brand-new Deputy Provost would “champion the development of a greater sense of belonging for McGill students.”
Did he? Do students have a greater sense of belonging here?
We may never know, four-year undergraduate degrees being what they are. There are, to be sure, different schools of thought on that question, but it is undeniable that Mendelson has left his mark on university life at McGill. His office was occupied last year for nearly a week, with students demanding his resignation, among other things.
That occupation, he said, had an “awful impact on this office.”
“People in my office are still rattled,” he said, bemoaning what he called the necessity of increased security in the James building.
Indeed, the James building is now a remarkably different place than it was a few years ago. The interview that constitutes much of this story was months in the making, Mendelson only agreeing to it after seeing a list of topics. The door to his office on the sixth floor is now locked, a development Mendelson says he hates.
In addition to demanding his resignation, the occupiers of Mendelson’s office were protesting his refusal to recognize the element of a CKUT and QPIRG referendum question that sought to make both their student fees non-opt-outable.
Speaking of the occupation, Mendelson said: “there was a lack of empathy for the effect that this would have. The irony is the event did not change or did not achieve the goal” that the occupiers sought. Mendelson is finishing his term and the fees for CKUT and QPIRG remain opt-outable. The administration did agree to recognize the vote as a referendum on existence – though not on the issue of online opt-outs – an agreement Mendelson said was reached before the occupation.
Over the years, campus groups such as CKUT, QPIRG, and – in the interest of full disclosure – this newspaper have decried the mandated existence referenda as an attack on independent student life at the university. Mendelson, however, views the existence referenda as crucial to maintaining the “accountability” of the student groups.
“If the students say [a particular student group] shouldn’t be operating, then they shouldn’t be operating,” he said. The principle, for Mendelson, is that the University administration is charged with “putting our hand into student pockets and taking money and handing it over to a third party.” He disagreed with the suggestion that the same logic could be applied to other functionings of the University that involved third parties, such as construction companies, functionings that don’t require the student body to vote. Mendelson pointed out that as of yet, there has not been an existence referendum question that has failed.
Another of the high profile developments involving Mendelson’s office during his tenure is the authoring of a protocol governing future protest on campus. Flowing out of the occupation, the administration established a new set of rules by which protests could take place on campus, along with guidelines for security services to police them. The initial version of the protocol drew fierce opposition from campus activists and unions, and even drew a condemnation from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. The administration eventually split the protocol into two parts: a set of operating procedures and a statement of values, with only the second part to be voted on by Senate, which approved the statement last month.
Mendelson said he was pleased with how the process surrounding the protocol ultimately went. “I think the university engaged in a very serious conversation about a very serious issue,” he said.
Referencing a particularly heated 2009 confrontation between Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney and protesters from the group No One Is Illegal, Mendelson said that over the course of his tenure he has “been surprised…about the degree to which some students are very intolerant of what is being expressed, but extremely tolerant about how opinions are expressed.”
Expression of student opinion is certainly a topic Mendelson is familiar with. He has been one of the primary targets of student anger over the years, consistently bearing the brunt of criticism for various administrative decisions. From the repeated attempts to close the Architecture Café, to student referenda, to the protest protocol, it has most often been Mendelson that is seen by student activist circles as the villain.
“That was the part of this job that was the most surprising,” Mendelson said, adding that he felt as though he was the lightning rod for all administrative decisions that were disliked by students.
Of all his accomplishments during his tenure, Mendelson said he was most proud of connections he established between various previously independently operating units on campus, and the team he built to do it. The more streamlined approach, Mendelson said, is consistent with the task force’s recommendations on the fostering of a “student-centric” university.
The most visible manifestation of the streamlining of bureaucracy is, of course, Service Point. According to Mendelson, the Service Point combines services for students that were previously dispersed across seven offices in four buildings into a single location.
Does Mendelson have any regrets?
“We were not as successful in getting that across to students, I think, as we should have been. Maybe part of that was issues of communication and consultation,” he said. He stressed though that he feels communication from students to the University has improved from a decade ago, pointing to the forthcoming implementation of a student co-chair on the Senate committee on student services.
It hasn’t yet been announced who will fill Mendelson’s shoes, but they will be walking into one of the most watched positions in the McGill administration.

This year’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) executive was made up of  Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney, External Affairs Officer Errol Salamon,  Academic Affairs Officer Adam Bouchard, Financial Affairs Officer Pooja Tyagi (replaced by Erik Larson as of March 22), Internal Affairs Officer Michael Krause, and Member Services Officer Elizabeth Cawley.
Salamon started the year off strong in August, organizing an English-language electoral debate alongside SSMU, the Concordia Student Union, the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association, and the Dawson Student Union. One of the only English-language debates of its kind, it was an opportunity for the anglophone student unions to collaborate further throughout the year.
PGSS, in collaboration with SSMU, organized an alternative education  summit in December in preparation for the provincial education summit in February. “We addressed several key issues, including tuition, university financing, international and out-of-province students, and university-industry partnerships,” wrote Salamon in an email to The Daily.
However, Salamon told The Daily that some students didn’t feel comfortable attending, due to administrative interference in the event. “According to the PGSS Secretary-General, the administration even asked PGSS to remove particular McGill student presenters from the event because of their political views,” he wrote.
Salamon has also been a proponent of francophone culture at McGill, especially after an executive meeting in October that almost led to the cutting of French translation services at PGSS. “At many PGSS meetings, I’ve supported a bilingual McGill, highlighting historical struggles of francophone Quebeckers in Quebec and the continued need to fight for university education and services that are accessible to francophone students,” he said. Cawley also told The Daily that a group has recently been formed to create a formal PGSS language policy, and will be meeting in the coming weeks.
Salamon was the only person on the PGSS executive who voted against taking the same stance on tuition as Conférence des recteurs et des principaux des universités du Québec (CREPUQ). CREPUQ has long argued that universities in Quebec are underfunded. During a meeting, Salamon alleged that Mooney had tabled the motion after meetings with Vice-President (External Affairs) Olivier Marcil.
Notable successes for this year’s PGSS executive include the beginning of a project to create a daycare, and the creation of a better online content management system for their website. Mooney also counted the successful campaign for accreditation in March, with a 29 per cent voter turnout, as one of the biggest successes this year.
“We worked with [the Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies office] and McGill [Network and Communication Services] to increase student e-mail space from 200 MB to 300 MB, and negotiated a reduction in the fees postgrads have to pay to use the gym, the sports medicine clinic, and fitness and [recreation] courses,” Mooney told The Daily by email.
February was marked by more turmoil for PGSS. That month, the Art History and Communications Studies Graduate Student Association (AHCS-GSA) voted to join the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), considered Quebec’s most radical student union. PGSS is a parent organization to AHCS-GSA. Typically, all graduate and postdoctoral fellows are associated with another union, the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ).
Later in the month, the Chief Returning Officer Brock Rutter resigned from his post, storming out of a debate between PGSS candidates and shouting, “You people are ridiculous. You aren’t fit for this university, you aren’t fit for society.”
Mooney, Bouchard, and Cawley are running unopposed for reelection in their positions for next year. Larson and Krause both face opponents, and Navid Khosrav will be running for External Affairs.

Discussion focuses on student involvement, advising
Plans to restructure Leacock and reorganize its administrative units were put before roughly 30 Arts students on Tuesday night at an Arts Town Hall meeting as part of the Arts faculty’s People, Processes & Partnerships initiative. 
In the basement of the building under consideration, students directed questions to Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi, Associate Dean (Academic Administration and Oversight) Gillian Lane-Mercier, and Associate Dean (Student Affairs) Lucyna Lach.
The major points of discussion were the process of student consultation and the effectiveness of the advising systems in the Arts faculty. Students voiced concerns similar to those raised at previous town halls and council meetings regarding departmental integrity and community.
On the topic of changing advising structures in the Arts faculty, Lach explained that the proposed central advising hub for the third floor of Leacock would include an Arts OASIS advisor, thereby allowing “cross-pollination” between faculty and departmental advisors.
Upon criticism of this kind of advising restructuring, as well as more general criticism of the advising system, Manfredi called upon students to explain “how it’s been ineffective.” Students responded with concerns about already existing problems such as new students no longer having assigned advisors.
A second major focus of the night was the process of student consultation, and the effectiveness of efforts designed to attract student involvement. Noting that between 40 and 50 students out of 3,000 invited attended a consultation co-hosted by AUS and OASIS, the question of how to reach a larger proportion of the student body was raised.
“We sent out information and expect[ed] it to be cascaded,” said Manfredi. Several student association representatives proposed ideas for better communication.
Morgane Suel, president of the Anthropology Students’ Association, suggested to Manfredi that they should communicate with the student associations rather than the student body, and allow the representatives to reach out on a broader scale.
History Students’ Association VP Internal Affairs Laure Spake suggested that delegates be sent to consultations from student associations so that they can better communicate with their constituents.
Other ideas for facilitating student involvement included sending emails over departmental rather than faculty listservs, or creating a board of ideas in a common space.
In an interview with The Daily, Manfredi reflected on the ideas raised with regard to student consultation. “We’re always trying to communicate with students and get their feedback…and I think we got some great ideas. […] We have an incentive to communicate effectively; we want to communicate effectively.”
While focusing on the restructuring of Leacock, the Town Hall also cast light on the plans to relocate departments in 688 Sherbrooke and the Ferrier building.
Manfredi described the plans – scheduled for this coming summer – that would see 688 Sherbrooke become the location of the East Asian Studies department, instead of the current location of the French Language department, as “not particularly problematic.” Plans for 688 Sherbrooke, according to Manfredi, are not part of the People, Processes & Partnerships initiative.
To train administrative workers to work for multiple departments in 688 Sherbrooke, a cross-training program will be implemented. This same program is proposed for training administrative workers in the Leacock building should the restructuring be approved.
Manfredi said that the administrative officers that will be affected are “quite happy about the possibility of having other people to talk to.”
