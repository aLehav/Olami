SSMU and PGSS encouraged by new long-term approach to enrolment management
As McGill’s new enrolment management plan inches its way towards approval at Senate in March, student representatives are negotiating changes to the plan with the administration.
A draft of the Strategic Enrolment Management (SEM) plan has been in circulation since October, when it was released to Senators. The plan calls for increases in graduate and international student enrolment, as well as the complete deregulation of international tuition and a geographical shift in international recruitment priorities.
“Overall I think they had a lot of good things within the document, but there are a lot of points that need clear elaboration,” said Joshua Abaki, SSMU VP University Affairs.
The plan aims to increase the total international student population from 20 to 22 per cent of the overall student body, or by over 500 students. In a draft of a SSMU submission to the Senate caucus developing the plan, Abaki asks for increased support for International Student Services (ISS) in light of the projected increase in international student enrolment.
The SSMU submission notes that in the last five years the proportion of international students has increased by 18 per cent – or slightly over 1,100 students. Meanwhile, said Abaki, in the last five years ISS have only added one more staff member.
In terms of international student support, Abaki was also concerned with the recent removal of provincial government subsidies for international students learning French.
“It doesn’t make sense at any level, because if international students are coming here and we want them to settle well in the community, it’s really important that we make it possible for them to be able to learn French. I think it’s something that the government holds dearly, and I hope McGill holds dearly,” he said.
Abaki is commissioning a report to research the escalating needs of international students, and is lobbying both the University and the provincial government to jointly subsidize French courses for international students, although he outlined SSMU contingencies should those attempts at subsidization fail.
“If the University is not interested in providing French courses at a much subsidized price, then we [would] definitely expand the scope of [SSMU] MiniCourses so that more students can access the French course,” he said.
Abaki said he has discussed providing French language services to international students with PGSS in the event that such courses don’t receive government or University subsidies, and PGSS president Alexandra Bishop acknowledged that PGSS may have to re-orient their services to accommodate the growing international student population on campus.
“The SEM focuses on recruiting top quality graduate students. … This may also create a more diverse graduate student body, and as a result we may have to evaluate the services we provide our membership and expand those to meet new demands,” wrote Bishop in an email to The Daily.
Another issue SSMU and PGSS are uniting behind is the draft consultation’s avoidance of the space and resource constraints that would result from the enrolment increases it prescribes.
“I would hope that McGill has planned to allocate more space for graduate student offices and labs, to accommodate the expected increase of students,” said Bishop.
“Space is really a major problem both for undergraduate students and grad students, and of course it’s definitely affecting the quality of education,” said Abaki. “The University first of all must clearly show that we are capable of handling an increased number of graduate students.”
The last major point of contention for Abaki concerns the new proportion of undergraduate to graduate students that could result from the implementation of the SEM plan – numbers that aren’t empirically referenced in the draft consultation.
“They definitely clearly need to articulate those goals, they definitely need to mention what those percentages are, and what they mean for different faculties,” he said, mentioning that different enrolment proportions could harm accessibility.
According to the draft consultation, McGill will increase graduate student enrolment “according to goals set through the Graduate Capacity Compact Process and will be appropriately balanced with undergraduate enrolments.” The Graduate Capacity Compact Process (GCCP) was not further described in the SEM plan, nor even mentioned again.
Abaki described the GCCP as “something that’s currently evolving,” and expressed concern that one of the SEM plan’s most significant changes – graduate enrolment – was based on such an unelaborated document.
“That’s problematic. It refers to a document that does not exist, or maybe it’s currently evolving or put together,” said Abaki.
Besides these points of contention, however, there are many features of the SEM plan both Abaki and Bishop support, including efforts to increase student diversity and accessibility for socio-economically disadvantaged students, Aboriginal students, and students with disabilities.
“The SEM also addresses many factors that will lead to a better graduate student experience, such as improving the supervisors-to-graduate student ratio and the quality of supervision provided,” said Bishop.
Abaki also praised McGill’s attempt to finally propose a long-term enrolment plan.
“It’s definitely great that now a long-term plan has been articulated,” said Abaki. “That will definitely – at the institutional level – make it easier for planning, and as well for people to anticipate what’s going to happen and for the University to align its goals appropriately.”
Representatives from both student societies have already met with McGill administrators drafting the SEM plan, and both are also submitting recommendations to the Senate caucus drafting the plan.
Abaki made a presentation on the SEM plan to SSMU Council January 6, and Bishop hopes to discuss the plan with PGSS Council February 2.
“There has been a lot of consultation about this,” said Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning, noting that discussion of the plan at Senate had been delayed from February to March, “because we weren’t able to get all the consultations done that we felt we needed to engage in.”
Specifics regarding enrolment and the deregulation of international tuition, however, remain an issue that Abaki is determined to resolve before SSMU approves the plan.
“They say they want to increase the proportion of graduate students…but they don’t mention the desired proportions,” said Abaki. “Until we see that – and what it means for different undergraduate populations – we won’t endorse the document.”
When asked for SSMU’s position on the proposed across-the-board deregulation of tuition rates for international students, Abaki said that the rates weren’t mentioned in the submission. He maintained, however, that “we definitely don’t support” the deregulation and said he planned to add this opposition to SSMU’s submission.

In the largest recorded meeting of Quebec attorneys to date, the Association of Prosecutors in Criminal and Penal Prosecutions of Quebec (APCPP) voted Saturday in favour of a mandate to strike if the provincial government does not meet their demands.
According to the APCPP, Quebec prosecutors are the lowest paid in the country, receiving thirty per cent less than the national average.
“We’re unhappy because there’s a pay scale that hasn’t really changed in a long time in spite of promises to fix it over the last ten years,” said APCPP spokesperson, J.D. Jerols.
“We’re in a position where we’re losing competent attorneys… They’re going…to Alberta and Ontario and…taking early retirement. … It’s impossible to hire new attorneys with experience,” he added.
The APCPP claims that without an additional 150 to 200 prosecutors, they are unable to devote sufficient time to each case, creating significant ethical issues. “If it’s your daughter that was sexually assaulted or your wife that was beaten and robbed or your son who was the victim of fraud then you want to expect the prosecutor to be top quality,” said Jerols.
A group representing Quebec jurors, the Association of Government Jurors, voiced similar concerns and has formed an allegiance with the APCPP. Jerols said the two groups have agreed that neither will settle for a lower salary than the other.
There is also a possibility that the two will strike together, which will cause significant delays in the Quebec legal system.
In the event of a strike, all cases not involving a detained individual or a jury will be postponed.
While the Association of Government Jurors has voted in favour of a strike, the APCPP feels differently.
“We would like to avoid a strike,” said Jerols,
Unlike jurors, prosecutors are not granted the right to binding arbitration, a process that allows the conflict to be resolved by a neutral party.

One day before proceedings were set to begin, the City of Montreal withdrew its case against the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) over a $2,500 postering fine. AUS is no longer responsible for either the fine itself or any court fees associated with the case.
AUS was charged for violating a city by-law which prohibits public posting in February 2010 after the Arts Undergraduate Theatre Society (AUTS) posted a flyer on the corner of University and Milton promoting their upcoming production of Cabaret.
Dave Marshall, AUS president, said that the courts did not have a “substantial enough case to continue prosecuting.” Marshall also said that, since AUS didn’t put up the poster, they never should have been the target of the fine in the first place.
Marshall explained that the City would have had to have found all the individuals who put up the poster, and found evidence that they had put the poster up, in order to fine them.
“The AUTS doesn’t exist as a legal entity, it’s just an informal group of students,” said Marshall. “It makes it very easy to go after us [the AUS] though, because we are a legal entity.”
Marshall said that this clear distinction between AUTS, who put up the poster, and AUS, would have been his main argument in court against the fine.
Marshall’s other defense challenged the constitutionality of the by-law prohibiting public posting, a law Marshall said was created in the nineties for the benefit of cleanliness.
“[The law] severely restricts the ability of groups to express themselves, particularly when the fine for a non-profit company such as us is as steep as it was,” said Marshall.
Marshall entered a not guilty plea on behalf of AUS in May of last year. Three months later in July, however, the by-law under which AUS was charged was declared invalid by the Quebec Court of Appeal, who had found it a violation of the Canadian Charter or Rights and Freedoms, for a period of six months.
“I think the justification behind making the law invalid…was to either have them revise the law so that it was less unconstitutional…or [to create] an opportunity during that six months for the City to put up more notice boards, more legal opportunities, for people to post so that they’re not completely restricted,” said Marshall.
“The reason that it was declared invalid for six months is really to force the City with a very strict timeline to revise that law. I haven’t found any indication that the City has actually done that yet,” he said.

SSMU President holds town hall on his motion
Yesterday, SSMU President Zach Newburgh hosted a  town hall forum to discuss his proposal to abolish the General Assembly (GA), and replace it with an Annual General Meeting. The motion, which has prompted criticism over a lack of consultation – as well as the creation of numerous Facebook events – will be debated at the next SSMU Legislative Council on February 3. If Council passes the motion, it will become a referendum question in the online winter referendum period, open to all undergraduate students.
The meeting began with few participants, most of whom were members of the student media, but attendance increased as the meeting progressed, peaking at about forty students. The town hall was organized by Newburgh after articles in both The Daily and Tribune linked him with the motion to abolish the GA. For most of the town hall Newburgh limited the parameters of the town hall to the “strengths and weaknesses” of the current structure of the GA and the “merits of the referendum question” outlined on a blackboard in the room. When questioned about the positions of SSMU executives on the issue, Newburgh reiterated these guidelines, despite VP External Myriam Zaidi’s post on the Facebook event, which stated that “the current SSMU executive is divided on this question.”
Discussion opened with comments from Engineering Senator Andrew Doyle, who said that there are “far too few good resolutions that come forward at the GA.”
Councillor Zach Margolis noted that any reform will need to go “beyond tinkering and promoting it.”
The accessibility of GAs was another central point of discussion.  “I wouldn’t be comfortable writing legislation,” explained Arts student Lily Schwarzbaum. “Discussion is what makes the student body not so apathetic.”
Other students echoed this sentiment, and the process of writing and submitting referendum questions was repeatedly labeled “opaque.” Speakers targeted Robert’s Rules, the system that governs GAs and Council meetings, as a key problem.
Doyle pointed out that “too many people who know Robert’s Rules use them to hijack the process.” Numerous students suggested the idea of GAs serving as a forum for debate, with voting moved to an online system.
Advertisement initiatives were another popular topic. VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew asserted that previous executives had failed to spend the entirety of their advertisement budget, resulting in a smaller budget for this year. He also emphasized the increased use of free advertisement through social media.
Notably absent from the vocal audience were student groups who often submit motions, including the Engineering Undergraduate Society and Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR).
SPHR members authored the motion that created controversy at the Winter 2010 GA, which called for the creation of a social responsibility committee, and sparked debate about the inclusion of a phrase regarding the “unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”
SPHR filed a Judicial Board complaint against Newburgh in March 2010. The complaint accused Newburgh of a conflict of interest, as he chaired the GA in his role as Speaker of Council while serving as president of the city-wide Jewish organization Hillel Montreal. The Judicial Board is the mechanism by which students can challenge the conduct of SSMU officials or bodies, according to the SSMU constitution. Newburgh was eventually cleared of all wrongdoing.
Newburgh was also heavily involved in the Winter 2009 GA, which caused controversy with a motion requesting that SSMU condemn bombings of educational institutions in Gaza. At the time, Newburgh organized the Facebook event, “SSMU: Vote Against the Condemnation of Israel,” and wrote to students that “the GA is not an appropriate forum to express external political issues.”
At Wednesday’s town hall, Newburgh took notes and summarized arguments for speakers as discussion progressed. Drew, another mover of the original resolution, typed minutes, which will be available publicly. “I think a lot of the arguments that were made were rehashing old arguments,” Newburgh said after the event, “but there were at least one or two comments that were very helpful, so I hope to use those comments to strengthen a reform of the GA.”

Thirteen arrested, 2,700 counterfeit textbooks seized in RCMP raids
Thirteen copy store owners and employees were arrested at four copy stores in Montreal last Thursday for selling illegally photocopied textbooks. The RCMP seized around 2,700 counterfeit books over the last few weeks.
Investigations started this past fall, when the RCMP received several complaints from university publishes that Montreal copy centres were photocopying textbooks illegally and selling them at a fraction of the price.
“Many students brought concerns to some legitimate stores and those stores came to us and prompted the investigation,” said RCMP Corporal Luc Thibault.
“We are still investigating and unless someone is charged, we can’t release the names of the copyright stores or of the people arrested,” said Thibault.
If suspects are found guilty, they could be charged with violating the Copyright Act and fined up to $1 million dollars or be imprisoned for up to five years.
Third-year McGill social work student Sivan Havusha heard from a friend that Copie 2000 at Stanley and Sherbrooke photocopied textbooks at a low cost. She borrowed two textbooks from friends to get them photocopied.
“I felt bad for doing it, but my textbooks all cost more than $100 each. I felt I could justify it because books are so expensive and I didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on textbooks,” she said.
She also said that a CBC reporter who interviewed her had mentioned that Copie Nova – a copy store located on Sherbrooke at Peel where McGill students often purchase coursepacks – blew the whistle on its competitor, Copie 2000.
The RCMP confirms that the majority of complaints came from legitimate copy stores. Copie Nova said they had no idea how the investigation got started.
The owner of Copie 2000 has owned the store for 26 years, but said he had no problems until two weeks ago. “We’ve been photocopying textbooks for years with no problem and then the police came two weeks ago and took everything as evidence. Before, we never used to check when people asked us to photocopy things. Now, we have to be very careful and make sure that everything students give us won’t violate any copyright laws,” said the owner, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A representative of McGill-Queen’s University Press said they did not hear any complaints about illegal copying, and that it is a significant loss when stores photocopy books illegally, since course books are a major source of their revenue.
Adrian Edwards, owner of the independent Word bookstore on Milton, said textbook prices are a real problem.
“I’ve been checking prices on books for 25 years and they have been rising steadily beyond the rate of inflation. When a book is reasonably priced, the price immediately goes up once it is used for a large class,” said Edwards. “Students are being taken advantage of and it’s a real scam.”
McGill mathematics professor Stephen Drury agreed. “I would like textbooks to be cheaper but unfortunately, they’re not. The real problem is the constant publishing of new editions every year – and I’ve found that the textbooks get even worse with every edition. That’s why I tell my students that any old textbook will do,” said Drury.
This is not the first time copy stores have been busted. In January 2006, the owner of the U Compute store near Concordia University was charged with copyright infringement, punished with a six-month suspension, and required to complete 400 hours of community service.
“People blame the McGill bookstores, but it’s really the publishers who set the high prices. Because of that, illegal photocopying has been going on for years, and periodically the police fine stores just to calm it down, but it always starts again.”

Donation-based collective failed to renew provincial certification, blames SSMU for lack of warning
Midnight Kitchen, the McGill collective that provides vegan lunches by donation every weekday, was informed Tuesday that it would have to stop serving food because the collective’s certification under the Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation du Québec, was no longer valid under changed laws.
Midnight Kitchen (MK) administrator Emily Zheng said that the collective “only just came under the permit late last year.”
“Before that, we existed in this space where, because there aren’t any laws for groups like us, nobody really told us that we needed a permit. Last April was when we were told that we would be a liability if we don’t apply for this permit,” she said.
SSMU Vice President, Clubs and Services Anushay Khan said that temporarily closing the kitchen is necessary until the collective acquires a new permit.
“MK could be fined up to $2,000 per day,” Khan said, adding that “SSMU could cover the costs for the fine – but if we were fined, then reapplying for a permit would be even harder.”
“We were recently informed that we had to do [the certification] every single year,” said Khan, citing an inspector’s visit from February 2010, when it was established that ten per cent of the group would have to undergo hygiene and food and safety training.
“At that point, that was just one person, but MK’s membership has increased, which means that more people need to be trained, said Khan.
Khan explained that the permit expired January 21, and claims that she emailed MK about renewal in December, and followed up with a second reminder email upon the reopening of school in January.
“There was no progress on the issue because of exams and because it was the beginning of the semester, so it’s understandable, and then they had about two weeks between then and [January] 21 to get a new permit, but that didn’t happen,” she said.
Collective members, however, claim that they never received the first email.
“SSMU says that they sent us an email about it on the 12th of December,” said MK member Alex Briggs. “But we never received that one – we’ve gone through the backlogs and that’s not there. So we found out about it as soon as we got back to school. On that day there was one spot left for the February certification test, but we’re a collective…we had to talk about it, and then that one was gone. And now the next one is in March.”
Representatives from MK also objected to the lack of notice they received about having to close operations.
“The first time that [SSMU] came to the kitchen to notify us was yesterday [January 25],” said Zheng. “There was a lot of miscommunication, but also the logistics of organizing as a collective – getting everybody trained and finding a way to pay for it – would have taken a really long time. So we really needed that two-month buffer, but we just didn’t know in time.”
Khan has said that MK would need to cover any training costs.
In the meantime, the collective is looking for ways to keep operating. One potential solution is to make the Midnight Kitchen a club operating in the same way as the SSMU Mini Courses.
“People will have to sign a waiver and their signature will make them a part of the Midnight Kitchen Club,” Briggs explained. “So that way we won’t be serving food to anyone external, we’ll be making it for ourselves. We’ll need to check on the legality of that, but the Mini Courses don’t have a permit, and they cook food in the kitchen for themselves. If that doesn’t work, our second loophole is that we’re going to try to get everyone involved in some part of the process – cooking  cleaning, setting up, or something.”
However, Khan pointed out that since most of the Midnight Kitchen’s income is from student fees, that may not be an option.
“We don’t give clubs fees – fees are for student services,” she said. “So there is a bit of a logistical problem with that, but…I met with MK twice today, we are going to see what we can to, and I will try my best to get it going as soon as possible.”
Organic Campus, a student service that operates a weekly local organic food stand, was also closed indefinitely on Wednesday. Organic Campus acquired all the necessary certification, with ten per cent of their membership undergoing hygiene and food and safety training, but the paperwork was not processed in time for them to get certified. While they will likely get re-certified before MK, they will also be closed for the foreseeable future.
