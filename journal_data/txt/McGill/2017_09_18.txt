Students given “temporary residence” waiting list 
McGill’s housing system have historically allowed numbers to exceeded the capacity of the residence system. This year, McGill partnered with EVO to meet application demands in time for the school year.
McGill guarantees housing for all first year students aged 22 years and under. The student’s residence is determined by a lottery system, using randomly generated numbers assigned to students who have paid their residence deposit fee. Students who are able to pay the deposit in advance receive a lower number, which increases their chance of being placed in their preferred accommodation. However, despite paying a $1500 deposit, a secure placement in residence is not a guarantee for all first year students.
Every year, around 100 to 200 residence applicants are waitlisted on temporary housing assignments, then are given permanent assignments as residence spaces become available before the school year. This summer, incoming students were given “temporary housing” status until mid-August, which left them less than two weeks to make travel arrangements and move into residence.
This backlog was a result of an administrative system intentionally accepting more residence requests than the available capacity. McGill depends on a certain number of cancellations to be able to meet demands for accommodation, which means that the lottery system accepts residence applications regardless of capacity, expecting many students to ultimately cancel their applications. Until this happens, however, the number of applications exceeds the housing space available in McGill’s residences. While students are guaranteed a place in McGill residence, they do not know where they will be placed.
According to Monique Lauzon, a marketing and nutrition consultant for McGill Housing and Student Services, this kind of delay is a common occurrence.
“Many more students apply for admission to McGill (and request residences) than actually end up attending McGill in the fall,” wrote Lauzon in an email to The Daily. “Once residence rooms are assigned in the lottery, there are always some students assigned a ‘temporary residence’ or who are put on a type of waiting list while we wait for cancellations to come in up until classes start.”
However, it appears that McGill received fewer cancellations this year than in previous years. As a result, students with temporary housing status remained on the waiting list longer than usual.
Phoebe Pannier, a U0 student in the faculty of Arts, shared her experience of getting stuck in bureaucratic limbo.
“Waiting was the worst,” she told The Daily. “It was beyond inconvenient to not have any information about my living situation. I didn’t know for sure what I needed to bring, or if I was going to be living with anyone else.”
Additionally, students who received temporary housing status do not have the option to choose between a single or a double room, and have been calling themselves the “rez-jects,” having been backlogged in the system.
“It was beyond inconvenient to not have any information about my living situation. I didn’t know for sure what I needed to bring, or if I was going to be living with anyone else.”
In response to the housing delays over the summer, McGill partnered with EVO, a privately-owned housing complex run by a joint venture between two equity firms: Campus Crest Communities Inc, and Beaumont Partners SA.
“Under Student Housing and Hospitality Services [students living in EVO] are entitled to the same programming and community services as [the] other residence students,” Lauzon explained. This means that EVO will be part of McGill’s residence programming for the coming school year, with access to floor fellows and representation on Inter-Residence Council.
EVO is currently housing 163 first year students in a dormitory-style housing complex located downtown on Sherbrooke street. EVO is an upscale living space with private bathrooms, an indoor heated pool, a game room, a 24-hour gym, and various other luxury amenities. For an individual student, rent for a double occupancy room at EVO starts at $775 per month, excluding meal costs and other costs of living. McGill students at EVO are paying $1100 per month for the same double room with the mandatory $5475 meal plan.
McGill’s residence fees are notoriously high. According to an article by the Huffington Post, McGill has the most expensive on-campus housing in Canada, at an average of $1,885 in living costs including utilities in 2015, followed by University of Toronto. This is partly due to the mandatory meal plan that must be purchased along with residence accommodation. Many students do not finish the meal plan in their first year, and carry over their credits to the next year.
This has sparked criticism from many students, with advocates of a voluntary meal plan emphasizing the value of responsibility and choice.
“I think I’m saving money by buying my own groceries although sometimes I end up […] buying food on campus,” said Darian McCabe, a first year student at McGill. Juliane Chartrand, also a U0 student, echoed the sentiment.
“I think that at our age, being for the first time alone, […] being responsible for our meals is a hard, but important experience,” she said. “I think that the meal plan is a very bad idea, [since] you pay too much at the end.”
“I think that at our age, being for the first time alone, […] being responsible for our meals is a hard, but important experience, […] I think that the meal plan is a very bad idea, [since] you pay too much at the end.”
When asked about future housing partnerships, Lauzon replied “There are many factors which affect the demand for residence rooms and it can vary from year to year. We may or may not need additional rooms in the future. If we do require rooms and EVO has rooms available, then there is that possibility.”

Organizers strive to move beyond the “McGill bubble”
The McGill office for Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) is hosting their seventh annual Community Engagement Day (CED) next week. Despite its name, CED actually takes place over a number of days, starting on September 25, with most of the events scheduled for September 28. Programming for the CED is comprised of a variety of workshops, talks, and volunteer opportunities intended to facilitate community engagement.
SEDE emphasizes the importance of building relationships with local community groups as a pillar of diversity education. As the largest initiative undertaken by SEDE to encourage community involvement, CED requires support from the administration, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), and a long list of local groups who want to strengthen the relationship between McGill and the wider Montreal community.
Monika Barbe, the CED Program Coordinator, spoke to The Daily about the importance of the event series and what to look forward to in the coming days. Barbe stressed that one of the most valuable things about CED is the opportunity to do hands-on volunteer work.
“[CED] is going to be a chance for people to see the everyday reality of a community organization and the importance of […] the manual work and [to see] that […] change happens there,” said Barbe. “Yes, it’s [CED] very interesting to sit down and reflect and criticize, which I think is super important, but there’s a lot of people working in the community organizations with actual physical jobs […] and interacting directly with the people who benefit from the different organizations, and I think that’s a powerful thing to focus on in terms of social change.”
“There’s a lot of people working in the community organizations with actual physical jobs […] and interacting directly with the people who benefit from the different organizations, and I think that’s a powerful thing to focus on in terms of social change.”
Barbe also described some of the workshops being organized, including the “Equity 101” event hosted by Shanice Yarde, an Equity Educational Advisor at SEDE. According to the CED website, the workshop “is designed to give participants a ‘101’ understanding of equity, and how society is shaped by power and oppression.”
“In a very introductory way [Yarde] is going to present […] the main issues that the office works on, so in that sense I would say that if you’re in any way interested in what SEDE does, that is that workshop is fundamental,” Barbe told The Daily, before finishing with a call for participants from the entre McGill community.
“In a very emphatic way I invite everyone to be part of Community Engagement Day,” she said. “Not only students, because I think with the profile of a student, […] the interest and the initiative to be part of this thing [follows], but also to faculty and staff, because McGill is not only students.”
SEDE has a website listing all the events taking place during CED. People can access the time, location, and description of the events, as well as register for the events they find interesting. The program covers a broad range of topics, from an outdoor movie screening of Demain, a film about the ecological and social challenges posed by climate change, to food distribution for the Welcome Hall Mission food bank. The events are happening all over Montreal and there are still spots available for many of the events.

Guest speakers discuss finances
On September 14, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council convened for its first meeting of the year.
Council heard a detailed presentation from Vadim di Pietro, the Chief Investment Officer of Desautels Capital Management (DCM). According to its website, DCM is “Canada’s first university-owned, student-run registered investment firm.” At Thursday’s council meeting, di Pietro discussed the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP Finance Arisha Khan’s plan to create a Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) fund for the Society, which would be managed by DCM. In essence, the SRI should ensure that a portion of SSMU’s funds is invested in sustainable, ethically-run companies.
“For one, you want to [invest in] things that are consistent with your own moral values,” said di Pietro, “but on top of that, you’re actually trying to have an impact that will […] do good for society, and for the environment.”
In a message to The Daily, Khan explained that she chose DCM to manage the SRI fund because of their student-run status,“SSMU’s accountants do not handle investments (you have to be licensed specifically for that purpose),” she wrote. “Our investment portfolio is managed by Lester Asset Management which is [an external] company. [SSMU has] no choice [but] to go with [an external] company and this way we are supporting student learning in sustainable investing and promoting it heavily at McGill.”
When asked how corporations’ ‘social responsibility’ will be determined, Khan told The Daily that SSMU’s SRI fund will use the index of a company called Sustainalytics, known as a global leader in ESG analysis. ESG refers to “environmental, social, and corporate governance,” a standard of a company’s operations concerning the range of factors that shape the impact of an investment. ESG analysis takes into account ecological sustainability, labour practices, employee diversity, and human rights, among numerous other factors.
“[Sustainalytics is] the leader in ESG analysis but with anything else investors must do their own deeper research,” explained Khan.
So how exactly will the creation of an SRI change SSMU’s investment portfolio? SSMU is constitutionally committed to “demonstrating leadership in matters of human rights, social justice, and environmental protection,” and to “[being] mindful of the direct and indirect effects that Society businesses and organizations have on their social, political, economic, and environmental surroundings.” The SSMU Sustainability Policy requires that the Society “be stewards of students’ money in an ethical manner,” and “prioritize funding to initiatives that will […] lead to considerable social and/or environmental benefit.” Finally, the Climate Change Policy mandates SSMU to “continue to avoid all investments in the fossil fuel industry.”
Despite these provisions, explained Khan, SSMU’s current investments aren’t as ‘socially responsible’ as they could be.
“Right now, we just invest in what is returning well,” Khan told The Daily. “There is no ‘positive screening’ done [to determine] how [we can] not just invest for a return but rather in companies that are doing good things and treating people and the environment right.”
Regarding the specific issue of divestment from fossil fuels, Khan commented that the above policies had not been entirely respected.
“SSMU was not divested fully [from fossil fuels] when I came in [to the position of VP Finance],” wrote Khan. “There is one pipeline company left that I submitted a request to divest from. Some of the other companies [in which SSMU invests] are sort of questionable, but […] you are limited when it comes to the Canadian landscape because most of Canada’s [wealth] is mining-related,” said Khan.
In addition to Di Pietro’s presentation, Council also heard from guest speaker Krista Houser, the administrator of McGill’s Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF). SPF was established in 2009 as a three-year pilot project funded by SSMU, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), and the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS). Houser explained that the SPF, which allocates funding to members of the McGill community interested in starting new sustainability-themed projects, will have to run a referendum campaign this semester to have its non-opt-outable $0.50 student fee renewed. The McGill administration already matches this fee dollar for dollar, and will continue to do so should the fee renewal pass.
Houser also announced the forthcoming creation of a “tiny stream application process,” intended to make it easier for smaller-scale projects to receive assistance from the SPF. This initiative is expected to be operational in the next few weeks.
Following the guest presentations, two motions were debated and approved. The first, a “Motion Regarding the Adoption of the Standing Rules for the 2017-2018 Legislative Council,” consisted of a series of minor modifications to Robert’s Rules of Order intended to streamline this year’s Council meetings. The motion passed after relatively little debate, with only a few minor adjustments to the proposal’s wording.
The second motion on the table, a “Motion​ ​to​ ​Change​ ​the​ ​Status​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Students’​ ​Society​ ​Programming​ ​Network,” aimed to move the aforementioned network (known as SSPN) away from Legislative Council for ethical reasons. According to the motion’s “whereas” clauses, SSPN has historically had looser membership requirements than other committees of Council, while simultaneously providing “many more incentives for its members than other committees.” This, apparently, had been a source of tension between SSMU councillors who were part of SSPN and those who weren’t.
In order to address this problem, the motion proposed changing the three SSPN seats currently reserved for SSMU councillors into more seats for members-at-large. Additionally, it proposed that, while councillors will still be allowed to join SSPN, doing so will “not fulfill their mandate of joining a committee of Legislative Council.”
The second motion also passed with minimal debate.

Beginning on Wednesday, September 6, Hurricane Irma wreaked a path of devastation across the Caribbean. As of Friday evening, the storm’s death toll stood at 84. It may continue to rise in the coming days, as the affected communities continue to assess the scale of the damage.
 For many island nations, the damage caused by the storm has been apocalyptic. In Barbuda, the first island hit by Irma, 90 per cent of buildings were destroyed, and 50 per cent of the population left homeless. The French-administered territory of St Martin was reported to have been 95 per cent destroyed, while more than a million Puerto Ricans were left without power.
One of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic ocean, Irma initially ranked as a category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale, meaning its wind speed was over 252 kilometres per hour. By the time it made landfall in Florida on September 10, Irma had become a category 4 storm, but it did substantial damage to the state nonetheless, destroying one in four homes in the Florida Keys and causing widespread power outages.
The devastation caused by Irma has reawakened controversy over the American Red Cross (ARC) and its handling of donations. Much of this controversy stems from a 2015 report by NPR and ProPublica, which charged the ARC with diverting tens of millions of dollars raised to support vital humanitarian efforts in Haiti. The ARC has denied mishandling relief funds, but has found corruption rumours difficult to shake. As the storm ravaged one Caribbean island after another, many of the region’s inhabitants took to Twitter to beg international observers not to donate to the ARC, and instead to channel much-needed funding to local relief organizations.
Both in the U.S. and across the Caribbean, Irma’s impact heightened already vast disparities between wealthy and impoverished communities. In Florida, where the wealth gap is significantly higher than most other states, Miami Beach millionaires left their securely hurricane-proofed mansions in compliance with a mandatory evacuation order. A few miles away in the primarily Black neighbourhood of Liberty City, many residents rode out the storm with limited supplies and little or no protection for their homes.
On the island of St. Martin, a well-known tax haven, an outcry erupted after multiple reports described evacuation boats prioritizing wealthy, white American tourists over the island’s local population. It was also alleged that Air France initially tripled its ticket prices for flights out of St. Martin and nearby St. Barthélemy, rendering them inaccessible to most locals.
Arriving in the immediate aftermath of hurricanes Harvey and Katia, and followed closely by hurricane Jose, Irma has also sparked much debate over the role played by climate change in these consecutive disasters. The consensus seems to be that while climate change cannot be said to have caused any of these storms, it certainly made their impact deadlier. Notably, rising sea levels exacerbate the storm surges (devastating waves and flooding) caused by hurricanes, and warmer temperatures result in more evaporation, and thus heavier rainfall. Many scientific authorities are predicting that the coming decades will bring hurricanes of Irma’s calibre with increasing frequency.

Brazilian federal prosecutors launched an investigation this week into the reported murders of ten Indigenous people by miners in the country’s remote Javari Valley. The violence first came to light in early August when FUNAI, Brazil’s federal department of Indigenous affairs, received reports that a group of gold prospectors had been overheard bragging about killing the indigenous persons.
These murders come on the heels of massive funding cuts to FUNAI, carried out by Brazil’s conservative Temer administration as part of nation-wide austerity measures. The department saw its budget slashed by nearly 50 per cent earlier this year, forcing FUNAI to shut down many of its regional offices. The Javari Valley, where the reported killings took place, is a vast reserve home to roughly 20 uncontacted Indigenous tribes; due to these recent budget cuts it is patrolled by only ten government officials.
Legislative attacks on FUNAI have made it easier for illegal prospectors to gain access to Brazil’s Indigenous reserves. The men whose boasts of violence sparked the current investigation had been dredging local rivers for gold. Since late August, the federal government has reportedly shut down four other illegal mining operations in the Javari Valley alone.
This forms part of a broader trend that has sparked protests both within Brazil and abroad: Michel Temer’s embattled administration, facing corruption charges and a flagging economy, has made a concerted effort to court powerful mining corporations. To this end, Temer attempted to cancel the protected status of a vast area of the Amazon rainforest to the north of the country in late August, only to be temporarily blocked by a federal judge. The region, home to several vulnerable Indigenous communities, is thought to contain valuable deposits of gold, nickel, and iron ore.
International observers have decried the lack of protections for Brazil’s substantial Indigenous population, particularly in the wake of this year’s cuts. Earlier this June, a United Nations press release stated that “the rights of Indigenous peoples and environmental rights are under attack in Brazil,” noting that over the past 15 years, no other country has seen more deadly attacks on land defenders, many of whom are Indigenous.
