Montreal’s Haitian community reacts to the earthquake
For the past week, Montreal’s 140,000-strong Haitian community has been mourning, and attempting to cope with new realities after last week’s devastating earthquake struck close to the centre of Haiti’s capital and largest city, Port-au-Prince.
The earthquake, which measured at 7.0 on the Richter scale, is thought to have killed as many as 200,000 people. Here in Montreal’s Haitian expatriate community, one of the largest in the world, community organizations have been reassessing the new and changing needs of their community, both here in Montreal and back home in Haiti. As increasingly disturbing reports come out of the Caribbean state, community leaders have reacted with grief, and in some cases, anger at the Canadian government’s response to the crisis.
Marjorie Villefranche, who has been director of St. Michel’s Maison d’Haïti since 1985, attempted to articulate the initial reaction of her community. “The first night, everyone was ‘freeze,’ because we didn’t want to believe it. And right now, I think we’re in a sadness phase,” she said in French. “Because we realize what’s happened, we see pictures, lots of pictures. And now it’s a deep sadness…and lots of worry.”
Immigration Canada has committed to “expediting” immigration requests from Haiti, but has declined to specify exactly what this will mean for those seeking refuge in Canada. According to a Monday press release from the Ministry of Immigration and Citizenship, applicants will have to prove that they are “significantly and adversely affected by the situation [in Haiti].”
Villefranche criticized Immigration Canada for not going far enough in their actions. “The government hasn’t relaxed the rules. It has simply said that it’s going to accelerate the process,” she said. “They’re still asking for papers, DNA tests. In a country where people don’t have any address anymore, any papers anymore, where the only people who could [officially] recognize [these] things, the judges, are dead, what do you want them to do?”
Villefranche added that many of the necessary tests and identifications could be performed in Canada, where the necessary technologies and bureaucratic infrastructure are available.
Yves Engler, author of Canada in Haiti: Waging War on the Poor Majority and an organizer with the Canada Haiti Action Network, is another activist who has criticized Conservative immigration minister Jason Kenney’s response to the refugee crisis. According to Engler, politics, rather than humanitarian concerns, are driving the government’s reaction.
“The Conservatives have an anti-immigrant base,” said Engler. “From their political standpoint, it’s a tricky situation, because their base is anti-immigrant, yet there is this horrendous human tragedy and any sort of humanely functioning government would…open the door more generally to Haitian immigrants.”
Merlaine Chrispin Brutus, director general of Entraide Bénévole Kouzin Kouzin’, an organization focused on children’s integration, illustrated the importance of the family unit that was threatened by last week’s earthquake. “No one asked the government to open the border for all Haitian refugees. That’s not what we want. People need to understand that. We ask for the reunification of families,” she said in French.
Brutus noted that the earthquake could have a profound impact on the fabric of the Haitian expatriate society. “It’s practically the loss of everything we had that was proof of our [material] culture…and so it tears out your heart to see your country completely devastated,” she said.
The City of Montreal has been quick in responding to the needs of Haitians both in the city and in Haiti. A mission of 34 police officers, doctors, nurses, and community representatives departed from Montreal early Wednesday morning – an operation that was scaled down from 100 personnel following a request from Foreign Affairs.
The borough of St. Michel is taking steps to open a call centre in an effort to better direct calls from concerned family members inquiring about services and information. The borough of Montreal-North has opened a multi-service aid centre to help its 11,000 residents of Haitian origin. “We’ve actually got the support of the City; they’re there with us,” said Villefranche.
Josette Jean-Pierre Rousseau, of the Point de ralliement des femmes d’origine haïtienne, an organization that provides resources to women of Haitian origin in Montreal, articulated the importance of women in Haitian society, and her hopes for a continuance of the presence of women’s groups there.
 “We call [women] the poto-miton [pillar] of the country…from the perspective of the family, the economy, education. Often it’s women that are there at the base of the economy…so I don’t think that this is going to change anything,” Rousseau explained.
Rousseau also pointed to the difficulties faced by those structurally disadvantaged populations still on the ground in Haiti and women’s efforts to help them. “These people there, they can all see, they all have two feet, they have their legs, their arms, but the disabled and the blind? This is a country with 85,000 blind people because of water problems, air problems, pollution, and asbestos…. Often you’ll find a bunch of women getting together to bring [them] some help,” she said.
A conference about the reconstruction in Haiti is set to convene on January 25 in Montreal and will be attended by U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Haitian prime minister Jean-Max Bellerive, and French foreign affairs minister Bernard Kouchner.
Engler hoped that the conference would provide real change for Haiti, but remained skeptical of the aims of the leaders. “The hope is that they eliminate all of Haiti’s debt, that every bit of money that is put forward is in grants, not loans; that they prioritize building Haitian governmental and institutional capacity, not what some Canadian NGO wants. The hope is that they don’t use this as a disaster-capitalist move. But we’re definitely fearful that that’s what they’re trying to do,” said Engler, citing concerns about privatization of Haiti’s five remaining state-owned companies. “I would love to believe that the politics of Ottawa and Washington would change overnight, but [they won’t] unless we build something that forces it out.”
Community leaders remain hopeful that Haiti will be rebuilt in a way that will allow the country to retain its autonomy, and expressed gratitude toward the community responses in Montreal and Quebec at large.
“We are grateful to Quebec society and to Canadian society in general for the way these people have reacted to our people’s trouble – everyone. There’s not one Haitian who wouldn’t be thankful for this reaction, affectionate even,” said Brutus.
Rousseau also expressed deep appreciation, saying, “Thank you to the Canadian community, to the Quebec community, to the Montreal community, because we are feeling a powerlessness that keeps us from sleeping.”

Council members weigh in on the defederation question
Debate continues within McGill’s Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) on the question of leaving the national student federation that has represented it for 17 years.
The Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) is the largest student lobby group in Canada. It is meant to be an effective advocacy group for student interests nationwide, while its parallel organization, CFS-Services, provides many student unions with health plans and student handbooks.
CFS has also been charged by its detractors with a lack of transparency, antidemocratic internal proceedings, and the use of legal threats to intimidate its critics. For many of these reasons, PGSS filed a petition to defederate from CFS in late October. CFS national treasurer Dave Molenhuis, who was recently elected 2010-2011 national chairperson, says he has received the petition. PGSS is still waiting for the organization to reply to their request and set a date for a referendum.
What is at stake in defederation?
CFS received $68,000 in membership dues from McGill University graduate students and post-doctorates in 2009.
Its supporters stress that the federation allows the Canadian student movement to present a united front in lobbying government. “If we were not united under one federation, we would lose unity in articulating our vision for postsecondary education,” said  Molenhuis. “If we aren’t working together, I can guarantee you we will be defeated.  We will be carved up, we will be divided, and we will fall.”
PGSS executives, along with undergraduate and graduate student leaders at Concordia, have publicly expressed frustration with what they see as CFS’s lack of transparency and increasingly undemocratic operations, as well as the amount of money spent on legal action against critics of CFS.
According to budgetary documents, the CFS spent $246,646.29 on legal costs in 2008-2009, and between  $83,285.70 and $368,657.64 each year over the last decade.
Documents compiled primarily by students at Simon Fraser Univesity and posted on studentunion.ca suggest significant federation involvement in litigation and legal threats against student unions as recently as 2006 and 2008.
Molenhuis denied that the majority of CFS’s legal fees are incurred in suits against students, and told The Daily they can be attributed to producing things like legal language  on student ID cards.
Separate from the petition to move members of the PGSS to a defederation referendum, six student unions put together a package of motions to reform the CFS through official channels at the organization’s annual general meeting (AGM) in late November.
PGSS president Daniel Simeone called the reform package “the first draft for what could be a truly effective organization.”
Many of the motions put forward in the package concerned the ability of student unions to leave the federation, as well as to increase transparency with reforms such as putting minutes and financial records online.
The majority of the package’s reforms presented at the AGM were not passed.
“There was this systematic blockage of the motions that had been put forward by Quebec,” said PGSS VP External Ladan Mahabadi.  “Instead of focusing on the reforms and discussing the motions based on their merits, they were brought down because they were coming from Quebec and PGSS.”
Molenhuis said that the PGSS was not singled out at the AGM and maintained in an interview with The Daily that the outcome was the result of standard democratic procedure.  “It’s the delegates who are deciding what amendments to make and how to vote on each of the motions,” Molenhuis said.
A timeline on the PGSS External Affairs Committee web site’s federal representation page documents times when significant concerns with CFS have been raised, dating back to the late nineties.
More difficult to leave
A reform  passed at the AGM, known as Motion 6, doubled the number of student votes required on a petition to leave CFS.
Simeone criticized the reform as compromising the primary right guaranteed to individual student members of CFS: the ability to start a petition to defederate.
Simeone and Mahabadi expressed concerns that CFS bylaws were violated by this reform.  CFS bylaws require a two-thirds majority of all voting members present to pass reform to the constitution.  Mahabadi stated that during the AGM vote, of 68 present voting members, 44 voted for the reform, 19 against, and 5 abstained – which she thought fell short of the 46 votes required for a 2/3 majority.
Molenhuis added that he has not received any communication or further questions on process and bylaws from members of the PGSS.  “They can certainly communicate those concerns to the national executive, but that hasn’t happened at this time,” he said.
Molenhuis said that the reform will not retroactively affect the 13 schools who have already filed petitions to leave  CFS.
Mahabadi said she expected the reform to have lasting implications.  “Regardless of what happens to the PGSS, [this change] is not going to go away…. Even if it doesn’t apply retroactively it’s very problematic; it contradicts their own bylaws.”
Recent developments in council and the referendum committee
Eric Pollanen, PGSS VP Finance for the past two years, was recommended to chair CFS referendum committee with nearly unanimous approval at Council on Tuesday night.
History representative James Wallace was among three members who opposed Pollanen’s recommendation on the grounds that the role he played in drafting the reform package would not allow him to be impartial.  “I don’t believe the wording of the reform package was presented in the spirit of reform. I believe it was presented in very negative language as an ultimatum,” Wallace said.
“I am against it considering the extremely progressive policies that CFS promotes,” Wallace added.  “To place someone who I strongly believe has a conflict of interest in this issue and is against CFS National in a position where they are adjudicating the referendum question is abominable…. The good work that the CFS is doing needs to be made known to graduate students here before they make up their minds in a referendum.”
PGSS Council member and former VP External Adrian Kaats, who is also a board member of CFS-Quebec, voiced concern that the council members defending CFS were being swayed by personal affiliations rather than trends supported by documentation. “They’re a very small number of people who are getting information from their friends who are employees of the CFS and who are not doing due diligence. These councillors are not looking at the abundance of information about the Canadian Federation of Students and its very serious problems with transparency, democracy, and accountability”
Members of CFS National Executive have been invited to attend the next PGSS Council meeting in February, along with CFS-Quebec staff.

Lawyers claim international film tour violates confidentiality agreements
The Link Concordia (CUP) – Concordia-based film collective Cinema Politica received a threatening letter on January 11 from the lawyers for Coca-Cola, stating that the network’s planned film tour for documentary The Coca-Cola Case violates a confidentiality agreement.
The film follows two American lawyers and union leaders as they attempt to bring a case against the soda pop giant for its alleged complicity in the murders of union leaders at bottling plants in Columbia.
 Cinema Politica founder Ezra Winton said the letter claimed the film was “defamatory” and included details of private negotiations between the company and the subjects of the documentary.
Cinema Politica, in cooperation with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), plans to screen The Coca-Cola Case at Cinema Politica locals. It stopped at Concordia on January 18 and its tour will include screenings in over 20 cities across the country and abroad.
“[Coca-Cola] knew about the film from the early days and I’m sure followed its progression. They probably thought that it would play at some film festivals then go away,” Winton told The Link after the letter was received on January 11.
“Now I think that [they’re contacting us because] it’s not just going away – that in fact it’s having a resurgence through our network,” he said.
Filmmakers Carmen Garcia and Germán Gutiérrez have said that Coca-Cola and the film’s subjects had already settled prior claims of a breach of confidentiality.
The corporation now requires information about where and when the documentary was filmed, but could not force the filmmakers to cut footage.
Coca-Cola never contacted Garcia or Gutiérrez directly, choosing instead to level its criticism at the subjects of the documentary and Cinema Politica.
“The idea that you can take legal recourse against an exhibitor is pretty unheard of,” said Winton. “The film is already in the can. It’s already out in public with thousands of copies circulating. It’s with a national public production house. So [when their lawyer sent us that letter] it’s kind of just them going after the little guy because we’re grassroots.”
Winton said he felt Coca-Cola was concerned about the Cinema Politica screenings because they will mostly take place on university campuses, in full view of the youth and students who are the company’s target market. Coca-Cola routinely seeks – and gets – exclusivity contracts with universities and other institutions.
Students at schools including the University of Guelph have held successful campaigns to ban Coke from campuses, citing the company’s record of human rights abuses. Most recently, a Norwegian student association shut out Coke products from all universities and colleges across Norway.
Cinema Politica plans to go ahead with its Coca-Cola Case tour regardless.
“If the NFB or the filmmakers asked us to stop screening it we would. But lawyers that represent Coca-Cola that simply don’t agree with some of the representations in the film – with what the characters in the film say, not the filmmakers [themselves] – it’s as if they’re saying Coca-Cola is beyond any kind of criticism in a documentary film,” explained Winton. “Now they’re sending us this letter, which to me means we’re doing something right.”
The lawyer who sent Winton the letter, Faith Gay of Quinn Emanuel Trial Lawyers in New York City, did not return The Link’s phone calls.
