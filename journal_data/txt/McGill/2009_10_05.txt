Tuition skyrockets amidst state’s financial turmoil
September 24, the first day of classes at most California universities, was marked by a state-wide walkout. Tens of thousands of students protested a 32 per cent fee increase announced in July for the 2009-2010 academic year in the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) systems.
Olgalia Ramirez, Director of Government Relations for the California State Student Association, explained that rising tuition fees are largely a reaction to the recent funding cuts to the state’s public university systems.
“Little or no notice was given to the students,” Ramirez said. “The decision was made in the summer, after [the students] had left school in the spring paying the usual fees.”
Victor Sanchez, president of the University of California Student Association, said that students there have faced a 100 per cent tuition increase since 2003.
“The problem goes a lot deeper; there has been an $800-million reduction to the UC budget since 2008.”
Students in the UC and CSU systems, the latter of which accommodates a larger student population, had been warned of a 10 per cent fee increase in May, but an additional increase of 22 per cent was announced in July.
Students in groups like UC Berkeley’s Solidarity Alliance began mobilizing prior to the announcement, as the pressures facing the UC system became increasingly evident when the state’s public finances began to fall into disarray last spring.
Ricardo Gomez, a third-year UC Berkeley student and member of the Solidarity Alliance, began a web site called berkeleycuts.org, and a Facebook group, in order to bring attention to the issue and appeal to different student associations for action.
Gomez’s efforts, in conjunction with those of other student activists, resulted in the Senate of the Associated Students of University of California unanimously passing a bill in support of the walkout.
“There’s been a snowball effect among teachers, students, and union members, culminating in a walkout that was 5,000-strong [on the Berkeley campus],” said Gomez.
Sahcnez explained that the state’s mid-September announcement that faculty members would be forced to take unpaid furlough days galvanized student protests across the state.
“The student action actually began with the plan to implement furloughs, so the idea really started with faculty and university unions.  By the time [students] realized there were plans to increase our student fees by 32 per cent, we thought this was our opportunity to take action and engage with the public,” Sanchez said.
Sanchez also referenced the workforce shortage that is slated to hit California around 2025.
“It’s not only higher education that’s at stake, it’s the future of California.”
Ramirez said that the university system is not producing enough graduating students to keep up with the demands of the workforce – a situation that will only be exacerbated by the funding cuts as increasing numbers of students are unable to afford post-secondary education.
This fee increase can be traced back to the $26.3-billion deficit facing the state of California in the 2009-2010 year, which resulted in a deficit within the state-held general fund from which money is directed to both the UC and the CSU systems.
Due to this funding deficit, the CSU Board of Trustees and the UC Board of Regents decided to implement the fee hikes to compensate for the lack of funds.
“We have limited discretionary funds from the State.  That’s the pot we draw our funds from,” said Ramirez.
A decade ago, the state provided about $600 million more to the UC and CSU systems than it provides today, even though the CSU alone has taken on 100,000 more students within that time period.
The recently implemented furloughs will save the CSU system an estimated $275 million annually.  But that also means students will get less time with their professors.
“I’ve already faced a whole bunch of cuts to class offerings.  About 10 to 20 per cent of the classes have been cut,” said Gomez.
Many staff members have also been laid off. Gomez said that campus cleanliness is beginning to deteriorate due to the limited number of employees.
Sanchez echoed Gomez’s concern saying, “Most students would say we’re paying more for less.”
This lack of state funding in education is more of a hot-button issue in California than in most other states.  In the sixties, the California legislature adopted the Master Plan for Higher Education that articulated the state’s commitment to its higher education system. It has gone through multiple revisions since its original drafting, and was most recently reviewed in 2002.
“The Master Plan for Higher Education promised to make California education affordable, accessible, and of quality.  We see California turning their backs on that promise,” said Ramirez.
Though faced with many challenges accompanying this year’s fee increase, students across the state are beginning to see the benefits of student activism.  Prior to the 32 per cent fee hike announcement, students in the CSU system had successfully lobbied for student aid to remain intact amidst the deficit budget.  As a result, the CSU will reserve one-third of the revenue from fee increases for financial aid.
“Students need to organize,” said Gomez. “There are more students than there are faculty members, more students than there are administrators. It just takes commitment, effort, and energy.”
Though no further fee hikes are likely to be announced this year, Ramirez spoke of the possibility of students’ associations from all three levels of the university system – the University of California, California State University, and the community colleges – coming together in collective action this spring.

Chinese immigrant workers awarded $164,000 in damages
The Quebec Human Rights Commission ruled this September that 15 Chinese workers should receive $164,000 in damages from their employer, Calego International, for racial discrimination in the workplace. It is the heaviest fine to be levied by the Commission in a human rights case to date.
The Commission asked that $10,000 be paid in moral and punitive damages to each worker and $5,000 paid to two workers who were forcibly thrown off the company’s premises in plain view of co-workers.
The incident took place in July 2006, when a group of 40 employees were called into a meeting with Calego International’s president, Stephen Rapps. The workers testified to the Commission that Rapps yelled at them, saying, “You Chinese eat like pigs!”
He Yong Han, a former employee and Chinese immigrant now residing in Montreal, reported to The Daily that Rapps told the workers to wash themselves daily, and that they were no longer in China.
He said that Rapps chastised the workers for unsanitary work conditions, warning them not to get urine on the floor when using the toilet.
Of all the employees at Calego International, the Chinese workers were the only ones who were called to the meeting.
He reported further that workers walked out immediately after, returning the next day to demand a written apology from Rapps, a cleaner work environment (workers say that at the time, there were no janitorial staff working), and compensation for what they saw as discriminatory actions. The demands were turned down, leading many of the workers to quit their jobs.
The workers then filed a complaint through the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR).
Calego International is a Montreal-based children’s backpack and accessories manufacturer. Rapps, a supervisor, and Agence Vincent, the placement agency through which the Chinese workers were hired, will share the payment of damages.
Julius Grey, the lawyer who represents Calego International, has denied that the incident took place.
Despite the fact that the fine is the largest sum that the Quebec Human Rights Commission has recommended in a racism case, Fo Niemi of CRARR, who helped these workers file their complaint, stated that the amount is less significant when the amount of damages awarded to each individual worker is considered.
“This may be why discrimination still goes on, because if we had the kind of damages awarded as in the United States, where we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, many people would think twice before committing racial discrimination,” Niemi said.
The former Calego employees have received support from the Montreal Chinese community, in the form of encouragement, assistance, and monetary aid. The Montreal Chinese Cultural Centre helped the workers find lawyers and gather information for their case.
Niemi notes that very few complaints are filed from people of Asian backgrounds, although Asian workers are a large number of the immigrant workers who are often forced to work in substandard conditions.

Locals accuse GSI of neglect and mismanagement of landfills
GSI Environment, a company specializing in organic waste management, is facing charges for a number of violations of the Environment Quality Act. The Quebec Ministry of Environment has decided to sue the company for the contamination of GSI’s waste treatment sites, as well as in response to civilian complaints about the stench emanating from their landfills.
L’Ange-Gardien, an Outaouais municipality, is only one of the communities affected by GSI’s apparent neglect of the composting sites. The municipality has requested an injunction from the Quebec Superior Court to either force the company to abide by environmental regulations or to discontinue their operations.
Alain Descarreaux, the General Manager of the municipality, said that the company has not been active at the location for over a year.
“What pushed us to take legal action was the smell. We received a number of complaints from residents located near the site,” explained Descarreaux.
The treatment site has fallen into disrepair since GSI abandoned it – a problem linked to the presence of non-compostable materials such as septic waste, plastic bags, and “garbage juice.”
“They’ve stopped using the factory and receiving waste products,” said Descarreaux. “I think the principal issue was that the company received larger quantities [of waste] than what it was able to manage on site. With so much accumulating, there was no way all materials could be treated inside the plant.”
Steve McLeod, founder of Compost Montreal, an independent composting service, is concerned that corporate endeavours in waste management do not prioritize sustainability.
“If the motivation is economic or political, then the results are not going to be as ecologically friendly as they could be. We’re trying to increase the amount of [waste] treatment infrastructure and instead we’re facing massive reductions [in the quality of waste treatment] because of contamination issues.”
GSI also faces charges of environmental infractions stemming from complaints of mismanagement of its landfills in the communities of Lachute and Saint-Basile.
McLeod mentioned that systemic neglect and improper aeration is a likely cause for the smells associated with composting. “It’s a risk we’re all running if we’re not paying attention to how we’re doing things,” he added.
McLeod also commented on L’Ange-Gardien’s initiative to have the site closed.
“I would rather not see the city’s passive involvement. We should be paying attention to the quality of what comes out [of the site] to create demand for the compost. At the end of the day, we’re still a capitalist society. We need to find a balance between the economic and the ecological.”
The company officially remains in operation, and is expected to resume management of its sites.GSI, a subdivision of EnGlobe Corporations, was unavailable for comment.

Decision follows SSMU Council censure of the club’s proposed pro-life event
SSMU Council voted  15 for and two against with two abstentions this Thursday  to censure a Choose Life event, “Echoes of the Holocaust.”  The club had invited Jose Ruba from the Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform to give the talk, that many believe would  violate SSMU’s Constitution and Equity Policy. It was argued that the talk would slander women who had decided to have abortions, and belittle atrocities committed by the Nazis.
 The motion included a clause that would render the club ineligble for SSMU funding if they followed through with the event.
During the debate, VP Clubs and Services Sarah Olle, who co-authered the motion  with Arts Senator Sarah Woolf argued that likening the Holocaust to abortion – and comparing post-abortive women to Nazis – violated human dignity, and that the comparison was disrespectful to Jews and other communities.
“Respecting human life also means respecting the dead,” Olle said, later adding, “This event seeks to use the millions of dead in the Holocaust to manipulate emotions.”
Clubs and Services Representative Corey Omer also took issue with the premise of the event, suggesting that Ruba’s reference to the Holocaust would not be academic but rather aimed to shock and appeal to emotion. Omer noted that  other SSMU clubs, including Hillel McGill, had petitioned against the event.
Choose Life President Natalie Fohl, however, argued that the event would not seek to compare the Holocaust with abortion, as they are two events which “cannot be quantified or compared in any way.” Instead, Fohl said that the talk would confront the question of whether unborn children are dehumanized by the medical profession in a similar way to that in which the Nazi regime dehumanized Jews. Fohl added that the prohibition of this event would be an abuse of SSMU’s power.
VP External Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan took issue with the graphic images of fetuses that would be used by Ruba during his presentation. Ronderos-Morgan felt Choose Life had broken a verbal commitment made last autumn to not use disturbing visuals.
“[It is a] shame they have misled Council,” Ronderos-Morgan said. “I would speak in favour of this motion.”
However, Law Rep Joël Lightbound and Residences Rep Mark Bay expressed concern that a censure would limit the opportunity for discussion on campus. Olle also explained that because the event was scheduled outside Shatner and was not sponsored using SSMU funds, the Society could not directly censure the event. Following Council, Olle explained  that she helped to put forward the resolution to show SSMU’s stance against the event.
On Friday, Fohl confirmed  that the talk was cancelled, but  emphasized that the decision to cancel was not a direct response to SSMU’s decision, which the club opposed as a restriction of the right to freedom of expression. She said the  decision had been made voluntarily given that the majority of her club’s membership felt it was not the right time to hold the presentation. Though Fohl indicated the threat to the club’s funding was considered in their decision, she said the club has never received funding from SSMU.

Students, profs take to the street to protest Bills 38 and 44
Five hundred demonstrators took to the streets last Thursday to protest Provincial Bills 38 and 44 – legislation that will change how Quebec’s universities and CEGEPs are governed. The demonstration is the largest to date on the issue, uniting multiple college and university associations that represent over 130,000 individuals.
The demonstration was organized by the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), with official participation from the Fédération québécoise des professeures et professeurs d’université, Fédération nationale des enseignantes et des enseignants du Québec (FNEEQ), the Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, and the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TACEQ) – of which SSMU is a founding member.
Students, professors, and staff from across the province were in attendance. Buses brought students from Outaouais, Sherbrooke, and Quebec City, while students at CEGEP Marie-Victorin in northeast Montreal missed classes and went on strike for the day to protest the proposed legislation.
McGill students were also present, though VP External Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan noted that SSMU did not organize a specific meeting place for students.
“We didn’t organize a place for all of us to come as one group, but I definitely had a pretty successful postering campaign, so the message is definitely out there…through Facebook, the [SSMU] web site, and the [SSMU] list serv, and so students were aware of it,” he said, adding, “I think that ultimately [this] affects McGill and that we should act in solidarity with our counterparts in other universities, with the unions that work in our schools, and universities.”
If passed, Bills 38 and 44 will change the composition of Quebec university and CEGEP boards of governors. Bill 38 requires that independent members compose 60 per cent of universities’ boards, in addition to an appointed government representative, while Bill 44 adopts a 65 per cent independent quota for CEGEPs. Both types of institutions would also have to adopt strict rules on the disclosure of public information.
While the Ministry of Education believes that the changes will improve governance and transparency, others see the legislation as a sign of further private and commercial control of the province’s educational institutions.
Demonstrators chanted, “Le savoir n’est pas marchandise; l’école n’est pas une entreprise,” as they marched along Ste. Catherine through downtown Montreal. Some students dressed in suits, ties, and white masks marked with dollar signs. Others handed out newsletters informing bystanders of the reasons for the demonstration.
Mathieu Melamcon, a graduate of Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) and vocal demonstrator, commented, “We thought that this was completely illegitimate to put private institutions at the head of our universities because those people have no idea how to run our colleges. We prefer to have public institutions that are ruled by public servants because those people have the…[incentives] to search for our best interests, and not the [profitability] of our institutions – which is not in our opinion a business.”
Jean Trudelle of FNEEQ, a union of CEGEP teachers, part-time university teachers, and graduate students employed at McGill, also joined the demonstration. He commented that the changes would drastically alter how CEGEPs and universities are governed.
 “The institutions are governed based on group participation of teachers, support staff, and professors, and also students.  All those groups have in a way or another, access to the way things are run…. [The Ministry of Education] want to restrain the participation of people from the inside, to the profit of people from the outside…and we all think that [institutions] should be governed the other way around,” Trudelle said.
Vaughan Dowie, Executive Head of Public Affairs at McGill, commented that while McGill already has more than 60 per cent independent representation on its board of governors, Bill 38 could have serious implications for student representation. The bill also legislates how long each member is required to serve: three years for members, and two years for students.
“The McGill tradition has been that the presidents of SSMU and the McGill Post-Graduate Students’ Society have seats for one year – and if it’s two years, that might mean that the current president of the society would not be able to sit on the board,” said Dowie.
Minister of Education Michelle Courchesne introduced the bills in an effort to bring sound governance to all public institutions. The legislation is viewed by many as a response to the mismanagement of real estate by UQAM’s board of governors, which resulted in $400-million bailout by the provincial government.
Jonathan Rioux, External Affairs coordinator for the Association étudiante du Secteur des sciences de l’UQAM argued, however, that the legislation is not an appropriate response to the UQAM debacle.
“It is very ironic. I know they say that it is a reaction to UQAM being $400 million in debt, but as you can see, in most of the news, the people who voted for the acquisition were the external members. The internal members, students and teachers, voted against,” Rioux said, adding “Unlike companies, universities are made to create knowledge, and act toward tomorrow’s society, so it is very important that the people who take action are directly connected to the reality of the university. You cannot ask people who work nine to five to make decisions that won’t be influenced by [their] positions.”
The Ministry of Education held a consultation on the bills this month. Kim Ledoux, spokesperson for the Ministry, said in an interview after the protest that Courchesne took opposition into account.
“She listened carefully to all the groups, she is open to some modifications and changes, and she indicated this many times, when the consultations were happening. The majority of the groups are agreed with the principles of the bills,” said Ledoux.
Demonstration organizers Christian Pépin and Étienne Guérette for ASSÉ said, however, that they were unsatisfied with the consultations and that there was too much opposition for the bills to go forward.
“I think if we don’t get the Minister’s attention now, that that will demonstrate that she is not listening to people who are doing the CEGEP and university, and that will show her arrogance toward the union movement and student association movement,” Guérette said.
Guérette also speculated that given the Liberal majority in the National Assembly, many expect that the bills will pass. In that case, Guérette promised a larger mobilization, and that student unions will continue to challenge the legislation at their respective councils.
