Correction appended
Until recently, McGill  had one of the strictest student residence alcohol policies in Canada, but only loosely enforced the guidelines. Now, the new Executive Director of Residences, Michael Porritt, is determined to close the gap between policy and practice – just one example of a changing philosophy that’s hitting McGill Residences.
Hired in November 2008, Porritt – a seasoned administrator with over ten years of experience at Trent and Winona State University – has been accused by several of his staff of bringing sweeping changes to the culture of residences, failing to communicate effectively, and trying to fix a system that some McGill floor fellows claim isn’t broken.
 “We’re open to changes that we feel will improve the community for our first-year students, but we also hold core values – like respect – that are non-negotiable,” said Graham Smith, a MORE House floor-fellow, explaining that residence life has followed a harm reduction strategy and established close-knit communities of trust. “That is what McGill Residences are based on, and that’s why we’re so concerned about what might change.”
 In his capacity as Director, Porritt oversees a $27-million budget, with 2,600 students housed in 30 buildings, served by over 215 employees -– including 70 floor fellows.
“Right now, a lot of the house rules are kind of ambiguous and vague,” he said, explaining that students needed a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities. “You can’t have gaps between policies and procedures.”
According to Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) – to whom Porritt reports directly – the administration wants to see a more consistent application of respect and responsibility.
“We have found that the understanding of how respect translates into action varies considerably across Residences,” Mendelson wrote in an email to The Daily. “Through wide consultation, which has already begun, Mike Porritt expects to strengthen the understanding of respect and its links to action.”
One outgoing floor fellow, who expected to get fired if his name was used on record, charged that hiring Porritt was an extension of McGill’s fears of liability.
“Mendelson is trying to direct what should happen through Porritt and through Porritt’s experiences, but unfortunately it’s different from the way we work here,” he said. “Porritt wants us to take on a more disciplinarian role [which will] hurt the ability for students to come to us and relate to us.”
He explained that the harm reduction strategy that encourages open dialogue and safe space also reduces McGill’s liability, and that Quebec liability law has covered grey issues in the past.
“We’re covered by liability laws because they are vague and work for us. He seems to be stringent on the need for [more specific] rules, which unfortunately will result in more qualms down the road,” he said. “As stuff is driven underground, it will become more of a problem.”
When he came on the job, Porritt introduced a Residence Life Advisory Group (RLAG), which he says, along with University Residence council, will keep the Residence administration from making decisions in a vacuum.
But one returning floor fellow, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of losing their job, explained that sitting on RLAG was frustrating because one third of the floor fellow’s efforts are spent fighting Porritt’s policies, taking away from valuable time with students.
“Being on that committee is 100 per cent defensive; it’s always an issue of doing damage control to what he’s bringing in” the floor fellow said. “There’s a lot of us taking our own minutes so we can say ‘no you didn’t say that,’ and ‘no, we didn’t say that.’”
Porritt has maintained that he has followed an open listening policy from the beginning.
“If I made a bunch of changes on the rez life side in the middle of my first year without doing a lot of listening, I would have been run out of here and I would have deserved it,” he said.
But the revised alcohol policy he proposed for residences – which tightens rules on serving, parties, and areas where students can drink, like certain common areas and building stairwells – was heavily criticized and amended by committee members before clearing RLAG.
“We have been able to fight back on policies, but on a larger level, we can’t fight back [against] everything he says all the time,” the floor fellow said.
“His inability to communicate with his staff and respect that we have opinions outside of RLAG is really troubling,” the floor fellow added, echoing statements made by other floor fellows.
Kate Wardell, a floor fellow from Gardner Hall, a residence above Pins, emphasized the unprofessional work environment she found herself in this year.
“He’s treated us like a group of kindergartners – he does that with the [residence] directors, too,” she said, adding that their positions carried large amounts of responsibility.
“I think he doesn’t understand what we do,” Wardell continued. “He thinks we have a part-time job, [but] we’re constantly on call and I don’t think he understands that.”
Another floor fellow explained that Porritt had suggested charging floor fellows rent for their rooms in residence – where they currently live for free. He proposed their rent be discounted in relation to first-years’, or that they pay rent and receive a small stipend. Floor fellows stressed, however, that their concerns weren’t driven by money worries.
Porritt acknowledged that he faced challenges this year, but maintained that many of the residence staff were still respectful of his leadership.
“There are lots of people who are very wary of ‘the new guy,’” said Porritt in an earlier email to The Daily. “The vast majority [of staff] have been very supportive and even excited to talk about how we can put their ideas into action.”
With a genuine concern for the future of residence culture at McGill, Smith stressed that their tenuous work relationships weren’t the driving reason for their concern.
“This is not a personal vendetta. It’s about a community that we value and cherish so much, and that thousands of people have valued as a really formative year.”
In the original version of this article, the by-line read “Proposed changes to alcohol policy will limit drinking in common areas” – which is a mistatment. While this was policy proposal was in an earlier draft, it has since been removed from the RLAG document.

Speakers recall a protest for change in participation of francophones at McGill
Saturday marked the 40th anniversary of the McGill français movement – a march 5,000 strong along Sherbrooke that demanded the University community become more inclusive of francophone students.
This march was commemorated last Wednesday evening at Thomson House, with three speakers who described their experiences in a movement that changed McGill, a still-majority anglophone university.
 “I’ve never been part of a demonstration so large, so electric,” said Mark Wilson, who held the position of editor-in-chief of The Daily for three days in 1969 before being fired by the Students’ Council, the precursor of SSMU Council. At the time, The Daily was not yet independent.
Wilson said that the purpose of the movement at the time was much more radical than allowing students to submit their work in French, now McGill policy.
 “The goal was not to make McGill more bilingual,” said Wilson. “It was to expropriate it.”
The gathering, organized by the Commission on Francophone Affairs (CAF) and attended by about 30 people, also included Daniel-Pierre Vézina, who recalled marching in front of the University during his studies.
“A lot of politicians didn’t think it was serious,” said Vézina, but “the protestors really believed what they wanted.
“It was very coherent,” he added, referring to the demonstrators’ remarkable organization. “It’s not the case anymore [with protests these days].”
McGill français, then Opération McGill, currently represents about 18 per cent of students – just under 6,000 – who declare their mother tongue as French. According to McGill enrolment services, 52 per cent of McGill students list English and 30 per cent list another language.
CAF, the current driving force behind McGill français, is less idealistic and more practical in its goals compared to its past incarnation, and has focused this year on increasing bilingualism in student associations. This year, they successfully lobbied  for all course syllabi to state that students have the right to submit all assignments in French. CAF also organizes the popular Francofête.
“Now [being at McGill] is easy for francophones,” said Vézina.
But Lucien Lapierre, a former Canadian Senator and host of the influential but short-lived sixties public affairs program This Hour Has Seven Days, said that the movement needs to focus on the University’s place in the province.
“I didn’t want McGill français,” said Lapierre. “I want McGill aux français,” describing how McGill had to recognize it was part of a francophone province and serve the workers of the province.
Lapierre gave an impassioned and almost tearful speech recounting his life in a large, Catholic, rural family with parents who had no love in the world except bettering their children’s lives. McGill, as a gateway to the rest of Canada and the world, needs to be open to francophones, to contribute to the betterment of the life of Quebeckers, and transform Canada into a country that respects the equality of Quebec.
“McGill is the only university in Canada that has to represent Quebec,” he said. “If you leave Canada the way you have found it, I will come back and haunt the hell out of you.”
SSMU VP Internal Julia Webster thought the event was a wake-up call for the lack of francophone representation on campus.
“I think this was a potent reminder of the marginalization of francophone students on campus,” Webster said.
Carman Miller, a former dean of the Faculty of Arts and a current history professor, hired a few years before the protest, pointed to the 1969 Principal’s actions, which framed the protest as a war.
“McGill has rights and will protect its rights,” quoted Miller, recalling Principal Harold Rocke Robertson’s address to faculty and staff at the time, before he then announced that police would surround the large auditorium in Leacock and force people to obey the University’s will.
“McGill represented, rightly or wrongly, what was wrong,” recalled Miller, “and the notion that I was on the wrong side only fed [my will for change].”

Large pharmaceutical companies expected to oppose reforms to flawed legislation
After nearly five years of calling for reform of Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR) – legislation intended to facilitate access to affordable, essential medicines in developing countries – Canadian civil society organizations may have reason to believe change is near.
Speaking on Parliament Hill last Thursday at a panel to launch the reform campaign, Senator Yoine Goldstein indicated that amendments to the legislation had already been drafted, and that plans to table the initiative in Senate by the end of April were underway.
CAMR was originally meant to allow generic Canadian drug manufacturers to approach the Commissioner of Patents and request a compulsory license – a scheme which permits the manufacturer to bypass the patent holder’s rights under exceptional circumstances. In so-called developed countries like Canada, HIV/AIDS has become a difficult, chronic condition. Yet, in developing countries with high rates of HIV/AIDS and low access to essential medicines, millions are in need, and the conditions are certainly exceptional. However, only one shipment of drugs has left the country thus far, and the legislation is widely recognized as flawed.
“[The regime] has not put lives before patents – precisely what this groundbreaking legislation was intended to do,” said Marek Krasula, counsel for Senator Goldstein. “No generic manufacturer is willing to go through the CAMR process in its current form.”
Under the current system, manufacturers are required to apply for a separate compulsory license for each country it wants to export to, and for each quantity of medication it wants to export.
According to Richard Elliott, Executive Director of the HIV/AIDS Legal Network, the main aim of the proposed reform implementing what he terms a “one-license solution” – a system that would allow generic manufacturers to apply for a single license authorizing the export of a lower-cost drug to any of the eligible countries without predetermining the quantity, and with the requirement that the generic manufacturer periodically disclose the contracts that they land and pay the applicable royalty.
“I think it is not at all premature, contrary to what the government says, to actually revisit this and come up with a much better, simpler process of getting medicines at lower prices to developing countries,” Elliott said.
At the panel, Elliott highlighted the need for government to act immediately. He announced that generic drug manufacturer Apotex – the first and only company to export drugs under CAMR – has committed to making a lower-cost version of an important paediatric AIDS medication, but only once CAMR is streamlined.
Citing problems with current paediatric formulas, including unpleasant tasting syrups, the requirement for refrigeration, and the need for children to take multiple doses, Elliott said that millions of children are in need.
“[A] paediatric formulation is incredibly needed to treat children with HIV around the world,  particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, when so few children have access to practicable treatment,” Elliott said, adding that the proposed formulation would only have to be taken once or twice per day.
Apotex’s Director of Public and Government Affairs, Eli Betito, also told The Daily that this would be the first and only medicine of its kind in the world.
Once the bill is tabled in the Senate, however, it is likely to face major obstacles. Though Elliott has been meeting with MPs from all political parties to discuss the proposed reform, history does not show promise: in December 2007, the government tabled a review of CAMR that recommended no changes be made.  Elliott speculates that much of the resistance will come from large pharmaceutical companies who have a stake in maintaining the status quo.
“Big pharma has always opposed compulsory licensing as a policy tool to get lower priced medicines, an opposition which is particularly obnoxious and offensive and really damaging when we’re talking about opposing the use of compulsory licensing by developing countries who are facing millions of people who need affordable medicine,” Elliott said.
The Minister of Industry, Tony Clement, did not respond to The Daily’s request for a comment.
Krasula felt that the issue of reform should move beyond partisanship, calling it “apolitical.”
“Even though it is a private member’s bill, all-party support would surely expedite the entire process and give this issue the attention it deserves,” he said.
Elliott agreed, noting that all members of Parliament and the Senate should have an interest in making the legislation work, as they voted unanimously for the original CAMR plan in 2004.
“As more time goes by it just becomes even more and more of an embarrassment that we haven’t got this right. That’s why we’re saying: it is in your hands, Parliament,” Elliott said.

Students booted by associate dean for silent protest
Peaceful pro-Israel protesters were expelled from the Law Building on March 17 by Associate Dean at McGill’s Faculty of Law David Lametti for silently campaigning against a photo exhibit meant to evoke sympathy for the violence faced by the Palestinians.
Following the demonstration, a distraught law student sent a letter to National Post commentator Jonathan Kay. The letter sparked claims of human rights violations at the University and a heated debate about the statements posted.
That a group of non-law students peacefully demonstrating in the atrium of the law building alongside a display hosted by the organizers of Palestinian Human Rights Week (PHRW) were kicked out of the building was troubling and a violation of freedom of expression, the letter stated.
“They did not attempt to obscure the visibility of these exhibits,” wrote the first letter writer. “Rather, by standing between them and holding their own posters, they were offering a visual rebuttal to the official faculty-approved message.”
Arieh Bloom, U3 Commerce, and President of Republicans Abroad at McGill, organized the counter demonstration, which was intended to present a balanced and alternative, yet peaceful perspective to the pro-Palestinian display.
“We were kicked out on [the] ground that the demonstration would prevent freedom of dialogue,” Bloom said. “That should have meant that we were doing something egregious and terribly unacceptable.”
Halfway through the planned two-hour demonstration Lametti requested that the 14 undergraduates leave on the basis that they were creating a hostile environment and were not law students, among other offences.
The first letter Kay posted describes one photo as depicting two dead Palestinian children killed in an Israeli Defense Forces operation, with excerpts from the Geneva Convention and short articles deploring the plight of Palestinians hung next to many of the photos.
The display was one of many campus events that contributed to an unbalanced treatment of Gaza, Bloom said. He said that there has been a failure in dialogue and that some groups – he cited those with both Arab and Jewish affiliations – were attacking Israel.
Bloom, who had consulted a lawyer before the counter demonstration, was certain that none of the signs he was showing were hateful. While he described the signs as teaching peace, love and toleration, some did portray violence.
One placard depicted a child dressed in green Hamas gear holding a machine gun. Beside the baby sat the slogan: “Teach love, peace, and toleration – not war.”
The idea, he stressed, was that passersby would see the pictures from both causes and be able to make an informed and balanced judgment.
“It would have taken away all legitimacy of our protest if we were trying to censor. We would have been hypocrites and it was totally against what we stand for,” Bloom said.
Bloom is now seeking amicable remedy with the dean on the account that their right to assemble was violated.
“I don’t think [Associate Dean Lametti] did what he did because of anti-Semitism. I think it was just poor judgment,” said Bloom. “What I most don’t understand is how does a law school – meant to be the paradigm of human rights – how do they not even respect the free rights of students who want to foster dialogue of human rights on campus?
“The contradiction of human rights is appalling.”
The associate dean and organizers of PHRW were unavailable for comment.

University redrafts regulations on research policy
McGill is looking to update its policy on military research for the first time since 1991, but senators will have to wait until May 20 before discussing changes to the Regulations on Research Policy.
In the past, McGill professors have collaborated with the American and Canadian militaries, although this may cause conflicts with the policy’s preamble, which states that “[Research] should be used to increase knowledge in ways that do not harm society.”
In the fall, Demilitarize McGill, a student group against military-funded research at McGill, learned that the administration was updating the existing policy, and decided to create their own draft for consideration after reviewing two drafts from William Foster, Associate Provost (Policies and Procedures).
According to Cleve Higgins, U3 Sociology and IDS and a member of Demilitarize McGill, the last draft they received, dated on February 2, is not adequate.
“We’ve [suggested making] it mandatory for research that is funded or in collaboration with a military agency to go to [a review] committee,” Higgins explained.
McGill currently requires professors receiving grants or contracts from military organizations to evaluate the consequences of their own research. The February 2 draft proposal stipulates that military-related projects must receive the approval of a research review committee, although the law gives the Board of Governors discretion to approve or reject all contracts, whether related to military research or not.
However, according to Higgins, professors could choose whether or not to have their work plans approved by a research review committee, something he believes does not fully guarantee the humane application of university research.
“The military is the only institution in our society that is specifically intended to cause harm to people,” Higgins argued. “If this research is for the military, [there] is a flag going off about harm.”
The new draft of McGill’s Regulations on Research Policy also contains a revised preamble that does not address research that might result in inflicting harm.
In a 2007 letter to University of Western Ontario Vice President (Research and International Relations) Ted Hewitt, McGill Vice Principal (Research and International Relations) Denis Therien asserted that it is difficult to trace direct harm to research and explained his opinion that military research can often benefit society. He also indicated his belief that academic freedom must be respected when regulating research.
“Academic freedom demands that, so long as all existing review criteria are met, we uphold our faculty members’ right to pursue research as they see fit and that restrictions based upon whether or not some may find particular avenues of research objectionable should be resisted,” Therien wrote.
In the letter, Therien also stated his opposition to any Canadian body that might provide guidelines for the approval of military research.
In the meantime, Higgins is hoping for increased student interest in McGill’s military research policies.
“For students in general, a research conduct policy on its own seems pretty bland, but when it’s put in the context of military research…then it’s an issue for people.”
Therien was not available for comment on McGill’s research policy.

Montreal’s red-light district, the area east of St. Laurent and Ste. Catherine, is getting cleaned up.
Patrons of the sex shops, insta-checks, and fast food joints may not be able to recognize the area after an eco-friendly mega-complex of socially responsible retail and art moves in.
A non-profit, eco-friendly development company called Technopôle Angus proposed the $110-million plan to renovate the strip.
Technopôle Angus demolished the abandoned building at 222 Ste. Catherine Est, once an erotic video theatre, and has bought several other buildings – notably the nightclub Katacombes and the building that housed the hot dog shop Frites Dorées.
Some occupants are concerned about the impact of gentrification on the historic neighbourhood.
Johnny Zoumboulakis, the owner of Café Cleopatra – who resisted an Angus buy-out – worried how his business, a strip club that stages transvestite shows on its second floor, would fit in with the new neighbourhood.
“Restoration shouldn’t change the look or mentality of the [area],” he said.
While Zoumboulakis was uneasy about the developers’ plan, he recognized that the neighbourhood could benefit from a fresh coat of paint.
“Run-down and boarded-up buildings [need to be] restored,” he said, stressing the importance of “restoration not demolition.”
Jacques-Alain Lavalle, spokesperson for the Ville-Marie borough, said that while the borough supports redevelopment, it values the preservation of Montreal’s history in urban design. His support for the demolition of 222 Ste. Catherine was in accordance with a February 2008 press release from Mayor Tremblay’s office, which deemed the building unsafe and insecure according to an outside engineering consulting firm.
“The building that was torn down at 222 [Ste. Catherine Est] had little value,” Lavalle said.
For its part, Angus has remained tight-lipped on the details of their plan: Ville Marie has only seen preliminary sketches of the project. Susan Methot, press liaison for Technopole Angus, said plans for the redevelopment of the neighbourhood would be revealed in a public assembly at the end of April.
Edson Teixeira, whose family owns the soon-to-be-evicted Frites Dorées, knew few details of Angus’s plan except that, “[the developers] don’t want [any] chain stores or hot dog joints.”
The City’s plans to redevelop the neighbourhood, a project coined Quartier des Spectacles, dates back to the eighties. The project focuses on the square kilometre bounded by City Councillors Street, Berri Street, Sherbrooke Street, and René-Lévesque Boulevard.
The City hopes the Quartier des Spectacles can “enhance existing heritage buildings that are next to modern buildings, while restoring commercial continuity,” according to the development objectives stated on their web site.

Businesses get creative as city ponders plans
In spite of having the second highest recycling rate of all the municipalities on the Island of Montreal, Westmount still doesn’t pick up commercial recycling – something locals say is problematic.
With only 41 per cent of all household waste being diverted from landfills, Westmount remains far from achieving the provincial objective of recycling 60 per cent of its total refuse.
Evan Hughes, an employee at the accessories shop Benn & Tournesol on Sherbrooke, said his store was recently provided with an individual blue bin that allows them to recycle junk mail and various office items – but it does not cover the large volume of cardboard boxes, paper, and plastic that the store generates.
“Retailers produce way more recycling than the average household,” said Hughes.
But in lieu of an accessible recycling system, Hughes has managed to find ways to cut down on the waste produced by his business.
“We switched our plastic bags to biodegradable and our wrapping paper and ribbon are made from recycled materials,” he said.
Westmount recycling coordinator Marina Peter said that the City has neglected to create a pick-up recycling program because of the logistical problems it presents.
“A lot of the time [trucks] are limited [in what they can pick up] because the laneways are narrow. Putting the recycling out in front of the stores – [is] not something that can be easily done. I don’t know if you’ve ever walked down St. Denis on recycling day, but you see tons of cardboard just sitting on the curb,” she said.
Peter said that in the meantime, Westmount is focussing on educating business owners about other ways to recycle – including informing them about a drop-off point for recycling, and providing them with names of private pick-up services.
Evelyn Couture, owner of the Westmount dog boutique Bark & Fitz, said it was difficult to independently take the initiative to recycle.
“At the end of the day, to get the recycling out [to a drop-off point] is a hassle to coordinate,” she said. “I know it’s better for the environment, but I don’t think it should be put on us to go to a drop sight when we are paying what we are paying to be in business here.”
Paying for private recycling is also not a feasible alternative, according to Tony Russo, who has owned Cavallero Fine Foods on Sherbrooke for 11 years – especially after paying Westmount taxes.
Russo also said he has not received any information from the City about recycling.
“You can educate all you want, but if you are not going to pick it up, well – you know, we’re busy here,” he said.

Communication gaps block student research from real-world implementation
The McGill Office of Sustainability wants the University and the community at large to benefit from undergraduate research, the results of which are too often wasted within the current academic system.
The Sustainability Office aims to serve as a nexus for campus sustainability projects by cataloguing student research. Director Dennis Fortune hopes the office will bridge the communication gap between students and the people who can actually implement their plans.
“We’re looking for ways to integrate ideas. We want people to come with ideas; we’re ready to encourage opportunities,” said Fortune. He maintains that the student body is buzzing with ideas about how to make their school more sustainable, but students encounter logistical obstacles when implementing their ideas.
“The problem is, how can we communicate to students in a better way?” Fortune said.
While the projects of many McGill faculties involve professional analysis of real-world subjects, the results and conclusions of these intensive projects regularly go unnoticed by their subjects, said Amelie Dinh, U3 Arts.
“Projects, and specifically group projects, are a huge part of the management faculty,” wrote Dinh.
“Students are not often asked to make additional presentations [to the subjects of their projects].”
Despite the generally short life- span of student projects at McGill, Dinh, a management minor, said that certain classes and professors do encourage students to submit projects to their subject. For her Marketing 438 Brand Management class, Dinh participated in a “brand audit” of the Green Party that she later presented to the Green Party at a conference.
“Bronfman professors…work extremely hard to connect their projects and assignments to the world outside of McGill,” said Dinh.
Dinh was confident that channeling results from undergraduate work toward the community in question would benefit students in the long  run.
“The [MRKT 438] professor [Robert Mackalski] has had past students submit their projects to the companies that were the group’s focus. He encouraged students to use the project as an opportunity to develop a portfolio of sorts, something that students could show to companies during job interviews.”
“It is definitely beneficial if students are asked to apply their work to the ‘real world’ upon completing a project.”
Fortune said there have already been some instances of student ideas being implemented on campus to increase sustainability. He said students have come to him with ideas about converting trucks to the use of vegetable oil fuel, and also to alter the mufflers on the Macdonald Campus buses to make them more sustainable.
Fortune said that the Office of Sustainability has made contact with the architecture and management schools, but admits that communication with students is a significant problem for the Office of Sustainability.
“Individual actions do make a difference,” said Fortune.

Montreal’s other anglo university hopes to compost 100 tonnes of organic refuse by 2012
Canadian universities have embraced sustainability projects, and amid a whirlwind of new offices, composters, and recycling bins, they are in a frenzy to be the greenest.
Sustainable Concordia recently completed their fifth annual waste audit, initiated in 2005. The results show that 65 per cent of waste was diverted from landfills through recycling and composting programs, which means Concordia will soon be re-certified at the highest level of Ici On Recycle! – Recyc-Québec’s waste diversion certification program.
Composting has been Sustainable Concordia’s greatest success, with the installation of an industrial composter on Loyola campus in September 2008. They are already well on the way to hitting their target of 20 tonnes of garbage for the year, and hope to reach 100 tonnes by 2012.
McGill is lagging behind Concordia’s success with greening initiatives in many areas, but  the University is planning a similar composting program – proposed for the downtown campus – and this year welcomed an Office of Sustainability.
Though a sustainability policy is still being developed, the Office has begun a number of other projects, including Reboot McGill, a recent initiative from the Engineering Undergraduate Society to refurbish used McGill computers and monitors, and provide them to student groups who express a need.
The Office hopes to demonstrate how making sustainable purchasing choices at McGill can encourage community waste diversion by using carpet and tiles made of recycled and post-consumer material in their building. According to Dennis Fortune, director of sustainability at McGill, the space was designed to be inclusive, cooperative, and accessible, qualities that underline the Office’s role.
McGill’s Lab Waste Reduction Group, which began as a graduate student project, has also tackled sustainable purchasing. The group organized an event last week that evaluated options for waste reduction and other eco-friendly possibilities in labs. Three of McGill’s major laboratory suppliers discussed how to reduce waste from packaging and implement take-back programs for recyclable supplies. According to Priyanka Sundram, the Group’s co-chair, they created a one-month pilot project that seeks to establish indicators that could figure into a larger scale waste audit in the future.
Both universities, though, can still improve in a number of ways.
Louise Hénault-Éthier, Concordia’s environment coordinator,  pointed to the University of Winnipeg, which last week became the first university in Canada to ban the sale of plastic water bottles on campus.
“They beat us to it,” Hénault-Éthier said, bringing up the student group Tap Drinkers Against Privatization, which is working towards similar bans at Concordia and McGill.
McGill undergraduates voted to ban the sale of water bottles in the Shatner Building at this semester’s General Assembly.
For Hénault-Éthier, the key to success is cutting garbage at the source. She cites the plethora of plastic water bottles and coffee cups in Concordia’s garbage as a disgrace, and wants to encourage discounts for re-usable cups to have a greater impact on people’s habits, and also encourages her university to only use compostable coffee cups, like the University of Sherbrooke.

Evelyn Couture, owner of the Westmount dog boutique Bark & Fitz, said it was difficult to independently take the initiative to recycle.
“At the end of the day, to get the recycling out [to a drop-off point] is a hassle to coordinate,” she said. “I know it’s better for the environment, but I don’t think it should be put on us to go to a drop sight when we are paying what we are paying to be in business here.”
Paying for private recycling is also not a feasible alternative, according to Tony Russo, who has owned Cavallero Fine Foods on Sherbrooke for 11 years – especially after paying Westmount taxes.
Russo also said he has not received any information from the City about recycling.
“You can educate all you want, but if you are not going to pick it up, well – you know, we’re busy here,” he said.

Communication gaps block student research from real-world implementation
The McGill Office of Sustainability wants the University and the community at large to benefit from undergraduate research, the results of which are too often wasted within the current academic system.
The Sustainability Office aims to serve as a nexus for campus sustainability projects by cataloguing student research. Director Dennis Fortune hopes the office will bridge the communication gap between students and the people who can actually implement their plans.
“We’re looking for ways to integrate ideas. We want people to come with ideas; we’re ready to encourage opportunities,” said Fortune. He maintains that the student body is buzzing with ideas about how to make their school more sustainable, but students encounter logistical obstacles when implementing their ideas.
“The problem is, how can we communicate to students in a better way?” Fortune said.
While the projects of many McGill faculties involve professional analysis of real-world subjects, the results and conclusions of these intensive projects regularly go unnoticed by their subjects, said Amelie Dinh, U3 Arts.
“Projects, and specifically group projects, are a huge part of the management faculty,” wrote Dinh.
“Students are not often asked to make additional presentations [to the subjects of their projects].”
Despite the generally short life- span of student projects at McGill, Dinh, a management minor, said that certain classes and professors do encourage students to submit projects to their subject. For her Marketing 438 Brand Management class, Dinh participated in a “brand audit” of the Green Party that she later presented to the Green Party at a conference.
“Bronfman professors…work extremely hard to connect their projects and assignments to the world outside of McGill,” said Dinh.
Dinh was confident that channeling results from undergraduate work toward the community in question would benefit students in the long  run.
“The [MRKT 438] professor [Robert Mackalski] has had past students submit their projects to the companies that were the group’s focus. He encouraged students to use the project as an opportunity to develop a portfolio of sorts, something that students could show to companies during job interviews.”
“It is definitely beneficial if students are asked to apply their work to the ‘real world’ upon completing a project.”
Fortune said there have already been some instances of student ideas being implemented on campus to increase sustainability. He said students have come to him with ideas about converting trucks to the use of vegetable oil fuel, and also to alter the mufflers on the Macdonald Campus buses to make them more sustainable.
Fortune said that the Office of Sustainability has made contact with the architecture and management schools, but admits that communication with students is a significant problem for the Office of Sustainability.
“Individual actions do make a difference,” said Fortune.
