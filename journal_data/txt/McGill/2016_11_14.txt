Hundreds rally after U.S. election in “cathartic” solidarity demonstration
“Fuck Donald Trump!” chanted a crowd of roughly 200 demonstrators marching down St. Denis on Wednesday, November 9, the words resonating as onlookers and passersby waved and cheered in support. The self-described anti-fascist gathering coincided with dozens of similar protests held across the U.S. in the wake of Trump’s election as the next U.S. President on November 8. It aimed to denounce Trump’s racism, sexism, and right-wing populist rhetoric and policy proposals.
A solemn mood reigned as protesters gathered around 7:30 p.m. at the corner of Ontario and de Lorimier. Many expressed their anger and disappointment in the previous night’s election.
“The last twenty-four hours have been emotionally traumatizing,” a Concordia student who attended the protest told The Daily. “I’ve been trying to come to face with the reality of having a neo-fascist as someone with the nuclear codes, [at the head of] one of the most powerful militaries in the world, so I’m feeling pretty shitty. Honestly, I feel like I’ve lost all hope.”
“I feel like a lot of people felt like the world was trending in a somewhat good direction, and this is a slap in the face to that kind of idea,” Justinas Staskevicius, a recent Concordia graduate, told The Daily at the protest. “I think the people were lied to, I think they were sold the image of a man who they felt was a populist, and they had a lot of anger toward the system itself.”
Speaking at the beginning of the rally, one of the organizers emphasized the need for solidarity with marginalized populations in the United States.
“I’ve been trying to come to face with the reality of having a neo-fascist as someone with the nuclear codes, [at the head of] one of the most powerful militaries in the world, so I’m feeling pretty shitty.”
“The far-right populist wave, which is growing in France, in Britain, in Greece, now finds an echo in North America,” she told the crowd in French. “Faced with Donald Trump’s racism and sexism, his wealth, his disdain for poor people, for disabled people, for the LGBT community, let us come together to say loud and clear that the far-right shall not pass, that we stand in solidarity with much of the American population that will shortly suffer the wrath of Trump.”
The gathering served as “a chance for personal catharsis” for the participants, as the anonymous student described it, and the mood noticeably lightened once demonstrators took to the streets and began to chant.
“I think the people were lied to, I think they were sold the image of a man who they felt was a populist, and they had a lot of anger toward the system itself.”
“Hey hey, ho ho, Trump has got to go!” and “Tout le monde déteste les fascistes!” (“Everybody hates fascists!”) the crowd shouted as it headed westward escorted by police.
Speaking to The Daily, attendees noted the harmful impact of Trump’s words and actions on members of marginalized groups and the impunity with which he has acted.
“We need to send a clear message that we do not accept this candidate who defends the principles of white supremacy and promotes hatred against different ethnic groups, Mexicans, Muslims,” Sandra Cordero, one of the demonstrators, said in French. “He’s a rapist, this guy is a rapist […] how come no one has arrested him yet? […] Will he do it again to other people? Will he prevent justice from taking its course? […] This is a fascist, this is a dangerous man.”
Maylee, a freelance illustrator who attended the protest, expressed concern about the rippling effects of Trump’s victory. “As a person of colour and a woman […] I really hope people of colour [in Canada] will not get hurt in this. I hope there won’t be a rise of racism in the world either because someone just gave the green light to this. So for now, let’s just hope the next twenty-four hours is going to be okay, because the last twenty-four hours have been really tough.”
Police declared the demonstration illegal at 8:50 p.m., but did not take action to disperse it. Shortly thereafter, the protest reached its destination, the U.S. consulate at the corner of St. Alexandre and René-Lévesque.
“We need to send a clear message that we do not accept this candidate who defends the principles of white supremacy and promotes hatred against different ethnic groups, Mexicans, Muslims.”
Addressing the crowd at the close of the demonstration, Éric, an organizer, spoke to the relevance of the anti-fascist struggle in Quebec.
“The struggle against fascism has to be waged day after day, in our living environments, in our work environments, everywhere we are, because it requires constant education – that’s the only way we can defeat it, and certainly not by voting, which amounts to a choice between the plague and cholera as we have seen this year in the U.S.,” he said in French.
“Here in Quebec, one has only to think of the Parti Québécois with Jean-François Lisée [and his Islamophobia], the security measures that are being taken to prevent us from demonstrating – we’re not any safer here than our neighbours are.”
Looking toward the future, some of the participants found a silver lining in an opportunity to build solidarity and in an increased potential for mobilization.
“Here in Quebec, one has only to think of the Parti Québécois with Jean-François Lisée [and his Islamophobia], the security measures that are being taken to prevent us from demonstrating – we’re not any safer here than our neighbours are.”
“Perhaps the one positive thing that can happen from this situation is that people that were centrist, liberal, HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] supporters will become radicalized and do more than they would have had she been elected,” said the anonymous student. “I’m trying to convince myself that there’s hope, but it’s hard.”

GA becomes a consultative forum
On Monday, November 7, around 25 students gathered for the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Fall 2016 General Assembly (GA). For the results of a GA to be binding, a minimum of a hundred students must attend. Since the meeting failed to meet quorum, it became a “consultative forum,” meaning that, while students still voted on motions, these votes were not binding.
SSMU Indigenous Affairs Coordinator Christian Quequish discussed SSMU’s recent statement in favour of striking the “Motion Regarding Support for the Kahtihon’tia:kwenio (‘Women titleholders of the land’)” from the agenda. SSMU had previously released a statement regarding the motion, the latter having originally been brought to the Winter 2016 GA.
According to SSMU’s statement, the motion “called for the SSMU to support a Notice of Seizure delivered to McGill University on September 12, 2015, by a group presenting themselves as representatives of the Kahnawá:ke Mohawk community.” The notice called on the University to “immediately stop trespassing on traditional Indigenous territory.” However, the motion was tabled at the Winter GA because of inadequate Indigenous consultation.
The land seizure was delivered without any consultation of Indigenous students or members of the Kahnawá:ke community, Quequish explained.
According to the statement, “the motion presented at the Winter General Assembly is misrepresentative of local Indigenous perspectives and stems from selective consultation with activists operating in isolation from traditional governance systems. […] The ‘Women Titleholders’ are not official representatives of Kahnawá:ke, nor do they have the support of the Kahnawá:ke Longhouses or many Indigenous students on-campus.” In fact, according to Quequish, the movers only consulted with one Indigenous student after the motion was tabled.
The Indigenous student, after providing their personal contact information to the movers, was “subsequently harassed […] with repeated emails, Facebook messages, and phone calls,” said Quequish.
“Non-Indigenous students need to realize that Indigenous issues are complex, and our perspectives are diverse and nuanced,” Quequish continued. “To only interact with one Indigenous person and no others [is] a misrepresentation.”
“Non-Indigenous students need to realize that Indigenous issues are complex, and our perspectives are diverse and nuanced.”
“As students, we should hold ourselves to a higher standard with respect to engaging with Indigenous individuals and communities, and respect their decisions when they choose not to speak with us,” Queqish concluded.
A motion ratifying SSMU Board of Directors (BoD) appointments passed with no discussion. SSMU President Ben Ger explained that SSMU’s constitution requires BoD appointments to be ratified by the GA, but it’s mostly procedural.
A “Motion regarding Global Access to Medicines Policy” was next on the agenda. It was moved by the McGill Students’ Chapter of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM).
One member of UAEM-McGill gave a brief explanation of the motion, saying that UAEM “is trying to get McGill University to adopt a patent policy which will allow different innovations or drugs […] tested at the University [to be] more accessible to people in developing countries.” According to the motion, 65 other universities have adopted a similar policy.
“This motion is asking SSMU to help [our] club get McGill University to adopt this motion in its policies,” the mover clarified.
SSMU VP University Affairs Erin Sobat asked how the movers planned to move forward and if they would join him in meeting with the Vice Principal (Research and Innovation)’s office. The movers clarified they would ask SSMU senators to put the motion in front of their constituencies and are also following up on other options. The motion then passed.
“This motion is asking SSMU to help [our] club get McGill University to adopt this motion in its policies.”
The next item on the agenda was the motion regarding SSMU support for cost-free birth control coverage, moved by McGill Students for the New Democratic Party (NDP-McGill). According to the motion, “non-Quebec McGill students currently do not receive full reimbursement for prescription birth control under the SSMU’s group health insurance.”
The motion called for SSMU to support cost-free access to prescription birth control and for the SSMU Health and Dental Review Committee to review SSMU’s health insurance plan and negotiate with the insurance provider to ensure free prescription birth control to SSMU members.
U1 student and member of NDP McGill, Julian Bonellostauch, presented the motion. “We feel that because birth control is the most effective form of contraception we should increase access to this,” he said.
Sobat proposed a friendly amendment to “add another clause that would also mandate the SSMU to advocate changes to the international plan,” as the international student health plan is separate from the SSMU health plan. Since the amendment was friendly, it was automatically added to the motion, which passed.
Finally, students passed a motion regarding the appointment of the auditor for the fiscal year of 2016-2017. This ensures that the same auditor for the 2015-2016 year is hired for this academic year.
After the motions were heard, the SSMU executive team reported on their work so far this semester.
Because the GA did not reach quorum, the motions ratifying the BoD and appointing the auditor will go to online ratification, while other motions will go to the SSMU Legislative Council.

Wide variety of views and ideologies expressed at Anonymous protest
On the evening of Saturday, November 5, roughly two hundred people gathered in Victoria Square for Montreal’s Million Mask March. Ostensibly organized by the decentralized global hacktivist group Anonymous, the annual march has taken place in cities around the world since 2013.
Its date coincides with Guy Fawkes Day, and protesters typically wear the stylized Guy Fawkes mask, which has become an emblem of Anonymous since the 2006 film V for Vendetta associated the mask with political protest in the public consciousness.
Gathered around a statue of Queen Victoria, the base of which had been covered in banners and placards for the occasion, those attending the protest chatted and chanted the occasional slogan. Half a dozen police officers watched from across a street, but did not intervene.
A wide array of political ideologies and causes were represented, with placards denouncing rape culture, the Dakota Access Pipeline, state surveillance, colonialism in Palestine, censorship, and capitalism, to name a few.
Many of the protestors who spoke to The Daily did not express affiliation with any specific political ideology, but rather expressed generalized frustration with aspects of society which they perceived as unjust or corrupt. Most protesters seemed to fall on the left of the political spectrum, though with varying degrees of radicalism and detailed analysis.
One demonstrator, however, declared support for the right-wing nationalist regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and expressed profoundly anti-Semitic views in a brief interview with The Daily.
A wide array of political ideologies and causes were represented, with placards denouncing rape culture, the Dakota Access Pipeline, state surveillance, colonialism in Palestine, censorship, and capitalism, to name a few.
This disparity of beliefs and political orientations is seemingly a function of Anonymous’s decentralized structure – the hacktivist collective has no hierarchy of leadership and no well-defined ideology, beyond a broad opposition to censorship.
Individuals identifying with the group have launched cyberattacks against a slew of targets, from the governments of the United States and Israel, to Daesh (also known as ISIS), to video game companies, to financial corporations like Visa and MasterCard, to Quebec nationalism, to the Westboro Baptist Church.
Speaking to The Daily, a protester who identified himself only as Francis addressed the drawbacks of such a broad and decentralized movement.
“Some groups, probably on the right, could try and get a piece of the cake,” he admitted in French. “Obviously everyone knows who those people are, everyone knows they’re not legitimate, and they’re not the real ones – if I can say that. The real ones are always for rights, […] but it’s true that there are right-wing groups that often do really serious things under the mask of Anonymous. And obviously people who are in the know understand that it’s not us, the comrades, who do that.”
When asked what issues Anonymous addresses that are the most important to him personally, Francis, replied “human rights, […] the media that lies to us, […] the police services of many cities – especially Montreal – but especially poverty, in my opinion.”
What could Anonymous do to effect change on these issues, as opposed to legal action through mainstream political channels? According to Francis, the value of their work lies largely in raising awareness among the general population.
“The real ones are always for rights, […] but it’s true that there are right-wing groups that often do really serious things under the mask of Anonymous. And obviously people who are in the know understand that it’s not us, the comrades, who do that.”
“Raising awareness, and if ever there’s no visibility, doing concrete actions […] but it’s mostly informing people,” he said. “For example, if there was an organisation known for causing poverty, […] Anonymous might attack their servers, and crash their site, which […] would make people aware of the subject.”
The message of the Million Mask March, he said, was to tell the world “we’re here, we’ll always be here, and we don’t forget.”
The crowd gathered in Square Victoria, in addition to its diversity of political opinions and causes, comprised a variety of ages, ethnicities, and genders.
Speaking to The Daily, Flavie and Charlotte said they were frustrated by the prevailing climate of conservatism at their private high school, and had decided to attend the march out of a strong sense that Canadian society is profoundly flawed, and that “it’s not by doing nothing that these things will change.”
After some brief speeches, the protesters watched a video tribute to the late Jean Leger, a local anti-pipeline activist who recently committed suicide. Following this, they took to the streets, chanting various slogans from the classic – “Whose streets? Our streets!” – to the eclectic – “Killuminati!” and “Fuck the New World Order!”
The protest wound through the streets of the financial district, the lower Plateau, and Old Port, stopping at sites deemed emblematic of state violence and corruption: the Palais de Justice, the United States consulate, and the headquarters of the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
“Whose streets? Our streets!” – to the eclectic – “Killuminati!” and “Fuck the New World Order!”
Police officers on bicycles remained just ahead of the crowd, with several police vehicles following it, but no substantive confrontation occurred between protesters and law enforcement. The event ended peacefully outside the Palais de Justice, with organizers urging people to meet on November 5, 2017, for the next Million Mask March.

Several withdraw their accounts with TD Bank, Royal Bank of Canada
On Monday, November 7, protesters gathered in Victoria Square to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation in their fight to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).
The Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport over half a million barrels of oil nearly 2,000 kilometres across the U.S. Midwest every day, was approved for construction earlier last summer without consulting the Standing Rock Sioux Nation. Many have come forward saying the pipeline’s construction threatens the Missouri River, an essential source of fresh water for the nation.
“The DAPL is slated to cross Lakota Treaty Territory at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation,” reads the event’s Facebook page. “For months, the Standing Rock Sioux have been leading a protest against the construction of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. They have been joined by thousands in what has been described as the biggest gathering of Indigenous movements in the U.S. in a hundred years.”
Since the protests began, many human rights violations have been recorded and protesters have repeatedly been targeted by police.
Among those who spoke at the rally was Kenneth Deer, who, on the event’s Facebook page, is described as “a journalist and educator from Kahnawake, known for his involvement in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”
“The brutality of the police force out there is unforgivable,” Deer said to the crowd. “There is no need for peaceful protesters who are defending the water and defending their land and their territory, defending their treaty rights, to be tear-gassed, to have rubber bullets being fired at them or bean bag rounds.”
“All of these activities and actions are absolutely unnecessary,” he continued. “Everybody has a right [to] peaceful protest. All of you here [in Victoria Square] are exercising your right to peaceful protest.”
“The brutality of the police force out there is unforgivable. There is no need for peaceful protesters who are defending the water and defending their land and their territory, defending their treaty rights, to be tear-gassed, to have rubber bullets being fired at them or bean bag rounds.”
“The environmental impact statement issued by the company itself confirmed that over three hundred and eighty [Indigenous] sites would be potentially destroyed by the pipeline project,” said Deer, stressing the the large scale destruction that the pipeline will cause to the land of the Sioux Nation.
Louellyn White, an associate professor of First People Studies in Concordia’s School of Community and Public Affairs, also spoke, highlighting the issues of sovereignty with regards to Indigenous lands.
“The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 that delineated the boundaries for the great Sioux Nation […] was repeatedly aggregated […] and that land has been greatly diminished,” said Louellyn White, an associate professor of First People Studies in Concordia’s School of Community and Public Affairs, reminding demonstrators that Standing Rock is yet another battle in a long and painful war between Indigenous people and colonial governments.
The provisions of that treaty said, “In exchange for use of your land, we will protect you from white settlers and we will provide annuities, education, [and] food – none of that happened,” she added. White also reminded the crowd that the land the protestors at Standing Rock are defending is unceded territory, and it is just a small fraction of the territory that the Sioux people once claimed as their own.
“The environmental impact statement issued by the company itself confirmed that over three hundred and eighty [Indigenous] sites would be potentially destroyed by the pipeline project.”
Professor White also invoked an old divination of the Lakota people: “You may have heard of the black snake prophecy of the Lakota people. ‘A black snake will come to the territory and will poison the land and will poison the air, it will poison the people.’ How do you defeat that black snake? You defeat that black snake by cutting off its head.”
Professor White concluded her address by referencing the end goal of the protest: to put pressure on Canadian banks that are partially responsible for funding the DAPL and other pipelines across the United States and Canada. She implied that these banks were the head of the “black snake” and in order to defeat the DAPL, individuals have to divest from institutions that support human rights and environmental violations.
Protesters subsequently marched from Victoria Square along Rue Saint-Antoine Ouest and made their first stop in front of the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, which has shares in the Dakota Access Pipeline.
The protesters then marched west on Viger Ouest, then north on St-Alexandre and west again on René-Lévesque to the Montreal headquarters of the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), where the march ended.
“You may have heard of the black snake prophecy of the Lakota people. ‘A black snake will come to the territory and will poison the land and will poison the air, it will poison the people.’ How do you defeat that black snake? You defeat that black snake by cutting off its head.”
Protesters prepared to enter bank locations in the area, including RBC, TD Bank, and Scotiabank, where they would divest, withdrawing from their bank accounts.
The large group broke into three smaller groups (for the three banks), but those outside RBC grew angry and confused very quickly when they came face-to-face with police officers unwilling to allow them access to the building, despite possessing RBC bank cards. Officers eventually agreed to let people in, but only one person at a time.
The first person to be let in was a young woman named Kara. After the teller told her RBC would not be divesting from the DAPL, she withdrew all her money from the bank.
“I walked in,” said Kara in French an interview with The Daily, “and I […] said ‘I don’t want to continue [being part of] a bank that […] invests in pipelines, with money that I give to RBC.’ Why would I invest in that? […] A woman said ‘fine, whatever, please wait in line to talk to someone at the counter.’”
White was the second person to enter the bank.
“I walked in, and I […] said ‘I don’t want to continue [being part of] a bank that […] invests in pipelines, with money that I give to RBC.’ Why would I invest in that? […] A woman said ‘fine, whatever, please wait in line to talk to someone at the counter.’”
“They let me in and they escorted me into the RBC branch […] there was quite a number of people just standing around […] they seemed to be really on the defensive and concerned,” she told The Daily in an interview.
She voiced her concerns with the branch and the moral implications of continuing to bank with RBC. “As an individual, I have accounts with RBC, and RBC has been contributing to the big oil industry,” she told RBC managers. “I cannot support that, therefore I’m divesting from RBC, and I know you don’t have a lot of power yourself to do anything, but I want to take my money out of RBC because I can’t support that.”
When asked if the individuals she encountered within the branch demonstrated any remorse for having lost her business, Professor White responded, “No, and I don’t think you’re gonna get that […] even at the management level they’re probably oblivious to the investments that RBC makes with these oil companies. I don’t think they’re really aware of it, but hopefully through these actions they’ll become more aware.”

Protesters take issue with resemblance of art installation to Apartheid Wall
On Wednesday, November 9, an Artists 4 Israel event on Lower Field of campus organized by Chabad McGill attracted protesters who denounced what they perceived to be the event’s insensitive concept and erasure of Palestinian voices.
In an event which has subsequently been removed from Facebook, members of the organization Artists 4 Israel erected a temporary wall on Lower Field, decorated it with Canadian and Israeli flags, and the word ‘peace’ in Hebrew and English, and invited passers-by to add their own graffiti to the installation.
They also displayed banners listing statements about Israel, and distributed free refreshments and t-shirts. Initially, Palestinian people, along with any Palestinian flags or symbols, were entirely absent from the event.
Soon however, the installation began to attract opposition. A small crowd of protesters gathered on Lower Field, carrying banners and placards which denounced Israel’s ongoing violence against Palestinian people, and appropriation of Palestinian land. The demonstrators spread out in a line, standing in front of the Artists 4 Israel installation.
Speaking to The Daily at the protest, George Ghabrial, a member of McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), explained what prompted him and other students to protest the event.
“Me and a couple friends were [at] the Y [intersection], we were all going to class, and we saw this structure […] and then we saw an Israeli flag. […] We went up to some of these student organizers, asked them what was going on, they said it was an event called ‘Artists 4 Israel,’” he explained.
“So SPHR […] said that we should do something – there’s no representation of Palestine, there’s no mention of Palestine, there’s no […] mention of the occupation,” he continued. “It’s an implicitly political event that does not make explicit the occupation of Palestine. […] So we went and got our banners […] and came down to Lower Field.”
“On the surface, it’s supposed to be apolitical,” Ghabrial explained. “I don’t know very much about Chabad as an organization, but I’d say that the event is very normalizing about the occupation. […] And there’s a very strong connotation about who the antagonizers to peace are.”
A member of Artists 4 Israel spoke with The Daily about the intended purpose of the event.
“Artists 4 Israel was brought here by Chabad, Stand With Us, Size Doesn’t Matter and AEπ and […] Hasbara Fellowships, in order to paint a mural about peace and coexistence, and try to bridge all the […] diverse cultures that are here together, and of course express their pride in their own Jewish heritage and sense of Israel with that larger culture of the campus.”
When asked about the response to the protest, he said: “Instead of their protest […] they’ve all been offered the opportunity to spray-paint with us and to have shirts made, the same way the entire student body has been allowed. That they chose to separate themselves and segregate themselves from an event that’s supposed to be about inclusiveness […] I think speaks for itself as to what their true intentions are. We would have loved them to be part of it.”
In a comment sent to The Daily by email, however, Julie, a member of Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions (BDS) McGill said that she had been present at the protest for more than an hour, and had never been invited to write on the installation.
The protesters partly took issue with the statements about Israel on display beside the art installation, which portrayed the nation as a place of tolerance and equality. One section, in particular, alleged that non-Jewish Israelis “enjoy equal rights and freedoms.” In fact, Israel has drawn criticism from minority voices internally, and from the international community for the systemic discrimination that many non-Jewish citizens face.
However, event organizer, Eva Chorna, objected to this characterization, saying, “To have that [statement] on the board I think is very representative of the essence that is Israel, because if there is one country that understands what it’s like to be a refugee, I think it’s Israel.”
“Israel isn’t a perfect society,” she continued, “as no society is, but there are so many instances where they try to be inclusive towards the Palestinians, towards the Israeli Arabs in society, towards all the different religions.”
However, protesters also took issue with the concept of the installation.
“The board itself resembles the Apartheid Wall that runs in the West Bank and restricts access to medical resources and water supplies of Palestinians that live there,” said Julie in her email to The Daily. “The idea of graffiti-ing the ‘canvas’ mocks and appropriates the forms of Palestinian resistance that appear on the Apartheid Wall.”
“Furthermore, the ‘graffiti’ displayed the word peace next to the Israeli flag alongside the Canadian flag as well as the McGill Martlet, which completely disregards the settler-colonial history tied to all three of these,” she continued.
She added that she “was asked to move multiple times.” She was also “asked to leave because they claimed this art (that resembled the Apartheid Wall with flags of Israel, Canada, and the McGill martlet) was not political.”

Future still holds potential for improvement 
On Monday, November 7, the Joint Board-Senate Committee on Equity (JBSCE) Subcommittee on Queer People hosted a forum in Thomson House basement to discuss the intersectional issues facing the LGBTQ community on campus, the current policies that affect the LGBTQ community, the ways in which these policies can be improved, and the resources available. Approximately 12 people were in attendance, a lower turnout than what was expected.
Divided into two parts, the forum heavily focused on integrated group discussion: the first part involved brainstorming about the issues that affect the LGBTQ community on campus. Recurring topics included the lack of centralized community, visibility of queer issues, diversity in curricula, and gender neutral washrooms on campus.
The issue of “deadnaming,” the act of referring to a transgender person’s birth name instead of their chosen name, was also identified as an institutional problem that McGill’s Information Technology (IT) Services imposes by not using preferred names on official transcripts and email addresses.
The issue of “deadnaming,” the act of referring to a transgender person’s birth name instead of their chosen name, was also identified as an institutional problem that McGill’s Information Technology (IT) Services imposes by not using preferred names on official transcripts and email addresses.
The second part of the forum discussed the initiatives that are being taken and can be taken to tackle the outlined issues, serve the diversity of the LGBTQ community, and foster solidarity and allyship on campus.
Measures that were discussed include those presently being undertaken at McGill, such as mandatory equity-based workshops and training for staff, faculty, and students. These include projects like the Safer Spaces workshops offered to all staff, faculty, and graduate students, and Rez Project, a mandatory peer-facilitated workshop for first-year undergraduates living in residence that focuses on sexuality, consent, and race.
The forum was facilitated by Lynn Kozak, the Chair of the JBSCE Subcommittee on Queer People.
Speaking of the importance of workshops and training, Kozak said in an email to The Daily that “so much discrimination comes out of ignorance rather than malice. Training can help people see that their words and actions might be hurting others, even unintentionally.”
Tynan Jarrett, the Equity Educational Advisor (LGBTTQ) of the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office, who was present at the forum, concurred.
“Workshops strive to provide not only awareness, but also skills and tools needed to support the creation of equitable and inclusive living, learning and working spaces here at McGill,” Jarrett told The Daily in an email.
“So much discrimination comes out of ignorance rather than malice. Training can help people see that their words and actions might be hurting others, even unintentionally.”
“They offer an opportunity for staff and faculty to engage around important issues that are impacting marginalized and underrepresented students, staff and faculty at McGill,” Jarrett added.
“SEDE’s role is to provide education and advising on equity-related topics to the entire McGill community, with a specific focus on staff and faculty,” Jarrett continued. “We help units apply an equity lens to their policies and practices, and we work with individual faculty members to help them integrate equity material and equitable practices into their curriculum and pedagogy.”
This lack of diversity is most likely symptomatic of a greater issue: the lack of engagement at McGill with issues that affect the LGBTQ community. The forum highlighted that McGill’s engagement with these issues should not only extend to the classroom, but into other campus spaces as well, such as libraries.
Michael David Miller, the Liaison Librarian for French Literature, Economics and LGBTQ+ Studies at the Humanities and Social Sciences Library, said in an email to The Daily that “librarians and staff of the library must continually accentuate the library as an inclusive place where everyone of all origins, genders, and sexualities are welcome to participate […] in conversations surrounding challenges facing LGBTQ+ communities in Quebec and abroad.”
“[Libraries can] build inclusive and diverse collections that represent the linguistic, cultural, gender and sexual diversity of our campus,” Miller elaborated.
Speaking about student engagement and allyship, Kozak told The Daily, “Community engagement around queer issues is crucial, first just because it’s so important for us to have a community, to get to share our experiences on campus with other people who might better understand us, and then to work together to improve those experiences overall at McGill.”

Panelists worry about future of journalism with Trump as president-elect
How deep does the abuse of police surveillance run, how can reporters protect themselves and their sources, and what does the future hold for the freedom of the press?
These questions were at the forefront of a panel called “L’Affaire Lagacé: A Free Press in The Surveillance State,” on Thursday, November 10, in response to the recent revelations that the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) had been using wiretaps on journalists.
These revelations came about after La Presse broke the story that the SPVM had been spying on one of their reporters, Patrick Lagacé. This quickly became a much larger scandal when it was revealed that warrants for journalists from other media outlets had also been issued.
Panelists at the event included former BBC reporter and executive director of the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec (FPJQ) Caroline Locher, Mark Bantey, a partner at the Gowling WLG law firm, Fabien Gélinas, a professor of Law at McGill, and Yann Pineau, the senior director of Continuous Improvement at La Presse.
The panel was moderated by Andrew Potter, former journalist and director of The McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC).
“I clued in when Lucinda Chodan, editor of the Montreal Gazette, along with Eric Trottier of La Presse and a couple other journalists, published an open letter basically calling this an outrage,” Potter told The Daily. “That was when I realized this was a problem I needed to pay attention to and I thought ‘somebody needs to do something’ and then I thought ‘hey wait, I have an institute whose job it is to convene these sort of things.’”
During the event, Locher said, “I have reported on many countries that do not have freedom of the press, countries you would call a police state, and what we saw here is in many ways close to a police state.”

In response to the wiretapping, the province of Quebec has launched a public inquiry, headed by a commission of experts on law and journalism. The panelists believe this will bring to light many of the answers needed to proceed.
“It is hard for us to make a judgement of the investigations without all of the facts,” Gélinas said to the room. “We don’t know what the police had put forward to the judges, and [the] provisions of the law under which the warrants were issued. There were multiple warrants issued by different judges, meaning there is reason to believe the judges did not know the depth of the situation.”

However, some attendees of the event were skeptical that the commission would bring about substantial change. Sharon Polsky, an attendee and president of the AMINA Corporation – which specializes in privacy and data protection, offered a more “realistic outlook,” in her words.
“Having grown up in Montreal, it is the current issue with police surveillance under questionable circumstances that leads me to believe that things have not changed much [since I moved to Toronto],” she said. “It has always been, in my experience, […] a vibrant city, but one where corruption exists and is deeply entrenched in every aspect of life here. I must wonder what positive outcome – what real change – might happen from a commission. They ask questions, there are inquiries, but nothing comes of it.”
Panel members also shared concerns about the future of journalism, and the potential negative ramifications of the 2016 U.S. presidential election on the profession.
“We don’t know what the police had put forward to the judges, and [the] provisions of the law under which the warrants were issued. There were multiple warrants issued by different judges, meaning there is reason to believe the judges did not know the depth of the situation.”
“In the past year, we’ve seen a presidential candidate that has attacked directly journalism, journalists, and media, and this is something that has never been seen before in the history of presidential elections,” said Locher. “He has threatened to sue journalists, put into question whether the laws that protect free press are even founded and good, and this person today [will be] the president of the United States.”
“It’s problematic because Donald Trump is the first presidential candidate to outright declare war on the media,” Potter added. “Going to war against the media rhetorically is a long standing political practice, John Diefenbaker who was Prime Minister back in the 1950s and 60s famously said ‘everyone is against me except for the people.’”
“However, it’s one thing to believe that the media has a bias against you, versus inciting violence against reporters,” he said.
The panelists found that the threat of police surveillance and infringement on freedom of the press continue to be important issues today, although many thought those days were over.
“We are in this business because we believe that somehow there is right and wrong, and somehow we can make things right by reporting on things that matter to society,” Pineau told the crowd. “We may be a bit naive, but we like to believe people do the best they can no matter what job they have, and we never would have thought that the police would be doing this to us.”

AMUSE welcomes senators and governors to talk about negotiations
On Wednesday, November 10, McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) and Senate met for its annual Joint Board-Senate Meeting (JBSM) at the University’s Faculty Club on McTavish Street. The meeting’s topic was “McGill’s sustainability plans and initiatives,” and featured presentations from three McGill professors.
“Our [sustainability mission] at McGill has three components: teaching/learning, research and service to society,” said Principal Suzanne Fortier in her introductory remarks, “and so for us, it is very important to offer on our campus, and in a variety of fields, not just environmental sciences, [the chance] to learn about sustainability, to teach about sustainability, and also to empower our students to bring that in their activities, not only while they’re at McGill, but after they leave our university.”
The presenters at the meeting were part of the McGill team that spoke at the last Annual Meeting of the New Champions of the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China. All three presentations focused on accessibility in each of their scientific subfields.
“Global agriculture is now being shaped by globalization,” said Graham MacDonald, an assistant professor in the department of Geography, whose talk focused on sustainable approaches in worldwide agricultural systems.
“This is the century of urbanization: by 2050, seventy per cent of wealth – nine billion people – will live in cities. Cities form a vast global network, connected by flows of people, energy, goods, and information,” said Andrew Gonzalez, Director of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences. “The challenge of this century is to make cities sustainable.”
“[In our research], we calculated boundaries for nine different earth systems, and together, those boundaries are defined by a safe operating space for humanity,” said Elena Bennett, a professor in the Natural Resource Sciences department at McGill, in reference to the different ‘spheres’ of Earth, such as atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, and humans’ effects on these spheres.
She focused largely on the intersection between humans’ social systems and sustainability. “If [humans] stay inside those boundaries, those critical systems are most likely to stay in the safer state,” she said.
While the night’s conversations may have revolved around McGill’s role in sustainability initiatives, no mention was made about McGill’s investments in fossil fuels, a subject that has caused controversy on campus in the past. Last year, the BoG’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) released a report which claimed that climate change did not cause “grave social injury,” and therefore divestment from fossil fuels was unwarranted.
For the first time last month, the BoG prematurely adjourned a meeting so they would not have to listen to members of Divest McGill who showed up to shed light on the recent open forums on sustainability.
Once again, the Board seemed unwilling to actively discuss environmental sustainability. Speaking to The Daily, one of the evening’s participants, who chose to remain anonymous out of fear of repercussions, said that a member of his table called the whole discussion of the night “esoteric nonsense,” refusing to acknowledge McGill’s role in issues of sustainability.
AMUSE at the JBSM
Prior to the start of the JBSM, senators and governors were welcomed by members of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) at the Faculty Club’s entrance.
AMUSE, 85 per cent of whose membership consists of student employees on campus, has been working since May to negotiate its second collective agreement with the University. The union commenced a five-day strike on October 28, when they felt that the administration was not willing to compromise. On November 10, the union re-initiated bargaining discussions with the University.
“I just came out of a bargaining session,” said Heather Holdsworth, a member of AMUSE and its bargaining team in negotiations with the administration, “and we’re hoping to increase pressure and awareness among upper administration and power holders at McGill to support and push for our bargaining priorities.”
Having listened to AMUSE members, McGill doesn’t seem to have come anywhere near their demands in recent negotiations.
“We know that the Joint Board Senate meeting is a space [where] people can advocate on our behalf and push HR [Human Resources] to widen their mandate in order for them to meet some of our bargaining priorities,” she concluded.

“Palestine and Feminist Paradigms” lecture critiques feminist canon 
On Thursday, November 10, approximately eighty people gathered in Morrice Hall 017 for a lecture by Rabab Abdulhadi, professor of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University (SFSU).
Adulhadi’s lecture, “Revising the Narrative, Critiquing the Canon: Palestine and Feminist Paradigms,” challenged the homogenization and dehumanization of Arab men and women in the women’s studies canon. Her lecture also contested feminist paradigms that subscribe to the colonial mission of “saving brown women from brown men” and fail to acknowledge the agency and voice of Palestinian women.
Abdulhadi began her talk by discussing instances when Palestinian women’s voices and agency were overlooked or misunderstood by women who have more power. For example, she spoke about a self-avowed feminist fashion house that staged a photo shoot for its summer catalogue in front of the Israeli-West Bank Separation wall in 2004, with the supposed aim of jarring the Israeli state with this image of suffering and despair. Abdulhadi shared a story wherein a chief executive of the company, an Israeli woman, is asked by Umm Muhammad, a Palestinian woman passing by, to join her at a sit-in and call for the wall to be torn down, instead of using the Palestinian’s suffering as a backdrop for her photoshoot. The Israeli woman disregards this invite and says of Umm Muhammad, “She’s too full of hurt, she cannot listen.”
Abdulhadi challenged the audience to question which of these women would be acknowledged as a feminist in the mainstream women studies canon – the “self-avowed feminist” or “the woman who invites those who colonized her land and her life to join her sit-in.”
“Sisterhood is neither powerful, nor global, if it is not on the basis of principled solidarity,” Abdulhadi said, emphasizing multiple times that what matters in any social justice movement is “the indivisibility of justice,” making issues of gender equality, queer rights, and the liberation of Palestine part of the same project.
Abdulhadi also spoke optimistically in her lecture about an increasing show of solidarity from Jewish communities for the Palestinian liberation movement. She explained that, historically, Zionism has always been “a contested narrative” in Jewish communities around the world.
“Sisterhood is neither powerful, nor global, if it is not on the basis of principled solidarity.”
“The Zionist settler-colonial project in Palestine, which claims to speak for the Jews, actually does not,” she said, “and increasingly today, more and more Jews are coming out and saying, ‘not in my name.’”
“I thought [Abdulhadi’s] recognition of anti-Zionist Jewish voices in her talk was really important,” said Anna Ty, a U3 Anthropology and Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies student who attended the lecture, in an interview with The Daily.
For Abdulhadi, critiquing hegemonic narratives is essential to academic work. In an interview with The Daily, she explained that activists in academia who are “speaking truth to power” are doing their job.
However, because of her scholarship and activism, Abdulhadi has been the target of fear tactics and attacks by Zionist groups, like Canary Mission and Campus Watch, for several years. Canary Mission and Campus Watch are websites that profile and personally target activists working for justice in Palestine.
“I thought [Abdulhadi’s] recognition of anti-Zionist Jewish voices in her talk was really important.”
Posters featuring cartoon portraits of Abdulhadi were posted around the SFSU campus earlier this year, targeting her with defamatory charges.
“They want to scare us out of business,” Abdulhadi told The Daily, describing the coordinated attacks of such groups as “cyberbullying” and “incitement of violence.”
“Justice for Palestine is not just a project for the Palestinians,” she told the audience. “Justice for Palestine is a project for everybody who seeks justice.”
A U3 Economics student in attendance, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily that this was what they found to be the most interesting part of the lecture. “The thing that stood out to me the most was her idea [of] how you can’t really separate the different issues within the anti-colonial struggle,” the student said.
“Justice for Palestine is a project for everybody who seeks justice.”
Abdulhadi concluded her lecture on this note as well, by explaining that Israel’s settler-colonial project implicates not just Israelis and Palestinians, but rather “every single person who lives anywhere in the world whose [government’s] policies are making it possible for Israel to continue oppressing Palestinians, to continue stealing land.”
“Everybody is invested in either being part of the problem, or in being part of the solution. And that goes for every struggle, not just for Palestine,” Abdulhadi concluded.
