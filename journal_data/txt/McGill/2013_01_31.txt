The Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) called on McGill to withdraw parts of a motion filed by the University which would grant McGill the authority to deny Access to Information (ATI) requests submitted by McGill students.  
The University filed a motion on December 7 to the provincial body that oversees ATIs, the Commission d’accès à l’information, seeking to exempt itself from fulfilling ATIs filed by 14 respondents. The motion also asks for authorization to deny  future requests submitted by any McGill student.
The student society’s motion, passed by its executive committee, asks McGill to “acknowledge that any McGill student shouldn’t be prohibited from submitting ATIs based on previous requests from other students.” 
PGSS External Affairs Officer Errol Salamon proposed the motion after seeing a lack of responses from different campus groups regarding this issue.
“I thought it would be important for PGSS to take a stance, particularly because I’ve been working on a project regarding industry and university research partnerships. And if it goes through, if the motion passes, it would limit the extent to which PGSS would be able to gather information for research,” Salamon told The Daily.
SSMU is in the process of dealing with the issue internally and has yet to issue a formal, public response, according to President Josh Redel.
Two of the respondents named in McGill’s motion are SSMU executives.
While PGSS denounced specific clauses in the motion regarding the University’s request to dismiss ATIs, it did not condemn the motion as a whole, due to a lack of consensus within the executive committee.
“From my perspective, I wanted PGSS to be able to denounce the entire motion, but, it was amended to…particular issues that everyone in the executive could agree to,” Salamon said.
Salamon told The Daily that he would try to get other associations on campus involved before determining a further course of action.

ASTT(e)Q asks shelters to debunk essentialized ideas of gender
Many homeless people were left vulnerable last week, as excruciatingly cold temperatures and a harsh wind chill hit Montreal. Many trans* people were left out in the cold, as they were rejected from homeless shelters. These shelters have been denounced by a prominent trans* rights group.
The Action Santé Travesti(e)s et Transsexuel(le)s du Quebec (ASTT(e)Q), released a statement last week on the increasingly dismal prospects of trans* people accessing shelters in Montreal. According to the statement, CACTUS Montreal, ASTT(e)Q’s parent organization, “witnessed several of [their] members … denied shelter on the grounds of being trans*.”
This has been particularly the case in night shelters, where government-issued identification is required in order to gain access to services. In women’s shelters, gender is verified when examining these IDs.
“This becomes problematic when your presented identity is different from your legal one,” explains Gabrielle Bouchard, Centre 2110’s Peer Support and Advocacy coordinator. “In women’s shelters, if you don’t look the part, then questions are asked. These questions can be fundamentally discriminatory.” 
The ASTT(e)Q reports that women’s shelters require trans* people to have undergone sex reassignment surgery in order to obtain matching gender identification.
“That F on your ID is hard to obtain. Sex reassignment surgery modifies one’s body forever, in a very significant way. Much authorization from a variety of people is needed in this process to confirm trans* identity prior to an operation taking place. If you are homeless this becomes near impossible,” Bouchard told The Daily.
Nora Butler Burke, program coordinator at ASTT(e)Q, also notes the role poverty plays in legal gender assignment.
“There are particular ways that low income trans* women encounter being denied to all sorts of essential services from health care to legal documents. There is lack of access to proper support for people transitioning and a lot around the process is not ensured until people are wealthier or privileged. Class and economic status create vulnerability on an individual level,” Burke told The Daily.
Burke explained that not all shelters are perpetrators of such inaccessibility. Day shelters do not typically require extensive documentation. Some night shelters make conscious efforts to be inclusive and accessible. 
Matthew Pearce, the director general of the Old Mission Brewery, stated that trans* people are not excluded. The Brewery “regularly hosts trans* [people], particularly in our women’s pavilion,” Pearce said. 
Burke, however, is not entirely convinced this is enough.
“Discrimination still takes place within the shelters even if accepted. Trans* women entering shelters still have a hard time because of different discriminatory attitudes. Shelters don’t often do work on educating and raising awareness of different people within the space and different issues such as ableism, racism, et cetera,” Burke said.
 Burke argues that this exclusivity comes from “a certain brand of feminism that is not able to understand trans* women as women, and that’s something important to talk about fighting essentialist ideas of what is woman.” 
“Legislation is used to legitimize this logic and so we often see shelters replicating the same barriers and exclusions that are directly out of state regulations, which reproduce certain components of social violence. Those who don’t fit properly within gender norms still face many forms of social violence,” Burke added.
To make shelters more accessible, Bouchard believes that myths of trans* women being dangerous or making others uncomfortable have to be debunked. To do this, Bouchard believes that shelters and those using the services should be educated on the topic.

Government set stage for indexation to inflation
Despite plans to hold a summit on higher education next month, the Quebec government reiterated its support this week for a tuition hike of between $46 to $83 per year. The amount would vary depending on whether a rise in household disposable income and an increase in operational costs are considered, according to a plan submitted by economist Pierre Fortin at a preliminary meeting in December.  
Government officials have been touting the summit as a way of building consensus about university funding and management. 
Pierre Duchesne, the Quebec minister of higher education, called free education “unfeasible” and said on Tuesday that the notion of a tuition freeze needed to be “defined.” The remark comes a month after Fortin described indexation to inflation as a “tuition freeze in every practical sense.” 
In an interview with The Daily, Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) President Martine Desjardins said in French that the “game was still not set.” 
“We still have a lot of time to make sure the government understands that a tuition freeze is the only measure that can ensure accessibility,” she said. “Most of the actors [at the summit] are against indexation, and the consensus seems to be against that proposition.” 
On Wednesday, the Coalition opposée à la tarification et à la privatisation des services publics – an organization composed of unions and community groups – held a demonstration in downtown Montreal against some of the government’s austerity measures, including the proposed tuition hike. 
“It was clear in December after the [government] budget was submitted that we weren’t talking about a tuition freeze anymore, but of indexation,” André Frappier, president and co-spokesperson of progressive provincial party Québec solidaire, told The Daily in French. “At every level, [the government] is taking steps away from the promises it made.” 
“The summit will be used to let off some steam, but I don’t think it will come up with solutions comparable to the mobilization we saw last year. It’s also written in the budget; it cannot be anything else but indexation,” he added.
Another provincial party has suggested a much more significant hike. François Legault, the leader of the Coalition avenir Québec (CAQ), said on Monday that a select group of universities, such as McGill and the Université de Montréal, should be able to determine tuition unilaterally. 
“It’s important to protect accessibility, but we have to be able to tell the truth in Quebec,” he told reporters in French at a press conference in Quebec City. “Right now, some universities don’t have the means to attract the best researchers. It’s obvious that the Université de Montréal doesn’t have the same resources as the University of Toronto, all proportions considered.” 
According to his plan, students at other universities would have to pay between 15 and 20 per cent of the cost of their education. The price for studying medicine, for example, would thus be higher than for an Arts degree. 
“It is obvious that Legault doesn’t understand the system and is applying principles which aren’t relevant to the university system,” Desjardins said. “We’ve invited him on a number of occasions to the summit and he has never proposed anything to solve the problems we face.” 
Quebec’s summit on higher education is slated to begin on February 26.

Administration targets campus activist hub Café Aquin 
Flanked by three security guards, approximately 200 Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) students stormed through the halls of UQAM’s DeSève, Thérèse-Casgrain, and Aquin buildings on Wednesday.
The protesters, who gathered in the agora of the Judith Jasmin building on Ste. Catherine at 12:30 p.m., voiced their discontent over new security protocols recently established by the UQAM administration.
The new security measures, slated to cost UQAM more than $300,000   over the next two years, included the installation of 15 cameras on the walls and ceiling around Café Aquin, a cafe co-run by the science and law (AFESPED), and the social science (AFESH) associations at UQAM. The university has already spent $300,000 over the last four years on similar security measures.
Café Aquin was a centre for mobilization during the student strikes of last year. It was abruptly closed on December 20 when the UQAM administration announced that the entire area had to be walled-off as strong acids were being used to remove graffiti. They also announced that AFESH would foot the $50,000 bill. The cafe reopened yesterday after several rounds of negotiations with the administration.
The walled-off area also included the meeting spaces allotted to the handicapped student’s association, the student-parent support network, the social science, and political science associations.
Without informing students, the UQAM administration also installed 15 surveillance cameras in the area. 
“They put surveillance cameras everywhere, there isn’t a way to walk around the university without being filmed,” Annie, a student at UQAM who didn’t want to give her last name, told The Daily in French. 
“Today we are here to oppose the fact that they installed these cameras. Also to denounce the fact that there are 16 employees that haven’t been paid since the closure,” Annie said. 
Cafe employees were only given 24 hours’ notice before the cafe was closed. These employees have not been compensated for their lost hours. According to Annie, the administration told AFESPED and AFESH that they would have to cover employees’ salaries for this period themselves.
“The administration is putting in place controls of the spaces we meet. They saw what happens when we get together; it allows us to resist,” Annie said in French through a megaphone to the assembling crowd. 
Protesters who were not masked were handed beige scarves to cover their faces. Moving toward the student services office, demonstrators threw confetti into the air and blew air horns. 
The anger over the installation of cameras was made evident as the protest reached the Henri-Aquin building when several protesters brought out hammers, smashing two wall-mounted cameras. One camera was ripped from the ceiling. Several other cameras were spray-painted with red and green paint.
One protester broke through one of the walls around Café Aquin, as demonstrators around him evaded the debris. 
The protest dissipated quickly as people announced that more security guards were on the way.
The UQAM administration did not return calls from The Daily by press time.

The Society of Undergraduate Mathematics Students (SUMS) held a discussion on Wednesday about the under-representation of women in mathematics at McGill.
Women make up almost 60 per cent of McGill’s overall undergraduate population; however, the math department estimates that between one-third and one-half of math majors are female. 
SUMS President Catherine Hilgers told The Daily that she was more concerned with the low number of female honours students. According to Hilgers, between 10 and 15 per cent of honours math students are female. 
Hilgers also pointed out that of the Math department’s 37 professors, only one is female. 
In an interview with The Daily, Math Departmental Chair Jacques Hurtubise said that the department was “working on” hiring more women.
“There is a desire to get more women [into the department],” he told The Daily. “There’s a policy in the faculty, which we entirely support, to interview at least one woman for every opening. We’re actually in the process of hiring a second woman right now.”
At Wednesday’s meeting, Colleen Alkalay-Moulihan, an honours student in Applied Mathematics, spoke about having felt marginalized as a female, by her peers and certain professors.
“Someone once told me that it’ll be easier for me to get into graduate school because I’m a girl,” she said. “My second year I had a rude professor – my male friends didn’t notice, but his attitude affected me. I felt like he treated the male students like peers, and me like an idiot.”
“We should identify the environmental factors that make [the Math program] unfriendly to women, and figure out how to change them,” Michael Snarski, an honours Math student, explained during the meeting. “Confidence is key to being in math – if you don’t believe you can solve a problem, you won’t solve it.” 
Students at the meeting underlined a number of areas the department could work on.
“We’re going to suggest that the department work to increase the number of women in math, increase the sense of community, and increase the number of female mathematicians hired,” Hilgers said.

Conflict over cause of smaller leak 
More than a quarter of the McTavish reservoir’s contents gushed through campus into downtown Montreal between 4 p.m. Monday and 2 a.m. Wednesday, when an 88-year-old water main gave way during construction near the intersection of Pine and Doctor Penfield.
The cause of the break has yet to be determined, according to city spokesperson Valérie De Gagné, who said that an excavation of the pipe would be underway soon to determine the cause.
A majority of the water’s flow had abetted by 7 p.m. on Monday, but water continued to pour down University until late Tuesday night. At the time, McGill and two city officials gave three contradicting reports to press about the source of the continued flooding. The school reported a second break in an 8-inch pipe, one city official reported to the Montreal Gazette a second break in a 54-inch water main, and another told The Daily that all the valves to the first break had not yet been shut off.
“It seems that they were all sort of right,” according to Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet. “What we had was the equivalent of an 8-inch water main coming out of that first break.”
The aftermath
The school is now scrambling to relocate classes and offices, continue de-icing main passageways, and de-humidify buildings. The University has barely begun the process of calculating the costs of repairs and contingency measures, according to Sweet, since many of them have yet to be incurred.
The University has contracted the services of Première-Action, a disaster restoration company, to help clean up buildings, but McGill’s own grounds services are doing most of the outside work salting and de-icing affected areas.
The James Annex, which is attached to the James Administration building and houses the University’s graphics department, seems to have been hit the hardest. The Annex sits on the slope that faces the reservoir, and a window at ground level broke during the flood, inundating the offices inside. It will not reopen for “weeks, perhaps months” according to Sweet.
The Wong building and 3435 University, which houses the School of Environment, also incurred significant damage. The administration  is unsure of when the buildings will be reopened.
Some of the school’s archived administrative records were damaged – as they were during a September 2011 flood – when Service Point experienced some flooding, and have been sent to freeze-drying facilities for restoration.
At the McLennan library, “the basement experienced some flooding, but the flooding was not extensive,” said Sabrina Hanna, the library system’s media relations officer, in an email to The Daily. Most of the library’s collection has been moved to different floors until the necessary repairs are conducted, she added.
Other affected buildings include Leacock, Macdonald, McConnell, and the James Administration building, although no further classes have been cancelled, and the buildings are expected to be fully operational within the next few days.
