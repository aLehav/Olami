McGill students must educate themselves on racial discrimination
On November 9th, QPIRG McGill hosted an “Anti-Racism 101” workshop as part of their Culture Shock event series. The series ran from November 7th to November 12th and dealt with issues such as anti-racism, migrant justice, and Indigenous solidarity. The anti-racism workshop was moderated by Vincent Mousseau, a community organizer and activist for groups such as Montreal Noir, Pervers/Cité, and RÉZO. Mousseau is currently studying Social Work at McGill.
The workshop began with a discussion about the difference between racial discrimination and racism. Mousseau defined racial discrimination as “discrimination based on aspects such as race and skin colour, which is a manifestation of prejudice.” They noted that “prejudice is the idea, and discrimination is acting upon that idea.” They also stressed that “anyone can be discriminatory towards anyone of any other group; [however], racism is understood as the systemic institutionalization of these prejudices. This is present everywhere…I live in fear of my life and I think of these things consistently.”
Mousseau continued by discussing their own experiences with racism, citing one of their first experiences at McGill. “When I got to McGill the first thing I did was buy a McGill lanyard, a McGill hoodie, and I kept my student card in the front of my wallet.”
“The reason for this is I have not worn a hoodie since Trayvon Martin died. I am terrified of what any interaction with the Montreal police can look like for me in this way. And I know that, as unfortunate as it is…it is more unacceptable to kill a McGill student than it is to kill a Black person.”
“As unfortunate as it is…it is more unacceptable to kill a McGill student than it is to kill a Black person.”
Mousseau discussed Indigenous residential schools as an example of racialized violence. “As Sir John A. MacDonald…said, this was the attempt to ‘kill the Indian in the child.’” Mousseau also spoke of the Sixties Scoop, “where social workers actively targeted Indigenous communities, found the smallest reason to pull children from their homes, and adopted them into white families.”
“A person that I adore and respect, Nakuset, who is the Executive Director of the Native Women’s Shelter in Montreal, was taken from her community and adopted into a Jewish family in Montreal and was told that she was brown because she was from Israel. That’s the reality of her life. She had to go through trying to understand that and go through these aspects of racialization.”
“We are on stolen land…the reason why we are here as settlers, irrespective of our issues of racialization, is because of the inherent violence that was committed against Indigenous populations, this act of cultural genocide being one of them.”

When asked about systemic racism at McGill, Mousseau talked about the SSMU building closure and the effect that it is having on student groups. For example, the Muslim Students’ Association will no longer have a space to pray. “When SSMU tells folks, ‘Oh, oops, surprise! Your building is being shut down,’ [and] there is a prayer space so many students on our campus rely on [that is] being taken away from them, that’s an issue.”
Mousseau also talked about the importance of SSMU as a space for marginalized groups to organize. “[Soon] there [will] no longer [be a] specific hub [for] Black queer [people]. [Right now] you can walk between Queer McGill and the Black Student Network in order to try to organize something. That is a barrier to making sure that our services are represented. This is just an example of some of the violence that exists against racialized folks at McGill. It’s often times coming from a place like ‘we didn’t even think about it that way.’”
“I try to give this workshop in order to try to raise consciousness on these issues and try to force people trying to organizing on campus to think more about the [role] racism plays in their organizing.”
An anonymous participant added to the conversation, “You need to call out your white friends for their racism. Direct them to specific resources. Educate yourself. You can not surround yourself with people of colour for the sole purpose of having them educate you. Do your own educating.”

On Tuesday, November 7, a number of general elections took place in select areas of the U.S., spanning across states and levels of government. These elections resulted in a number of historic victories for Democratic party nominees, many of whom are members of the LGBTQ+ community and are visible minorities. This is in stark contrast to the results of last year’s presidential election, the anniversary of which was last week. Notable victories from Tuesday’s races include several from Virginia. Danica Roem is the first openly transgender person to hold a seat in any American state legislature; she follows in the footsteps of transgender representative Althea Garrison, who lost her Massachusetts seat after being outed as transgender in the 1990s. Roem’s victory also unseated the republican incumbent responsible for Virginia’s iteration of a “bathroom bill”. Virginia also saw the election of Hala Ayala and Elizabeth Guzman, the first Latina lawmakers in the state, as well as Kathy Tran, the first Asian-American lawmaker in the state, and the election of Justin Fairfax marked the second time that a Black person was elected to the position of Lieutenant Governor in Virginia. Elsewhere, Seattle elected its first openly gay mayor, and its first female mayor since 1920, Jenny Durkan. Hoboken, New Jersey elected its first Sikh mayor, Ravinder Bhalla. St Paul, Minnesota elected its first Black mayor, Melvin Carter III, while Minneapolis elected Andrea Jenkins, the first openly transgender person of colour being elected to public office in the United States. She will now serve as a city councillor for the city. This dramatic increase in support for the Democratic party, if continuous, could result in the house of representatives shedding Republican control in the 2018 midterm elections.
Since declaring their independence in regional parliament on October 27, the Catalonian government has been struggling to bring this declaration to fruition. The government of Catalonia was dissipated by the Mariano Rajoy’s Spanish government after declaring its independence. A constitutional court ruled the declaration of independence “unconstitutional and void.” The Spanish government has called a snap regional election for December 21 while several former leaders of Catalonia are currently hiding in Belgium, or are incarcerated. Among those are deposed Catalonian president, Carles Puigdemont, and four other prominent politicians. A Spanish request for an European Union arrest warrant on these officials is pending approval. This past Wednesday in Spain saw massive pro-independence strikes occupy over sixty roads in the Catalonia region, with many routes to Barcelona being interrupted. A warning against travelling by car was the only advice given to the Catalonian people from its Ministry of Transport. Spain’s foreign minister has also put forward the idea that Spain may adopt constitutional changes to make way for regional referendums on independence. However, in the foreign minister’s referendum model, all 47 million of Spain’s citizens would be able to vote on one region’s bid for independency. The minister, Alfonso Dastis, in his remarks to the BBC said, “We acknowledge there is a political situation that deserves to be looked at but, in any case, it’s clear that the decision will be taken, will have to be taken by all Spaniards.”
