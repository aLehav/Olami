This year’s autumn elections saw all three referendum questions passed with over 50 per cent voter support, according to the preliminary results. Voter turnout was at 12.6 per cent. Post-grads voted to pay a $0.75 per semester fee for the McGill Tribune, making them members of the Tribune Publications Society. Other questions included a levy of the McGill Writing Centre fee to $1.50 per semester in order to prevent the termination of one-on-one tutorial services for graduate students, and making the student services fee for post-doctoral fellows non-opt-outable. For a breakdown of the results, see infographics.
