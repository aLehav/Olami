University threatens expulsion, citing violation of Ontario human rights code
Two protests and a letter campaign followed an early February decision by Carleton University’s Equity Services to ban a poster depicting an Israeli aircraft firing a missile at a Palestinian child holding a teddy bear.
The Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) Carleton chapter – who circulated their organization’s poster to promote Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) – were not informed of the ban until they realized all 100 copies had been taken down, according to Jessica Carpinone, a member of SAIA Carleton and the student who dealt with the administration on the issue.
SAIA quickly emailed Equity Services, demanding an explanation for the ban. Equity Services emailed an official statement, claiming that the poster infringed on Ontario’s Human Rights Code and Carleton’s Human Rights policies. The email also suggested that the posters could incite violence and fear on Carleton’s campus.
“Equity Services made their decision about the International IAW posters without giving SAIA any opportunity to discuss the event it was sponsoring or defend the graphic it depicted,” Carpinone said.
The SAIA later organised a protest, pressuring the administration to lift the ban and challenging their decision.
“We took it upon ourselves to tell students what the administration was up to,” Carpinone said.
About 80 Carleton students protested outside the administration offices, shouting, “Shame on you, lift the ban, stop campus repression.” About 40 others protested at Ottawa University, where the same poster was banned.
On February 12, Carleton’s Interim Provost and Vice-President  Feridun Hamdullahpur sent a letter to the university’s community stating that the poster was “received by many as hurtful and discriminatory to some students on campus.” He hoped campus would “remain an entirely respectful one.”
Carpinone felt the letter was threatening since it also stated that students who infringe on Carleton’s Human Rights Policy face expulsion.
“[SAIA isn’t] creating the climate of fear,” Carpinone stated, “If people are offended by the truth, they should be doing something to change the truth.”
Following SAIA’s call for “letters of support,” 200 statements from the Carleton community landed in the Equity Services Office. The university’s president, Roseann O’Reilly Runte, issued a response following the barrage of letters, reiterating that the poster “did not have the necessary approval for posting and could incite infringements of the Ontario Human Rights Code.”
Runte felt the posters did not contain specific enough information on events planned at Carleton – a statement contested by the SAIA – and stressed that they were not banning IAW events. She suggested the SAIA submit alternative posters for approval – as long as they met the Carleton Human Rights Code
The ban had both positive and negative effects on the SAIA Carleton chapter, according to Carpinone, who said that while the conflict drew attention to IAW, it also forced the organization to redirect its efforts away from planning the week’s events.

Flash mob raises awareness without moving a muscle
Roughly two dozen students froze in place Wednesday afternoon on the McLennan-Redpath walkway to promote the Fine Arts Council’s Nuit Blanche.
At approximately 12:28 p.m., each member of the “flash mob” struck a pose with a Nuit Blanche sign for four minutes. Passersby were forced to thread their way through the frozen students, many of them pausing to stare at the impromptu wax museum.
“It’s freaking me out,” said John Paul Tasker, U0 Arts, who was eating lunch on the Redpath ledge when the mob materialized. “I feel like I’m at a funeral.”
“I like it,” chimed in Alanna Marcellus, U0 Education. “But I think they need more people to get a real effect.”
Participants adopted various poses with their signs. Some students were content to act as human signposts; others pretended to freeze mid-conversation, while reading textbooks or magazines, or, in one girl’s case, halfway through an apple. All held their positions, no matter how closely passersby examined them.
“People came right up to my face,” recalled mobber and Nuit Blanche coordinator Amelie Dinh, who laughed and added, “Time passes slowly when you’re frozen.”
Celeste Pang, who gave the flash mob its starting and ending cues, was enthusiastic about this novel method of promoting Nuit Blanche’s second year.
“We’ve been putting up posters and flyers,” said Pang, “but this is a really cool way to publicize.”
Publicity stunts like the flash mob, that depend on a critical mass of participants and the element of surprise, have become more popular in recent years with the advent of streaming online video and Youtube extending their reach beyond passersby.
Although Dinh has previously participated in similar events in the Montreal and Toronto areas, including flash dance mobs and subway parties, this was her first time organizing such an event and she was pleased with the outcome.
“Everyone involved had fun. We were hoping for more traffic, but we obviously can’t control that.”
The mob was organized in February via a secret Facebook event and relied on invited friends and word of mouth to assemble. “We were expecting more participants,” Dinh said, “but something like this only appeals to certain people.”
Lack of traffic and participants notwithstanding, Pang was proud of the amount of people who spent part of their afternoon standing rigid in the cold. While the Fine Arts Council is far from abandoning traditional poster-and-flyer methods of advertising, Pang was optimistic about the future of such alternative publicity methods.
Dinh agreed, adding that such publicity stunts and Nuit Blanche’s flash mob make passersby rethink the way we use public spaces.
“It’s art in and of itself, which is the whole point of Nuit Blanche.”

Judge removes most of the strict conditions against him, Montrealer doesn’t pose a danger
The Federal Court has loosened its noose around Montreal French teacher Adil Charkaoui February 20, when Judge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer abolished the majority of the restrictive conditions placed on him and his family upon his release from prison four years ago.
Some of the basic freedoms restored to Charkaoui include the following: his parents need no longer accompany him whenever he leaves the house; he is now free to use the Internet, cell phones, and fax machines; he no longer has a curfew; and he is permitted to leave the Island of Montreal.
Despite these changes, Charkaoui is still required to wear a GPS tracking bracelet whenever he leaves the house.
Mary Foster, a member of the Coalition Justice for Adil Charkaoui, said the ruling has given the Charkaoui family a great sense of relief.
“They can have a much more normal life; it means they can go outside the home without always being together,” Foster said.
The ruling comes after months of public trials during which Charkaoui’s lawyers presented half a dozen witnesses and argued for the abolition of the conditions.
While Charkaoui’s lawyer, Johanne Doyon, recognized the significance of the ruling on her client’s day-to-day life, she emphasized that it did not deal with the fundamental problems in Charkaoui’s case – specifically that Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) agents destroyed original evidence and operational notes in Charkaoui’s file.
“Through the cross-examination of two witnesses, we established that [CSIS] did destroy evidence,” Doyon said.
Knowing this, Doyon explained, the defence was in a position to stop the proceedings altogether, something the judge’s ruling failed to address.
In Tremblay-Lamer’s decision, however, the judge wrote that the evidence before her does not indicate that Charkaoui poses a threat or danger to others, nor that he is likely to commit criminal actions.
Throughout the public hearings leading up to the decision, the government’s lawyers failed to present a single witness and presented no evidence dated from 2000 onward. Instead, they largely relied on the same information included in a public summary of Charkaoui’s file released in February 2008.
In her report, Tremblay-Lamer also responded to CSIS Assistant Director of Intelligence Ted Flanigan’s testimony that Charkaoui was not a sleeper agent, but “fit the profile” of one.
“If (Charkaoui) had had the profile of a sleeper agent nine years ago, it is obvious that it could no longer be the same today in light of the publicity surrounding his case,” Tremblay-Lamer wrote.
Charkaoui, a PhD student and father of three, spent nearly two years in prison without charge after being named under a security certificate in 2003. Security certificates, which fall under federal immigration law, apply only to non-citizens, allowing the government to detain them indefinitely using secret trials and evidence under threat of deportation.
In February 2007, the Supreme Court ruled security certificates unconstitutional, but postponed the effect of their ruling by one year. The Conservatives tabled the new security certificate legislation, Bill C-3, in October 2007, and two months later the Canadian Bar Association stated that it considered the new legislation – which added the provision of a “special advocate” and addressed minor problems in the first law – unconstitutional.
A year after the Supreme Court’s decision in Charkaoui’s favour, C-3 became law. In November 2008, the Quebec Bar Association was permitted to intervene in the unconstitutionality of C-3, and has since released detailed arguments against C-3.
In light of these objections to security certificate legislation and the two-tiered system of justice it entails, Foster said Charkaoui’s case raises broader social questions for Canadians.
“I think it’s a question of how we want to see the rights of everyone in this country,” Foster said.
“It’s a question about racism, what it means to be a member of society, how that’s sanctioned under law, how rights are protected – formally and informally. Those are the fundamental questions behind this.”
The public hearings resume next Tuesday and Wednesday, March 10 and 11, at 9:30 a.m. at the Federal Court, 30 McGill St., in Old Montreal.

Robert Fisk challenged Canada’s involvement in Afghanistan and the Middle East
Acclaimed journalist Robert Fisk’s writing confronts the reality of war in the Middle East head-on. Now, as the situation in the region is becoming increasingly dangerous, Fisk practices what he calls “mouse journalism.” He often only has 20 safe seconds to observe the chaos and bodies between bombs.
At a sold-out lecture at Concordia University on February 19, Fisk argued that journalists must go beyond impartiality when reporting on conflict – a rule which he believes should apply only to football matches.
“Whether it is the slave trade or Nazi extermination camps, we must talk about the dead and the survivors. If you see any atrocity you should be revolted by it,” stated Fisk.
Fisk has built a reputation as one of the most honest and authoritative voices on the Middle East in media today, with 30 years of experience living and working in the region as a foreign correspondent for The Independent. Thursday’s lecture, “Canada and the Middle East Wars,” discussed the role of media in wartime and the deteriorating quality of Canadian coverage.
Fisk criticized the National Post’s coverage of the conflict, which called the Israeli offensive an “effective” and “surgical” maneuver and described the opposition as “crying” that Israel’s actions were an unequal response. He also questioned how news media could remain impartial when the death count was utterly disproportionate.
According to Fisk, the Globe and Mail’s coverage drew overly sensationalized parallels between the Middle East and Canada to drive the conflict home. The newspaper compared Israel’s situation with fictional scenarios of militants in Richmond, B.C launching rockets at Vancouver, and militants in Outremont firing rockets onto Montreal street corners.
While Fisk jokingly asked the audience whether there was something unusual about Outremont, something that he didn’t know about Montreal,  he used this example to question what is now considered acceptable reporting.
“When you have people making such statements, it is just childishness. These are simple arguments, and simple arguments are easy to repeat. And that this same wording appeared in newspapers across Canada, surely someone is pushing the button,” Fisk said in an interview with The Daily.
Fisk’s demand for critical and honest reporting resonated deeply with many audience members.
“If you want to have credibility on these issues you need to report the ugly truth,” commented Christina Xydous, a Montreal resident. “What Fisk brought home in this lecture is the idea that there are no sacred cows. We need to ask the tough questions. There can be no other loyalties beside a loyalty to the truth and to those who suffer.”
A representative from Echec a la Guerre Montreal who introduced Fisk placed the lecture in a Canadian context, “We’ve been at war for seven years. We have not seen images of war, who Canadians are aiming at, and there are no interviews with the victims. We don’t hear any true war stories in our country.”
Even stories of Canadian soldiers are no longer considered newsworthy. “We don’t even see photographs of Canadians being buried,” Fisk said. “I was on a plane to Ottawa when the first Canadian woman soldier was killed. When she was buried at the military cemetery the story was on page six when it should have been on page one.”
With Canada’s engagement in Afghanistan, however, set to continue until at least 2011, Fisk said Canadians and their journalists need to start asking the questions that count.
“Did you know that there was a famine in Afghanistan? Instead of 7,000 more troops we need 7,000 more doctors?,” he asked. “Why is the army in Afghanistan? My experience when there has been a war that has been going on for awhile is that people forget why they are fighting it. Nobody remembers why we invaded Iraq. Nobody remembers why we are in Afghanistan. How long can we keep doing this?
“You don’t see what I see. If you saw what I saw in Iraq and Afghanistan you would not support military engagement anywhere.”
In fact, Fisk asserts that Western military engagement must come to an end. “These countries do not belong to us. We should leave. People ask for justice that we do not intend to give them. No more soldiers. Enough.”

Regional activists discuss their struggle against oppression and disappearances
The Canadian division of Peace Brigade International (PBI) stressed its growing concern for the conditions of workers in Latin America at a panel of guest speakers from several sister organizations, Monday evening at UQÀM.
The four speakers, hailing from Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico, painted a grim picture of their respective countries for the group of around 25 avid listeners.
“Every day, three or four people disappear, [in Colombia]” said Gloria Gomez, president of the Association of the Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared (ASFADDES).
ASFADDES disseminates information about kidnappings that are used to suppress political opposition, and fights to bring justice to the victims’ families.
After 12 years of struggle, a collective suit seeking justice for 64,000 disappearances in Colombia over the last 30, was tried at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, where the Colombian state was found guilty. Even though the country’s government refuses to recognize the verdict, ASFADDES is not giving up.
“We expect justice proportional to the crimes perpetrated,” Gomez said.
Jorge Lopez, president of Guatemala’s Organization to Support an Integrated Sexuality to Confront AIDS (OASIS), spoke on his organization’s role promoting the rights of the gay and transsexual community within a  violent political regime.
“It isn’t easy being Guatemalan at all, regardless of one’s sexual orientation,” Lopez said.
“[As transsexuals,] we have two choices,” added his colleague, Zulma, who witnessed the murder of friend and fellow OASIS worker by the Civil National Police. “Either we hide who we are or we fend for ourselves on the street, because we are denied the right to education [and thus, to a good job].”
Zulma noted that even McDonald’s refuses to hire transsexual employees, because it is considered bad for their company’s image.
“And who is going to help us?” Lopez asked, before responding sardonically, “Certainly not the government.”
The climate in Mexico is just as worrisome, according to Tita Radilla, a founding member of the Association of the Family Members of the Detained, Disappeared, and Victims of Human Rights Violations in Mexico (AFADEM).
 Since the seventies, the country’s system of repression has overseen the torture and disappearance of over 1,300 individuals.
“Persecution, execution, and rape still occur [in Mexico] today,” Radilla said, whose father disappeared in 1974.
“We have been fighting for justice for the last 40 years, without any reaction from the government, despite promises to investigate,” Radilla said.
Indeed, when the United Nations published a report in 2003, it was found that the Mexican state and the military were responsible for the crimes perpetrated.
Zulma, however, remained hopeful about the future of human rights in Latin America.
“[All this unfairness] is what motivates us to fight for our rights,” Zulma remarked.
PBI’s panel will continue its tour of North America in the following week, stopping in Ottawa, Toronto, New York, and Washington to promote its message.

The Société de Trasportation de Montréal (STM) helped Montrealers celebrate the city’s sixth annual Nuit Blanche by staying open all night long to facilitate travel around the festival’s attractions.
Although Montreal’s 172 daytime bus routes stopped running at the usual time – around 1:30 a.m., with some routes ending earlier or only running on weekdays – the STM’s underground subway service ran in tandem with 20 night bus lines throughout the night, the third time in the metro’s 43-year history.
Marvin Rotrand, vice-chairman of the STM board of directors, highlighted the significance of providing all night metro service in a press release.
“Throughout its long history, the metro has stayed open all night only twice. The first time was during the storm of the century, March 4, 1971, while the second time was for the countdown to the year 2000. I can tell you without hesitation that allowing the metro to run all night is truly an exceptional gesture, any way you look at it,” Rotrand said.
The STM also leased 15 buses at a special low price to shuttle festival patrons from one location to another. The metro stations themselves also became attractions, providing many local artists space for art installations.
Margaret Miller, National President of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Canada, thought the all night service provided an important alternative to the drowsy festival patrons.
“Whenever a service becomes available to someone who has been drinking, it gives them more options, and when people have other options, they make use of them and don’t drive,” she said.
Miller felt Montreal’s roads could be much safer if the nighttime services were expanded or offered more frequently, because it would reduce the chances that intoxicated drivers are behind the wheel.
“The easier we make it for them to get a safe ride home, the less likely they are to be behind the wheel. More options prevents deaths and injuries because people don’t have to make alternate arrangements or take risks.”
The STM normally performs maintenance on the aging metro stations, tunnels, and cars, mostly when the metro and daytime bus system is closed – starting between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., depending on the station, route, and day, and ending around 5:30 a.m. The nighttime bus network, originally designed for employees to reach their starting locations and then opened to the public in 1988, runs 20 routes while the metro and daytime bus system is closed, mostly on intervals of 45 to 60 minutes.

Most executive candidates run unopposed, allowing them to avoid giving concrete promises
SSMU executive candidates kept it casual as they to spoke to a half-empty room of mostly SSMU councillors, executive incumbents, and student newspaper editors at the executive debates last night.
Four of the six positions were acclaimed – VPs External, University Affairs, Finance & Operations, and Clubs & Services – and, notably, the last three of the acclaimed candidates and VP Internal candidate Brendan Sullivan have come up the ranks from Queer McGill.
SSMU President hopeful Marshall Peters sat cross-legged on a table throughout his debate, choosing not to discuss his qualifications or read from a prepared speech. Peters’s comments focused mostly on a desire to interact face-to-face with students, and his view of the role of president as a figurehead.
Peters used his allotted question to ask his fellow candidate, Ivan Neilsen, whether he feared death, rather than to get more information about his platform.
Dressed in a crisp shirt and tie, Nielsen spoke in French for half his opening statement and highlighted his background as a Quebecker. He was mainly concerned with ancillary fees, the University’s attempts to push SSMU events off campus, and francophone issues.
Sullivan and Alex Brown, running against each other for VP Internal,  have long backgrounds organising events – in Queer McGill and SSMU, respectively – and said they hoped to increase the accessibility of future SSMU activities. While funding was a mutual concern, Sullivan thought evaluating events and cutting down financial flops like SnoAP would be best, while Brown thought it was more important to find sponsorship for events beyond Frosh.
Acclaimed VP Finance & Operations José Diaz mentioned his work on two SSMU service executives, and his involvement on various SSMU financial committees, including the Financial Ethics Review Committee. He discussed his intentions to create a business plan for student-run food services to replace their corporate counterparts in Shatner’s cafeteria when their leases expire in 2011. Diaz also gave a nod to the two most difficult projects in his porfolio: Haven Books and Gerts.
“I’m not intending on having them break even. It is ideal, but unrealistic,” Diaz said.
Diaz suggested placing Haven online and expanding its inventory beyond textbooks – so students would return after the first few weeks of each term.
Acclaimed VP External and current Arts Representative Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan said he hopes to tackle problems surrounding the international tuition defreeze, and continue the work of his incumbent, Devin Alfaro, to create a new provincial student association. He felt SSMU might fare better in such an organization rather than in the Fédération étudiant universitaire du Québec or the Canadian Federation of Students because it would be free and organized on a volunteer basis.
Acclaimed VP University Affairs Rebecca Dooley acknowledged that while her background has been mainly in student activism – as Queer McGill’s political action coordinator and a Culture Shock coordinator – she said she would put that aside to work as a go-between with the University.
“I think it’s really important to not go in with an ‘us vs. them’ attitude,” she said of her role as a future VP. “I think it’s really important to develop a very professional rapport with [the University].”
Acclaimed VP Clubs & Services candidate Sarah Olle mentioned her experience at Queer McGill and work on club executives. Though she was vague on her future plans as a SSMU VP, she said she would focus on greater communication with clubs. Olle targeted the PGSS in her closing remarks – notably their failure to negotiate a new Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with SSMU.
“A lack of an MoA prevents PGSS members from being a part of our harmonious society. In doing so, the PGSS has erected between upper and lower campus a barrier of segregation, an iron curtain of separation, a wall between the student lives of our brothers and sisters,” she said. “This needs to change. Tonight, I say to the PGSS, this must end. PGSS, I say to you, tear down this wall.”
The only other SSMU elections without acclamations are for Science Senator, for which four students are competing. As well, because no one from Education or Religious Studies filed a nomination, those two seats were reallocated to the largest faculties in descending order, namely Arts and Science, giving three senators to Arts – the only faculty to normally have more than one – two to Science, and one each to Engineering, Management, Music, Law, Medicine, and Dentistry.
The debates for student senators will take place Monday at 5 p.m. in the Clubs Lounge on the fourth floor of the Shatner Building.

McGill students found clinic to provide artists with advice on negotiations and illegal use of their work
Montreal’s artists will welcome a legal clinic catered to their needs this Sunday with the launch of the Clinique Juridique d’Artistes de Montreal (CJAM), a McGill-student-run initiative aimed at providing local artists with legal information.
In a city renowned for its artistic talent, many artists often have trouble working out by themselves the complex legal issues that accompany their professions, and affording help can also often prove too large a financial obstacle for small, local artists, according to U4 Law student and CJAM director Olivier Plessis.
“Local artists often don’t have resources, funding, or access to legal service,” Plessis said. “They need help getting off the ground.”
Yzes Agouri, Director of Diversité Artistique Montréal, an organization that fosters art and culture in the community, said that often artists don’t know where to find legal assistance and resort to resolving their legal responsibilities themselves, without adequate knowledge.
“[Artists] are not experienced or knowledgeable. They think they can do it by themselves,” Agouri said.
Artists can encounter a variety of legal responsibilities, ranging from contract issues to the illegal use of their work. The amount of legal responsibilities for artists can amount to such a level that it becomes impossible to manage it all.
“[Artists] need help with everything,” said Agouri, who cited help with things like licensing and distributing agreements, legal representation, and deals with agents and venues as examples.
CJAM plans to familiarize artists with basic legal information and the knowledge of their rights, through meetings and workshops.
“We’ll show [artists] templates – for example, what a contract looks like – and we’ll [introduce] them to business practices in the [artistic] industry,” said Plessis. “Copyright and contracts are the biggest issue for local artists, but we’ll help with everything.”
CJAM also plans to cater to the artistic and lingual diversity of Montreal by providing bilingual services to artists, and will accommodate artists from all genres – music, film, dance, and writing.
“Given the music scene [in Montreal], we’re expecting a lot of interest musically, with things like recording contracts,” said Plessis. “But our goal is to be a true Montreal clinic, and provide equal access [to anglophone and francophone artists].”
CJAM currently has neither formal status nor a permanent physical space from which to operate. Plessis, one of five McGill students who started the group, is hoping that CJAM’s first meeting this weekend will not only attract local artists, but also McGill students who want to volunteer.
“We want McGill and the [Montreal] arts community involved,” said Plessis. “We’re hoping to recruit people to management positions to help with things like marketing, business, and financing. We’re also looking for general volunteers, too.”
CJAM is just getting off the ground, but Plessis and those in the local artistic community are looking forward to the services CJAM are hoping they will be able to provide.
“We’ll help with whatever the artists demonstrate a need for,” said Plessis. “The sky is really the limit.”
CJAM’s first meeting is Sunday from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m., at Apathy is Boring, 10 Pins O., #412, and can be contacted at cjamontreal@gmail.com.
