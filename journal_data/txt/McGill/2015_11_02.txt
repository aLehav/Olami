Bitcoints airdropped at OAP Lite
This September during Frosh week, the McGill Cryptocurrency Club (MCC) initiated a “bitcoin airdrop,” handing out paper envelopes with vouchers for bitcoin, a form of digital currency, to be redeemed within three months. According to Michael Gord, a U4 Management student and co-founder of MCC, over $1,000 in bitcoin has been given away to McGill students to date, with around a 50 per cent claim rate.
“Bitcoin is basically two things. […] It’s a payment technology that allows for quick, cheap, international money transfers that are incorruptible and unhackable. The second thing is bitcoin the currency itself, and that’s the currency that runs on this payment network,” explained MCC co-founder Eric Maurin, a U3 Psychology and Marketing student who works as a broker and consultant at the Montreal Bitcoin Embassy, in an interview with The Daily.
“The airdrops are basically meant as a way to seed some bitcoin into the McGill community, so that when we do have [some] stores accepting bitcoin, people already have something to spend,” Maurin noted.
The MCC began in October 2014, after Gord and Maurin, along with three other students, discovered a mutual interest in Bitcoin. According to Gord, the club has grown from its five founders to over eighty active members in the span of a year.
“[Bitcoin is] a payment technology that allows for quick, cheap, international money transfers that are incorruptible and unhackable.”
Invented in 2008, bitcoin reached peak buzz in 2013, and has sincce lost some of its cutting-edge appeal as currency. Bitcoin was long associated with the online drug marketplace Silk Road, one of the first sites to accept it, and the Guardian reported that the currency briefly plummeted in value after the site was shut down in 2013.
Other recent criticisms were brought up in an article in the Economist, which describes bitcoin as “the latest techy attempt to spread a ‘Californian ideology’ which promises salvation through technology-induced decentralization while ignoring and obfuscating the realities of power – and happily concentrating vast wealth in the hands of an elite.” But members of the MCC insist on its continuing relevance as both data-transfer technology and practical currency.
In a video produced by the MCC, Peg Brunelle, a career advisor at the Desautels Faculty of Management, talks about the benefits of bitcoin’s global usability. “I think it certainly can take us to the next level, in terms of being a global community,” Brunelle said.
In February, the club also arranged for Gerts to accept bitcoin for the night of their launch party. In April, at Open Air Pub (OAP) Lite, Maurin and Gord distributed free bitcoin to attendees, and Alex Fonseca, one of the co-founders of MCC, accepted bitcoin in exchange for tickets for burgers and drinks.
“So what happens is we would be sitting there accepting all the bitcoin, then the system actually measures what the price was at the time of the purchase and then we go and pay [OAP] cash at the end of the day […] valued at the time of the purchase,” explained Maurin. “It allows the merchant to accept bitcoin without actually holding any bitcoin or being afraid that the value might go up or down.”
Currently, the MCC is pushing for McGill to accept payments in bitcoin for everything from meal plans to student fees.
MCC members highlighted the convenience of bitcoin for international students in particular. “My parents pay hundreds of dollars worth of fees just to send me money for school,” Maurin said. “Parents can send their kid bitcoin, or can send the school bitcoin, and it would totally limit the fees,” added Gord.
“I don’t really think that I would ever buy bitcoin myself, I don’t really see a benefit to it [over] other, governmentally-backed, currencies.”
In an interview with The Daily, U2 Anatomy and Cell Biology student Madison Luck expressed reservations about the currency. “I don’t really think that I would ever buy bitcoin myself, I don’t really see a benefit to it [over] other, governmentally-backed, currencies,” Luck told The Daily. “However, if someone gave me bitcoin, I would use it.”
Gord has been working on soliciting alumni donations in bitcoin, which are used to finance the airdrops. “The first bitcoin airdrop was at OAP, the second was around McGill […] and the third airdrop is 99 per cent going to be in Montreal and Toronto – it’ll be a tour. I say in five years, it’s going to be across Canada,” he added.
According to Maurin, in terms of future projects, the MCC aims to get all of the student-run businesses on campus to use the cryptocurrency.
“It tends to be easier to convince them to accept bitcoin because they don’t have to go through a whole process with a company. We’d love to have Subway accept bitcoin but you’re dealing with a much bigger company, a lot of bureaucracy.”
When asked about McGill’s financial incentive to adopt bitcoin, Gord commented, “I’m going to graduate in three months and I’m going to donate to McGill as an alumnus in bitcoin.”
“If they accept donations in bitcoin and they hold it in bitcoin […] the potential price of bitcoin could be up — we say this, and people don’t take it seriously — but it could be up in the couple hundred thousand dollars, if not millions, per bitcoin.” Currently, approximately 14 million bitcoins exist in the world, but the quantity is permanenly capped at 21 million.

McGill Food Systems Project to conduct research by end of year
Between October 28 and 30, McGill Food Systems Project (MFSP) collected non-perishable food items on the McGill downtown campus, in partnership with The Yellow Door as part of a nationwide Trick or Eat food donation campaign.
According to the event’s description on Facebook, the food collected was donated to The Yellow Door, a non-profit organization located in the Milton-Parc neighbourhood, which offers a food bank for low-income students to receive free groceries anonymously.
In an email to The Daily, Adam Pietrobon, a U3 Biochemistry student and an events coordinator at MFSP, highlighted the severity of food insecurity in Montreal.
“According to Moisson Montreal (a food distribution organization), there is $61 million worth of food distributed annually across 250 different community organizations in Montreal,” said Pietrobon. “Monthly, 140,000 people in Montreal receive food assistance, with 40,000 of those individuals being children. Food insecurity is still most definitely an issue in our local community.”
According to Monica Allaby, a U1 Geography student and marketing coordinator at MFSP, the initiative has collected non-perishable foods through multiple yearly events since MFSP’s inception in 2008. This year, Allaby says the initiative is shifting its policy to focus on supporting applied student research projects with community engagement initiatives.
In an email to The Daily, Allaby explained that MFSP is “hoping to collaborate with a number of other student organizations and groups on the McGill campus and in the larger Montreal community, as we are all working toward common goals and can benefit greatly from sharing our knowledge and experiences.”
The Daily also spoke with Laurence Bertrand, a U4 Economics student and internal manager at MFSP, at the beginning of the campus food drive on October 28. Bertrand explained that a key challenge MFSP faces is “reaching out to parts of the student population that don’t know much about food sustainability or food insecurity.”
“Monthly, 140,000 people in Montreal receive food assistance, with 40,000 of those individuals being children.”
“Usually, we have events that will attract all environment students, or people who are already part of the ‘sustainability bubble,’” Bertrand added.
Allaby and Bertrand explained that The Yellow Door often receives donations that “nobody eats, such as artichokes, jam, and jell-o, which is not helpful at all.” They said that the ideal non-perishable donation to a food pantry is something that is nutritious and versatile, such as canned beans, sauces, and pastas.
Allaby stressed to the Daily that “these items should also be easy to prepare, as a person’s ability to access food may coincide with their ability to prepare those foods. Canned vegetables, soup, and chili are all great options.”
“There have been several studies conducted across Canadian campuses called ‘Hunger Reports,’ which assess food insecurity within the university population,” wrote Pietrobon. He cited the Ryerson 2015 Hunger Report, which found that 422 people in Ryerson university experienced food insecurity. A total of 2,528 visits to the Ryerson Good Food Centre for emergency-related food relief took place within the year.
“For McGill, the MFSP is currently in the progress of conducting a Hunger Report, which we hope to release by the end of the year,” noted Pietrobon.
According to Pietrobon, a similar Hunger Report released at the University of Saskatchewan found that 28.6 per cent of students experienced food insecurity, while a study at Acadia University in Nova Scotia found the rate to be 38.1 per cent.
Allaby told the Daily that later in this semester, MFSP will be collaborating with the Groupe de recherche et d’intérêt en développement durable et en agriculture urbaine (GRIDDAU) at the Université de Montréal to host a film screening and panel discussion on issues relating to student food security.

McGill student solidarity group focuses conversation on human rights
On October 28, Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill presented a workshop entitled “Palestine 101: Intro to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.” The event was organized as part of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Week at Concordia, and was the only event held by SPHR McGill.
The speakers were Melis Çagan, Ralph Haddad (former Daily editor and current director on the Board of the Daily Publications Society), and Michael McCauley, three members of SPHR McGill.
The workshop began with a brief overview of the occupation and the plight of Palestinians living in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and the diaspora, respectively. The overview, presented by McCauley and Haddad, described the blockade and military assaults on the Gaza Strip, instances of police brutality against Palestinians, and the Israeli West Bank Barrier, also known as the Wall.
“This blockade of the Strip has prevented the reconstruction of homes that have been demolished in previous military assaults against the region, and have also virtually destroyed the Gaza economy,” McCauley said. “There is […] a 43 per cent unemployment rate in the Strip – that is the result of both the blockade and these repeated military assaults.”
“There is […] a 43 per cent unemployment rate in the Strip – that is the result of both the blockade and these repeated military assaults.”
The presentation included footage showing Palestinian refugee camps being demolished by the Israeli state, as well as analysis of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, with a focus on the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords, and the 2000 Camp David negotiations.
“The problem with these peace talks [is] that they’re very asymmetrical. They lean more toward Israel’s side than the Palestinian side,” said Haddad. “They also assume that both parties are equal and they have the same to bring to the negotiation table, which is inherently wrong. You can’t sit down at a table with your oppressor and talk about an equal exchange that will happen between you.”
The visual presentation displayed the three demands of the BDS call: “Ending [the Israeli state’s] occupation and colonization of all Arab lands [occupied in June 1967] and dismantling the Wall; recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties, as stipulated in [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194].”
“Because there is no constant stance in Palestine about a one-state or two-state solution, by focusing BDS on having [human] rights, [since] there’s a general consensus on what rights people should have […] it’s easier for people from different political views to take part in it,” noted Çagan.
“Neutrality in this case means complicity with the oppressor, and I think this attitude needs to change if we are ever to make any strides in standing in solidarity with the liberation struggles of [the Palestinian] people.”
Çagan concluded the presentation by discussing the relative success of international calls for BDS, which began in 2004 with a Palestinian campaign for academic boycott. Recent successes of the BDS movement worldwide include the French multinational infrastructure company Veolia selling its shares in the consortium that runs Jerusalem Light Rail as well as the global mobilization to divest from G4S, a British multinational security company that provides security equipment and supplies to Israeli prisons in the West Bank.
Following the presentation, participants brought up questions comparing boycott and divestment tactics used to end South African apartheid in the 1980s and 1990s and BDS against Israeli apartheid today. Discussion also centered on McGill’s role in the BDS movement. McGill has investments in G4S as well as Re/Max, a real estate company that sells properties in Israeli settlements.
Liza Riitters, a U1 Political Science student who attended the workshop, noted that while many students she knew were in support of the Palestinian cause, many others at McGill did not support divestment. “I was here last year when they were trying to [divest from the occupation of Palestinian territory], and so many people were saying ‘Oh, the university shouldn’t have an opinion,’” said Riitters.
Ayesha Talreja, a U3 International Development student and member of SPHR McGill said, “Neutrality in this case means complicity with the oppressor, and I think this attitude needs to change if we are ever to make any strides in standing in solidarity with the liberation struggles of [the Palestinian] people.”

Space for mental health support to operate out of Shatner fourth floor
After months of consultation with the Peer Support Centre (PSC) and other mental health organizations on campus, Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) executives have developed a proposal to create a permanent space in the Shatner building dedicated to mental health.
The PSC, formerly known as the Peer Support Network (PSN), was until recently a student group on campus without any affiliation to McGill or to SSMU. This September the PSC applied to become a SSMU club and was granted interim status. The PSC will be eligible for full club status in January.
SSMU VP Clubs & Services Kimber Bialik outlined the plan in an email to The Daily: “As of right now, we are proposing Rooms 429 and 430 on the fourth floor of the SSMU Building as the ‘Mental Health Space.’ […] We intend for Room 429 to be a space where student groups can offer group support sessions, [while] Room 430 would focus on direct resource provision, including informational resources and peer support.”
“The proposal for this room includes renovations that would create two smaller segments of the room that could be used for private one-on-one support sessions that could be operated by the Peer Support Centre or a similar group,” Bialik added.
The renovations should cost roughly $30,000, Bialik explained, with the necessary funds to be provided through grants. Bialik and VP University Affairs Chloe Rourke, who has also been heavily involved in the project, hope to see the proposal brought to SSMU Legislative Council by the end of November.
The proposal is in accordance with a motion passed at SSMU Council on April 9 that strengthened SSMU’s ties with the PSC, and mandated the VP Clubs & Services and VP University Affairs to “prioritize the creation of a permanent, physical space in the SSMU building dedicated to mental health,” consulting with relevant student organizations in the process. It also fulfills part of SSMU’s Mental Health Five-Year Plan.
“Not having a more permanent, central location [is a problem], because it gets really confusing with multiple hours and multiple locations.”
At the moment, the PSC operates out of four different locations on campus: the McGill Office of Religious and Spiritual Life (MORSL), the Strathcona Music Building, University Hall, and McGill Mental Health Service (MMHS), using each space for three or four hours per week.
“We’re really trying to become more available for students,” said Quinn Ashkenazy, U3 Psychology student and the chair of PSC, in an interview with The Daily. “Not having a more permanent, central location [is a problem], because it gets really confusing with multiple hours and multiple locations. Sometimes you just want to talk to someone [right away] but wait, where are they? They’re over here, they’re over there.”
The bottom line, said Ashkenazy, is that “there shouldn’t be barriers to accessing peer support.”
Ashkenazy pointed to other Canadian campuses where such arrangements already exist. “For example, [at] the University of Alberta, on an average day, their peer support program could see between seven and eight people,” she said.
Bialik emphasized, however, that the proposed space would not belong exclusively to the PSC, but would be shared by other mental health groups on campus. “The proposal as it currently stands tries to make this space as multi-purpose as possible,” wrote Bialik.
The creation of a student-run mental health space comes amid criticism from SSMU clubs regarding Bialik’s decision to convert club office spaces on the fourth floor of the Shatner building into bookable spaces.
“The old club office structure provided benefit to very few groups, and the elimination of that outdated system provided an opportunity to create more multi-purpose space.”
“The old club office structure provided benefit to very few groups, and the elimination of that outdated system provided an opportunity to create more multi-purpose space on the fourth floor that can benefit a far greater number of people,” Bialik said. “A ‘Mental Health Space’ is an excellent example of the kind of space that has a wider benefit and has significant student support.”
Indeed, many students have voiced concern in recent years over long wait times required in order to see a specialist at MMHS, which can last up to five months, as reported by The Daily. Earlier this month, Nancy Low and Giuseppe Alfonsi, clinical directors at MMHS, had told The Daily about their intention to encourage peer-to-peer mental health initiatives, in order to relieve pressure on clinical staff.
Asked about the long-term efficiency of this plan, Ashkenazy responded with enthusiasm.
“I think it’s the most sustainable way to proceed,” she said. “To start building communities of support on campus with peer-to-peer [support], I think that’s really empowering. And often, I think if you can start to talk about things early, it gets to the stage where maybe you don’t need a professional.”

A look at the boycott, divestment and
sanctions movement at Concordia and McGill
Between October 26 and 30, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) Concordia organized a week-long campaign dedicated to raising awareness about the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
BDS Week was the first of its kind at Concordia, and featured speakers such as Kanien’kehá:ka activist Clifton Nicholas, human rights attorney and activist Noura Erakat, and Palestine-based independent journalist Dan Cohen. The week also featured musical performances by Saeed Kamjoo, Julien Ottavi, and JKPickett as part of the Howl! fall event series.
Last year, between November 25 and 27, Concordia students passed a referendum that asked students, “Do you approve of the [Concordia Students’ Union (CSU)] endorsing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel?”
The initial draft of the question included “until Israel complies with International Law and Universal Principle[s] of Human Rights,” but this section was removed by the CSU Judicial Board prior to the referendum.
According to Rami Yahia, a member of SPHR Concordia, the availability of funding from the CSU for Concordia’s BDS Week is a direct result of last year’s ‘yes’ vote.
“We had a referendum vote where all the students could participate, whereas at McGill, [the GA included just] whatever students decided to show up to that [GA], on that particular time on that particular day, [when there] was a snowstorm.”
The week also coincided with the one year anniversary of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Fall General Assembly (GA), where students voted to indefinitely postpone a motion calling on SSMU to stand in solidarity with the people of the occupied Palestinian territories. The motion was brought up in response to Operation Protective Edge, launched by the Israeli military in Summer 2014.
Later in March, another motion proposed by SPHR concerning divestment from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories was defeated. Some students opposed the motion on the grounds that it was allegedly affiliated with the BDS movement.
Abdulla Daoud, another member of SPHR Concordia, explained that the SSMU motion was not concerned with standing in solidarity with the BDS movement, but rather with specifically divesting from companies.
“We know [SPHR McGill], we work closely with them. They’re very strong and passionate people. We believe that there is really no difference as far as what happened at McGill and what happened at Concordia – only as far as how the structure is,” Daoud told The Daily.
“We had a referendum vote where all the students could participate, whereas at McGill, [the GA included just] whatever students decided to show up to that [GA], on that particular time on that particular day, [when there] was a snowstorm.”
Michael McCauley, a member of SPHR McGill, said, “We had, I think, more difficulty with motivating people to come out and walk through the snow to get there. Whereas, there was more motivation from the people who were mobilizing against us, despite the fact that I really do think that there is a lot more sympathy toward [the] Palestinian cause than was reflected at that particular GA.”
In an email to The Daily, Hillel McGill president Rayna Lew argued that the BDS movement is reductive.
“BDS simply does not create an academic space for discussion on the conflict, peace, or resolution. […] The movement polarizes the issue and does not invite nuanced discussion from either side,” Lew said.
Jordan Devon, a U2 Political Science student, agreed with Lew, stating that BDS supporters fail to understand the complexities of Israeli society. Although Devon is co-president of Israel on Campus (IOC), his statement was not made on behalf of the organization. “For this fundamental reason, the BDS movement is failing to achieve its goal, particularly to inflict enough pressure on Israeli society so that its government will abolish certain policies pertaining to the Palestinians,” said Devon.
Devon expressed that it is possible to be critical of the BDS movement and the Israeli state at the same time. “Being pro-Israel or Zionist is not a monolithic identity; it is not confined to supporting the current Israeli government or the settlement program; it is not manifested through blindly defending every action undertaken by Israel,” he said.
But according to Daoud, “[BDS is] the most non-violent and peaceful way a person in North America can aid in resisting the occupation that occurs right now in the West Bank and Gaza. It’s very diplomatic, very concise, very strong, and very easy to do.”
McCauley explained that the BDS movement adopts a human rights – based approach. “There is generally a pretty broad consensus [that] BDS in Palestine […] doesn’t exist for support for political parties or support for a one- versus two-state solution.”
“So, as I see it, despite any sort of criticism that you may have of the ultimate goals of BDS, […] it’s something that you nevertheless have a responsibility to support because it’s a direct call that was made by the Palestinians themselves,” McCauley stated.

Student refugee program in need of sustainable funding
On October 23, World University Service of Canada (WUSC) McGill created a Facebook event called “Mock Refugee Camp on Campus at the Y Intersection.” The next day, two McGill students, Sumaya Ugas and Y. Abdulqadir, spearheaded a massive backlash against the concept of a “mock refugee camp,” leading WUSC McGill to change the event’s title to “WUSC McGill Info Station,” and eventually to change the format of the event.
Both Abdulqadir and Ugas are members of the McGill African Students Society (MASS), but acted independently of the organization. The two students along with Rachel Zellars, a PhD candidate in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education, created a campaign via a Facebook event entitled “No ‘Mock Refugee Camp’ at McGill,” and Abdulqadir and Ugas wrote an open letter speaking against the idea of a mock refugee camp, which was signed by 277 people, as of press time.
According to WUSC McGill’s Facebook event page, their event was “designed to give an idea of what life is like in a refugee camp as a contrast to our life here in Canada,” with a focus on the Student Refugee Program (SRP), an initative that provides education opportunities for student refugees.
Ugas and Abdulqadir’s open letter elaborated on their concerns about the event and ultimately called on WUSC McGill to use different awareness-raising tactics.
“We do not condone any event that exoticizes or reduces the complicated, nuanced lived experiences of people who are refugees around the world.”
“Despite the seemingly noble intentions of WUSC McGill, we find the inaccurate reproduction of often incredibly violent and gendered spaces founded upon colonial and imperial histories to be a cheap falsification of a complex lived experience,” the letter stated.
The letter further explained the writers’ anger and concern regarding WUSC McGill’s decision to later change the name of the event, which they saw as an offensive attempt to placate them.
Many people commenting on the Facebook event brought up the fact that the executive team of WUSC McGill consists of several students supported by the SRP. Nevertheless, Abdulqadir and Ugas wrote they “hold that the opinions and lived experiences of these individuals should not serve as the basis and/or justification for a campus-wide awareness event that relies on a mock refugee camp.”
Zellars told The Daily that she supports the analysis presented in the letter. Zellars said, “A refugee camp cannot be reproduced in any realistic or meaningful way, except to benefit privileged spectators at the voyeuristic expense of those who have been harmed by these spaces.”
On October 24, MASS released a statement of solidarity, supporting Ugas and Abdulqadir’s activism and condemning the idea of a mock refugee camp. In the statement, MASS noted that “while we are also committed to increasing the visibility of refugee issues at McGill, we do not condone any event that exoticizes or reduces the complicated, nuanced lived experiences of people who are refugees around the world.”
In a response also released on October 24, WUSC McGill called on MASS “to kindly join hands with us to organize this event by helping us to avoid offensive components, if any.”
“A refugee camp cannot be reproduced in  any realistic or meaningful way, except to benefit privileged spectators at the voyeuristic expense of those who have been harmed by these spaces.”
On October 26, after meeting with Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP University Affairs Chloe Rourke and SSMU Equity Commissioner Marilyn Verghis, WUSC McGill agreed to changing the event to a table with printed information about the SRP.
In their final statement on October 27, WUSC McGill stated that “the event’s original description and title were poorly worded, and many well-meaning community members misinterpreted them as implying that we were attempting to romanticize or simulate what it means to be a refugee.” The organization stressed this was never their intent, reiterating that their goal was always to raise awareness for the SRP and its need for funds to continue helping refugee youth globally, in face of financial strains.
The event was held as scheduled on October 28.
Two similar events organized by local WUSC committees at the University of Saskatchewan and University of Prince Edward Island have taken place in the past month, entitled “Mock Refugee Camp” and “Mock Refugee Camp(us),” respectively, where refugee tents were set up.
At McGill, fundraising for the SRP is done through a non-opt-outable fee of 50 cents established in 1986 and collected from all undergraduate and graduate downtown campus students.
WUSC McGill told The Daily that the SRP “gives two students the chance to study at McGill and get an education that they otherwise wouldn’t have access to each year.”
“This fee, set up in 1986, was supposed to be indexed for inflation. It wasn’t. The cost of living has roughly doubled in the last 30 years, but our fee hasn’t, and we’re about to run out of reserve funds,” WUSC McGill stated. “Barely anyone at McGill had even heard of WUSC until this weekend. We wanted to change that.”
