Recent conflict closes the border, restricting aid workers and goods from reaching Gaza
Ehab Lotayef, a Montreal writer, activist, and engineer arrived in Gaza on February 19 after two unsuccessful weeks of trying to cross the Egypt-Palestine border, which was closed during recent conflict.
According to Lotayef, Egyptian control of the crossing has made access to Gaza unpredictable, leaving many aid workers and activists stranded at the border for days on end. He said, however, that government at the crossing can be swayed by the presence of large groups, because they do not want to see too many international travellers stranded at the border.
“It is very difficult to cross the border. You have no recourse. If they decide the borders are closed, there is nothing you can do about it,” Lotayef said in an interview from Gaza.
Lotayef was repeatedly turned away from the border until he joined a delegation of 60 aid workers organized by CODEPINK – a women-initiated grassroots peace and social justice movement. The delegation was the first of its size to cross the border since July 2007.
He noted that border restrictions have had a severe impact on civilians, as all goods entering the region are now brought through tunnels – resulting in skyrocketing inflation.
“The needs of the people of Gaza are not satisfied…. These tunnels also support weapons smuggling. If you want to stifle the tunnels, then open the borders. It would be much more difficult to smuggle weapons across an official and legally monitored border,” Lotayef said.
His real work will begin now that he is in Gaza. Delegations such as CODEPINK allow activists from around the world to collect photographs and first-hand accounts of their experiences, so that they can be taken back to their local communities.
Mohamed Boudjenane of the Canadian Arab Federation – one of the groups sponsoring Lotayef’s travel – commented, “Lotayef is well-respected within the Canadian humanitarian community. By sending someone like Lotayef, we will have a first-hand report of what is taking place in Gaza.”
Lotayef said he has spent his time connecting with Gazans, documenting cases, taking photographs, and blogging in order to better inform Canadians about the current humanitarian crisis.
“The devastation is enormous. I believed that I had a good idea of what the devastation was like, but over the last few days I have seen more destruction than I expected: of agricultural areas, houses, and city centres. In the north of the Gaza Strip, the American School of Gaza has been completely flattened,” he said.
“I met a 12-year-old who told me how many of his friends had died in the conflict. He told me, ‘I don’t want to make friends anymore; it is too painful when the die.’ This alone was the most striking moment for me so far. I just froze; I didn’t know what to say.”
The CODEPINK delegation is composed of 50 women and ten men from the United States, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Turkey, and Egypt. They were joined by the Viva Palestina Caravan led by British MP George Galloway that arrived March 9, after travelling 5,000 miles from Hyde Park in London.
According to Lotayef, the arrival of both these delegations has helped to uplift spirits in Gaza for the moment.
“The Palestinian people need to see that there are people in the world far away, people of different colours and nationalities that understand their plight and support them in their struggle.”

Sparsely attended event draws little interest from outside SSMU
Around 50 people trickled in to Gert’s Thursday evening to witness Ivan Neilson and Alexandra Brown win the only two contested SSMU executive positions – President and VP Internal.
All SSMU and administrative referendum motions passed – though a motion to raise the QPIRG fee by 75 cents – the first increase since its inception in 1988 – was briefly contested because of an ambiguity in the SSMU constitution of what constitutes a “simple majority,” the requirement to pass referendum items.
The increase was approved with 48.3 per cent for and 46.4 against.
Neilson beat out Marshall Peters for his position with a vote of 50.8 per cent to 38.2 per cent, with 11 per cent spoiled. Brown and Brendan Sullivan had the closest race, with Brown winning 50.2 per cent.
Both McGill ancillary fees passed, with the Athletic fee approved 54 per cent to 45.7 per cent, and the student service fee approved 53.7 per cent to 45.5 per cent.
The McGill Undergraduate Students Fee renewal passed with 57.2 per cent to 36.6 per cent, and the Athletic Improvement fund  passed 50.7 per cent to 44.3 per cent. A motion to amend the SSMU General Assembly was also approved, with 54 per cent for and 25.4 per against.

New work permits allow grads more opportunities
A catchy government sign on the corner of Parc and Milton speaks straight to graduating students: “Real Montrealers stay in Montreal.”
The sign reflects the provincial government’s renewed efforts to keep graduating university students in Quebec – particularly international ones – to prevent brain drain and keep the job market afloat.
Mayor of Ville-Marie Borough, Benoît Labonté, addressed SSMU’s council last Thursday and emphasized that Montreal must attract out-of-town graduates from the City’s universities.
“Our real challenge, which will measure our progression, will be our capacity to attract, maintain, and integrate talent into Montreal,” Labonté said. “If we can’t, it’s over, we’re cooked, we’re finished.”
This semester, McGill hosted three popular informational presentations for international students who are considering staying in Quebec after graduation. These 75-person sessions – run by the Ministre de l’Immigration et des Communautés Culturelles – were filled to capacity, forcing some interested students onto a waiting list.
According to Rhonda Turner, McGill Advisor to International Students, these sessions are part of a government effort to attract qualified immigrants to work in Canada.
“It’s made very clear in the presentation that they want you to stay in Quebec,” she said.
International students, who account for almost 19 per cent of McGill’s student body, can either apply for permanent residency if they wish to remain in Quebec – a process that generally takes six to nine months – or apply for a Post-Diploma Work Permit – a special visa introduced in April 2008 that allows recent graduates to stay in Canada for up to three years without a specific job offer.
“It used to be this vicious cycle where companies wouldn’t want to hire you without a work permit, and the government of Canada wouldn’t give you a work permit without a job offer,” said Sam Imberman, an American who decided to stay in Montreal after graduating from McGill in 2008 with a B.A. in Geography.
Imberman currently works as a marketing assistant under this new permit as he awaits the status of his permanent residency application, which is now a common practice, according to Turner.
Caroline Leamon, an American who graduated in winter 2009 with a B.A. in Cultural Studies and a minor in French, rethought her decision to stay in Montreal after attending one of the information sessions.
“It looked like quite the undertaking,” she said. “There are a lot of processing fees, and it comes out to over $1,000 in the end…. Hearing all of the steps and how expensive it was really made me think, okay, this would be a big commitment settling in Montreal, and do I really want to be here for the next three years at such a cost? And that’s what really got me thinking, maybe not so much.”
Securing permanent residency is a complicated process in Quebec that entails an elaborate point-system, a mountain of paperwork, and often a series of interviews assessing applicants’ French and English language abilities and personal characteristics.
Many applicants find the point-system to be the most confusing part of the process, according to Turner.
Single candidates must obtain 60 points of a possible 96, and those applying with spouses need 68 of a possible 113. Most points are awarded to applicants who are under 35, have advanced degrees, and are highly proficient in French. The scale also rewards those whose could fill positions in industries that are currently experiencing shortages in the province, including the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.
A U3 who is in Electrical Engineering, hopes to return to Quebec after he fulfills a two-to-three-year obligation to a Saudi Arabian oil company that has paid his tuition at McGill.
“Most [international students in engineering], I’d say 70-75 per cent, would want to work here,” he said. “The diversity of people is very welcoming for people like me – immigrants – and the work environment is appealing. Flat organization, less bureaucracy, less hierarchy – that’s something very attractive for engineering firms, at least.”
While he only possesses a basic knowledge of French, he said that he plans to learn the language, especially if he decides to pursue citizenship.
But for some, the cost outweighs the benefit. Faye Hughes, an American U3 IDS and Hispanic Languages major, said that she plans leave Montreal largely because of her limited French. “I’ve had trouble finding an off-campus job,” she said. “Some of the on-campus jobs you have to speak French, and I’ve really felt limited by that. While I’d like to learn French at some point, languages are hard. I’d rather just find somewhere where my Spanish is useful.”
For those who are fluent in French, the appeal of Montreal as a city can be motivation enough to get through the paperwork.
“It’s a good starter city,” Imberman said. “It’s good for people in this age, in this stage of life. Sure, I could move to New York at this point, but where would I live, and how long would my commute be, and could I even afford to go out and drink? It’s true, you’re paid less here, but it takes a lot less to live.”

Nearly 1,000 professors from l’Université de Québec À Montréal (UQÀM) voted on whether to strike next week – with 76 per cent in favour, after being left without a contract since May 2007. This follows four one-day strikes by the professors, organized during February and March.
Class schedules, however, will likely not be affected by the strike – as they were not by the walk-outs – because many are taught by lecturers, who are part of a different union.
The professors claim that the student-teacher ratio and their average salaries are well below the provincial average. They are asking the administration to hire 300 new professors and raise salaries 11.6 per cent over the next three years.
According to figures released by Statistics Canada on Monday, the average salary of a professor at UQÀM is $90,000 a year, which is $14,000 less than at McGill and Université de Montréal, but $6,000 more than at Concordia.
UQÀM says its massive debt  – brought on by two badly-planned expansion projects that incurred overruns so large that the provincial government had to step in –  has kept them from making an offer. As a stipulation of their $465-million bailout, the government required they carry out a study comparing their salaries to those of provincial professors. The study will be completed in a few weeks, after which an offer can be expected.

Unions to face fines if representing their members on pay equity disputes
Correction appended
Women in the federal public service may soon see their right to pay equity negotiated away at the bargaining table, which some say will critically undermine women’s internationally-recognized human right to equal pay for equal value of work.
According to the Harper government, Canadian taxpayers have covered over $4-billion in pay equity disputes and settlements heard at the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) since the right for equal pay was introduced in 1977. The government’s proposal – known as the Public Service Equitable Compensation Act – would forbid CHRC from hearing pay equity complaints from federal public servants – a body of 400,000 workers – and instead make it an issue for negotiations during collective bargaining, claiming that both the employer and the union will be responsible for ensuring equitable compensation.
The Act is rolled into Bill C-10 – the Budget Implementation Act, which includes urgent provisions for an economic stimulus – which cleared the House of Commons on March 4, despite criticism from all three opposition parties, and moved to the Senate the same day, where it presently being studied.
The Act received heavy criticism in the Fall Economic Update, contributing to a decision to prorogue Parliament.
Removing a Human Right
Patty Ducharme, the National Executive Vice-President for Public Service Alliance Canada (PSAC) – a 166,000-member union that represents federal public service workers – was furious that a convention of the Canadian Human Rights Act might be removed.
“You’re negotiating a human right at the bargaining table,” said Ducharme, explaining that pay equity may just get swapped in favour of other benefits. “It’s oppressive. It’s repressive. It’s ideologically-driven and heavy-handed.”
PSAC believes its members may be further jeopardized because the union is not allowed to assist its members in filing a pay equity complaint without receiving a $50,000 fine.
“Last time I checked, unions have a mandate that says they must represent their members,” said Ducharme. “There’s no public servant employee who has pockets deep enough to take on the federal government.”
In 2000, after over 20 years in court, PSAC settled the largest pay equity case in Canada, leaving the federal government accountable to paying PSAC members $3.2-million in wage-gap differences and interest.
Sue Genge, National Representative (Women and Human Rights) for the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), a federation of unions nation-wide, agreed that the bill has put PSAC in a difficult position.
“They’re caught,” Genge said. “PSAC has to represent their members, but they’ll be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars if they do.”
Ducharme admitted that PSAC was unsure how to proceed if the legislation passed through the Senate.
“To bring a pay equity case requires a lot of research studies,” Genge explained, noting that funding had been cut from many women’s groups that provided support during pay equity complaints. “You can’t only know how you do, but how everyone else does relative to you.”
Two Rights Regimes
“There will now be two regimes of pay equity in Canada,” explained Genge. “Federal public service workers will be subject to new legislation, while other federal sector employees – like crown corporations – will still be able to file under the Canadian Human Rights Commission.”
Over 80 female lawyers, academics, and professionals sent a letter to the Harper government urging the removal of the Act from the budget, on the basis of human rights violation.
“It undermines, rather than fulfills, the commitment to eliminating sex discrimination from pay practices, and does not provide women federal public servants with effective access to a remedy if their rights are violated,” the letter read.
Canada’s position on pay equity lies in stark contrast to recent policy shifts in the United States, as Obama’s first bill signed into law on January 29 improved the conditions for women to sue over pay equity.
“Obama committed to not balance the budget on the backs of working women, which is exactly what this government is refusing to say,” said Ducharme. “It’s a very sad day when we in Canada allow the removal of human rights from a section of our population.”
Non-equitable expansion
While the current bill targets federal public service workers, London, Ontario Member of Parliament Irene Mathyssen, the NDP’s critic for the Status of Women, was concerned that this federal policy shift could expand to other federal sectors or set a precedent for provincial legislation, where labour law issues are regulated.
“It sends a bad message to provinces and territories that proactive pay equity doesn’t matter,” said Mathyssen. “It tells employers that this government isn’t going to fight for women.”
Genge noted that the Harper government’s focus on federal public service workers may expand.
“If they can get away with this, then they will keep pushing [pay equity reform] to other sectors.” Genge said.
Mathyssen and others called for a proactive approach to pay equity – forcing employers to pursue strategies for equitable compensation, rather than operating on a complaint basis.
In 2004, the Federal Pay Equity Task Force – appointed by the Federal Ministers of Justice and Labour to review the equal pay provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Equal Wages Guidelines in 1986 – released their recommendations for adopting a more proactive pay system federally after a three-year-study, none of which have been implemented by the Liberal or Conservative governments, the latter of which has presided over the removal of the Task Force’s report from the Department of Justice’s web site.
“The Act makes it appear that the government is legislating to advance pay equity, yet many dimensions of the new legislation will undermine existing protections,” explained McGill Law professor Colleen Sheppard.
“Law reform should enhance rather than undermine existing human rights,” Sheppard said.
Presently, Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba have proactive pay equity laws.
Harming recruitment
With a large wave of expected retirees from federal public service jobs in the next five years, Mathyssen expected that the Act would diminish recruitment of women to the federal sector.
“It sends some really upsetting messages to young women who may have considered a job in the federal public service,” Mathyssen said. “It’s telling young women that there is no future here.”
Canadian women with university degrees earn 68-cents on the male dollar – an average 2.5-cents below women’s earnings nationally, according to statistics from the CLC. Unionized women receive 93-cents for every male dollar, on average.
“Young women are starting to recognize the ‘gapzilla,’” said Genge, noting that most don’t note the profound difference in wages that still exists.
Systematic Inequality
Mathyssen explained that the Act was part of a trend to systematically undermine equality for women.
“Their reforms are part of a trend to cut out women’s rights,” she said. “I’m expecting that we’ll once again be censured by the United Nations, and that will be the umpteenth time in the past few years that we’re going to hear that Canada isn’t doing enough for the status of women.”
“This government is profoundly anti-equality and anti-women,” Genge agreed. “We’re talking about the removal of a right.”
Both were expecting that either a change in government or a court challenge on the basis of violating human rights would be necessary courses of action if the Bill passed the Senate.
“There is a significant fight ahead,” Mathyssen said.
………………………………………………
The changing status of women under the Harper government
1) Stopped funding to the Court Challenges Programme
2) Changed funding criteria for Status of Women Canada’s Women’s Programme, precluding support for advocacy or lobbying for law reform
3) Cancelled the Status of Women Independent Research Fund
4) Ended child care agreements with the provinces
The article originally stated that PSAC was granted $3.2-billion in settlements, rather than $3.2-million. The Daily regrets the error.

Students evacuate safely, one student injured
Monday afternoon, McGill’s downtown campus was shaken by an explosion in the Otto Maass chemistry building and a fire on the sixth floor of Leacock – forcing the evacuation of hundreds of students and staff and the closing of both buildings for several hours.
Pierre Barbarie, Associate Director of University Safety, said McGill Security has yet to determine the cause of the Leacock incident, and that the fire department is investigating what appear to be suspicious circumstances.
Though no one was hurt in the fire, a student was injured in the explosion on Otto Maass’s third floor, when his chemical reaction accidentally detonated. The student suffered cuts on his hands, face, and chest, and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. The office of the Dean of Students could not be reached for comment on the student’s status.
Barbarie said, though, that he was pleased with how both of the situations were handled, and that buildings’ occupants took the alarms seriously.
“I want to commend everyone who evacuated quickly. The co-ordination of the response to these incidents went very well,” Barbarie said.
According to McGill Security Services, the  Leacock fire originated in boxes that were stacked up in the 617 seminar room. Once the alarm was activated at 1:08 p.m., Leacock and the attached Arts Building and Dawson Hall were safely evacuated as fire trucks arrived on the scene.
Security services personnel blocked indoor and outdoor access to Leacock until 5:45 p.m. – a full five hours after the fire broke out.
Barbarie explained that Security was delayed in reopening the building because the fire panel, which controls the building emergency system, had to be reset by the contracted company, and Security needed to clean up to ensure safety. However, certain students and staff were escorted back into the building to recover important belongings before Leacock was re-opened.
As of 6:15 p.m., the smell of smoke still hung in the air on the ground floor, in the elevator, and on the sixth floor where fire department and security personnel were still on-site.
In Otto Maass, researchers on the fourth floor reported hearing the fire alarm and evacuating between 3:30 and 4 p.m., but did not report hearing or feeling any impact from the explosion. The 911 call at Otto Maass was taken at Security Services at 3:37 p.m. and the building was evacuated, re-opening at 4:35 p.m., except for the third floor.

EngageMcGill to launch an online subject-sorted list of campus clubs and services
A group of students calling themselves EngageMcGill are trying to streamline student activism through the McGill web sites.
Scott Martones, U2 IDS and Sociology, and six team members have begun the project as part of Professor Marcos Ancelovici’s sociology class, Contemporary Social Movements.
They want to modify the myMcGill portal by linking it directly to a SSMU web site listing campus clubs and services with accurate descriptions, sorted by subject rather than alphabetically, along with a detailed event calendar with weekly updates.
“SSMU’s web site should be the place to find out about what is going on, how to get involved, but the newly-launched web site is not adequately publicizing events or opportunities for involvement with student groups,” wrote the group in an email to The Daily. “[Now] students have to go through multiple menus and broken links, and the events calendar does not include the majority of student events.”
SSMU recognizes the problem, according to outgoing VP External Devin Alfaro, but lacks the funding or staff to run a web site as they would like.
“[The web site is] definitely something that needs work,” said Alfaro. “It’s a really important way to communicate with students.”
“The most important thing I learned from Reclaim Your Campus was how to draw links together between issues on campus,” Alfaro added.
Although Reclaim Your Campus – a campaign to increase student mobilization on campus – attracted very few committed students, Alfaro noted several examples of successful reactive protests, including responses to the many threats to space for the Sexual Assault Centre of  McGill’s Student Society (SACOMSS) and the Architecture Café, as well as the teaching assistants’ strike.
“Students tend to mobilize in response to something being taken away; when there is no particular group, it is very hard to mobilize,” Alfaro said, a statement with which EngageMcGill agreed.
“We believe students are not necessarily apathetic, but appear so because of barriers to engagement,” wrote the group.
The supervising professor said that the proposed web site changes could help spur interest in campus groups.
“This idea of making campus activity accessible through the myMcGill page may not lead to huge action, but it can foster networking and create synergies,” said Ancelovici, although he cautioned students to move quickly for fear of the idea falling off the radar.
“Time is perhaps their worst enemy. Between courses, papers, and exams, basically, they have a window of two months. And lack of experience: very often they just don’t know where to start,” said Ancelovici. “But two or three people who know what they are doing will quickly spread their efficiency.”
Alfaro also said that the McGill bureaucracy inhibits student activism.
“To a certain extent, large organizations tend to be conservative,” Alfaro said. “The bias is to continue doing things as they have been done before.”
Ancelovici also noted that McGill had challenges specific to the University.
“Another problem is the career-focussed student body of McGill, who don’t really care about local issues – they just came here to study, not wanting to invest time in local issues.”
Martones, however, thought that rather than assign blame, this project could actually produce some positive results.
“It’s easy to blame someone else – students can blame administration, or the administration could blame the students’ disorganization,” said Martones. “But really, it’s a shared responsibility.”

Lack of cleanliness has contributed to bacterial outbreaks in some McGill hospitals
As few as one in four doctors at some McGill-affiliated hospitals wash their hands between patients, according to a hospital audit conducted by the Montreal Gazette and published on January 6.
This rate is not unusual, according to  Dr. Laurie Taylor, the Director of Operations of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute. Nurses fare only slightly better, according to the audit, scoring an overall rate of around 40-50 per cent.
The issue of sufficient hand washing in health professions hits home due to C. difficile, a potentially fatal bacteria that can cause fever and diarrhea. Canada has taken heavy hits from C. difficile; it spread like wildfire through Quebec hospitals and nursing homes in 2003 and 2004, and was responsible for nearly 2,000 deaths.
According to Wendy Nicklin, President and CEO of Accreditation Canada – a national, non-profit, independent organization that helps develop health safety standards – C. difficile has become a bigger problem during the past decade.
“There’s been an increased focus on infection,” noted Nicklin. “We’ve seen an increase in C. difficile and MRSA [another dangerous bacteria that often spreads in hospitals], and because of this, experts in infection prevention and control are trying to understand why. Hand washing has become an area of focus [for] health care organizations to improve their rates.”
 A McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) employee, who wished to remain anonymous, was unfamiliar with the source of the data but offered the opinion that the variation in rates of hand washing are due to differences between high stress and low stress areas in the hospital.
 “When you have [doctors] running around in the emergency department, these people are working very hard,” the health employee said. “Washing hands 100 per cent of the time is virtually impossible. In some areas, it’s easier than others.”
 However, emergency environments such as MUHC’s intensive care units were the areas of the hospital in which 60 per cent of doctors – the highest of any area in the hospital – washed their hands in between seeing patients.
 Taylor warned that varying institutions’ statistics can mean different things.
“[It depends] on how the data was collected – you have to be careful about comparing data between different organizations,” she said. “You have to be careful about how many observations there were and what time of the day and night they were being [collected].”
Nicklin noted that any organization with hand washing rates similar to MUHC could be prone to infection problems – though MUHC’s rate of handwashing is average.
“I would say in any health-care organization [infections could take hold]. I’m not sure the MUHC is any different from other health centres. I’m not sure that I would single out the MUHC,” Nicklin said.
Taylor suggested that patients should help themselves by keeping an eye on their doctors.
“You can be your own advocate when it comes to hand hygiene,” she said. “There is nothing wrong with asking your provider if they have washed their hands before they examine you.”
