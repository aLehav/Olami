New union to protect McGill casual employees
The Association of McGill Undergraduate Student Employees (AMUSE) was certified as an official union last month after a year-and-a-half-long accreditation process. Every casual worker at McGill, roughly 65 per cent of whom are students, will now be represented by the union.
The union was approved by the Québec Commission des normes du travail as a local of the Alliance de la Fonction public du Canada-Québec (AFCP-Québec). Veronique Allard, one of the lead organizers of AFCP-Québec, said the presence of AMUSE at McGill will close an important gap in labour standards on campus not filled by the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) for many employees at the McGill bookstore, libraries, food services, and athletic facilities.
“MUNACA represents the non-academic regular employees, but whenever someone used to go on maternity or sick leave, they would be replaced by casual [workers]. And these casuals did not benefit from the same working conditions put in place [for MUNACA members], creating a huge double standard system,” she said.
AMUSE’s accreditation process began a year and a half ago. From September of 2008 to April of 2009, volunteers collected signatures from casual workers indicating interest in unionizing. While the exact number is not public, volunteers signed between 35 and 50 per cent of workers. In a representation vote this autumn organized by the Commission des normes du travail, 85 per cent of voters supported the union.
Max Silverman, former SSMU VP External and volunteer coordinator for last year’s signature drive, said the idea of unionizing was well received by casual workers.
“When out card signing, we got an unbelievable amount of support. Everyone agreed there are lots of issues in the work place for casual workers and thought a union would help address those,” he said.
However, AMUSE members still have to complete several steps before they can begin negotiating a collective agreement with McGill, including organizing a general assembly, drafting bylaws, and electing an executive and bargaining committee. Allard anticipated this process would take a year for AMUSE.
Under Quebec labour law, all casual workers will be protected by the collective agreement and responsible for membership dues, though only members who sign membership cards will be eligible to run for office within the union.
Allard hoped the presence of AMUSE at the university would help to improve labour relations for undergraduate workers, which she felt were problematic.
‘There are so many people who are not unionized at McGill. I hope this is going to change soon on campus,” she said. “Casual workers are usually the most vulnerable, and the fact that there was so much support for this drive shows there’s still work to do to support these people.”

Provincial and federal impasse keeps students from receiving bursaries and grants
Student groups across Quebec are calling on the federal government to correct its mismanagement of the Canada Student Grants Program by transferring close to $118 million of financial support that has been withheld from the province.
The new grants program allocates $500 million in financial assistance to post-secondary students across Canada each year, replacing the Canadian Millennium Scholarship Foundation (CMSF), whose mandate expired on January 5.
Quebec opted out of the federal program since the province already administers Aid financière aux études, a loans and bursaries program for Quebec students. The province also opted out of the Millennium Scholarship, instead receiving an average of $70 million per year to support the provincial program.
No agreement has yet been reached to settle the terms for a fund transfer from the Canada Student Grant Program. According to Concordia Student Union president Amine Dabchy, negotiations between the federal and provincial government have failed to make progress. Until an agreement is reached, Quebec students are ineligible to access the new funding.
Dabchy condemned the federal government for withholding the funding that is due to Quebec students, as well as the provincial government for failing to reach an agreement with Ottawa.
“When the Millennium bursary was closed, the $118 million which belongs to Quebec was not given to the government. That means that a lot of Quebec students are missing out on the funds, which could go toward loans and bursaries.  We have all the rights to these funds,” he said.
Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, SSMU VP External, said that a cash transfer should be reached since the Canada Student Grant is funded by taxes paid by Quebeckers as well.
“The program as it stands right now does not provide eligibility for Quebec students, but it is of course coming from tax dollars that are provided from all different Canadians, from all different provinces. The province is not getting its tax dollars back for education programs,” said Ronderos-Morgan.
The demise of the CMSF resulted in a shortfall in student aid available in the province, which was made up for by funding provided by the provincial government.
According to Christian Pépin,  secretary of coordination in l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), however, additional investments made by the Quebec government would not excuse the federal government from making a contribution toward education in the province.
Provincial student lobby groups have demanded that the federal government not only make up for the shortfall, but also transfer funds from the grant equivalent to the per capita percentage of aid due to province of Quebec.
“New investments from the Quebec government shouldn’t substitute the money that should already come from the federal government. There should be some other money to improve student access, and financial aid for students, since there are lots of problems going on, and the money that is given now is below the rate of poverty,” said Pépin.
“Right now we are asking students to live with $200 per month, and that is below the decent revenue for students, students who work lots of hours, and it constrains them. By the end of the month they just can’t survive,” he added.
On December 2, 50 members of ASSÉ staged a protest in downtown Montreal to draw the attention of both levels of government. The protesters attempted to enter the Revenue Canada building and later tried to occupy the office of Quebec’s Finance Minister, Raymond Bachand.
“[The federal government] should transfer the money that is available with no conditions toward the Quebec government.… We will put pressure that the money [is used by the province] at the right place so that we can address the more deep problems about financial aid needed for students,” said Pépin.
Olivier Gégou, spokesperson for the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec, said that the federal transfer to the province would strengthen the financial aid mechanisms that already exist.
“If the federal program is not repatriated then there will be two programs for Quebec students, and every student from Quebec should do two applications for two different loans and grant programs,” said Gégou.
The protracted negotiations between the two levels of government have led student lobbies to demand a quick resolution to the issue so that Quebec students do not lose out in the semesters to come.

Summit fails to reach binding agreement
Last month’s climate summit in Copenhagen ended with   climate activists across the country denouncing Canada’s role at the summit as weak and counterproductive.
Canada’s official delegation – which was led by Minister of the Environment Jim Prentice and included McGill principal Heather Munroe-Blum as an advisor – drew ire from many delegations from the Global South. The delegation committed to a 3 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, as opposed to the 20 per cent reduction pledged by the European Union. One delegate from Rwanda demanded, “Can they not do math?”
Due to what many perceived as Canada’s failure to commit to substantive reduction targets, the Climate Action Network awarded Canada with the Fossil Award, which Toronto mayor David Miller accepted on Canada’s behalf.
“Like most Canadians, I’m embarrassed. I’m embarrassed that our government continues to be one of the biggest obstacles to reaching agreement,” said Miller as he accepted the award given to Canada by a coalition of 400 global NGOs.
Miller is the chair of the C40, a coalition of the world’s largest cities committed to tackling climate change. He marched with the Canadian Youth Delegation during the December 12 demonstration in Copenhagen for a comprehensive and binding agreement on climate change.
“Local governments and young people are the most powerful agents in the fight against climate change,” said Miller in a statement to the press prior to the march. “This Saturday, I will walk beside Canadian youth and I will ask our federal government to take immediate action domestically to reduce our emissions. We must ensure that our grandchildren have a safe future.”
Green Party leader Elizabeth May was also among the members of Canadian civil society groups at Copenhagen. She joined in criticizing the Harper government’s stance.
“The reason Canada kept winning the Fossil of the Day award in negotiations, at COP 12, 13, 14, and 15, was that we were actively obstructing progress,” wrote May in a press release.
Harper’s decision to prorogue Parliament has also been widely criticized as an attempt to evade backlash toward his government’s disappointing performance at the conference.
The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was established at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.
Frustration with Canada’s role in the negotiations eventually led to a coalition of delegates from Trinidad and Tobago, scientists, and activists demanding that Canada be suspended from the British Commonwealth until it adopts a more aggressive climate policy.
Several of the delegates and leaders from the Global South voiced frustration at the conference’s abortive attempts at a binding agreement on climate change. Bolivian president Evo Morales urged the United States to adopt the Kyoto Protocol, and called for an international system that holds countries accountable to their emissions reduction targets.
“Those who do damage to Planet Earth and those who do damage need to be judged,” said Morales in an interview with Democracy Now!. “And [toward] those ends, we have to organize a tribunal for climate justice in the United Nations.”
Morales also announced that Bolivia would host an alternative summit in April of this year.
Throughout the conference, delegations from several African countries and small island states threatened by rising sea levels pushed for a new and more effective climate deal that would limit long-term temperature increases to 1.5 ° C.

Doctors threaten to resign in protest as fears of health risks grow
A   fter a year of sporadic protests from local doctors and ordinary citizens, the uranium exploration near Sept-Îles, in northeastern Quebec, appears likely to end. The mayor of Sept-Îles, Serge Levesque, said on December 16 that the contract British Columbia mining company Terra Ventures had with the province of Quebec to explore for uranium in the area was unlikely to be renewed after it expires in February.
Opposition to the uranium project stems from fears of health risks to the local population. The mining site lies just 13 kilometres from a major water source for Sept-Îles and many local doctors are in staunch opposition to the project. Twenty-three doctors at the Sept-Îles hospital have pledged to resign and leave the region in protest since early December, and some of them have pledged to leave Quebec entirely, unless the National Assembly declares a province-wide moratorium on uranium mining.
Moreover, a poll released January 4 showed that 91 per cent of Sept-Îles inhabitants are still opposed to the floundering uranium project. 71 per cent of respondents are convinced that uranium mining presents health risks for people in the area.
Broad public opposition has been confirmed by occasional protests in Sept-Îles this past year.
The largest protest to date took place on December 13, when 1,200 inhabitants marched in the streets, opposing Terra Ventures and supporting the resignation of their doctors.
A turning point seems to have come on December 11, when the doctors threatening to resign met with two high-level public health officials, Alan Poirier, national director of public health, and Raymond Cloutier, public health director for Côte-Nord, to discuss the health risks presented by uranium exploration. They agreed to revise the government’s position, established in early 2009, that the exploration at Lac Kachiwiss was completely safe.
After the meetings, La Presse reported that Poirier said, “We have to evaluate…all the risk factors. We understand the concerns of the doctors.”
Two of the protesting doctors, Bruno Imbeault and Isabelle Gingras, said they felt their message had been well received by the officials.
Meanwhile, some government ministries continue to state that there are no health risks attached to uranium exploration.
Jacques Roi, the press secretary to Minister of Natural Resources and Wildlife Serge Simard, criticized the doctors on Friday, saying the purported health risks were based on a report that used data from between 1932 and 1980. Minister of Health Yves Bolduc has maintained that the uranium exploration is completely safe.
Also on December 11, Terra Ventures issued a press release signed by President Gunther Roeling, indicating an indefinite break in operations at Lac Kachiwiss.
On December 15, Serge Simard said that he had spoken with Terra Ventures and told them that “social acceptability” would be an important factor in the continuation of their Lac Kachiwiss site. Simard admitted that the people of Sept-Îles were clearly opposed to the uranium project.
In a meeting with Levesque, Simard reassured the mayor of Sept-Îles that Terra Ventures would have a difficult time proceeding at the nearby site. “We have every reason to believe the project will not continue,” said Levesque, after the meeting.
The Terra Ventures press release said, “construction work has ceased on the access route to the property,” a route that had been in construction until early December.
The release also explained that until a planned corporate reorganization, “no exploration plans will be formulated for any of its wholly-owned properties.”
Jacques Roi indicated that this “subtle” wording meant the company would not apply for a renewal of its government permit until the corporate restructuring was finished. There was no mention in the release of the public protests in Sept-Îles or the opposition of local doctors.
In casting doubts on the Lac Kachiwiss uranium exploration, Simard cited pending legislation to be debated in the National Assembly this spring, that will apply more stringent regulations on mining in Quebec.
Mr. Simard’s office notes that the new law will “leave a lot of place for communities to decide for themselves,” whether mining developments appear in their areas.
The minister’s press secretary, Roi, would not comment on the specifics of the bill. He said that the events surrounding Sept-Îles would not significantly factor into the creation of the mining law. La Presse reported on December 19 that Sept-Îles does, however, intend to participate in the bill’s creation.
