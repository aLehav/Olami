McGill doing “okay” on student engagement
Greeted by several members of Divest McGill who had come to offer a celebratory cake and attend the open session of the meeting, the McGill Board of Governors (BoG) convened for the first time this semester on February 2. The BoG approved a borrowing plan to address McGill’s urgent deferred maintenance needs and heard a presentation of the annual report on student life and learning.
The BoG approved the Building and Property Committee (BPC)’s proposed plan to address the university’s most pressing deferred maintenance needs, namely building infrastructure and technology.
According to the document, McGill suffers from “decades of underinvestment in infrastructure,” with an investment of about $1.58 billion being necessary to address infrastructure-related needs between now and 2021. However, even “by fully tapping all available sources of funds,” only $625 million is available, leaving a projected shortfall of approximately $953 million.
The plan recommends that the University request a new line of credit to facilitate borrowing for capital investments until 2019, and to issue a bond thereafter to finance the debt in the long term.
The BoG also passed a motion to enter into a grant agreement with the provincial government in support of “green chemistry” initiatives on campus. Associate Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations) Sarah Stroud called the initiative an opportunity for McGill to “step into a major leadership role in this field.”
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens presented his annual report for 2013-14, emphasizing a number of initiatives. These included the launch of the McGill App, the development of the “Counsellor in Residence” program, the first inter-university Iron Chef competition, and a review of the Fall 2014 orientation, which Dyens called “the best frosh in North America.”
When BoG Vice-Chair Claude Généreux asked Dyens if McGill had seen an uptick in student satisfaction with their experience at McGill, Dyens responded that McGill’s score on the National Survey of Student Engagement is “okay, not great,” but that student engagement in student government is higher at McGill than at other universities.
Dyens also noted that students were highly critical of the University’s advising services, but that about 90 per cent of students would recommend McGill. 
Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Secretary-General Juan Camilo Pinto asked Dyens if the University had data on student mental health, and if there were mechanisms in place to help students deal with high levels of stress. 
“We have mechanisms in place,” Dyens responded, adding, however, that some students choose to come to McGill for the challenging environment. He added that the administration was working to make regulations a bit more “understanding about what students are going through.”

BRIEF
Last Wednesday, the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) General Council (GC) voted to approve the amended Winter 2015 budget, and pass a motion supporting the ECOLE project.
The GC voted almost unanimously to approve the budget presented at the previous meeting by VP Finance Eileen Bui. The budget had been revised following the recent passing of two fees in an online referendum: an increase in the base fee, and the introduction of a student space improvement fee.
The majority of the SUS funds are to be distributed to departmental associations, while the income from the fee increase will be set aside in a separate fund for later use.
Notably, the budget set aside funds for a laptop lending program for students. The program will allow students to borrow laptops from SUS should theirs break. “The laptops will be available for students to use around the end of midterms and exams, because that’s usually when laptops tend to break,” said VP Internal Shaun Lampen. Three units have been purchased for the initial implementation of the program, with the option to purchase more if necessary.
The second motion, put forth by Representative to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Zacheriah Houston, was in support of ECOLE, a living and community space focused on sustainability on campus. The motion would grant ECOLE room-booking privileges with SUS, similar to other independent student organizations under SSMU.
“ECOLE […] is a great new student space. We have programming, we have skill-sharing workshops, we have film screenings. […] All in all, about 100 to 200 people walk through the space every week and it’s a really exciting project to be a part of.”
“ECOLE already gives us room-booking privileges and they book rooms with some of the student societies on campus, so I just wanted to formalize that process,” said Houston.
The motion also included a clause recognizing the importance of ECOLE, and asked that ECOLE be promoted regularly through the SUS listserv. SSMU Council will vote on a similar motion at its next meeting.
VP External Emily Boytinck, who is also a facilitator at ECOLE, spoke in favour of the motion. “ECOLE […] is a great new student space. We have programming, we have skill-sharing workshops, we have film screenings. […] All in all, about 100 to 200 people walk through the space every week and it’s a really exciting project to be a part of.”
Boytinck did not put forth the motion, nor did she vote on it, to avoid a conflict of interest.
After a very brief debate, the motion passed unanimously.

Members determined to be heard by Board of Governors
Members of Divest McGill celebrated the second anniversary of the submission of their first petition for divestment from fossil fuels on February 2. In the early afternoon, members met with Board of Governors (BoG) Chair Stuart “Kip” Cobbett to submit a new petition and a 150-page research brief, and, later in the day, attended the BoG meeting to offer the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) a celebratory card and cake.
“Exactly two years ago, we submitted for the first time to the [BoG], so this is a new way of celebrating the anniversary of our long relationship with CAMSR,” explained Divest McGill member Ella Belfer in an interview with The Daily.
Following a recommendation from CAMSR, which is tasked with advising the BoG regarding socially responsible investments, the BoG rejected Divest McGill’s original petition in May 2013. Since then, following a community consultation, CAMSR has updated its terms of reference to include grave environmental damage in its definition of social injury.
“Exactly two years ago, we submitted for the first time to the [BoG], so this is a new way of celebrating the anniversary of our long relationship with CAMSR.”
Divest McGill member Natasha Wey explained that CAMSR’s reasons for rejecting the first petition could have easily been addressed by Divest. In order to avoid a similar situation this time, the new petition is accompanied by a much more comprehensive research brief, and Divest McGill has also requested a follow-up question period to address CAMSR members’ concerns.
“Two years ago, our brief was a little over thirty pages,” Wey told The Daily. “The response we received asked a lot of questions that we felt were completely answerable. […] So this time we submitted a much more comprehensive brief that answered a lot of those questions and went into far more detail about specific injury of the industry […] and explained what each of those companies has done to harm, not only the environment, but also the people.”
CAMSR has recently applied for funding to the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) to conduct a study of responsible investment practices in other universities, which could delay the consideration of Divest McGill’s petition.
“Whether CAMSR will decide to go ahead with this petition before we’ve actually gone through the study, or whether they’ll think it’s more useful to wait until we’ve done the study – I just don’t know,” Cobbett said at the meeting with Divest.
“I think that would be a great excuse for them to delay reviewing this petition […] but I think it’s their responsibility as they’re undergoing this process to be transparent and accountable.”
For Belfer, using the study as a pretext for a delay would be unacceptable. “Given that the SPF hasn’t even approved the project yet, I think it would be ridiculous for them to delay the review of this petition,” she said. “I think that would be a great excuse for them to delay reviewing this petition […] but I think it’s their responsibility as they’re undergoing this process to be transparent and accountable.”
“I’m hoping that we’ll be able to at least present to them before the end of the school year,” added Wey.
As for the card and the cake, Belfer explained that they are intended to remind the BoG that Divest McGill is determined to hold the body accountable.
“This showing today is a reminder to the board that we’re really invested in this process – we’re not going away,” said Belfer. “We’re not willing to let them lead us along and play games with us for the next several months.”
Governors acknowledged Divest McGill members’ presence at the BoG meeting, and CAMSR Chair Gerald Butts accepted the cake on behalf of the committee.
“We’ve been met with somewhat friendly response so far; a cautiously friendly response, I would say,” said Belfer. “It’s been a long road between us and the Board, so I think this is a humourous reminder of that, but also a more serious reminder that we’re still around after two years.”

Council updated on Royal Victoria Hospital acquisition
At its February 4 meeting, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Council approved Secretary-General Juan Camilo Pinto’s resignation and heard an update on McGill’s acquisition of the Royal Victoria Hospital. Council also passed a motion to advocate for the suspension of tuition policies for students who exceed the time limit for thesis submission, and a motion in support of murdered and disappeared students in Mexico.
McGill Graduate Sociology Students’ Association (MGSSA) representative Jason Jensen introduced a motion for PGSS to advocate for the suspension of existing tuition policies for students who exceed the time limit to complete their thesis and are thus de-registered from the university.
Under the current policy, de-registered Masters and PhD students can submit their thesis within two years of de-registration, provided that they pay reinstatement fees equal to a retroactive charge for all semesters between the time limitation and the thesis submission.
“This is patently unreasonable, because it’s asking us to pay for services, i.e. student status, which we do not benefit from. You can’t benefit from student loans, you can’t benefit from bursaries, as well as student services on campus,” said sociology student Leslie Cheung in a presentation to Council on the topic.
“A lot of people are not aware that this policy exists,” added Cheung.
“This is patently unreasonable, because it’s asking us to pay for services, i.e. student status, which we do not benefit from.”
PGSS Health Commissioner Elizabeth Cawley commended Cheung for her presentation to Council. “I think that’s one of the best issues that’s been brought to Council this year,” she said.
In response to a question, Cheung noted that the Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (GPS) unit has recognized the need to revisit the policy, but is hesitant to take a stance against it for the moment.
“From what I can see, the position is that [GPS is] just willing to revisit it, but it may or may not end in the status quo,” said Cheung. “They do not take the position that [the policy] is unreasonable. Although individually as members, [Associate Provost (Graduate Education) and Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies Martin] Kreiswirth, Dean [of Students André] Costopoulos, [Associate Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies Heather] Goad, as well as the ombudsperson [Dimitrios Berk] have all taken personal positions against it.”
The motion, which passed, calls on PGSS to advocate for the immediate suspension of the current policy, to motion for its suspension at Senate, and to “work with McGill on creating new time limitation policies which are fair.”
Council accepted Pinto’s letter of resignation, submitted on January 20 following a Board of Directors motion of censure against Pinto on November 13 and a vote of no confidence by the executive on December 10.
The new Secretary-General is to be elected on February 24. Pinto indicated that he will assist the new Secretary-General for a week without pay to ensure a smooth transition.
“I’ve been concentrating on organizing all the documents, ensuring that the interim Secretary-General has a smooth transition and there’s no breakdown of communication,” said Pinto.
Council also passed a motion in solidarity with the 43 Mexican students who disappeared in the city of Iguala in September, presented by Association of Postdoctoral Fellows representative Illa Carrillo Rodriguez.
The motion mandates PGSS to write a letter of solidarity with the families of the victims and work to raise awareness of the issue.
Vice-Principal (Communications and External Relations) Olivier Marcil gave a presentation on McGill’s situation in the process of acquiring the Royal Victoria Hospital.
“We are struggling to find some new space […] to meet our academic purposes and enhance students’ life on campus. It is clear that on campus right now, we are really landlocked,” said Marcil.
A year ago, McGill officially informed the government of its interest in the hospital site, which is roughly a million square feet in size. Marcil said that, as of April 2015, the site will be empty and “might become an urban ghost.”
Marcil also shared his vision of creating a “green hospital” and converting roughly 50 per cent of the parking lots into a part of the Mount Royal Park.
“Since McGill is a green campus, and our students are walking, our profs do not have cars […] we don’t need all of those parking lots and we can give them back as green spaces to the mountain, and that will be the biggest enlargement of the Mount Royal Park [… in] a long time.”
If everything goes as planned, McGill will launch work on the site in 2017 and the site will open in 2021.

Many unions considering spring strike action
Correction appended March 19, 2015.
Across Montreal, universities are shifting the burden of provincial austerity measures onto students. While undergraduates at many institutions are facing higher tuition fees and larger class sizes, for teaching assistants (TAs), the cuts have meant a fall in real wages coupled with increased workloads.
“[Concordia’s] tried basically cutting every expense they could find […] they’re trying to cut everything,” said Robert Sonin, a Teaching and Research Assistants at Concordia (TRAC) union member.
He explained that the number of Concordia graduate students has climbed, while the TA budget has remained flat.
Quebec funds universities based on their number of weighted FTEs (full-time equivalent students), with graduate students garnering heftier subsidies than undergraduates. Increasing graduate admissions thus act to counterbalance funding shortfalls elsewhere. However, the result of an enlarged graduate student body is fewer TA contracts with fewer hours, and ultimately a lower rate of compensation.
“They take the money from the easy places where they know there’s less resistance, and there’s less resistance among students because [students] take what [they] can get,” Sonin continued.
He also told The Daily that TRAC is working to combat an unspoken norm under which TAs are expected to work more than their contracted hours. However, graduate students are not in a strong bargaining position; many are glad just to have a job, and are afraid to jeopardize what is often their only source of income. As Sonin explained, “If that’s how you pay your rent – you’re stuck.”
TAs at McGill are feeling similar repercussions of austerity. Justin Irwin, president of McGill’s TA union, AGSEM, agreed that TAs working well over their contracted hours is an “endemic issue.”
“They take the money from the easy places where they know there’s less resistance, and there’s less resistance among students because [students] take what [they] can get.”
In an email to The Daily, AGSEM Grievance Officer (and former Daily Publications Society Chair) Benjamin Elgie explained that because of unionization, “McGill has not been able to impose a wage decrease or freeze” on TAs in response to provincial austerity. However, he pointed to a “successive and sometimes drastic decrease in TA hours” despite rising undergraduate enrolment, as having a similarly negative impact.
At McGill, departments have offset cuts to teaching hours by employing more course graders, who do the same work as TAs but are not unionized. According to Elgie, graders “have minimal labour protections, as well as significantly lower pay with longer hours.” AGSEM is currently seeking to extend its membership to all teaching support workers, including course graders.
The Daily also spoke to Shanie Morasse, an executive member of Université du Québec à Montréal’s (UQAM) TA union, SÉTUE. So far, UQAM has mostly confined its cuts to professors, lecturers, and staff, who have suffered a 2 per cent wage drop.
SÉTUE is currently in negotiations with UQAM, which will announce its next budget in April.
“We’re anticipating a cut in the number of contracts, a cut in the number of hours contained within contracts,” Morasse told The Daily in French.
An actual decrease in TA wages at UQAM is unlikely given their already low pay rate, Morasse explained. UQAM graduate TAs earn $13.31 per hour, far below the $26.81 per hour offered at McGill. However, she noted that some courses have been cut, which has reduced the number of TAs required. “We’re looking [at] a fall in real wages,” she continued.
Asked what measures teaching unions were taking to protect their members, Morasse said that SÉTUE is “constantly in contact with the Printemps 2015 committee to keep an eye on what’s going on.” She candidly told The Daily that a strike at UQAM is almost a certainty at this point, and that SÉTUE will join “to put the pressure on” and “fight austerity.”
Sonin was more reticent about the prospects of a strike at Concordia. However, he echoed Morasse’s sentiment, saying, “It would be nice to see a strike in the spring.”
“This is the richest humanity has been – ever. The decision is where are you going to spend the money […] How are you going to divvy it up? That’s the point of a strike.”
Elgie confirmed in an email that AGSEM in currently in a legal strike position, but does not yet have a strike mandate. He added that a motion to strike could be proposed by any member, and that the union understands that “a number of other unions have members who are planning to bring strike votes for May 1 as part of a coordinated effort against the provincial cuts.”
In an interview with The Daily, Irwin explained that AGSEM was in contact with unions at other universities, but was unwilling to state which ones.
In 2008, a dispute with the University over standardized workload forms led McGill TAs to call a strike – which was a success. Indeed, with TAs across the city under strain from their universities’ reactions to austerity, several union representatives confirmed to The Daily that they saw value in retaliatory strike action.
Sonin argued that austerity is not, in fact, necessary. “This is the richest humanity has been – ever. The decision is where are you going to spend the money […] How are you going to divvy it up? That’s the point of a strike.”
A previous version of this article stated “Elgie confirmed in an email that AGSEM will not have a legal strike mandate until May, when it will finish collective agreement negotiations.” In fact, the end date of AGSEM’s negotiations is unknown. Additionally, the article should read that AGSEM is currently in a legal position to strike; however, it will not have a strike mandate unless a member-led motion to strike gains majority support.

Charges dropped for eighty protesters, tens of trials still to take place
In a statement released on January 28, the activist legal clinic Contempt of Court announced that over eighty people who had been charged and fined under the P-6 bylaw at the March 2012 anti-police brutality demonstrations had their charges withdrawn. The trial, set to begin on January 29, was cancelled by the prosecutor.
Municipal bylaw P-6, which regulates demonstrations, was amended in May 2012 to make it illegal to demonstrate without submitting a planned itinerary to the police. Over 3,400 fines, each usually amounting to $637, have been distributed since 2012, with hundreds of protesters contesting their tickets in court. In some cases, charges have been dropped, while others have accepted plea bargains or have been found guilty.
“The [P-6 bylaw] restricts our rights to peacefully gather and express our opinions in a public place,” Collège de Maisonneuve professor Julien Villeneuve told The Daily.
“It forces us to enforce [the] itinerary, if it’s not enforced then everyone can be held responsible for that, and that has a lot of problems, [one of which is that] it forces us to be our own police.”
Villeneuve, who became known as Anarchopanda during the 2012 protests thanks to his panda costume and mask, was arrested five times under P-6 and is involved in a multitude of legal battles over the bylaw. In addition to contesting his tickets, he is contesting the constitutionality of the bylaw in the Superior Court of Quebec, and is one of eight people spearheading class-action lawsuits against the city over conditions of arrest and detention.
He noted that many of the charges that have been withdrawn have been so due to technicalities such as legal proceedings that have taken too long or erroneously filed paperwork. However, for him, the real argument is over the constitutionality of the bylaw, which might clash with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.
“It forces us to enforce [the] itinerary, if it’s not enforced then everyone can be held responsible for that, and that has a lot of problems, [one of which is that] it forces us to be our own police.”
Villeneuve is also challenging section 3 of the bylaw, which prohibits protesters from covering their head with a hood or a mask without a reasonable cause. Villeneuve argued that there are several reasons to wear a mask that are in no way related to criminal activities.
“Those that are frightened of work repercussions, or people with a difficult legal status that might have problems with immigration, one could join a parade for gay rights while staying in the closet,” said Villeneuve. “We think that people have a right to express themselves [anonymously] in a public space – especially these days when everything is filmed.”
“[As things stand] the police could give P-6 bylaw tickets to almost everyone that’s not on their own [in] the public domain.”
The ambiguity of the bylaw is another issue, as section 2 restricts any “assembly, parade or other gathering” without prior disclosure, while section 3 prohibits wearing a mask without a “reasonable motive.” Villeneuve said that the interpretation of those terms is left to the discretion of the police.
“[As things stand] the police could give P-6 bylaw tickets to almost everyone that’s not on their own [in] the public domain,” said Villeneuve.
Last August, the Superior Court authorized eight class-action lawsuits on behalf of 1,600 people arrested under P-6, through which protesters are seeking compensation for their conditions of detention and arrest.
The kettling process used by the Montreal police is a tactic for containing large crowds during gatherings. It involves a large formation of police surrounding the crowd and moving in to contain the protesters so that they can be arrested or given tickets. Kettling was used during the student protests, such as when 518 arrests were made during a single demonstration in May 2012, as well as during the annual marches against police brutality in 2013 and 2014.
“We were detained for many hours without access to water or washrooms. Political profiling occurred, since police let some people go solely based on their age or clothing.”
“We were detained for many hours without access to water or washrooms,” Perry Bison, the representative for the lawsuit concerning the March 15, 2014 anti-police brutality march, said in French at a press conference on August 26. “Political profiling occurred, since police let some people go solely based on their age or clothing.”
“Of course, not having access to food, water or toilet for that long is really problematic,” Villeneuve told The Daily.
As for the constitutional challenge of the bylaw itself, Villeneuve said that he remains hopeful of the outcome of the judgement.
“The trial went really well as far as I’m concerned,” said Villeneuve. “Even an appeal judgement in our favour would be useful legally at this point, and I think we would win on appeal if it has to go that far.”

The Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office is running a photo contest about barriers to inclusion at McGill. The contest, for which members of the McGill community are asked to “submit a captioned photo highlighting barriers, myths, or examples of inclusion at McGill,” is part of SEDE’s Public Education is for Everyone initiative, or #Edu4All.
“One of [the contest’s] goals is to provide a platform for the broader McGill community to be able to shape discussions around equity, or lack thereof, at McGill,” SEDE Public Awareness Strategy (Communications and Events) Intern Cadence O’Neil told The Daily in an email.
O’Neil continued, “Everyone’s experience at McGill is unique, and this is determined in part by the barriers and supports in place at McGill, and the space created to discuss these realities.”
The scope of the contest is as broad as the range of barriers that exist at McGill. O’Neil outlined some of the issues centred in the few submissions that SEDE has received so far.
“Everyone’s experience at McGill is unique, and this is determined in part by the barriers and supports in place at McGill, and the space created to discuss these realities.”
“These submissions have highlighted a broad range of issues already, for example: the accessibility of equipment in offices at McGill, some of the reasons behind the underrepresentation of Indigenous students at McGill, and the lack of abuse and sexual assault support services for all members of the McGill community.”
Ultimately, O’Neil was hopeful that the contest would spur changes on campus beyond a discussion of barriers and accessibility.
“I […] hope that the important critiques and barriers being identified by students through this project will be taken seriously by other members of the McGill community, and will result in tangible changes,” said O’Neil.
“There is clearly a long way to go before public education is truly accessible and a positive experience for all, but SEDE is dedicated to helping that process along.”
SEDE will be accepting photo submissions until March 13.

BRIEF
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) recently implemented a new composting program, working to reduce resource use and waste production, and generate greater green awareness on campus. The program involves installing compost bins in the SSMU cafeteria and partnering with Compost Montreal, a local collection service that will take the organic waste, cultivate its decomposition into compost, and later redistribute it as soil amendment.
SSMU Environment Commissioner Kristen Perry called the project “part of ongoing efforts to improve the operational sustainability of SSMU.”
Perry highlighted one of the larger problems the program aims to tackle in an interview with The Daily. “Methane produced by food in landfills is around 24 times stronger than CO­2 as a greenhouse gas,” she said.
SSMU Environment Commissioner Keelin Elwood also noted that the project’s implementation will “reduce the landfill waste created by the SSMU building, while simultaneously educating the McGill community to be more conscious in regards to waste.”
SSMU faced some roadblocks in implementing the program, and continues to confront difficulties raising awareness. The most persistent problem is compost contamination.
“Often there are non-compostable items, such as styrofoam, plastic, or animal products, thrown in the bins, which usually means that the whole bag has to be thrown out,” Perry explained.
The program is fighting this by developing more targeted signage. Moreover, Perry told The Daily, “the Environment Committee also held a compost education week when members, wearing a banana suit, got students in the cafeteria to participate in our composting challenge.” Participants were told to determine which items on their trays were compostable and which were non-compostable.
Commissioners agreed that, ultimately, to fight the issue of contamination, more education is needed.
However, this can pose a challenge, Green Building Coordinator Alex Heim told The Daily. “It’s not only difficult to educate on composting, but also difficult to find students interested and committed to adopting a lifestyle like this on a daily basis.”

Jaggi Singh calls for global solidarity in anti-austerity activism
“I’m here to talk about people who fight for social justice,” said Jaggi Singh, addressing a small but engaged crowd at the Concordia Student Union (CSU) lounge on Wednesday afternoon. “Meaning a world where we don’t accept injustice, but confront it, and reject this corporate […] vision of the world, which I describe as, ‘It looks like Disney. It tastes like Coke. It smells like shit.’”
Singh, a well-known Montreal-based activist, spoke as part of Solidarity Concordia’s week-long teach-in on the growing movement against austerity in Quebec. His talk, “Resisting Capitalism and Austerity: From Seattle 1999 to Printemps 2015,” traced the history of the anti-globalization movement up to today’s anti-austerity movements, drawing partially on his own experiences on the front lines of protests across North America.
“The spirit of this presentation is to […] understand the different policies and measures that have taken place in the past and how they impact where we are today, and to understand the resistance to those policies,” said Singh. “That’s important: it helps inform how we’re going to resist today.”
Singh began his presentation with a survey of the various summits, trade agreements, and organizations that had, in recent decades, become flashpoints for anti-capitalist resistance. Each of these, said Singh, from the 1997 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Vancouver, to the 1999 conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, were “different facets of managing global capitalism in the interests of major corporations.”
The protests sparked by such events have succeeded in mobilizing tens of thousands of people, he explained, and brought the anti-globalization debate into the mainstream. Yet these demonstrations tend to be limited in one crucial respect: intersectionality.
“My point here is that capitalism inherently is quite barbaric.”
Singh argued that anti-WTO protestors in Seattle were fighting the same oppressive system as the Black Panther Party and Indigenous resistance groups.
“What’s unfortunate […] is that somehow, those movements, [involving] people of colour and their communities […] are seen as separate from the [economic protests],” said Singh. “Talking about abolishing the prison-industrial complex, and talking about police brutality, for a lot of people, is a distraction from the ‘real’ economic issues.”
Singh pushed the audience to keep this at the forefront when mobilizing in the future. “What I’m urging, as we […] look forward to Printemps 2015, is that we not make the same mistake.”
He continued, “If anyone ever tells you [… that] because you’re bringing up issues around feminism, or around race, or Indigenous issues, that that’s a distraction, we’ve got to fight, because it’s going to destroy our movement from within.”
“I think it’s really important to highlight the sweeping nature of the austerity measures,” Mike Finck, an organizer with Solidarity Concordia, told The Daily in an email. “How they touch not just university budgets, but public workers and healthcare, among others, and to take note of the important cross- sectoral bridges being made between students and workers.”
Singh also called attention to the “privileged position” of North American activists who, he said, are protected from the most damaging byproducts of global capitalism – sweatshops, poorly-regulated factories, and toxic waste dumps that are typically established in the developing world. As a result, these activists often lack solidarity with true anti-capitalist movements.
“When you have Western unions or […] social movements who are critiquing [social injustice], they’re often doing it in a way that’s not about opposing capitalism, but accommodating certain […] sectors of society.”
For example, Singh compared the stances taken by different groups in reaction to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), launched in 1994. Many unions in the U.S. and Canada, he explained, did not actually oppose the agreement, simply advocating for the addition of “social clauses” to protect workers’ rights. The Mexican Zapatista movement, on the other hand, adopted a far more radical approach: to protest NAFTA – which eliminated pre-existing laws protecting Indigenous land in Mexico – they launched a major armed uprising, declaring the agreement “a death sentence on their people,” said Singh.
Singh argued that activists must stop making compromises with capitalism. “My point here is that capitalism inherently is quite barbaric and savage.”

BRIEF
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Legislative Council met last Wednesday, where its members passed a motion to classify the Computer Science Undergraduate Society (CSUS) as a departmental association under the AUS, and discussed the upcoming launch of a new AUS mobile app.
The motion to recognize CSUS as an AUS departmental association was put forward by AUS President Ava Liu, VP Finance Li Xue, and Political Science Students’ Association (PSSA) VP External Gabriel Gilling. CSUS VP External Ian Karp spoke to the reasoning behind the motion.
“There are many students in the Faculty [of Arts] who are in computer science, a lot of people who are minoring or majoring, so it made sense that we’d become a departmental [association],” Karp said.
“To get people to vote, people have to be aware of what’s going on on campus.”
Tom Zheng, co-founder of app development company Kreate Solutions, gave a presentation to Council about the new AUS app, which is set to be launched on February 16.
According to Zheng, the app is meant to allow students to access all AUS-related information through one channel, and to give AUS representatives insight into what issues their constituents care about the most. Zheng also highlighted its potential for increasing election turnout, noting that AUS hit a record of a mere 21 per cent during the strike year.
“To get people to vote, people have to be aware of what’s going on on campus,” said Zheng.
Xue asked for clarification on the legal implications of the marketplace aspect of the app, where students could hypothetically advertise the buying and selling of textbooks. “In our Memorandum of Agreement [with the University], it says that we cannot be a medium for these sorts of activities because that goes through the bookstore.”
Zheng responded that, while no transactions actually take place on the app, AUS should display a disclaimer outlining any activities that the app should not be used for.
Xue also noted that the app was late, as it was originally contracted to be available for Frosh 2014.
A last-minute motion to approve the AUS operating budget was tabled at the request of Councillor Patrick Dunbar-Lavoie to allow Council more time to read the budget, which had been revised since it was last presented to Council, before voting.
Council also unanimously passed a motion to adopt a revised version of the Classics Students’ Association (CSA)’s constitution, which was last updated in 2011.

Black Students’ Network events discuss institutionalized racism
February is Black History Month, and student organizations, spearheaded by the Black Students’ Network (BSN) at McGill, are organizing a multitude of events to raise awareness of black history and expose the institutionalized systems of racism that, to this day, work to oppress black people.
“We really wanted [the events] to be a celebration of talent in McGill and the black communities,” said BSN Internal Coordinator Richenda Grazette.
Black History Month begins as the BSN’s longstanding efforts to stimulate campus discussion about race continue, especially after the events surrounding Ferguson, and organizers hope the panel will help to stimulate discussion. “We talked a lot about police brutality, specifically last semester, and now we are looking at anti-blackness more generally,” Grazette told The Daily.
Events include “Soul Food Friday!” and “Fro-back Thursday” (an open-mic night), which aim to celebrate black culture and entertainment. Others, such as Children’s Day, are geared toward contextualizing blackness in Canada for Montreal youth.
Grazette said that Children’s Day is geared toward students from Westmount and James Lyng high schools. “We are hoping that they will walk away with new ideas about what they can do after high school, and [learn] about black history and black innovations,” Grazette explained.
“The black Canadian historical absence is so stark and so blinding that black children can still go to school in Quebec for an entire lifetime and never hear about themselves in their history texts,” Rachel Zellars, a moderator of one of the upcoming Black History Month panels, told The Daily.
“I am concerned with the psychic violence that this entails, as well as the emotional and physical violence that lands on black children’s bodies within our public schools […] it is a kind of violence that happens very broadly in this city.”
“One of my greatest hopes is that we can start questioning, as a normative practice, what Canada says about its history and its relation to its black population; that is, who Canada holds itself out to be nationally and internationally,” Zellers added.
On February 16, BSN will host a panel called “Discourses of Race: The United States, Canada, and Transnational Anti-Blackness,” as part of the David A. Freedman Speaker Series. Renowned scholar and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates will be one of the speakers.
“We are hoping our audience walks away with greater knowledge about the way anti-blackness manifests in North America and new perspectives on the black experience,” said Charmaine Nelson, a professor with McGill’s department of art history and communication studies and a speaker at the event.
Nelson asserted that the “failures of early education” contribute to ignorance by not offering the opportunity to learn about black history. “If you look at Canadian education from kindergarten to university, how many people of colour are actually teaching, are principals, are deans?” Nelson asked.
“There is institutional racism in the fabric of our educational systems in Canada which means […] that our questions aren’t being asked.”
Nelson explained that these discussions are crucial, given the existence of institutionalized racism in Canada. “Most Euro-Canadians, most white Canadians, do not understand the deep colonial history of the country […] because they come from a position of white privilege, which means that they don’t have to know that history if they don’t want to.”
She noted that the very existence of Black History Month signifies racism on a deeper level. “Not even 11 months a year, but 12 months a year, we are always being given what is really white history or Euro-Canadian history in the context of this nation,” Nelson argued. “But the problem is that we don’t really call it that.”
“My wish is, of course, that Black History Month becomes obsolete because black histories are so a part of the narratives that we tell ourselves and a part of the national consciousness that that we don’t need to set aside a month just to do that,” Nelson expressed. “But we are far from that [reality].”

Prof and students weigh in on landmark decision
On February 6, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously struck down the blanket prohibition on physician-assisted suicide in Canada. 
The government has one year to rewrite legislation to comply with the decision. When it comes into effect, Canadians will have a legal right to demand assisted suicide under the condition of a “grievous and irremediable medical condition.” They must also be “competent” and consenting adults.
“I put it alongside the abortion decision of Morgentaler and the decision on same-sex marriage as an important moral step that Canadian societies are ready to take,” McGill law professor Daniel Weinstock told The Daily.
The court ruled that sections 241(b) and 14 of the Criminal Code, which prohibit physician-assisted suicide, infringed upon Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states that everyone has a right to life, liberty, and security of the person.  
Further, the Court decided that the prohibition’s infringement on Section 7 rights was more than minimal. Extensive evidence convinced the Court that the objective of the prohibition, to protect “vulnerable persons” from committing suicide, could be met by less drastic means, and that physicians could reliably assess patients and apply the informed consent requirement. The prohibition therefore could not be saved by appealing to Section 1 of the Charter, known as the “reasonable limits clause.”
“[The provinces] will very likely look to Quebec for ideas.”
The ruling is also favourable to provincial Bill 52, “An Act respecting end-of-life care,” that was passed into law last June, legalizing physician-assisted suicide in Quebec. 
The Court credited Bill 52 as an influencing factor in the decision. “It forms part of the context in which the judges took their decision,” Weinstock noted. “The judges know that this legislation exists and that it has very broad support among the population.” 
Massimo Orsini, a first-year law student at McGill, agreed that Bill 52 will be an important blueprint for future legislation. “The Supreme Court [gives] provinces time to draft appropriate [legislation], and they will very likely look to Quebec for ideas,” Orsini told The Daily.
Orsini also said that the impact of the decision is important for law students. “It reminds us to be humble, that the law isn’t something divorced from social life but rather something that applies in some of our most intimate moments,” he told The Daily. 
Kyle Ng, a first-year medical student at the University of Ottawa with experience in bioethics, agreed that this verdict will have a great impact on the medical community.
“This decision has far-reaching consequences in every field of medicine from birth until death,” he told The Daily. “I can’t think of anything more impactful to medicine today.”
Ng was, however, skeptical of the Court’s ruling against blanket prohibition.    
“I can’t trust that the medical profession will get this entirely right, 100 per cent of the time,” Ng said. “We have to come to grips with the fact that the medical profession is not perfect – there will be mistakes.” 
He also emphasized that mental health problems that lead to thoughts of suicide should be addressed adequately. 
“Cases untreatable and unresponsive to palliative care are exceedingly rare compared to suicidal ideation,” he said. “I’m not going to say the Supreme Court is wrong, but we are going to suffer a huge loss in society if we don’t figure out problems of mental health and palliative care in advance, before this decision gets implemented.”
