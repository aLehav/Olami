The Daily discusses grassroots advocacy with prominent activist Wade Rathke
Wade Rathke began his career in activism by organizing against the Vietnam draft with the group Students for a Democratic Society, while he attended college in Williamstown, Massachusetts in the late sixties. In 1970, he founded the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which represents the interests of lower-income communities across the United States. He stepped down from his position as ACORN’s chief organizer in June 2008. Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau announced its disaffiliation from the group after two employees were caught on camera offering business advice to two individuals who were masquerading as a pimp and a prostitute. Rathke spoke at Concordia’s Samuel Bronfman Building Tuesday evening, promoting his new book, Citizen Wealth.
McGill Daily: Why did you found ACORN and what is its political mandate?
Wade Rathke: ACORN is a membership organization of lower-income working families that began in the United States, largely because there wasn’t an organized voice for such families and neighbourhoods. People started coming together and trying to build some power to address [issues like] housing or income or wage or health issues.
MD: Do you see the recent scandal – the U.S. Census Bureau’s disaffiliation from ACORN – as a deliberate attempt to smear the organization?
WR: After being there for 38 years, it’s very saddening and painful for me to see the Republicans and right wing try to target ACORN because of its association with President Obama, and because they really don’t want poor people to have an organized voice. The census thing is a manufactured issue. [ACORN] was simply telling people they ought to be willing to be counted in low-income neighbourhoods, which is actually a huge problem in the census. So it doesn’t hurt ACORN per se, but this new McCarthyism [that] is raging in the United States – I think that is a very frightening thing for any organized group – labour or community or anything else – that’s [otherwise] allowed to continue unabated and to succeed.
MD: Why do you think ACORN has become the scapegoat of the right wing press?
WR: I’ll be damned if I know but I think it comes down to a frighteningly simple thing. One, it is poor people, and they believe that it’s easier to bully them, and they don’t like the fact that they’re standing up. And secondly, the organization is largely minority-led; the majority of its membership are African-Americans and Latinos. Clearly, you can watch these pictures of the town halls and these ruddy-faced overweight people yelling at the top of their lungs; that’s not the ACORN constituency.
MD: ACORN has been active for a number of years in fighting predatory lending and more recently, it has encouraged people facing foreclosure to stay in their own homes.
WR: Yes, while I was there, ACORN was very involved in trying to stop predatory practices of subprime lending that were essentially luring people into loans that – [when] they qualified for regular mortgage rates – were putting them in disadvantaged situations. So we got agreements with Countrywide, which at that time was not owned by Bank of America and was the biggest [mortgage bank], to try and stop some of these activities. [Currently] the foreclosure crisis is spreading and it’s very difficult for many families to navigate their way out of this. While I was there the government kept announcing programs to help people facing foreclosures but there’s no progress. I have read that there have been a number of efforts – and ACORN’s is one of them, but there are many of them – where people are saying “stay in your homes” until the government finally does succeed in getting the servicers to agree to modify mortgages.
MD: In recent years the liberal media has been paying closer attention to how private lobbies have managed to alter legislation. Do you see ACORN as an organization that needs to work within the lobby system or do you see that system as being inimical to its interests?
WR: Well, I don’t think it’s a system we can work in. The kind of system you’re talking about – the private lobbies – is really pernicious. It’s amazing, for instance, the bailouts of Wall Street, and all the money people got and what they gave away. [Yet] Wall Street lobbyists and bank lobbyists were still all over Congress afterward, preventing real regulation from coming in to correct those problems in the future. I think any membership organization is certainly not a lobby; you have to represent your members, and ACORN and similar organizations and unions have been very aggressive in standing up and communicating – not privately and in smoke-filled rooms and behind closed doors – but very publicly saying, “this is not the way you can do business.”

Quebec Education Minister Michelle Courchesne and Senator David Angus announced last Monday at McGill’s Otto Maass Chemistry Building that the University would be receiving a grant of $103 million from the federal and provincial governments. The grant, which comes through the Knowledge Infrastructure Program, a part of January’s $12 billion Economic Action Plan, will invest in a brain imaging centre at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, new life sciences facilities at the Macintyre Medical Building, renovations at the Otto Maass Chemistry Building, and new facilities at the MacDonald Engineering Building.
These upgrades, according to Principal Heather Munroe-Blum, are designed to “address a few of our most urgent maintenance projects that have been deferred for several years” and to “allow McGill to attract the next generation of brilliant Canadian innovators.”
Arti Sharma, director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, a lobby group which works to attract deferred maintenance funding for post-secondary institutions, called the move a “band-aid solution,” and added that it will go only part of the way to reversing a trend of brain-drain from Canada’s universities due to budget cuts made in the nineties.
While upgrades to McGill’s science facilities will doubtless be a boon to the University, some are wondering why new buildings are being constructed while old ones, such as the Leacock Building, are in a dangerous state of disrepair. The cause of the mysterious illnesses of eight secretaries at Leacock last year, which some believe was linked to contact with muriatic acid fumes due to a failure of the ventilation system, has still not been fully addressed by the University.

Scholarships assist the children of deceased Canadian soldiers
Project Hero, a new scholarship program that waives tuition for the sons and daughters of fallen Canadian soldiers, has made its way to Concordia University and several other Canadian universities.
Initially the vision of retired Canadian general Rick Hillier and honourary lieutenant-colonel Kevin Reed, Project Hero will reach out to financially dependent children of soldiers killed while on active duty. Eligible candidates must be 26 years old or younger and full-time undergraduate students at participating universities.
Concordia’s Director of Media Relations, Chris Mota, said the decision to adopt Project Hero was a simple one.
“We learned about the project from a member of our board of governors. Soon after, the University wanted to get on board right away,” explained Mota. “It simply made sense.”
At McGill, Project Hero has not been overlooked. According to Morton Mendelson, McGill’s Deputy Provost, the program is being put into effect here as well.
“We have been working on implementing the program for some time and it was finalized this week,” said Mendelson. “Although no general advertisement has been made as of yet, we will be announcing this decision to the McGill community shortly.”
Once an announcement has been made, applications will be available to students in the Scholarship and Student Aid Office.
“After hearing about the project, we looked at our own scholarship program and asked ourselves, ‘How can we make this work?’” Mendelson explained. “It fit into our program reasonably and allowed us to do our part in supporting the Canadian Armed Forces.”
Judy Stymest, Director of McGill’s Student Aid, felt that Project Hero reflected McGill’s tradition of aiding the families of Canadian soldiers.
“McGill, like many universities, has a history of support for the families of soldiers,” said Stymest. “We have an aid program for the families of soldiers who were in World War I and II, which is still in existence.”
According to Mota, Concordia has had a long-running relationship with the military.
“After World War II, when many G.I.’s returned home, several attended Concordia,” said Mota. “We’ve been there to get them back on their feet.”
“Although there may be individuals who are for or against Canada’s presence in Afghanistan, the University decided that this was not the time for such a debate,” Mota said. “Instead, we chose to support the families.”
According to Heather Mac-Donald, the Media Relations Officer of Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), VAC does have programs to assist children of veterans or members of the Canadian Forces in financing their educations.
“One such program is the Educational Assistance Program, in which surviving children of deceased veterans and Canadian soldiers receive funding for their education,” said MacDonald. “Another is a program that partially reimburses the tuition of former students.”
Nevertheless, MacDonald does not feel that Project Hero is redundant. “Project Hero is very important in demonstrating that Canadian universities are recognizing veterans and the service they provide. This is invaluable support.”
“Those who serve our country deserve our respect,” Mota said. “They have made the ultimate sacrifice and the least we can do is help their children aspire to a higher education.”
For Mendelson, giving special aid to the children of fallen soldiers is McGill’s duty as a Canadian institution.
“Symbolically, Project Hero is very important,” Mendelson emphasized. “It is a small measure we can take to demonstrate our support for the families of Canadian soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice.”

Students, staff upset by change in prices and policy
What happens when student suggestions for improving campus life get misinterpreted? In McGill residence cafeterias, students are now adjusting to a new dining system that some wish they hadn’t asked for in the first place.
For years, students in Royal Victoria College (RVC) and Upper Residences – Molson, McConnell, Gardner, and Douglas – had been curious as to why their cafeteria system only had limited hours of operation, no weekend food services, and a fixed, albeit large, portion of food at each meal – a system that generated a lot of waste.
Administrators are now saying that they’ve responded to years of student feedback by extending dining hours until 10 p.m., keeping the cafeterias open on weekends, and providing more flexible meal options. All residence students now have declining balances and are permitted to spend 85 per cent of their funds at their home residence, and the remaining 15 per cent at campus food spots. This split ensures that McGill Food and Dining can cover their contractors’ fees at each location.
Students are still dissatisfied, however, due to hikes in food prices. A standard dinner costs around $13, and students are charged extra for healthy items like salads – which used to be free and unlimited – and fruit. Instead of paying extra – like $1.05 for an apple – some students are eating less and complaining that food services are overpriced and monopolistic.
The meal plan is mandatory for all students in the Upper Residences, RVC, New Rez, and Carrefour, and each is serviced exclusively by McGill Food and Dining – a new centralized body comprised of the former Residence Dining and McGill Dining offices.
Concerned students have already prompted McGill Dining to tweak their price system. Yesterday morning, students arrived for breakfast to find that all meal prices had dropped by an average of $2 – a small victory.
Part of this development can be attributed to a petition started by Patrick Dibb, a resident at McConnell who quickly garnered the support of 120 of his peers.
“Various meal options were ridiculously overpriced,” he said. “They were wringing us dry on every single little thing.”
Dibb, however, was not able to get his petition accepted by anyone in the administration, and admits that the petition’s role will be negated by the election of Food Reps from each residence.
There are still several kinks to work out in the new dining system. Floor fellows who were familiar with the old system are now complaining that the sense of community around the dinner table has disappeared with the extended meal times.
In addition, students from RVC are finding it difficult to manage without their cafeteria at Sherbrooke and University – an ideal lunch spot for students during the day – which is closed for major renovations and won’t be open until January 2010.
The new Carrefour residence only has breakfast and snack service, and their residents must travel to New Residence Hall to eat most meals.
As with most shocks to a system, it appears that the adjustment of students and staff to the new system has been slow. With luck, students’ feedback will be duly noted by the administration throughout the year, and McGill Food and Dining Services will eventually establish a viable and pragmatic arrangement.

Reports on McGill’s highest bodies
Research and recruitment
McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) convened for the first time this academic year on Monday. Members of the administration announced their intentions to continue to develop McGill as a research-intensive university with a focus on graduate programs. A lack of resources – due to both an endowment affected by the economic crisis as well as a decrease in government and private research funding – has factored heavily in the administration’s plan to attract graduate students who are in high-revenue fields.
In a presentation about research revenues, questions were raised about the significant drops McGill has seen compared to the other top-five Canadian research universities over the past four years. Denis Thérien, Vice Principal of Research and International Relations, said the trend is due in part to the time it takes grant money and investments to be accounted for in the University’s budget. He added that McGill has also failed to prioritize research and graduate subsidies in comparison to several other universities.
McGill cuts $1 million in health benefits
 “We have to stay extremely disciplined,” said Principal Heather Munroe-Blum regarding the University’s current financial situation, “Tough decisions will have to be made.”
 One such tough decision will be a cut of $1 million from the University’s employee health benefits program.
 McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) member Trevor Garland submitted a petition of over 1,000 signatures that calls the cut to employee health benefits “unfair and unjust.”
 MUNACA Vice President of Labour Relations David Roseman later commented that MUNACA doesn’t intend to refuse cuts outright, but wants to renegotiate the terms of their collective agreement to rearrange their health benefit plan, rather than reduce it.
 University governance
The Quebec government has introduced Bill 38, which would control university governance by setting up specific requirements to be met by administrations across the province – including a clause requiring 60 per cent of a board of governors to come from outside the university.
Munroe-Blum, as a member of the Conference of Rectors and Principals of Quebec Universities (CREPUQ), said she is working to create a proposal rejecting this lobby by the government.
Chairman of the BoG Robert Rabinovich echoed her statements, saying the bill would “infringe on the independence of the University.”
Course packs delayed
 The McGill Senate convened for the first time this year on Tuesday, and high on their agenda was a motion tabled by education professor Alenoush Saroyan asking the administration to explain why course packs were printed late this September. Saroyan took issue with the administration’s decision to stop using Eastman Systems – the company McGill has relied on for the past 10 years – and to move the printing in-house. This year, McGill Ancillary Services took over the job of printing course materials – a move Saroyan argued was not in the best interest of faculty or students.
Associate VP University Services Jim Nicell replied that despite 10 years of work with Eastman, the company’s contract was up for renewal and that moving publishing to McGill would cut costs by making the most of using digital resources – instead of paying copyright twice on material the University already owns.
He informed Senate that the delays were due to start-up problems, such as working out legal details and purchasing new printing equipment, and that Ancillary Services has added a third shift to their staff who are now working around the clock to print the 11 remaining course packs.
 H1N1 pandemic preparation
Geography professor Tim Moore raised concerns over the University’s handling of H1N1 prevention. He questioned the Senate on whether the administration’s “social distancing” – avoiding groups of people – would  actually be effective. He also asked whether the University has any medical steps in mind for dealing with a pandemic, and if hand sanitizers will be made available on campus.
The administration responded that the University has been working on pandemic planning since last June, but that the key to prevention was personal hygiene. While hand sanitizers will be made available at various locations across campus, it was stressed that prevention comes down to washing your hands and sneezing with etiquette.
Some senators commented that hygiene at McGill becomes rather difficult when washrooms are left a mess.  Principal Heather Munroe-Blum responded that the University would take all necessary measures to maintain hygiene, regardless of the cost, if more janitors are required.

On September 9, student unions from Carleton University and the University of Ottawa succeeded in lobbying the Ottawa City Council to rescind the age cap on student discount transit passes. Previously, students over 28 years of age paid the adult rate – a policy student groups viewed as discriminatory against older students.
Union members presented a petition with 2,400 signatures demanding that City Council recognize that students face financial barriers, regardless of their age, and that the policy be reversed.
Ottawa City Council voted unanimously to rescind the ruling. Each student over 28 is now eligible to purchase OC Transpo student passes – which equates to about $200 in savings a year.
Erik Halliwell, President of the Carleton University Student Association, told The Daily that convincing the non-student population to understand and support the student cause is the key to reversing discriminatory policy.
“Doing your best to make it a public issue is going to really help you in your fight. Councillors need to feel the heat sometimes in order to change,” Halliwell said.
In Montreal a student must be under the age of 25 in order to purchase student fares, while a student bus and subway pass in Toronto is only available to students between the ages of 13 and 19.
Montreal student unions are gearing up to take the issue to the City this year – in hopes that Montreal will follow Ottawa’s example.
SSMU VP External Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan told The Daily that removing the arbitrary age cap in Montreal is already one of his top priorities.
“We are going to demand that there is accessibility to the Metro Transit System for all students, specifically when it comes to reduced fares for passes, on a non-discriminatory basis – and that of course refers to the age cap,” Ronderos-Morgan said.
He was enthusiastic about cooperating with student unions from around the city in order to lobby candidates in the upcoming municipal elections, including groups from Université de Montréal, various CÉGEPs, as well as the Post Graduate Students’ Society of McGill University (PGSS).
In an email to The Daily, Ladan Mahabadi, Vice-President External of PGSS, said that the External Affairs Committee is currently pursuing a plan to develop a total transit pass for full-time students at McGill, similar to the Vancity U-Pass program which provides students with unlimited Translink access for $23.75 a month.
“It doesn’t seem like there is any justifiable reason for the age cap, outside of financial limitations that the STM might have, but financial constraints shouldn’t dictate whether policy is discriminatory or not,” Mahabadi said.
