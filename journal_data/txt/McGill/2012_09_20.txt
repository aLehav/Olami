Marois reveals new cabinet
The $1625 tuition hike announced last year by the Liberal government of Jean Charest is to be cancelled today, according to Éliane Laberge, the President of the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Quebec (FECQ).
“[The Parti Québécois (PQ)] told us that they would announce it after their first ministerial meeting,” Laberge told The Daily in French.
Because the hike is not a law passed by the National Assembly, the tuition hike can be repealed by a ministerial decree.
The news came hours after Pauline Marois, the newly elected premier of Quebec, unveiled her new cabinet in Quebec City.
Marie Malavoy, an outspoken supporter of the student movement, was appointed Minister of Education, while Pierre Duchesne, a former journalist with Radio-Canada, was chosen to be the Minister of Higher Education.
“We will mainly be working with Mr. Duchesne, and we met him briefly at the National Assembly,” Laberge said. “It’s refreshing to be working with someone who’s very open toward young people.”
Like her predecessor Jean Charest, Marois will be in charge of Youth Issues. Léo Bureau-Blouin, the former president of FECQ and the youngest Member of the National Assembly (MNA), will be her parliamentary assistant.
“We’re not disappointed that Léo isn’t a minister,” Laberge said. “But we’re happy to see that he was elected to the National Assembly.”
In a statement on its website, the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Quebec (FEUQ), said that it welcomed the appointment of Duchesne as Minister of Higher Education.
“Mr. Duchesne met students during the last FEUQ congress in August, and they saw how accessibility was an important issue for him,” the statement read in French.
At a joint press conference yesterday, FEUQ and FECQ announced that they would be willing to “work to increase student accessibility as well as the quality of teaching.”
A media spokesperson for FEUQ told The Daily that more details over the planned summit on higher education – a forum designed by the PQ to address university funding and accessbility – would be announced later today at a press conference. The student associations have not yet been informed of the date and content of the summit.
The second-largest student association, the Coalition large de l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE), was absent from the conference.
“We used to work more with CLASSE,” Laberge said. “But now, not so much.”
CLASSE could not be reached for comment by the time of press.

Departments’ bank accounts to be centralized or completely externalized
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) is considering centralizing the finances of its various departmental associations as it seeks to restructure its own finances to comply with the Memoranda of Agreement (MoA) signed with the McGill administration.
AUS is also in negotiation with some departmental associations regarding the possibility of these associations becoming independent of AUS.
The MoA, which outlines the relationship between AUS and the University, requires AUS to complete financial audits every year. If the conditions of the MoA are not met, the administration will not release student fees to AUS.
According to AUS President Devon LaBuik, the Society has not delivered audits to the University since 2008 – the same year that departmental associations’ bank accounts were externalized, meaning that departments took control of their own finances.
“This was not an issue because the McGill administration had let it fly for so long,” said LaBuik. “However, going into this year they wanted a full audit, otherwise they refused to release our fees.”
McGill’s Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet told The Daily that each accredited student association needs to produce an annual audited statement of its finances, proof of insurance, and proof of incorporation.
“An audited financial statement is required to make sure that the money the University collects from students and hands over to AUS is, in fact, properly managed and properly spent,” said Sweet.
AUS VP Finance Saad Qazi told The Daily that since departmental associations’ bank accounts were externalized, the lack of financial reporting from the associations left AUS without enough records to finalize the audits.
Re-internalizing departmental association bank accounts is only one of the options AUS is currently contemplating, but according to LaBuik, it would be the easiest to implement.
Some of the larger department associations – such as Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, and English – held a joint meeting to discuss the effects of this measure on their autonomy.
According to Political Science Student Association (PSSA) President Talitha Calder, re-internalizing would deeply affect the association because it is the biggest in the Faculty of Arts.
“We receive the largest financial allocation from the AUS each year. We receive an allocation of about $3700 each year, and we put that toward events…we make expenses on a weekly basis,” said Calder.
If PSSA were re-internalized, the AUS would once again control its bank accounts, affecting the departmental association’s expenses.
“Our biggest concern is that it would slow down our ability to hold events, and in some ways we are concerned about the departmental association’s autonomy as an organization,” she added.
Qazi mentioned that AUS’ financial track record has also raised doubts among departmental associations.
Qazi told The Daily that he began his term at a time when AUS had a large amount of debt.
“The AUS originally had savings of around $90,000 to $120,000…then they cashed in the savings to the checking account, but then those got taken over by the Quebec government for delinquency on filing taxes. So we have currently $100,000 frozen by the Quebec government, but we are hoping that because our tax status is also now updated for the first time in the last three years, [we’ll get the money] sometime in October [or] November,” he explained.
McGill has released around $50,000 in AUS fees, which the Society used to pay off last year’s debts, according to Qazi.
“We have done all that McGill has asked of us, in terms of making sure that an audit for this year occurs,” he said. “So hopefully the fees for this semester of Fall 2012 will also be released.”
An alternative to internalization would be for the departmental associations to take on greater responsibility and perform the same level of financial reporting as AUS, according to Qazi.
Calder said that the PSSA was given the option to “re-internalize the account, or the external departments would just become completely externalized and have to become their own associations, like their own non-profits, similar to the AUS.”
A final decision has not yet been made, as AUS continues to consult its financial auditors.

Advisory board includes one undergraduate student
McGill announced last spring that the process of finding a replacement for Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum, following the completion of her second five-year term on June 30, 2013, was underway.
A 14-person advisory committee has been formed to narrow down the pool of replacement candidates. The final candidate pool will be put before the Board of Governors (BoG), who will have the final say regarding the appointment.
The University has also retained the consulting services of international headhunting firm Odgers Berndtson.
According to Advisory Board and BoG Chair Stuart Cobbett, the pool of potential candidates is a broad one.
“Anybody who is qualified is being considered. We’re going to find the best candidate, whether they come from inside, outside McGill, in Canada, outside Canada,” he told The Daily.
The committee has already started considering candidates, but a decision will not be made – or released – until sometime this winter, he said.
The advisory committee is comprised of four current BoG members, two alumni appointees, two Senate appointees, two McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT) appointees, two elected members of the administration and support staff, one undergraduate student representative, and one post-graduate student representative.
According to Stuart, “the opinion of each member of the committee is equal to another member of the committee. If you want to put it that way, one person one vote.”
However, he added that consensus – and not necessarily unanimity – would be sufficient to send a candidate to the BoG for consideration.
SSMU VP University Affairs Haley Dinel is the only undergraduate student on the advisory board. Dinel admitted that representing the interest of over 22,000 undergraduates is no easy task, but explained that these advisory boards are created according to the statutes of the University and are very difficult to adjust.
Dinel also pointed out that the advisory committee solicited student feedback online, and several public consultations were open to the public and publicized to the university-wide community.
Consultations were held “before the end of school term – we deliberately wanted to have the consultations before everybody disappeared for the summer,” according to Stuart.
Consultations officially began on May 1, the day after the winter term officially ended.
Despite this, Dinel said that the board spoke to “literally hundreds of students and professors to hear what they wanted in the new principal.”
Regarding undergraduate representation on the advisory board, Dinel also commented that the principal’s portfolio is chiefly concerned with fundraising, and not student affairs.
“The principal doesn’t spend much time dealing with students, it’s not their primary duty,” she said.
For Dinel, it will be imperative that the new principal be politically aware. “It must be someone who speaks French and who can understand the Quebecois and Canadian context… someone who has political allies. And especially considering the events of the past year, government relations are super important.”
A search is also currently underway for a new Dean of Students and Deputy Provost.

A family demonstration of approximately 100 protesters marched through downtown Montreal on Sunday, despite Parti Québécois (PQ) leader Pauline Marois’ promise to repeal the proposed tuition hike. After staging a sit-in on the corner of Ste. Catherine and Union, two demonstrators were arrested for “mischief on a car” and a “death threat,” according to the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
Sources on Twitter said that a third arrest was made, but that the protester was released.
The demonstration began at Parc Laurier at 1 p.m. and was declared illegal from the outset, according to the SPVM. The march eventually met another contingency of protesters at Parc Émilie-Gamelin around 2 p.m.
At the front of the procession, holding a banner, was newly formed group Amnistie Générale, followed by several other community and neighbourhood groups such as the Mile End Assemblée Populaire Autonome du Cartier and Mères en colère et solidaires.
McGill Philosophy Professor Alia Al-Saji was in attendance with her Mile End neighbourhood assembly.
While the demonstration’s Facebook event claimed a partly celebratory nature due to the repealed hike, Al-Saji said she felt that “part of the point is that a lot of what the students and the popular mobilization have been fighting is more than the hike. It’s about wider austerity measures and wider privatization of social services. It is also about a kind of form of democracy and a way of being heard….this manif is to say that democracy isn’t just about staying quiet, and voting, but it’s actually about having your voice heard and organizing at the local level.”
As the march worked its way westward on Ste. Catherine, the SPVM announced over a loudspeaker that the demonstration was illegal and that protesters needed to leave. Upon hearing the announcement, Amnistie Générale immediately disbanded.
Following the announcement, at approximately 2:45 p.m., about 15 other protesters staged a sit-in.
One of the leaders of Amnistie Générale, a student at Cégep Marie-Victorin who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily that her organization was there to “do some manifestations for the general amnesty of everyone.”
The CEGEP student did not partake in the sit-in because they had “already been arrested four times.”
The sit-in continued until 3:30 p.m., when a squad of SPVM officers arrived to break it up. Moments after their arrival, police officers on bikes chased after one protester who was eventually arrested on University and charged with “mischief on a car.”

Activists discuss Turcot, education
Last October, Occupy Montreal took over Square Victoria, renaming it Place du Peuple and transforming the square into a tent city. This weekend, a similarly diverse group organized Occupons le Sud-Ouest, an occupation of Parc Sir-George-Étienne-Cartier in St. Henri.
François Genest, an active participant of Occupy Montreal, doesn’t think that the lack of a permanent home substantially changes the nature of the movement.
“Obviously we can’t have any tents anymore, but we can still continue to meet in public spaces and say, we’re here, the problems are still here, and we are working with the people.”
“Welcome Home” was chalked in French on an asphalt pathway, and next to a play area with children’s toys there was a “free market” where clothing, books, and other miscellaneous items had been laid out in the grass for people to give or take as they wanted.
Workshops were held at the park throughout the weekend.
Shannon Franssen, spokesperson for Mobilisation Turcot, gave a presentation about the Turcot Interchange project, which aims to halt plans made by the Charest government to renovate and expand the major highway intersection between St. Henri and Côte St. Paul.
According to Franssen, “The current project has some really disastrous effects on local neighbourhoods, but it also has some disastrous effects on all of Montreal and is going to cost the taxpayers about $1.5 billion dollars more than it should.”
On Sunday, people from different Assemblées populaires autonomes de quartiers (APAQs), neighborhood organizations that emerged during the mobilization and general discontent of last spring, met to share ideas about popular education.
Christine Dumas, an active member of the Hochelaga/Maisonneuve APAQ, said that these groups have great potential as tools for political organizing and bringing about tangible change.
“[An APAQ] is a place to take hold of the dialogue, a place where projects for the neighborhood and for the society can emerge, and it can go in all kinds of different directions,” she told The Daily in French.
McGill Political Science student Hugo Martorell attended Occupons le Sud-Ouest and participated in the workshop on popular education. He has also been involved in the Alternative University Project at McGill, which aims to re-imagine the way that people think about education.
“In March, [Alternative University organizers] started realizing that there were other groups that were doing the same thing we were doing, and there was this willingness to build a network, and trying to get out of your own social groups that you are predestined to be in, and being in this experiment where you learn from people that have different experiences from you,” he explained.
St. Henri Municipal Councillor Sophie Thiébaut spent most of the weekend at the park.
“An event like Occupons le Sud-Ouest allows elected officials to listen to the population, because I think that there are few places where you can hear what people think about politics,” she told The Daily in French. “So [this is] a place to listen, and also a place to exchange, because an elected official is, above all, a citizen, and nothing more than a citizen.”
Occupy Montreal activist Paul Bode told The Daily, “The reaction to [the neighbourhood occupations] has been great, and this is going to be our last one of the season probably, but we’re going to do them all again in 2013.”
This weekend was Occupy Montreal’s sixth occupation of a public space since a four-day reoccupation of Place du Peuple in May.

Essay-writing service attracts desperate students
Montreal-based business UnemployedProfessors.com is billing itself as a fool-proof way for students to circumvent plagiarizing software without doing their own assignments by providing customers with original content written – allegedly – by actual academics.
Unemployed Professors currently employs 30 professors, according to the Montreal Gazette.
The website operates through a bidding process in which professors compete for requests submitted by students.
The Daily submitted a prompt to the website to evaluate these bids, and within minutes of submitting a prompt for a generic history assignment using 15 primary sources, two professors had bid on the project.
Using the pseudonym “Professor-Rogue,” the first bidder demanded $250 for the ten-page paper, promising a two-day delivery.
Professor-Rogue’s profile stated that they hold an “Ivy League BA, Ivy League MA (Sociology), Ivy League MA (Political Science) and a Big State School PhD (Political Science).” On the Unemployed Professors blog, Professor-Rogue claimed to hold “a relatively good position at a top-flight University.”
The Daily could not verify these claims.
Professor-Rogue also described themselves as an “academic prostitute.”
“When I write a custom essay, I’m selling my cognitive function, my ability to regurgitate complex information in a coherent way,” Professor-Rogue wrote on their blog.
Professor-Rogue received a rating of five stars on the website, based on 71 student reviews. One anonymous student commented, “Excellent work, as usual! Exhaustively researched and persuasive.”Another claimed that “[the work] was so well done, I thought my teacher wouldn’t even think it was me who wrote it!”
The second bid for The Daily’s prompt was from “History-Mistress,” who asked for seven days to complete the project at a rate of $25 per page.
Although the company claims all of its writers are “current and former academics and graduate students who teach their own classes, with advanced graduate degrees,” History-Mistress only claimed to have a Bachelor of Arts from “a top tier school” on their profile page.
The Daily did not accept either bid.
In defence of its service, Unemployed Professors states on its website, “the academic system is already so corrupt, we’re totally cool with [being really unethical].”
Professor-Rogue echoed this sentiment in a blog post entitled “Don’t Hate Da Playa; Hate Da Game,” in which he stated that “the PhD market is oversaturated” and that administrators and football coaches are “pocketing mad cash.”
“Education has become a commodity,” wrote Professor-Rogue.
Linda Jacobs Starkey, interim Dean of Students at McGill and Chair of the Enrolment and Student Affairs Advisory Committee (ESAAC) Subcommittee on Academic Integrity, told The Daily, “As an academic, Chair of the Subcommittee on Academic Integrity, the existence of such sites is clearly disappointing. That our students could be drawn to them is a big concern. It’s too bad these sites are there and that students use them.”
“Students that use the service are not trying to scam the system,” she continued. “Students could fall down on a paper and make bad choice and we have to wonder what went wrong. These students lack confidence as learners to express [their] analysis and interpretation.”
Beginning this semester, graduate students must complete a mandatory online academic integrity tutorial. Next year it will be mandatory for undergraduates as well.
“Notions of research ethics and academic integrity have impact. If we prepare our students about academic integrity, and if they have confidence to show their thinking, we can prevent plagiarism,” said Starkey.
U3 History and Political Science student Samuel Felix Harris, whose friend has used a similar service, believes that Unemployed Professors “shows a bad flaw in the academic system…a blatant example of when the system is broken” and that students use the website out of desperation, “[seeing] no other way of completing these papers they have to submit.”
“Because of the academic integrity warning published on every syllabus at McGill, everyone knows what plagiarism is,” he said. “Arts papers are easier to plagiarize because you can get away with writing a paper without attending a class.”
He added that while plagiarism detection software such as Turnitin is a “decent idea”, “requiring research proposals would be helpful in preventing plagiarism because they force you to engage in the topic you are purportedly going to write about.”
According to the Committee on Student Discipline Annual Report published by the McGill Senate, 164 allegations of plagiarism were made at the University in 2010-2011, 31 of which were against graduate students. 55 students were ultimately exonerated.

PQ summit on higher education a main topic of concern
In an informal discussion forum in the Shatner Building on Tuesday, a handful of students and strike organizers met to reflect on the past seven months of the Quebec student movement and to contemplate its future.
The primary concern of the discussion was the upcoming summit on higher education, proposed by Parti Québécois (PQ) leader Pauline Marois upon her electoral victory.
Little is known about the format of the summit, which is expected to take place this winter, and students expressed apprehension about participating in a forum where the terms of discussion are dictated by the opposition.
“Students need to be at the centre of the discussion and debate to develop not only the process, but to put out the issues that are the most relevant,” said Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) External Affairs Officer Errol Salamon.
Students discussed holding a counter-summit as an alternative, either prior to the PQ summit or at the same time.
“Any kind of mobilization after the summit will be a reaction,” said Jérémie Bédard-Wien, Financial Secretary of Coalition large de l’ASSÉ (CLASSE).
“We cannot let the government dictate the political agenda, we must take action before that,” he continued.
With the strike over and the tuition hikes on hold, the difficulty now lies in mobilizing students against a threat that is no longer imminent.
First-year Law student Kevin Paul stressed the importance of “the twenty-twos,” mass demonstrations that take place in Montreal on the 22nd of each month.
“They are becoming increasingly a matter of routine,” said Bédard-Wien. “We are demonstrating, but why? What for?”
With students back in school, the importance of maintaining momentum and mobilizing students new to the movement was emphasized.
“There is a lot of potential at McGill to develop union culture,” said Bédard-Wien. “We must make sure that what has started at McGill is kept up.”
