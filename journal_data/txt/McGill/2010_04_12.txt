Journal de Montréal employees start up new publication
Search 4545 Rue Frontenac on Google Street View and you will see picketing workers on the sidewalk outside of the Journal de Montréal head office. Although the image is from last October, 253 unionized employees – journalists, photographers, editors, and office workers – have been on the pavement since January 2009.
But it’s not picket lines or protests that have garnered media attention for the union – it’s ruefrontenac.com, the online newspaper that the locked out journalists started in 2009 in order to continue covering local news.
The Quebec Superior court recently overturned a labour board ruling criticizing the paper’s  parent company, Quebecor Media, for the illegal use of replacement workers during the lockout.
The Syndicat des travailleurs de l’information du Journal de Montréal (STIJM) and the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) are currently appealing the decision.
The Quebec Labour Code stipulates that companies cannot hire new employees to work in the establishment during a strike, though the law – dating from the 1970s – does not clearly elucidate what the “establishment” is.
Newspapers use this ambiguity to continue to produce content through remotely performed labour, which undermines the spirit of the Labour Code, according to Darin Barney, an associate professor in the department of art history and communication studies at McGill who also serves as the Canada Research Chair in Technology and Citizenship.
“The Labour Code exists to protect workers and their work, not workplaces. That the employer in this case would claim that work performed remotely, and submitted or gathered online, does not violate anti-strikebreaking provisions of the Labour Code is disingenuous at best,” said Barney in an email to The Daily.
Going home
The lockout began with a failure to reach a new collective agreement when the Journal de Montréal workers’ contract expired on December 31, 2008.
The STIJM and CSN have launched a campaign involving a web petition denouncing Quebecor’s behaviour, asking the provincial government to use all available means to bring parties to the negotiating table.
“The more the public knows about the issues, the more they are outraged,” said Pascal Filotto, secretary general of the STIJM. “The average [Journal de Montréal] reader doesn’t get the full picture. We have seen massive support from students and others who are getting their news online.”
Media conglomerates have been restructuring in response to new media sources, real-time information, and declining revenue from classifieds and advertising.
Quebecor has claimed that they have offered union employees “the best [pay] in the industry” and generous severance packages.
The union, however, refuses to accept Quebecor’s deal, which includes the layoffs of 75 employees, a 20 per cent reduction in benefits, a 25 per cent pay cut for classified workers, fewer rights for new hires, and the employer’s freedom to reassign employees to produce online or multimedia content without pay.
Quebecor also wants to expand the 30-hour work week to a 37.5-hour week. With a four-day work week being typical for most francophone dailies, this would mean an unpaid fifth workday.
Filotto said that more than just pay is at stake. “This is a fight worth having – not only for us, but also for the public and the integrity and quality of journalism as a profession,” he said.
Going independent
Filotto expressed fears about Quebecor’s new business model, which has seen the newsroom and publicity department uncomfortably close.
The first edition of a new Quebecor weekly, L’Écho de la Rive Nord, ran an article positing the health benefits of tanning beds. The only source cited was the owner of four tanning salons, who had also bought an ad on the first page.
Rue Frontenac has enjoyed considerable investigative and editorial freedom. In September 2009, the web site broke a corruption scandal involving municipal politician Benoît Labonté, which led to his resignation as leader of the official opposition party, Vision Montréal.
“It’s been a very interesting journalism laboratory. We’re able to do things we weren’t able to before,” said Filotto.
Rue Frontenac isn’t the first union in Quebec to publish independently. After being locked out in April 2007, Journal de Québec workers launched Média Matin Québec (MMQ), a print daily they distributed for free during the 15-month labour dispute. The venture cost their union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, $5 million.
Despite having considerably more editorial and investigative latitude than at the Quebecor-owned papers, independent models like MMQ or Rue Frontenac lack reliable streams of revenue, and are not viable in the long term.
“I think what the [Journal de Montréal] workers are facing is an economic and technological situation in which it is becoming easier than ever to be a journalist, but also increasingly more difficult to make a living as one,” said Barney.

After a year-long battle in Senate, harmful research disclosure left out
Research with potentially harmful applications will see few regulatory restrictions at McGill, following a decision made at Senate on March 24. This year, McGill has seen a long and arduous debate over its newly passed Regulations on Conduct of Research policy, which has ultimately omitted the ethical regulations sought by the campus group Demilitarize McGill.
The debate over the new policy has focused mainly on the removal of regulations on research funded by the military, and the need for a reporting system established within the policy to monitor any research that is funded by non-peer-reviewed sources, as well as research with potentially harmful applications.
“Just as we have ethical reviews of research on human subjects…I think that we can ask those kinds of questions [for any research],” said law professor and Senator, Richard Janda. “Particularly, I believe we should ask those kinds of questions when the sources of money that are being given for research are not peer-reviewed granting councils.”
Students from Demilitarize McGill started working with the administration in 2008 to tighten regulations on military-funded research that were in the old policy, and to extend those regulations to any research that could have potentially harmful applications.
In February 2009, Associate Provost (Policies and Procedures) William Foster presented a draft of the new research policy to Demilitarize McGill and the then SSMU VP (University Affairs) Nadya Wilkinson. The draft contained a new section that required researchers to obtain approval from the VP (Research and International Relations) to undertake research which has significant potential for direct harmful applications or adverse effects.
This section was removed from the new policy at its first reading in November, however, along with some of the policy’s pre-existing regulations.
After the November Senate meeting, Demilitarize McGill submitted another proposal of amendments, but they were not included or addressed in the second reading in February.
The policy was finally reviewed by the Academic Policy Committee, which was deeply divided on the issue and ultimately struck the regulations on research with military purposes or any potentially harmful applications.
The document went to a vote in Senate in March, where it passed almost unanimously.
Throughout the entire debate, the administration was reluctant to consider any regulatory obligation to disclose harmful applications that could stem from research. The administration reiterated at each meeting, in and outside the Senate, that there was an urgency to push this policy forward as is.
“The policy is ready to be adopted right now, and every month that goes by without having a document like this is dangerous [and] is not good for the University. We need this to come in force as soon as possible,” Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations) Denis Thérien said at the February Senate meeting.
The administration consistently argued that McGill must stay in line with other large research universities in Canada, which do not have such policies in place. Many researchers – students and professors alike – were concerned that these policies would add an unnecessary burden on researchers, and that it would be impossible for researchers to identify all possible applications of their research once it is in the public domain.
“We’ve been hearing that it’s too cumbersome,” said Janda on a CKUT live broadcast in early March, “but the fact is our social responsibilities require us to think about things that are not entirely certain. All that we’re asking researchers to do is think about the problem, report about it, and have the University keep track of this…. Seems to me it’s entirely consistent with the role of the University.”
Nikki Bozinoff, member of Demilitarize McGill and former editor at The Daily, said that she was not shocked by the decision made by Senate in March.
“Demilitarize McGill has always maintained that ethical review of research with harmful applications will become the norm one day.  The question here is whether McGill wanted to lead that movement, and it’s clear that they weren’t up to the task,” said Bozinoff. “We urge students to engage in creative direct action to oppose harmful research.”
Demilatirize McGill is currently undertaking a project to archive potentially harmful research done at McGill, including research conducted during the ’80s, when weapons research at McGill was first exposed by a group of students and professors.

SPHR accused of defamation of character
Incoming SSMU president Zach Newburgh threatened to take legal action against McGill’s chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) on April 3 if the group refused to drop their Judicial Board hearing within 48 hours, according to two sources.
SPHR allowed the deadline to expire, and the Judicial Board meeting went ahead as scheduled Friday night. As the Daily went to press, a lawsuit had not been filed.
SPHR called for a Judicial Board hearing on March 17, accusing Newburgh of bias while chairing the February 10 General Assembly (GA).
The Judicial Board heard the case on Friday evening, but has not made a ruling.
One of the motions voted on at the GA was submitted by SPHR, and called for SSMU to establish a committee that “will thoroughly investigate McGill University’s involvement with companies on the basis of negative ethnical practices.”
The preamble of the motion mentioned the Israel-Palestine conflict within the context of ethical investments and boycotts, drawing ire from pro-Israel campus groups.
SPHR holds that there was a conflict of interest, given that Newburgh is the president of Hillel Montreal, the umbrella organization that links the various anglophone Hillel student groups on Montreal campuses, including Hillel McGill.
When the motion was brought to the floor of the GA, the clauses  referencing Israel-Palestine were struck by popular vote.
SPHR cited a January 28 meeting between SPHR and Hillel McGill members, attended by Newburgh. According to Nafay Choudhury, lead counsel for SPHR, the two parties adjourned for five minutes, and Newburgh spent the break in private with the members of Hillel McGill.
“The conversation Hillel McGill [had in private] points to what we don’t know,” said Choudhury. “No equivalent meeting was held with SPHR.”
However, both Newburgh and Hillel McGill president Mookie Kideckel claimed that Newburgh refused to voice an opinion for the entire duration of the meeting, including the private meetings.
“Zach refused to say anything. We wanted him to say something, but he didn’t,” said Kideckel.
One key issue from the January meeting involved GA procedure, specifically whether a preamble clause could be amended. Newburgh confirmed that he told both parties at the meeting that such clauses could not be amended. The night before the GA, Newburgh received a call from Corey Omer, the clubs and services representative to SSMU and VP (External) of Hillel McGill, who directed him to a passage in Robert’s Rules – the legislative procedure for General Assemblies – stating that preamble clauses could be amended after certain motions had been passed. SPHR said they were not made aware of the change until Newburgh brought it up in the assembly.
“It took everyone somewhat aback,” said Choudhury.
Newburgh’s lead counsel, Max Reed, said that it was unrealistic to expect the speaker of council to know every rule in the 600-page Robert’s Rules book. SPHR countered that, as speaker, it was his job to know all of Robert’s Rules.
SPHR claimed they had begun to review Robert’s Rules before the GA, but that their meeting was disrupted when they discovered SPHR member Alexa Romanelli’s Facebook account had been hacked, cancelling the GA event she was administrating. McGill security was unable to trace the hack.
SPHR also contended that Newburgh’s bias was revealed during the GA when he threatened vocal members of the assembly with ejection, but failed to act on these claims.
Reed said that Newburgh followed all of Robert’s Rules to the letter, including the speaker’s ability to eject members of the GA.
“A motion must come from the floor [to eject members of the Assembly],” said Reed, implying that Newburgh was not legally allowed to follow up on his threats.
“If the motion passed without incident, if everyone was perfectly happy, Mr. Newburgh would still be biased – which in my opinion makes no sense,” concluded Reed.
Newburgh confirmed during the hearing that he made SSMU aware that there could be a perceived conflict of interest if he chaired the Winter GA. Newburgh said SSMU president Ivan Neilson told him he would chair the GA anyway. Newburgh said that these facts undermine the SPHR allegation of a conflict of interest.
“Their arguments don’t seem to hold,” said Newburgh. “I myself knew that there was potential conflict of interest. I had given full disclosure to the executive and they gave me full support. They told me that as an employee, I would be doing my job chairing the meeting.”
Max Silverman, former SSMU VP (External), thought Newburgh had performed well at the GA, given that it was a highly-charged, divisive event.
“I think Zach actually did a pretty good job, all things considered,” he said.
Silverman sent a Facebook message to Newburgh expressing a similar sentiment after the GA. Newburgh cited the message in his respondent factum before the hearing, but when Silverman learned of it, he issued Newburgh a cease and desist order, and the message was pulled from the factum.
Despite Newburgh’s performance at the GA, Silverman said that even the appearance of a conflict of interest undermines the process.
“Regardless of how highly one thinks of Zach, the optics of it make it appear as if there would be a conflict of interest and the mere appearance of a conflict of interest can delegitimize the process,” said Silverman.
Neilson said that Newburgh was in danger of having this rift with SPHR define his presidency, but was confident in Newburgh’s ability to reconcile with SPHR, as well as all other student groups.
“Regardless of the outcome, he’s just going to have to work a little bit harder to demonstrate not only to the members of SPHR, but really to everyone, that that’s not what defines his presidency, that he really brings something more to the table, that he won’t allow this to be a distraction, and really not to try to ignore the past, but just to try to move on and proactively engage student groups,” said Neilson
“I don’t think he’s trying to bring an overly aggressive attitude, despite whatever facts are floating around,” said Neilson. “I think that…he’s seeking mediation, that he’s trying to find a solution, and that next year he will bring that sort of attitude to any other conflict.”
SPHR’s factum calls for a public reprimand of Newburgh by the Judicial Board or an official apology from him.

Nine programs to be reviewed by federal body
Nine programs in the McGill Faculty of Engineering are going up for accreditation renewal next year.
In order to be accredited, the programs have to meet new standards set by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), a process that will involve some restructuring.
It’s created a lot of work for the faculty’s academic committee, whose last meeting had 83 items on the agenda. The academic committee has reviewed every program to make sure it meets all the requirements and has an adequate number of contact hours, or academic units.
Associate dean James Clark, who chairs the engineering academic committee and the committee on teaching and learning, said that there’s a 100 per cent chance that McGill’s engineering programs will pass accreditation, and that it’s more a matter of doing well enough in the review process that each program earns the maximum accreditation period of six years before another review has to take place.
Jonathan Lipsitz, Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) VP (Academic) and student representative on both committees, has sensed some skepticism about the new requirements over the past year.
“The professors don’t really like changing around their whole thing, because we’ve been putting out perfectly good engineers for the past 50 years,” he said. “However, they do realize we need to do this to keep being an engineering program.”
“It seems like a lot of work that needs to be done that might not necessarily justify the efforts put into it,” Lipsitz said. “A lot of people are working really hard to satisfy these new requirements, [and] once we’ve satisfied the new requirements, I don’t see us being that much improved from what we were beforehand.”
Lipsitz added that the process stands to affect CEGEP students the most, as their transfer credits may no longer be counted the same way. Clark said that the restriction on transfer credits is nothing new and isn’t going to change with the new requirements, though McGill is constantly pushing the CEAB to count more CEGEP transfer credits.
According to EUS president Andrew Doyle, there was serious concern earlier in the year about passing the accreditation process.
“There’s a certain minimum number of professors that have to be in each program – and a [minimum number] who have to be professional engineers,” said Doyle. “The dean of engineering [Christophe Pierre] is a junior engineer, not a professional engineer. There was a worry that we were going to lose accreditation…. Other schools have failed, and it’s serious.”
According to Clark, Pierre was not certified because he was coming from the U.S., where professors are not required to be licensed in the same way.
Now, Doyle said, with accreditation pending, Pierre will be taking the exam to become a professional engineer. “It looks like we’re on track,” Doyle said. “I have total confidence that he’ll be able to pass.”
Though some of the new CEAB requirements deal with the numbers of instructors with specific credentials each program should have, Clark said that the regulations should not affect personnel changes within the faculty.

Critics say changes might endanger lives, restrict right of appeal
Canadian minister of citizenship and immigration Jason Kenney announced an overhaul of the government’s system for determining refugee status last week. The proposed changes focus on expediting the asylum claims process, deporting failed claimants as quickly as possible, and reducing the costs of processing claims.
The changes reflect Kenney’s statement in an interview with CTV to “give faster protection to real refugees while sending the message to bogus claimants that you’re not going to be able to use the system in Canada anymore.”
The overhaul would significantly shorten the decision-making period for refugee claimants. Government appointees would screen initial asylum claims before their claims reach the independent Immigration and Refugee Board. The minister would also have the legislative authority to categorize countries as safe or unsafe countries of origin. This designation would restrict the ability of claimants from “safe” countries to appeal a rejection.
The current system involves a 19-month wait with about 60,000 backlogged claims. Overall, the ministry has said the reforms would reduce the cost per failed claim from $50,000 to $29,000.
Critics have taken issue with Kenney’s priorities for reform. A  press release from the advocacy group Canadian Council for Refugees criticized Kenney’s continuing use of terms like “bogus” with regard to claims as  “extremely damaging,” and went on to add that “not everyone who makes a claim needs protection but that doesn’t make them ‘abusers’.”
Janet Dench, executive director of the Council, characterized the bill as overly reductionist. “The bill is based on the assumption that it’s clear and easy to tell between those who need protection and those who don’t. Our position is that refugee determination is quite difficult.”
Dench said the government is trying to group claimants on the basis of nationality and other characteristics, while refugee status should be determined on a case-by-case basis, especially to account for discrimination in countries otherwise deemed respectful of human rights.
“The minister is giving himself the power to declare some places safe. In the case of gays and lesbians in places like the Caribbean, these are often claims that are successful although they come from countries that are considered safe and peaceful. They won’t get the opportunity to appeal that claim,” said Dench.
Melanie Carkner, a spokesperson for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, said in an email that Canada’s current asylum system was “crippled by long delays” and a “cumbersome process” that resulted in claims taking years to resolve.
“The proposed reforms are balanced and fair and would increase support for those in need of protection while discouraging many of the unfounded claims that now burden the system,” said Carkner.
Moreover, claimants would be restricted from filing an appeals case for one year after receiving the decision on their application. The proposal to enforce timely removals, however, would see most failed claimants deported before that time is up.
Stephen Green, chair of the Canadian Bar Association’s Citizenship and Immigration Law Section, acknowledged that under these time restrictions, claimants would not have adequate time to file humanitarian claims.
The government has also proposed a pilot program to offer financial assistance and incentives to those about to be deported, and $54 million for a resettlement assistance program that helps refugees from camps and urban areas throughout the world settle in Canada.
NDP MP and citizenship and immigration critic Olivia Chow echoed many of the concerns.
“The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has stated that even in democracies there are still grounds for persecution based on gender or sexual identity,” said a statement on Chow’s web site. “For example, Mali may be a democratic country, but they still practice genital mutilation. We simply can’t assume a country is free from all forms of persecution.”
Even under the current system, there have been cases where those not granted refugee status have returned to their country of origin only to face the threats they had originally fled.
In 2007, Enrique Villegas, a gay Mexican citizen whose application for refugee status had been denied four years before, was found dead in his Mexico City apartment. Last year a deported 24-year-old anonymous Mexican woman known only as “Grise” was murdered after having twice been denied refugee status in Canada.
Previous efforts to expedite the refugee claims process included visa requirements for Mexican and Czech citizens starting July 2009, in a bid to keep potential refugee claimants from entering Canada for economic reasons.
Canada’s refugee acceptance rate typically hovers between 40 and 50 per cent, while the U.K. and France, whose immigration models these reforms resemble, both have accepted about 30 per cent in recent years.
“It should be noted that only certain provisions in the proposed bill would take immediate effect if the bill is passed,” said Carkner. “Most changes would occur 12 to 18 months after the bill receives Royal Assent.” Green noted that while the reforms do address current problems, he was concerned that power will be in the hands of ministers  and not open to legal scrutiny.
“The word ‘safe’ is not in the legislation, so we don’t know how a country will get on that list. Will it be political reasons that get a country on that list?” asked Green. “The government has recently passed laws that are bare bones and the meat is in the regulations. We just saw a skeleton and we don’t know how things will really operate.”

Ottawa sit-in ends in arrests, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada cites security concerns
Six non-native women protesting the recent discontinuation of federal funding to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF) were arrested in Ottawa on March 29, approximately one hour into a sit-in at Indian Affairs minister Chuck Strahl’s office.
The protest was organized to express solidarity with the AHF, which funds the work of 134 community-based aboriginal support services that aid survivors of Canada’s residential school system. The organization began in 1998 with a $350-million grant from the federal government. However, the 2010 federal budget did not renew funding.
According to protester Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, once the police arrived, the women were given 30 seconds to either leave or be arrested.
“I asked them if we could have 60 seconds, if we could have a minute to discuss this, and they said, ‘No – 30 seconds,’” she said.
“What was surprising was how quickly it escalated. Normally, at least as far as I know, the police have protocols where they escalate fairly slowly, and it usually lasts several hours,” Rolbin-Ghanie continued.
Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) spokesperson Margot Geduld said that the women were arrested because of a “security consideration.”
But Marc Menard, spokesperson for the national capital division of the RCMP, would not comment on whether or not security had been a concern. He said, however, that the women were ticketed for trespassing.
The decision to cut AHF’s funding has been met with widespread “disbelief and shock,” according to AHF communications director Wayne Spear.
“We had no guarantee that we’d get additional funding beyond March, but since there aren’t many services available in aboriginal communities people were quite upset that these services would be disappearing,” he added.
Funding was not renewed despite an INAC-commissioned evaluation of the organization that was overwhelmingly positive. The evaluation found that “the healing is gaining momentum, but that in relation to the existing and growing need the healing ‘has just begun;’ project reports and interview results indicate a high level of continued need for healing according to an array of negative social indicators attributed to [residential school] trauma.”
The evaluation went on to say that “that there are few if any viable alternatives to achieve the positive healing outcomes the AHF has been able to achieve with such a degree of success.”
According to Geduld, the 2010 allocated budget $199 million over two years “to ensure that survivors [of residential schools] continue their important path to healing.”
“Certainly Health Canada will continue to work closely with the aboriginal communities,” she continued.
Health Canada will receive $65.9 million over two years for the Indian Residential Schools Resolution Health Support program, an existing Health Canada program, according to Paul Duchesne, director of Health Canada’s Media Monitoring Unit.
The remaining $133.2 million will go toward the Independent Assessment Process (IAP) and the Common Experience Payment (CEP). Both the IAP and CEP programs award money to residential school survivors as part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.
But critics worry that operating programs through government agencies rather than community-based groups will have detrimental effects on residential school survivors. “There’s been a history in Canada of aboriginal people having solutions brought in from outside, depending on government, being dependent on these resources,” said Spear. “[With the AHF] we had examples of people being self-sufficient and taking control of their own well-being. It was successful, all the research said it was doing good work, but [the government] is not going to encourage that any longer. It should be clear to anyone who’s looked into it that this is a step backward,” he continued.
The loss of AHF funding is just one in a recent series of federal funding cuts to aboriginal organizations. Federal funding of $7.2 million was withdrawn from First Nations University of Canada earlier this year. Sisters in Spirit, a national project that addressed violence against indigenous women and raised awareness about the issue, also lost its funding in the 2010 budget.
“It seems to me that there’s a broader phenomenon going on here,” said Rolbin-Ghanie. “The people who are actually doing the on-the-ground work are no longer being funded.”
Geduld, however, refused to draw a connection between the recent funding cuts.
“[These are issues] that have been in the media recently, but there’s really not a link between them at all. I don’t even see how you can link them,” she said.

The McGill Daily
After a year of controversy, Choose Life will re-chart its course for the coming year. The Daily’s Stephen Davis reflects on what we’ve learned from the club, and the debate.
In 1987, Harper’s published an article by a writer named Sally Tisdale, who had worked as a nurse in an abortion clinic. Tisdale explained how, “In abortion, the absolute must always be tempered by the contextual.” There are no absolute answers to the moral question of abortion, she argued, because our values should always be contingent on context.
For the large part of this year, McGill’s fledgling pro-life group, Choose Life, has opted to deal in moral absolutes, rather than acknowledging the lived experiences of the students around them. And this might be why they haven’t accomplished much of what they set out to do.
Their moral absolutes led them to pursue shock tactics – forget the individual women, they seem to be saying, there is a greater truth here: abortion is killing, killing is wrong, and we will do whatever it takes to spread these truths.
After a year clouded in controversy, they’ve re-plotted their course. But it remains to be seen where next year will lead.
The club’s history: digest version
Choose Life gained interim club status in October 2008. And after holding some successful events and jumping through a few administrative hoops, they gained official club status at a Council meeting in February 2009. Official club status comes with certain privileges, including the ability to book rooms and set up displays on campus.
Students were anxious and frustrated. At the October Council meeting, a student called the pro-life perspective “inherently violent against women and against human rights.” The February meeting was the most well-attended Council session in almost a year.
The anxieties expressed at Council did not go unaddressed. The group was subject to certain restrictions, including a prohibition on the use of graphic imagery.
In the lead-up to gaining official status, the group had proven itself to be a polarizing force on campus. Despite the restrictions on imagery, they tabled at the crossroads with pictures of fetal development in November 2008. Then they invited Mary Meehan, a speaker who compared abortion to eugenics. The audience in the room was literally divided, with pro-lifers on one side and Choose Life’s opponents on the other.
In September 2009, the club hosted the Silent No More Awareness campaign. Demonstrators stood on campus with signs reading “I Regret My Abortion” – actions which some criticized as intentionally targeting women who’ve had abortions to make them feel ashamed. Fliers handed out at the event made the dubious assertion that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer.
Things became tense on campus, but Choose Life pushed forward. In October, they invited a speaker who compares the language used to justify abortion to the language that has been used to justify genocide. The Students’ Society censured the event, fearing it would create a hostile environment on campus.
Choose Life went ahead with the event. Student protesters shut it down. Police escorted two protesters out in handcuffs. At a Senate meeting, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum said the protests had cast a “dark cloud” over campus by trying to censor the group.
Soon after, SSMU Council voted to suspend Choose Life’s club status. Over the coming months, members of the club’s executive met with the Society’s Equity Committee to discuss how Choose Life could conform to the Society’s Equity Policy. This document binds the Society to “Creating, promoting, and engaging its membership in an environment that fosters respect.” After a few meetings and agreements on new restrictions for the group, a vote at Council in early April reinstated Choose Life as an official SSMU club.
The promise of dialogue
When you speak with Choose Life president Natalie Fohl, she talks about a lot of things – women’s rights, Canadian law, and freedom of speech.
But more than anything else, Fohl’s preferred topic is dialogue. I’ve interviewed her several times this year – after the group’s first event of the year, in the lead-up to their suspension, and following Choose Life’s reinstatement.
At the Silent No More event, three speakers – two women and one man – shared stories of how abortion affected their lives.
Afterward, when protesters had packed up their signs and guitars and left, Fohl told me that the event was “a great opportunity for dialogue.”
In January, Fohl was tabling at the crossroads and speaking with students about abortion. Her club was still suspended, so she wasn’t allowed to be tabling under the name Choose Life. But she contacted Conservative McGill, and they booked a table under their name. Late in the day, someone came along and flipped over Fohl’s table. But she was optimistic, and said that Choose Life, as always, was “here to raise awareness but also to promote discussion.”
And recently, with her club’s status reinstated, she said “We do try and have a variety of events to make sure that a lot of different people are engaged in…dialogue.”
Fohl’s professed love for dialogue is bizarre, since for a brief period this year, it seemed that Choose Life’s tactics had destroyed any hope of a meaningful discussion of reproductive rights on campus. When you confront a woman with a sign reading, “I regret my abortion,” for instance, you cannot expect students to eagerly engage in dialogue.
Fohl seems to have realized this. Her plans for the club have shifted away from inviting incendiary speakers and toward research and activism.
She explained that future initiatives would include a research group that will assess the resources available for parents and pregnant students at McGill.
“We’re going to compile that information, [first] to make it available, but also to assess the situation, see if it’s adequate, and, if it’s not, advocate for changes,” Fohl said.
After a rocky year, she seems more aware than ever that pregnancy is a particularly weighty issue for students, one that the administration fails to address.
“If I were to get pregnant, randomly, unexpectedly…that would be my school career, all of my plans, out the window. And I don’t think that needs to be the case…. The University structure should be set up to accommodate that and make it so that women don’t have to choose between their studies and their child’s life,” Fohl said.
She didn’t mention any concrete plans Choose Life has to accomplish these goals – and they have their reputation working against them. Their rhetoric earlier this year was divisive – not the kind of talk that encourages students to get involved with any sort of grassroots initiative advocating for pregnant students. Through their actions – their signs, their underhanded tactics, their shock tactics – Choose Life has alienated the very people they want to advocate for.
A look ahead
I recently read a Maisonneuve article in which the pseudonymous author wrote about her own abortion. She mentions Tisdale’s piece, and toward the end, she quotes British writer Fay Weldon:
“Abortion is sometimes necessary, sometimes not, always sad. It is to the woman as war is to the man – a living sacrifice in a cause justified or not justified, as the observer may decide. It is the making of hard decisions – that this one must die so that one can live in honor and decency and comfort. Women have no leaders, of course; a woman’s conscience must be her General. There are no stirring songs to make the task of killing easier, no victory marches and medals handed around afterwards, merely a sense of loss.”
The Maisonneuve writer goes on to say that women who choose to obtain abortions open up an aftermath that they must face alone. So far, Choose Life has only made the situation worse, reinforcing the view that abortion is absolutely wrong, but the factors that compel women to make that choice aren’t worth challenging.
After Council voted to impose new restrictions on Choose Life, Fohl accused the Society of applying a double standard. Choose Life is the only club on campus that must abide by such stringent guidelines, she said. This is true. But no other club on campus deals with issues with as much potential to alienate students as abortion. As VP (University Affairs) Rebecca Dooley said after the vote, “You can’t talk about this issue and not talk about women’s bodies. You can’t talk about this issue and not talk about a difficult experience.”
Choose Life VP (Internal) Paul Cernek told me that, “We have the best interests of everyone at heart, including women.” If this is true, Choose Life should acknowledge that women who choose to end their pregnancies do so for reasons that a campus club could actively combat. They must focus less on the how of abortion – the surgical procedures, the gory details – and more on the why: those factors that compel a woman to seek an abortion.
If women are ending pregnancies because they must choose between a child and paying rent, the group could campaign for improved access to social housing. Or they could advocate for McGill post-doctoral students to receive benefits like subsidized child-care or paid maternity leave. Currently, maternity leave is negotiated with the post-doc’s supervisor. And then there’s contraception and sex education, both of which are lacking across the country and around the world.
As a SSMU club, they stand to benefit from the funds that the Society collects from its members (all undergrads and law students). Choose Life owes students more. If they are as concerned about women’s welfare as they claim to be, they need to prove it next year.

Quebec’s provincial employees march in Montreal for new contract
The contracts of public and semi-public workers across the province expired April 1 while negotiations between the province and union are still ongoing.
On March 20, 75,000 workers had taken to the streets demanding that a collective agreement be reached by March 31, and marched again on April 8.
Louis Roy, first vice president of the Confédération des syndica nationats (CSN), said that the goal of the demonstration was to force the government to negotiate without resorting to a general strike.
“When we decided to do this demonstration, it was because we told the government last year…if you want to negotiate with us and we are not on strike, they have the opportunity to do that before March 31. The possibility of a strike will come after April 1,” said Roy.
“If we don’t settle the agreement for March 31, we will fall in the usual way of negotiations with maybe a strike in the autumn. If [so], the government will have missed an opportunity to do something new – to settle without a strike and without a decree,” he added. 
Monique Gagnon-Tremblay, treasury board president of the Quebec Liberal Party, said union leaders had set March 31 as a symbolic deadline for a collective agreement – the same day that labour contracts for public sector employees, imposed by the Quebec government in 2005, expire. 
As the union’s symbolic deadline came and went, they decided to continue negotiations until April 20.
“At the latest, on April 20, if sector agreements are still not on the horizon, we’ll depose requests for mediation in view of bringing the two parties together for a final regulation,” Michel Arseneault, president of the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec (FTQ), said in an April 8 CSN press release.
Through labour contracts, the Quebec government imposed a two-year pay freeze, followed by four two per cent increases in wages, on public service employees. 
The Front commun syndical was created in May last year in order to represent public sector employees in negotiations with the Quebec government. It consists of the Secrétariat intersyndical des services publics (SISP), the CSN, and the FTQ, and represents 475,000 public and semi-public workers.
In a press release responding to the protests, Gagnon-Tremblay said that Quebec is offering a global raise of seven per cent in five years, which corresponds to $2.3 million.
The Front commun syndical is demanding a 11.25 per cent pay raise over three years.
Roy said that the wages of public sector workers, when measured in terms of purchasing power, are decreasing.
“[Public service employees] had two years of frozen wages, in 2004 and 2005, and we are just trying to get back to the level [of purchasing power parity] we were at [before these years].”
Gagnon-Tremblay called union demands unrealistic, predicting that granting an 11.25 per cent pay raise over three years would cost $8 billion.
“I know that these billions of dollars look [like a large amount], but we are working for 500,000 people, and these people are paid less than the equivalent job in the private sector,” said Roy.
Roy said that negotiations will be difficult. “Until now, the government is asking for concessions – and they don’t offer a lot of money for wages. We are still working hard…. This government is not really close to people working in [public] services.”

Bills 38 and 44 caused a ruckus in the fall, but were abandoned after widespread protest
One of the biggest issues for Quebec students this year has been the debate surrounding Bills 38 and 44 and the matter of university governance. The bills – which deal with university and CEGEP governance respectively – would have required Boards of Governors (BoG) in Quebec’s postsecondary institutions to maintain 60 per cent external representation for universities, and 65 per cent for CEGEPs. External representation would be at the expense of internal, locally elected governors like professors, administrators, and students.
Presented in spring 2009, the bills were met with widespread opposition from all levels of the postsecondary education system. Last summer, the ministry of education held a series of public hearings to gauge public enthusiasm for the bills.
“Everyone was against it,” said SSMU legal and political affairs coordinator Boris Savoie-Doyer. “They took a shellacking. We challenged them to produce anything that supported [their theories]. They got destroyed.”
Opponents of the bills argue that the logic supporting them is  a naive perception of the values of external BoG members.
“It was a very ideological point of view on how [external] governors would act,” said SSMU VP (External) Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan. “The logic is that external governors have more interest in the financial well-being of an organization. [Often] they don’t really care.”
In October, roughly 500 students from universities and CEGEPs all over Quebec took to the streets of Montreal to voice their anger about what they saw as the privatization of university governance. The protest was organized by Association pour un solidarité syndicale étudiante, and drew support from the Fédération québécoise des professeures et professeurs d’université, Fédération nationale des enseignantes et des enseignants du Québec, and the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec.
Savoie-Doyer said that the government didn’t expect such an immediate and widespread outcry.
“They thought it would be technical, that no one would pay attention [to the bills]. It was the opposite,” said Savoie-Doyer.
Bills 38 and 44 were derived from the earlier Bill 107, written in the fall of 2008. That bill resulted from a provincial audit of the finances of Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) in what came to be known as the UQAM real estate fiasco. In 2005, the university was faced with a massive space deficit and former rector Roch Denis’s solution was to embark on a risky and ambitious public/private development project to build two new buildings. The project left the university $400 million in debt, enough to significantly weaken UQAM’s reputation and merit a huge government bailout.
Ronderos-Morgan criticized the provincial government’s response to the real estate fiasco. “[The auditor general] really stepped out of bounds of what an auditor should do,” said Ronderos-Morgan, who instead emphasized the specific rector’s role in the fiasco. “Denis managed to manipulate the Board of Governors.”
Despite the outcry earlier this year from student groups across the province, the bills could still be revived. Earlier amendments proposed by minister of education Michelle Courchesne were dismissed by the opposition, but it is possible that further amendments could be made. Revised versions of Bills 38 and 44 could be presented as early as the next parliamentary session in September.
“As far as we know now [the bills] aren’t dead in the water,” said Ronderos-Morgan. “But the bills are fundamentally flawed; no amount of amendments could make them worthwhile.”
Savoie-Doyer said that nothing substantial was likely to be amended; at least nothing that would sway the coalition of protesters against the bills. He did not rule out their return, however.
“I’m sure it will rear its usual ugly head,” said Savoie-Doyer.

Talonbooks, publisher of book exposing Canada’s pro-mining policies, threatened by Barrick Gold
Barrick Gold, the world’s largest gold mining company, has successfully pressured Talonbooks into cancelling its plans to publish Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World’s Mining Industries. The book focuses on the economic, social, and environmental repercussions of the Canadian mining industry internationally.
“This has the potential to develop into serious legal action,” said a representative of Talon who asked to remain anonymous.
Written collectively by Alain Deneault and the members of the Collectif resources d’Afrique, Imperial Canada Inc. critically examined the factors that have led Canada to become home to the majority of the world’s mining companies. 
It focuses on four themes: the mining codes of Quebec and Ontario, the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada’s involvement in Caribbean tax havens, and Canada’s official diplomatic approach toward international institutions that govern worldwide mining, all of these factors  perpetuate what the book calls the extension of Canada’s “imperial heritage” into today’s extractive sector.
The authors examine the extent to which Canada supports mineral speculation, grants subsidies to mining companies, and most importantly, provides a legal sanctuary for companies facing lawsuits from communities that are experiencing adverse effects due to their extraction operations. 
Montreal-based journalist Tim McSorely has reported that the book “outlines alleged human rights abuses carried out by Barrick Gold in various African countries, including the deaths of more than 50 Tanzanians in 1996 and fuelling the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”
Imperial Canada Inc. also examines Canada’s judicial practices of giving legal preference to one’s right to reputation over freedom of expression and the public right to information. The authors assert this legal tradition as the reason that many academics have been reluctant to present their mining-related work in Canada for fear of libel charges.
This is not the first time that Canadian mining companies have tried to silence their critics.
Noir Canada: Pillage, corruption, et criminalité en Afrique, also co-written by Deneault, presented a collection of documents detailing the impact of Canadian mining companies in Africa, and credited the continuation of these questionable operations to the “unfailing help of the Canadian government.” 
It was successfully published by Édition écosociété in 2008, though Barrick Gold successfully cancelled the book launch in April of that year by serving the editors and publisher with a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation based on claims of inaccuracies.
In a press release that followed the cancellation of the book launch, the Collectif Resources d’Afrique said “It is understood that the financial means of a powerful mining company, compared to that of the researchers who prepared the book, permits the company to proceed by intimidation.”
The original intent of Talonbooks was to produce a direct translation of Noir Canada. However, after mining companies Barrick and Banro filed lawsuits against all who were involved in the production of the book, Talon was advised to develop a new approach in light of legal considerations. 
Imperial Canada Inc. focused on Canada’s economic policy and other cultural and institutional factors in order to ask one question: why are 70 per cent of the world’s mining companies registered in Canada through the Toronto Stock Exchange?
Given that the book’s intent was mainly scholarly, Talonbooks said they were shocked to receive a threatening letter from Barrick’s lawyers demanding the complete handover of all pieces of the manuscript that either directly or indirectly reference Barrick Gold, any subsidiary company, an affiliated company, or any former or current company administrator.   
The representative from Talon said there is no known explanation for what prompted the company to demand access to the manuscripts last month.
Also in the letter from Barrick Gold to Talonbooks Publishing, the company warned that if Talon failed to provide such documents, to rigorously check their facts, and to refrain from republishing any “defamatory contents” that were included in Noir Canada, Barrick would not hesitate to take legal procedures against the authors, or “any other person who will have played a part in the drafting, the translation, the publication, the diffusion or the promotion,” of Imperial Canada Inc.
As manuscripts prior to release are considered private property, Talonbooks – perceiving the letter as seriously threatening – saw Barrick’s actions as a deep violation of privacy, according to the representative of the publishing company.
