Large police presence for small protest; McGill and Concordia students no-shows
This article has been updated to reflect corrections
The Roddick Gates looked like a summer-camp bonfire last Wednesday, as about thirty students from a downtown CEGEP skip-roped, danced limbo and outlasted over a dozen police cruisers waiting nearby.
“[The police] really get pleasure out of overdoing it,” said Mateo Doutreligne-Solkin, an organizer with the CEGEP du Vieux Montréal students’ association. He said they were trying to intimidate him and the other students.
At quarter past one, as about thirty students – mostly from Mateo’s CEGEP – were discussing gender equality and the injustices of capitalism outside the central entrance to downtown campus when three police officers approached.
One of them began speaking to CEGEP student Dominique Bordeleau, telling her the students would be hit with tickets if they continued to protest in the street. The officer then asked the students to move on to the sidewalk.
Mateo replied in French from about ten feet away: “Civil disobedience doesn’t happen on sidewalks.”
The officers walked away shortly after, declining to answer The Daily’s questions about the threatened tickets. Over a dozen police cars and minivans were massed at the intersection of McGill College and Sherbrooke. In an email to The Daily, Security Services Manager Pierre Barbarie confirmed that McGill Security coordinated with the Montreal police for the protest, and that they work with the police on a regular basis.
As the police cruisers gradually drove away, the students moved their protest into the sun for warmth. Many of them had slept outside of the CEGEP du Vieux Montréal in tarpaulin tents and sleeping bags the previous two nights, as part of their three-day student body strike protesting proposed Quebec tuition hikes.
Wednesday’s protest had a festive air. At the beginning, two young women addressed the mostly sitting crowd: one had braces and the other had a yellow sun painted on her cheek. Later, students twisted their red and black banner into a rope and took turns skipping over it as two people spun it on either end. The same banner was used as a limbo bar while protestors sung lyrics taunting Premier Jean Charest.
When Mateo noticed the absence of police cars, he yelled, with a touch of irony, “We won! We intimidated the police!”
The CEGEP contingent waited for over half an hour for McGill and Concordia students to arrive and join them in a march through campus. In the end, only one McGill student came – Andrea Figuera, a U3 Arts student who works with QPIRG. She noted that it can been hard to mobilize McGill students against tuition hikes, but that, “Small actions help remind McGill students that their university is pushing” for tuition increases.
The small protest marched from the Roddick Gates to the James Administration building and addressed Principal Heather Munroe-Blum over a bullhorn, condemning her advocacy of tuition increases. Students were particularly incensed over the more than $30,000 increase in tuition for in-province students implemented over the summer for McGill’s MBA program.
Bordeleau called the MBA tuition hikes “abhorrent,” as protesters marched towards the James Administration building behind the red and black banner.
In front of James Administration, protestors briefly chanted in French, “Capital is waging war on us. War on capital.”
Mateo commented on the low turnout. “I don’t feel let down at all. I’m happy that this happened,” he said, as the protest was breaking up and students filed out through the Milton Gates. “I’ve been in contact with QPIRG [McGill] for a little bit, and they have the will and, in my interpretation, the rage, to really make a significant difference in the future against this negative movement.”
Mateo Doutreligne-Solkin was incorrectly identified as the president of the CEGEP du Vieux Montréal students’ association in an earlier version of this article. The Daily regrets the error.

Week of activism sees protest on McGill campus
Beginning on Saturday November 20, students at CEGEP du Vieux Montreal (CVM) were locked out of their college for five days.  The lockout came as students prepared a week of mobilization against the Liberal government’s planned tuition hikes. The week of student action included strikes, sit-ins, and an outdoor bed-in.
“The goal of closing the CEGEP…is really to prevent the mobilization of students,” argued Laurent Cornelissen, a spokesperson for the AEGCVM, the CEGEP’s student association.
According to Estelle Desgerlis, another AEGCVM spokesperson, students received an email on Saturday morning saying that the CEGEP would be closed until Thursday. In the email, the administration cited the difficulty of securing the school in the face of the week’s coming activism, as the reason for the closure.  The CVM administration could not be reached for comment.
“It took three weeks for us to organize the strike and the cultural conference with workshops outside…to really inform people what is happening,” said Fallon Roullier, a student who played a large role in organizing the action.
Last week’s schedule included two strike days on November 23 and 24 along with participation in protests on René Levesque and a protest on McGill campus.
AEGCVM has traditionally held bed-ins the night before student strikes to prepare students for the action and to facilitate more students attending the strikes. This year, in the face of the lockout, students slept outside in a tarp-enclosed barricade.
“In the past we had a lot of experience with bed-ins, we had an experience where things went badly in 2007…[At that time the bed-in was] illegal because the administration did not permit them except that some activists decided to sleep there anyway,” Roullier explained.
Rouiller said that in 2008 the CVM administration oversaw a successful bed-in. The role of the administration included supervision of students and help in accessing bathrooms and water.
This year, in the week before the lockout, there were no negotiations between students and the administration.
“The CEGEP administration refused all forms of negotiations with us in regards to this strike. All we wanted to do with the administration was to talk, make an agreement, make compromises, discuss. But the administration refused that right,” said CVM student Corrine Lagoie.
“It is due to [the unwillingness of the administration to negotiate] that we organized a pacifist sit-in [for Monday afternoon] then in reaction to this pacifism they closed the school for five days,” Lagoie added.
Students eventually staged a sit-in scheduled for Monday, November 22 – the day before the two days of student strikes were set to begin – in order to demand that the administration negotiate with students.
 “I think that…[the administration] saw on Facebook the group had 250 people who said they would participate in the sit-in … They feared the would lose ground so they decided simply to close the doors [of the CEGEP],” said Desgerlis.
How the lockout and subsequent student protests will affect long-term relations between the CVM administration and students remains to be seen. But students are bitter about what a student association press release called “a pure display of paternalistic behaviors.”
“[The strike] is the only democratic medium that we can use to be heard apart from voting,” CVM student Jeanne Pilot pointed out. “We cannot wait until 2012 when the [increased tuition fees] have arrived. … I think that [a strike] is the way to send a clear message if you are not heard.”

Founder hopes Omeq will have a “moderating effect”
A new McGill group calling itself Omeq is aiming to change the dynamics of the Israel-Palestine discourse on campus.
The group takes its name from the Hebrew and Arabic letters OMQ, the root letters of the words “depth” and “profundity” in both languages.  According to Omeq VP External Michah Stettin, debates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are consistently hampered by an adversarial atmosphere.  He described the formation of Omeq in early 2010 as “a response to too much inflammatory rhetoric on campus, as opposed to substantive discussion and dialogue.  We felt that there was a need to have a group on campus that was hospitable to numerous viewpoints.”
Stettin cited last winter’s SSMU General Assembly as a particular source of strife, when the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) brought forward a motion calling for the creation of a financial ethics review committee. The motion made numerous references to the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
Another reason for the new group, according to Stettin, is the frustration expressed by Omeq’s mostly Jewish members that positions taken by Hillel McGill, a major Jewish student group, did not reflect their own perspective.  “I don’t think that there is such a thing as the Jewish political opinion.  Thus if an organization takes a political opinion, there will be Jews that disagree.  Hillel in the past has taken stances on issues on campus, and there were people on campus who were left outside of those positions,” he said. Stettin did, however, maintain that “Hillel is a great place for Jewish students and serves very important functions.”
Corey Omer, president of Hillel Montreal, said that he sees Omeq “as a positive thing, to have other groups. Any way Jewish students can represent themselves is good.  Hillel strives to represent everybody; however, it is hard for one organization to say everything to everyone.”
The effort to create what Omeq’s executives call “increased dialogue” on campus has not, however, been met with universal acclaim. Sam Bick, a McGill student and SPHR member who stressed that he did not speak for the group as a whole, said that dialogue may hurt more than it helps. “People don’t come to the table on the same footing. … When there are different degrees of power, when there’s military violence happening, dialogue becomes a much different thing,” he said, adding that dialogue may end up diverting attention “from dealing with real issues.”
Through a series of talks on subjects such as anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and the role of activism in Israel and Palestine, Stettin hopes that Omeq can act as a moderating force in conversations that have been tense on campus in recent years. A talk scheduled for last Wednesday,  “Debunking Myths about Islam,” would have been the fourth this year for Omeq, but was postponed in favour of a general meeting due to a scheduling miscommunication.
Rex Brynen, a McGill Political Science professor, sees a respectful environment as something that will come naturally to Omeq because of its structure. “If you set up contexts–whether it’s speakers on campus or internal dialogue sessions–in which the understood rules of the game are that you can say what you want but you have to be respectful with it, [dialogue] doesn’t become terribly hard,” he said.
Brynen feels that organizations like Omeq have an important role to play in decreasing the polarization of campus discourse. “People get upset at occupation of the settlements, people get upset by terrorism, and and it sort of drives them apart and leads them to a situation where they can’t recognize common interests, so I think [OMEQ] kind of re-centres the discussion in useful ways,” he said.

ASA’s involvement in the controversial closure
The Daily has obtained a bundle of documents relating to the Architecture Café – including personal emails between administrators and student politicians, internal memorandum, and reports – after filing an Access to Information request. The document dump sheds light on the decision-making process surrounding the closure, detailing a coordinated media strategy on the part of the administration. Several key administrators and faculty declined to comment for this article, referring The Daily to Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson. They include Director of the School of Architecture Michael Jemtrud, Director of McGill Food and Dining Services Mathieu Laperle, Assistant Director of Legal Services Vilma Campbell, Dean of Engineering Christophe Pierre and Director of Media Relations Doug Sweet.
By July 15, the decision to close the Architecture Café was final. More than a month passed between when the decision to close the cafe was made and when the administration officially told students it would not be reopened.
There was also a more than two-month gap between when Architecture Students Association (ASA) president Kyle Burrows was told of the possible closure of the cafe, and when the official notice came. This delay left students confused about how to proceed – whether to resist the closure whole-heartedly and risk losing a student space, or to tentatively plan for a new, student-friendly space where the cafe had been.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson wrote Mathieu Laperle, Director of McGill Food and Dining Services, just after noon July 15, in response to a question sent that morning as to whether a final decision had been made on closing the cafe. Mendelson wrote: “I agree that you should remove the [Architecture Café] as a destination in your [promotional] material.”
As early as the beginning of June, however, Burrows was made aware that he should start thinking about new uses for the cafe space in a meeting with Michael Jemtrud, Director of the School of Architecture. In a June 15 email from Jemtrud to Mendelson, the director wrote, “The new ASA President [Burrows] is very reasonable and I have basically said the cafe is a done deal. I think I am getting them to the right place but they are concerned about being the bad guys of course and want to make sure it is replaced by something defensible.”
In an interview with The Daily, Burrows said he was hesitant over the summer to begin publicly suggesting ideas for replacing the cafe, however, until he was sure the cafe was being shut down.
“If the cafe was dead and gone we might start to think about [new plans for the space]. It was that constant struggle that we didn’t want to lose the space for students…but [the cafe] wasn’t a lost cause in our minds,” said Burrows.
“For us to come forward with a proposal, before we had received any kind of official confirmation that the cafe would be closed – that would have a very negative effect on the way it was perceived,” he said.
Despite Jemtrud’s indication to Mendelson that Burrows was resigned to the closure, the ASA president insists that he wanted to keep the cafe open from the beginning.
“Our main objective was to keep that room a student space,” he said, adding that, “the ASA decided very early on that the cafe was the best representation of a student space we could have in the school. Nothing we could think of – especially not a study space – could ever match the quality and the charm of that space.”
Katherine Messina, last year’s ASA president and senior manager of the cafe for the past two years, saw a more elaborate strategy in Burrows’ hedging between fighting the closure of the cafe and proposing what might replace it.
Despite Burrows’s opposition to closing the cafe, Messina told The Daily that Burrows formally accepted the administration’s desire to shut down the cafe in an attempt to gain their support throughout negotiations over joining the Engineering Undergraduate Society’s (EUS) Memorandum of Agreement (MoA).
“The ASA was never on board with [the cafe’s] closing,” she said. “But because the ASA wanted to be accredited [as a student association] and we didn’t want anything to stop us from doing that, the idea was to make the ASA and the Arch Café appear to be two separate governing bodies, so that whatever was done to save the Arch Café did not reflect on the ASA and would not have made the University be like, ‘No, we’re not giving you your accreditation.’”
Messina said she and other managers were tasked with opposing the administration’s decision, setting themselves apart from the ASA, which wanted to remain on the administration’s good side.
Messina acknowledged that Architecture students were trying to “pull a fast one” on administrators with this strategy. Part of the ASA’s reason for wanting to be covered by EUS’s MoA – contracts that large student organizations like SSMU, faculty associations, and student newspapers have with the University – was to protect the Arch Café, Messina explained. EUS is allowed to run businesses under the terms of its MoA.
“If we joined the EUS…the Arch Café could be a business of the EUS. So that was the idea,” she said.
She also added that Jemtrud was aware of this two-pronged approach to saving the cafe, and that he played along in his correspondence with administrators. Both Messina and Burrows said it has been a long-standing goal of Jemtrud’s to join an official student organization with an MoA.
“Because Michael [Jemtrud] has a lot invested in the ASA, and he really wants the ASA to ‘re-become’ a student organization, he had to paint Kyle in that light: that Kyle agreed with [closing the cafe], just so we wouldn’t get any backlash about it,” Messina said.
In his interview, Burrows said Messina was off the mark, as he spent much of the summer trying to find out why the cafe was being closed, with a mind to keeping it open. “We weren’t hushed to be goody two-shoes with the administration,” Burrows said.
Jemtrud was also concerned about who would be percieved as ultimately responsible for the closure. In an August 30 email, he wrote, “Either Food Services takes responsibility…or this thing is going to go sideways.” Mendelson replied later that day that he would be willing to be the “fall guy.”
Students involved in the closing of the cafe are unanimous, however, in feeling that the administration largely ignored their concerns. Carly Rouault, slated to be this year’s top manager of the Arch Café prior to being shut down, said that Mendelson refused to negotiate with her and Burrows in a meeting during the first week of school.
“Mendelson made it very clear that he was not sure why we were meeting and that there was no chance of any form of negotiation between us,” Rouault wrote in an email to The Daily. “He had made his decision and it did not concern us.”

Heritage Canada decision may spell the end for event
Fourteen days before the État d’urgence, a four-day, five-night homelessness festival in downtown Montreal, the Department of Canadian Heritage decided to drop their share of the funding for this year’s event. The decision has left ATSA (Action terroriste socialement acceptable), the organizer of the event, with a $43,000 deficit, and effectively rules out the possibility of a festival next year.
The État d’urgence – French for State of Emergency – which was inaugurated in 1998, ran from Thursday through Sunday in Place Émile-Gamelin last week. The event provided free food, clothing, and medical services for the homeless, and featured art exhibits addressing discourses on homelessness and social exclusion.
When asked why Canadian Heritage, the ministry in charge of federal culture grants, cut funding for the festival this year, ATSA co-founder and event organizer Annie Roy responded, “I don’t think there is a reason for it, that’s the problem.”
In an email to The Daily, Canadian Heritage’s press service representative Geneviève Myre noted that the ministry made no promises to ATSA this year with regard to funding, and thus had committed no error.
“Funding was not withdrawn for this festival, as no previous funding was announced for this year’s event. As stated in our application guidelines, there is no guarantee of funding for applicants from one year to another,” wrote Myre.
Despite the promoter’s financial woes, the atmosphere at the festival on Thursday was upbeat. Evidently homeless men lit up at the sight of old friends as they mingled under the massive “protest” photographs by Argentine artist Leonel Luna.
Jean Yves, a 57 year-old Montrealer, homeless for 12 years, explained, “It’s good for food, warmth, clothes, for people to get together. People come for the atmosphere.” In the middle of talking he introduced an elderly man he had not seen, he said, since the man went to jail a few months before. “It’s good to see him back here.”
One homeless man, who introduced himself as Ralph, said he planned on staying in the park for the whole four days, sleeping in the square with other festival-goers. “I’m here for the festival just to have fun. I like to meet new personalities, that’s what I like to see,” he said.
Most of the visitors at the festival on Thursday did not know that the event had lost its government funding two weeks before. Jean- Matthieu, press coordinator for the ATSA, says the organization does not want to seem like it is complaining.
“We’re not mad at Canadian Heritage. We try to understand. But they’re putting us in a bad situation. … We want everyone to know [about the cuts], but also to enjoy the moment,” Barraud said.
However, Roy expressed her displeasure with the way the government made its funding decisions known to ATSA.
“They do not have consistency. They don’t realize they are asking small cultural organizations to be responsible with their budget,” she said. “[Canadian Heritage] is totally disconnected from the reality of the cultural milieu, how difficult it is to find money. They have the right to put their money elsewhere, but just do it correctly so we don’t crash.”
Canadian Heritage did not say whether it would renew ATSA’s grant until two weeks before the festival, and before that, Roy insists, Canadian Heritage led ATSA to think it would gain substantial funding for this year’s festival.
“The agent for Canadian Heritage told us to budget $65,000. The way they were encouraging us told us that we should expect money. We kept calling throughout the year up until two weeks ago and we were absolutely not expecting a zero.”
Festivalgoers, homeless and otherwise, were disquieted when told that the festival might not be back next year.
“If that’s really happening, anyone who is here is going to be upset,” said Ralph.
Roy holds that not only was Canadian Heritage misleading in the run-up up to the grant decision, but that the basic structure of the funding operation is detrimental to the cultural institutions it supports.
“They are not obliged to give us money but I think there is a certain ethic and procedure that needs to be followed,” said Roy.
