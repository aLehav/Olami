Taking on mayor’s Party in by-election
Bryce Durafourt, in the last year of his Masters program in Neuroscience at McGill, is Projet Montréal’s newest candidate for city councillor in St. Laurent’s Côte-de-Liesse district.
 With the deadline for declaring candidacy set for October 22, his only opponent thus far in the by-election is Francesco Miele, from Gerard Tremblay’s Union Montréal party. The campaign began last Friday, and election day is November 21.
Durafourt is running for a position that had been held by Laval Demers, who died on September 16 of a brain aneurysm. He was 57 years old.
The 23-year-old Durafourt is a veteran in municipal politics, having contested his first election in the St. Laurent borough when he was 18. This will be his fourth campaign for municipal office – he ran twice for councillor and once for school board representative.
Durafourt, who received his Bachelor’s in Microbiology and Immunology from McGill in 2009, thinks his chances of winning are “very good.”
“It’s always tough,” he told The Daily. “Tremblay’s party has had five councillors elected in the borough.” There are five seats on the St. Laurent council.
Durafourt, who has deferred his acceptance to McGill medical school until next year so he can finish his Master’s degree, thinks the St. Laurent council could use a breath of fresh air.
“Since council is made up by five people from the same team it’s important to have some opposition…so that new ideas can be brought in,” he said.
“They’re pretty excited to see someone young,” he said of the constituents he met going door-to -door getting signatures in support of his candidacy.
Durafourt’s past campaigns have not garnered as much enthusiasm. In every one of his previous races he lacked serious political endorsement, and ran as an independent. In 2005, in an election for councillor, he received just over one per cent of the vote. “It was a tough campaign,” he said. “But I used the lessons I learned then when I ran again in 2009. I ran a much bigger campaign. I used full-sized signs.”
In 2009, he received about six per cent of the vote. Durafourt found that “it’s very difficult to get elected without the financial and organizational backing of a party,” as the Gazette put it in a profile of the young politician in 2007.
Durafourt has cleared that hurdle this time around. Projet Montréal approached Durafourt about running this year, and is throwing its full weight behind him.
He shares many of Projet’s policy goals, like expanded public transit, reduced car traffic, and air-conditioning in the metro. Although hesitant to criticize the mayor’s election platform, Durafourt pointed to continued “collusion in city contracts” as a failure of Tremblay’s tenure as mayor, which began in 2001. Durafourt felt that the problem “maybe didn’t originate from Tremblay and his team,” but that it “certainly hadn’t been well addressed in [Tremblay’s] first two terms.”
Durafourt’s research work at McGill, meanwhile, seems unimpeachable. He is part of a team looking into the effects of a new drug to combat Multiple Sclerosis, which “was on clinical trials and…was just approved in the U.S.”
He chose MS research because MS is “an issue that’s close to me for family reasons…that’s meaningful to me.”
Next year Durafourt will be attending medical school at McGill, but he is confident he will be able to balance his academic and political life.
“It’s not quite a full-time job,” he said of being a councillor. “I would be obligated to go to St. Laurent council meeting, which is once a month, and Montreal council meeting, which is once a month as well. The rest of the work is meeting with citizens and then performing whatever tasks need to be done.”
“You’re elected to work for the City of Montreal,” he continued, “but you’re working for the people, you’re working for the citizens.”

Ability to trade hours will also be curbed
Called into a meeting last Thursday, student employees at Bishop Mountain Hall were notified that starting this week the majority of student employees would be experiencing reduced hours and less flexibility in terms of switching shift.
According to Director of McGill Food and Dining Service (MFDS) Mathieu Laperle, the cutbacks are a result of McGill’s contract with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the administration’s hands are tied when it comes to cutting students’ shifts.
“We have a union contract agreement, so we have to respect the contract agreement. We have a union agreement [that] we have to go by seniority… It is a normal process,” said Laperle.
Laperle added, “What we did was to renew our needs. There are more and more people who have started to use [Royal Victoria College] instead of BMH, and we’ve seen some changes in terms of the patterns and the habits of the people. So it’s a normal process. This is something we do every year because at the start of the year we don’t know the habits of the people. If there is a need [for employees] there is no problem, but if there is no need there is no need. We aren’t creating jobs just to create jobs.”
However, some student workers are less concerned about shift cutbacks than a new policy that limits the number of times a person can switch their shifts to five times a semester.
For one student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the cuts in shifts are bringing his work in to conflict with his academics.
“The problem is that they aren’t outright firing us. What they are doing is they are giving us shifts that are impossible or really difficult to do,” he said. “They aren’t considering availability, which is an issue because ultimately I’m here to go to university, and if I were to do their shifts I would have to seriously sacrifice that.”
The limited shifts will also affect his work permit. “I am an international student and so we’re only allowed to work on campus,” he said. “To be able to work on campus you need to get a social insurance number from the Canadian government, and when they give it to you, it’s on the basis that you are going to be in an employment in a place for a certain amount of time. Also they are not just going to reissue you one if you lose your job quickly.”
Currently there are just under seventy students on schedule at BMH. This number is up from previous years when the average number of employees was around 40 or 50, according to Susan Campbell, Associate Director of Food and Hospitality Services.
Some students are wondering why MFDS would inflate the number of hires just to downsize two months into the school year.
“Basically everyone has lost shifts,” said Steve Eldon Kerr, a U2 Arts student and Daily writer employed at BMH. “They hired too many people, so they had to cut down. They have said that if you really need the money they will give you more shifts, but I just really don’t know how they are going to do that.”

Machines removed to comply with summer food service audit
In accordance with a review completed over the summer, revenue from vending machines in McGill Residences will no longer help support residence Hall Councils, and some machines have been removed from residences entirely.
Hall Councils are responsible for planning events, fundraisers, and other residence activities for students. The Councils formerly received bimonthly checks from vending machine revenue. The money “wasn’t a lot, but was certainly helpful,” said Clara Lu, former VP Finance of Royal Victoria College. She estimated that last year’s RVC Hall Council, which had a budget of about $4,000 to work with, received a few hundred dollars from vending machines.
Lu also noted that in the last months of the 2009-2010 academic year, the RVC Council received two revenue checks issued to McGill University rather than to the council itself. “Food Services did not question the changing of the recipient,” she added.
Mathieu Laperle, Director of McGill Food and Dining Services (MFDS), said that in a review of services after the start of Aramark’s contract on June 1, MFDS was “surprised to discover that there were some vending machines being operated on campus and in Residences without any official authorization or contract with the University.”
Locations such as Thomson House, the Faculty Club, and the Shatner building are not included in the contract with Aramark, but other than these exemptions, “student associations are not permitted to operate vending machines or food services,” Laperle wrote in an email to The Daily.
In agreement with MFDS’s contract with Aramark, the unauthorized vending machines, which included some of those in McGill residences, were removed. Machines in Gardner Hall were removed, though there are still machines present in RVC, and there has been no mention of their removal, according to RVC President Caelestia Hu. Hu also said that RVC’s Hall Council is looking for a way to make up for the loss.
Laperle stressed that MFDS must be financially sustainable without receiving funds from the University, though later stated that MFDS has “never been involved with where the money [from vending machines] goes.”  However, Lu said the RVC council was able to cash the vending machine cheques, received from a company called Distribution Triso, through MFDS this spring.
Aramark now owns the operation of the majority of vending machines on campus, with the exception of a few that are run by other companies, such as Coca-Cola.

Motion will not be on SSMU Council agenda tonight
A motion that sought to abolish QPIRG’s funding, and would have put its opt-outable to a referendum, was declared out of order by the SSMU speakers yesterday, and is no longer on the agenda for today’s SSMU council session. The motion was initially approved Tuesday, but then declared out-of-order after it became apparent that SSMU has no jurisdiction over the fees administered by a independent student group.
“The question couldn’t happen,” said Raymond Xing, Speaker of Council. “SSMU doesn’t have any authority to do anything about the QPIRG fee.”
Since both SSMU and QPIRG are independent organizations on campus with their own individual Memorandums of Agreement (MoAs) with the University, they can’t control each other’s fees. SSMU Councillors Spencer Burger, Lauren Hudak, Matt Reid, and Eli Freedman were signatories to the motion.
SSMU President Zach Newburgh conferred with Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) Morton Mendelson yesterday to assess the legality of the proposed referendum question.
In an email correspondence between Newburgh and Mendelson obtained by The Daily, Newburgh cites Article 1.6 of the QPIRG-McGill MoA as an indicator of the potential illegality of the referendum question, describing how only the University has the authority to approve any adjustment in QPIRG’s fees.
The MoA states that “no adjustment to the QPIRG’s fees shall be applied or collected by the University unless the Dean of Students has confirmed in writing that the formalities required by the QPIRG’s constitution for fee adjustments and applicable law have been followed.”
“In the same way that QPIRG could not launch a referendum question to alter the fees that are payed to the SSMU, the SSMU cannot launch a referendum question regarding a change of fees for QPIRG,” said Newburgh.
Mendelson insisted that he was not involved in the decision to strike the motion from the council agenda.
“My view is that SSMU does not have the authority to ask such a question,” Mendelson wrote in the email to Newburgh. “Perhaps one confusion is that groups not affiliated with SSMU use Elections McGill to conduct their referenda, which may lead some people to believe, incorrectly, that the referenda are SSMU referenda.”
Burger wrote in an email to the Daily that he authored the motion to “have an open and civil debate about QPIRG’s role on campus, what its role should be, and whether it should function according to the same rules that apply to other explicitly political groups.”
According to Speaker Cathal Rooney-Cespedes, council speakers were first informed of the illegality of the referendum question in an email on Tuesday from Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, a member of QPIRG’s Board of Directors and former SSMU VP External.
The question itself was only able to make it onto the agenda in the first place because the SSMU Council Steering Committee elected to extend the deadline for motions for today’s council from 5 p.m. Monday to Tuesday morning.
“People were late with motions,” said Rooney-Cespedes. “It wasn’t arbitrary. We decided to grant everyone further extensions.”
According to Freedman, the motion was first submitted on Monday by Reid, but was found unconstitutional by the speakers of council.
“The main issue was that there were far too many statements of opinions within ‘whereas’ clauses,” said Rooney-Cespedes.
The motion was amended and resubmitted by Burger on Tuesday. Motions to council require the signatures of four councillors.
Freedman was quick to clarify his own role in the submission of the motion. “My involvement was limited to signing the document. I lended [sic] my signature to the fact that [the motion] was constitutionally acceptable,” he said, adding “some statements were unconstitutional. They made accusations – which in their opinion were true – that were never made clear by the SSMU body.”
The revised motion described various “alienating” characteristics of QPIRG, as well as the recent confrontation between QPIRG members and members of the opt-out campaign in the McConnell Engineering Building. The incident led to the EUS council banning QPIRG from renting space in the building for the year. The motion further described QPIRG as funding “goals and groups that deeply disturb members of the SSMU.”
The question at the end of the motion reads: “Do you agree, That the $3.75 student fee (per semester) of every SSMU member to fund QPIRG McGill be annulled effective immediately?”
Rooney-Cespedes affirmed that, had it not been for the illegality of the motion, the question could have got a lot of support among the SSMU council. “Not until QPIRG brought this [illegality] to our attention did anybody object,” he said. He pointed out that while SSMU makes its by-laws and constitution public, QPIRG keeps its documents private.
“QPIRG should do a lot better in terms of making themselves more transparent,” he said. “They don’t do anything to make themselves accessible. We should be able to know what their by-laws, how they govern themselves.”
With the motion removed from today’s council agenda, Rooney-Cespedes also recommended other avenues through which the motion authors could pursue their aims.
“I gave [Burger] a list of things SSMU was capable of,” he said. “I recommended to him that he make a symbolic gesture.” Such gestures included going to plebiscite – essentially a survey of student opinion on an issue that has to go to Council the same way a referendum question would – and having SSMU take a stance on the anullment of QPIRG fees.
“SSMU has alternative avenues he can take. None of them actually do anything,” said Rooney-Cespedes. “He knows he can’t go [to referendum].”
Burger, or any other councillor, would have to pass a two-thirds vote to amend the agenda for today’s session in order to achieve any of those objectives before next session, but Xing firmly dismissed any possibility of the revised motion making it onto today’s agenda.
“No suspension of rules could possibly make it in order. There are fundamental legislative issues with the question,” said Xing. “It’s not going to happen.”

Deal would have left eighty per cent of workers jobless
Almost ninety per cent of 253 unionized journalists voted Tuesday to reject Journal de Montréal’s latest contract offer in a labor dispute unresolved since January 2009. The Journal’s offer would have let 48 people return to work, leaving eighty per cent of the workers without a job.
Journalists who produce content – such as reporters and photographers – would not have been able to work for a competitor for a period of six months if they wanted severance pay. The publications considered competitors are La Presse, Cyberpresse, and Rue Frontenac. Rue Frontenac is the union’s online news publication, which is scheduled to hit newsstands by the end of the month as a free weekly tabloid.
Quebecor, Journal’s parent company, called for Rue Frontenac to be shut down at the meeting between management and the union Tuesday. The company further demanded a six-month moratorium on the publication of any new strike papers or websites with the additional condition that the iconic name not be reused. Reynald Leblanc, the Journal’s union leader, told the Gazette that these demands were the deal-breaker.
Alain Bisson, financial reporter for Rue Frontenac, said the union had no substantial demands of their own during the negotiations. “We were willing to do our share. We understand that Journal wanted – not needed – to lower costs, but we wanted to see if we could do our part of the effort,” he said.
Bisson explained that the Journal prepared for the lockout well in advance to avoid hiring scabs. A year prior to the lockout, the newspaper hired new management and placed them in the Sports section. Twenty of the paper’s original sports writers are now on the picket line. All of the other sections were supplanted by Quebec Media Inc., a wire agency created two weeks before the lockout that enables the Journal to use content produced by employees at other Quebecor subsidiaries.
These tactics prompted the union to challenge Quebec’s Labour Code on the basis of trying to redefine what qualifies as “scab labour,” but the employees lost the case in court.
Bisson said he believes that Rue Frontenac has a lot of leverage in the labour dispute and explained that, with advertising revenue, the website is making a profit. “It’s another question to know whether Rue Frontenac could sustain so many journalists if it were a real business that paid salaries – I think it would be possible and viable,” he said.
Bisson and his colleagues still receive 75 per cent of their net salary, but many have been doing freelance work to support themselves. “The lockout was one of the reasons that I sold my house two months before [the lock-out] happened,” he said.
“There is no financial justification to Journal de Montréal [demands] – they make several millions a year, probably tens of millions in profit. We’re not talking about a company that has financial difficulties,” said Bisson. “There is no justification of stealing jobs from roughly 200 people.”
