PQ Public Security Minister Stéphane Bergeron announced last week the continuation of plans to create a civilian group that would oversee cases of deaths or severe injury involving police forces.
“We are committed to setting up an independent mechanism of inquiry that will probe into incidents involving the police,” Bergeron told the Globe and Mail.
Under current Quebec law, an investigation is held if such incidents happen, but they are conducted by an outside police force.
Earlier this year, the former Liberal government proposed similar legislation – Bill 46 – which died on the order paper when the provincial election was called.
Quebec Ombudsperson Ray-monde Saint-Germain’s Director of Communications Carol-Ann Huot told The Daily in March, that “Bill 46 maintains the system of police investigating police that does not provide a sufficient guarantee of impartiality.”
The Liberal government did not follow recommendations by the ombudsman to set up a special investigations unit.
Regarding the latest proposal by the PQ government, Huot stated in an email, “The Quebec Ombudsman repeats his recommendations aimed at creating an independent civilian bureau to oversee investigations, supervised by a civil director and including civil investigators.”
“We will examine the bill with interest when it will be deposited by the government,” she added.

The Students’ Society of McGill University’s (SSMU) Fall General Assembly (GA) motions re: Renaming the SSMU Breakout Room and re: Installation of a Bouldering Wall – both of which passed with quorum in the GA before moving to online ratification – were ratified online and are thus officially adopted.
Elections SSMU released the results in an email to SSMU members last Thursday. The motion regarding renaming the SSMU breakout room to the Madeleine Parent Room passed its online ratification with 2,002 “yes” votes and 459 “no” votes. The motion regarding the installation of a bouldering wall in the sub-basement of the Shatner Building passed with 2,024 “yes” votes and 530 “no” votes.
A total of 2,931 students participated in online ratification, according to Elections SSMU’s online results report.
This was the first GA to include online ratification since fall 2008.
“I think online ratification went well,” SSMU President Josh Redel wrote to The Daily in an email. “Considering that a lot of people thought nothing would pass if it went to online ratification, I’m glad to see that we were able to get them passed.”
The online voting page also featured embedded YouTube videos from the GA to aid online voters in their decisions.
“I am also glad to see the decent amount of views on the embedded YouTube videos of debate surrounding the motions,” wrote Redel. “Certainly just the start to how we make online ratification strong, but a good start!”

Activists say landlord complaints prioritized over tenants
Despite promises of shorter waiting times and better service, the Régie du logement – the provincial tribunal charged with handling litigation between tenants and landlords – continues to suffer from considerable delays and a lack of resources, according to Projet Genèse, a Montreal-based community organization.
The group staged a protest in front of the Régie du logement offices last Thursday.
“There are simply not enough commissioners,” Projet Genèse spokesperson Sheetal Pathak told The Daily in French. “Less than ten years ago, it took less than three months to hear a case. It’s not impossible to go back to more reasonable delays.”
According to a government study conducted this year, the average waiting time for a “priority” case is 14.5 months.
The Régie groups cases into five categories: urgent, non-payment, fixation and redaction, priority, and general. Issues that affect the well-being of tenants – such as heating – are classified as urgent.
With the exception of urgent cases, the Régie handles complaints chronologically.
However, Pathak claimed that cases of “non-payment” – in which a tenant refuses or is incapable of paying rent – are always given priority over the other classifications.
“No matter the extent of the harm that is done to the landlord, they are always given precedence over cases that endanger the health [of the tenants],” Pathak said.
In an interview with The Daily, Régie spokesperson Geneviève Trudel said that urgent and non-payment cases were handled under “similar delays.”
An inquiry compiled by the Quebec Ombudsman, the parliamentary body tasked with investigating injustices committed by government agencies, revealed that between 2010 and 2011, “non-payment” cases were dealt with following a 1.3 month delay.
Complaints labelled as “urgent” were addressed in 1.4 months.
“It’s an administrative and political decision,” Pathak said.  “It’s a very big problem when someone lives in housing that isn’t heated for a long time. It has consequences on the well-being and on the security of people. We think it’s unthinkable that cases of non-payments are prioritized.”
42 commissioners sat at the Régie in 2007, but that number fell to 34 in 2010, according to La Presse.
Last year, the Régie noted in its annual report that 20,110 cases were being reviewed by the organization, a 7 per cent increase from the previous year.
According to Trudel, however, the Régie has the necessary resources to handle the current complaints, and “the problems [they] encountered last year were rectified.”
The Association des propriétaires du Québec, a group that advocates on behalf of landlords, disagrees.
“Every commissioner deals with around 1,300 cases per year,” a statement on its website read in French. “We consider the [14.5 months] delay to be too long and we believe that it causes harm to owners as well as to tenants.”
The Régie hired eight new commissioners this year. Whether delays will be shortened by this new measure remains to be seen.

“University funding should be reassesed”
The Daily spoke to newly-elected MNA Françoise David of Québec solidaire (QS) on Friday about her party’s vision for higher education in the province, the problems facing universities, and what QS would insist upon at the summit planned by the Parti Québécois (PQ) government for later this spring to address the funding, role, and future of higher education in Quebec.
Two camps have formed in the university funding debate. On one side sits the Conférence des recteurs et des principaux des universities du Québec (CREPUQ) – the federation which represents the administrations of Quebec’s 18 universities – which argues that universities in the province are severely underfunded. A CREPUQ study released in 2010 cites $620 million as the amount necessary to bring the province’s universities up to snuff.
On the other sit the student federations, who say that the problem is one of misallocation and mismanagement, and who argue that the figure cited by CREPUQ only points to the disparity between the funds available to Quebec universities as opposed to the Canadian average rather than to a quantified need.
But for QS, according to David, the issue is not quite so black and white.
“I’m not an expert on university finances, but it’s certainly possible that there’s an underfunding,” David told The Daily in French. “It hasn’t been conclusively determined either way for me… But I also think that a lot of cleaning up needs to happen. Senior administrative salaries have definitely gotten ridiculous, especially with principals and rectors. McGill’s principal is the best example of this.”
Her party, however, does believe that the provincial funding model needs to be reassessed. With most universities’ dominant grants coming from head count, universities are pushing their enrolment numbers past capacity, according to David.
For its part, McGill has seen total enrolment rise by over 13 per cent since 2006, representing over 4,500 new students.
Furthermore, private sector funding has prioritized subsidized research over teaching, and led to the “development of certain disciplines for entirely financial reasons,” David said.
David also pointed to what she believes is a recurring preoccupation with prestige.
“For me, it’s an ideological question. I don’t know why we have to compete with the best universities in the world […] I think we have to be realistic.” Research and innovation are critical and should be encouraged, she said, but the role of universities should also be to foster “critical thought” in the public.
At Senate on October 22, McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum pointed to a drop in the University’s rankings – from 28 to 34 in the world, according to the Times Higher Education – as a cause for concern, and as a direct result of underfunding.
Since its inception in 2006, QS has advocated for the abolition of tuition in Quebec. David said that with the support of student federation Coalition large de l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE) and, most recently, the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) – Quebec’s second-largest trade union federation – QS hopes to put free tuition on the table during the summit.
“Because we’ve kept tuition frozen for so long, pretty soon given the way that the cost of living is going up, tuition will be – comparatively speaking – basically free,” said David. “But we think we need to go further, we need to get to a point where student debt is zero.”
QS believes the solution is simple: reinstate part of a tax abolished in 2007. The tax in question was levied on the permanent capital of all businesses in the province, and QS suggests reinstating the part which deals with financial institutions, “which don’t produce anything in the first place, but essentially make money off of money,” David explained.
According to QS and CLASSE’s calculations, this would generate at least $737 million, a number they consider more than adequate to finance free tuition.

Project manager cites “unforeseen site conditions”, promises that construction will halt during finals
 The construction outside the Redpath library will continue at least into early December and possibly longer, according to the architect in charge of the plan.
Students can also expect more construction throughout next fall for the third and final phase of the renovation.
According to Robert Stanley, the Director of Project Management for Facilities Operations and Development, “unforeseen site conditions” will delay the completion of the project past its projected finish date of October.
Delays in sourcing materials for the general contracting firm St. Denis Thompson, as well as additional masonry work, have slowed the project, Stanley said.
“Inevitably when we work on these old buildings, we find lots of surprises. Things aren’t quite what you think they’re going to be,” he told The Daily.
The $1.4-million contract has at least a dozen sub-contractors.
Stanley said that if the project is not completed by early December, it will shut down for the Fall exam period, which begins December 6.
Last fall, the first phase of the Redpath project – the renovation of the walkway connecting the McLennan doors to McTavish Street – was delayed well past its projected completion date of October 2011.
Internal emails obtained by The Daily indicate that phase one of last fall’s renovations was delayed into December partly as a result of a payment dispute between Kingston-Byers, the general contractor, and a masonry subcontractor.
According to emails from within University Services dated November 9, 2011 – the authors and recipients of which are redacted – a delay in the subcontractor’s paycheck resulted in a construction manager “sending a small crew, or no crew at all” in protest.
The final phase of the construction is scheduled to begin just after convocation this spring, and Stanley said he expected it to continue through the Fall 2013 term.
“We understand that this is an inconvenience to the student population, to the employees of the university, but we have no choice. We have a four-month window of downtime,” he said.
He added that construction for phase three could begin as early as May, but that the University has opted not to start until after the convocation ceremony.
Kingston-Byers is one of the many construction firms to have appeared in the Charbonneau Commission, the provincial inquiry into corruption in the Quebec construction industry.
The contractor worked on a Laval water-processing contract that went 60 per cent over budget.
“Kingston-Byers have been doing work for us for a long time,” Stanley said, calling them “one of the best contractors in Quebec.”
Asked if the Charbonneau Commission has had any indirect effect on construction projects at McGill, Stanley said that there is an “insidious attitude of painting people as being guilty just by virtue of ‘you’re in the industry.’”
“There’s a lot of cynicism out there, and it undermines the credibility of my team as project managers and as construction professionals,” he said.
“Internally, within the McGill community most especially, people don’t understand the complexities of the construction industry. And when that misunderstanding becomes disbelief, disbelief then becomes méfiance, lack of confidence, and mistrust,” he said.
Stanley said that he has notified higher administration officials that there is roughly $600 million worth of work to be done on campus during the next six years. “The University is crumbling around us, we have so much deferred maintenance work to address.”
Although the project’s information page on the McGill website states that the renovations will include smoothing out the terrace between McLennan and Redpath, the addition of a green terrace and a railing around the perimetre, Stanley emphasized that this was “not a beautification project.”
The project was initiated to address “chronic leaks [in the drainage system] that were damaging not only the contents of the spaces below but also adversely affecting the reinforced concrete.
