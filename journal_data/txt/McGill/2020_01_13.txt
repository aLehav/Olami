“No Justice, No Peace, US out of the Middle East”
On Sunday, January 5, just days after the US ordered the assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport, anti-war protestors took to the streets of downtown Montreal to decry US aggression.
Two Montreal demonstrations against a U.S.-Iran war were originally organized by separate parties – Montreal activist Shelby Johnson and the International League of Peoples’ Struggle (ILPS) in Canada – before deciding to merge into one unified demonstration, beginning at Phillips Square and ending at the US consulate on Saint Catherine Street West. As the protesters marched down Aylmer Street from Phillips Square, they chanted, “US imperialists, number one terrorists” and “No more war,” among other slogans.
Demonstrators held posters with anti-war messaging, such as “Stop economic terrorism now,” “US out of Middle East,” “No blood for oil,” and “Stop the war machine.” A few held up photos honouring the deceased general, a move which angered some Iranians at the rally who hold unfavourable views of the government. While marching down Maisonneuve Boulevard West, one protestor shouted “Islamic regime is terrorists” and waved the flag of the former monarchy in Iran, which was overthrown in the 1979 revolution.
After reaching the US consulate, a number of Iranians, Americans, and Canadians took turns decrying Western imperialism in the region. “No one deserves to live in a war zone,” one protestor declared.
Demonstrators Condemn Western Imperialism
In their speeches, speakers referred to the 1953 CIA coup in Iran, U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, the American occupation of Iraq, and its benefits to Western oil companies, many of whom gained profitable access to Iraq’s oil industry and came to dominate it because of the war.
While sanctions may not initially seem to put lives at risk, this is not the case in Iran. Due to sanctions and governmental mismanagement, Iranians lack critical access to humanitarian goods such as life-saving medicine, especially chemotherapy treatment drugs. The weight of sanctions introduced by US President Donald Trump in the past year have also resulted in inflation rates of 35.7 per cent according to the International Monetary Fund, meaning that the average price of consumer goods has risen by that percentage in the past year, therefore making it difficult for many Iranians to afford essential items. Deutsche Welle noted that the Statistical Center for Iran calculated an even higher inflation rate of 47.2 per cent, with food and fuel inflation at more than 60 per cent. This pressure has undoubtedly compounded into civilian unrest, as the Iranian government’s decision to increase gas prices in the wake of mounting economic stress incited widespread protests in the last few months of 2019.
Another protester in front of the consulate noted similarities between former US President Bill Clinton and sitting President Donald Trump. “The last time a president was impeached, he resorted to violence,” they stated to the crowd, “just to manipulate [US] domestic politics.” Indeed, in 1998, Clinton launched a strike against Iraq just days before his impeachment inquiry, and was later acquitted in the US Senate. Additionally, Trump’s tweets in 2011 and 2012 that stated Obama would strike Iran in order to be re-elected have resurfaced. One Twitter user called these statements “pure projection,” describing Trump’s actions as having “no plan, no strategy, no rhyme, no reason, just impulse from the man who thinks a president could try to stay in office by starting a war.” 
Varied Perceptions of Soleimani
One speaker turned to comment on the death of the Iranian military figure, stating “We are feeling the loss of General Soleimani […] he lived in the hearts and minds of the people in the Middle East.” This statement, again, was met with shouts from one protestor against the current Iranian government and Soleimani.
Indeed, there are varied opinions among Iranians and Iraqis of Soleimani. Many Iranians see him as having been one of the primary reasons for ISIS’ losses in the region, which garnered the late general immense respect. Thousands of Iranians attended his funeral in Tehran on January 6. However, some are not as saddened by his death, especially those living abroad. Just a day after the strike, the Los Angeles Times reported on Iranian-Americans’ reactions, citing quite a few of whom who felt relief at the news. One was quoted as saying “In a vacuum, objectively, his death is a welcome development,” but that for many Iranian-Americans, they “are fearful of the repercussions. This is a really dire situation if it escalates.”
Iran’s increasing involvement in Iraq’s political affairs has garnered Soleimani further criticism as well. France24 reported that Soleimani had visited Iraqi authorities in November 2019, advising them on how to repress the protestors in the midst of increasing demonstrations against Iranian influence. In Iraq, this repression by the state security forces led to the killings of 500 peaceful protestors and thousands of injuries. In December, Reuters reported that approximately 1,500 Iranians had been killed in demonstrations against the government across a two-week period.
After looking into leaked Iranian intelligence reports, The Intercept found that Shia militias’ actions in Iraq, which had been backed by Soleimani, had created an unfavourable perception of Iran by Iraqi Sunnis. In Jurf al-Sakhar, Shia militias loyal to the Soleimani led Quds force defeated ISIS in 2014, but the battle was followed by the killings of innocent civilians and the displacement of tens of thousands.
Effects on Iranians and Iranian-Americans
While many are averse to the current regime, for Iranian Americans, the idea of war is frightening. In the past week, President Trump has threatened the attack of 52 Iranian cultural sites, which, per Human Rights Watch, is a war crime. Many fear for their families’ safety in Iran, as well as increasing surveillance of Iranians in the US. The weekend after the strike, approximately 200 Iranian-Americans were detained and questioned at the Canadian border entering Washington state, and some were held for 12 hours.
Both the Los Angeles Police Department and the New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, issued tweets following the attack, calling on citizens to “say something if you see something” and stating that they “will have to be vigilant against this threat for a long time to come.” Many Twitter users have called these tweets “propaganda,” as one user argued that “these ridiculous warnings of non-existent ‘threats’ are just fear tactics to help sell Trump’s illegal imperial war of aggression against Iran.”
“I immediately just thought [after hearing the news of the strike], this is so terrible,” stated Persis Karim, director of the Center for Iranian Diaspora Studies at San Francisco State University, as quoted in the Los Angeles Times. “You can be critical and have feelings of disdain for a regime that murders its own people, and still believe that war is not going to be any kind of solution.”
As the protest in front of the US consulate cumulated around 1 p.m., the crowd repeatedly chanted “No justice, no peace, US out of the Middle East.”

Harsh Winters Difficult for Montrealers with Reduced Mobility
The failure to clear ice and snow from sidewalks presents a challenge to all pedestrians. As the weather worsens, the lack of pathway maintenance in the streets of Montreal shows a blatant disregard for Montrealers with reduced mobility.
Disability activists are calling for the City of Montreal to improve their snow removal program. Laurent Morissette, a wheelchair user and disability rights advocate with Regroupement Activistes Pour L’Inclusion Québec (RAPLIQ), contends that one concern is the city’s messy sidewalks. In an interview withGlobal News, the wheelchair-user describes being stuck in a pothole on the road and how it “took five minutes before [he was helped] out.”
The lack of maintenance forces Montrealers with physical disabilities and others with reduced mobility to remain in their homes, as private and public pathways become inaccessible. Morissette claims that it is normal for wheelchair users to stay in their homes for “the duration of winter.” With the increasing snowfall, disability rights advocates have been calling on the city to do more.
However, many Montrealers are unaware that the city has already announced the implementation of a reduced-mobility snow removal program.
In February of 2019, the City of Montreal launched a reduced mobility snow removal program to address such accessibility issues. According to The Montreal Gazette, Jean-François Parenteau, the mayor of Verdun, announced that the purpose of the program was to clear residential areas “when winter weather makes it dangerous to negotiate slippery front steps and paths.”
The city requires citizens to call 311, a hotline which direct callers to request for the city’s snow-removal service. By requiring citizens to call in their residential needs, the City of Montreal is delegating the task of clearing the streets on the residents themselves – rather than organizing a general city-wide snow removal initiative.
There is a lack of awareness about the reduced-mobility snow removal program, and a need to advertise it effectively. According to the CBC, the City of Montreal’s lack of progress in the program may be an economic choice. Last year, the city exceeded their budget by six million, providing them with incentive to withdraw out of initiatives they deemed to be costly, including the snow-removal program, estimated to cost 20 million.
Despite this, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante insists that there is a “proactive” snow removal plan in place, although no schedule of the plan’s enactment has been released. It is also unclear what this would look like, and the fact remains that for people with mobility issues, the city remains inaccessible.

The McGill Daily
On November 14, the SSMU Legislative Council convened for their second-to-last session of the fall semester. On the agenda were a number of motions, but also a number of recent controversies and concerns that had arisen over the prior two weeks. In addition, there were presentations by Lester Asset Management, the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (who came to announce their unionization drive), FL Fuller Landau LLP, and the McGill Scarlet Key Society.
Motions
Regarding motions, the Motion Regarding Amendments to the Committee Terms of Referencepassed unanimously, and the Motion concernant la Loi resserrant l’encadrement du cannabis passed, with two No votes (Councillors Andrew Chase and Evelyn Silverson-Tokawtlidis) and two abstentions (Councillors Kevin Franceschini and Beatrice Courchesne-Mackie). The latter motion, presented by Councillor André Lametti, mandates SSMU to oppose the recent changes passed by the provincial government on November 1 – raising the minimum legal age of cannabis consumption to 21 years and prohibiting the use of cannabis in any public space (outdoors or indoors).
The Motion Regarding Suspension of the Management Representatives, which arose due to the representatives’ failure to attend mandatory sexual and gendered violence training, also passed unanimously. Finally, there were two notices of motions, namely the Notice of Motion Regarding Adoption of the Climate Justice Policy, and the Notice of Motion Regarding Changes to the Internal Regulations of the Society’s Finances.
Question Period
Of particular note was the discussion that took place during question period, which covered a few controversial topics that had been brought to Council’s attention. During this time, Councillor Lametti asked what the SSMU listserv review process was, in light of the recent incident regarding the November 11 listserv, in which VP Internal Sanchi Bhalla was criticized for not having acknowledged Remembrance Day. In addition, Councillor Lametti asked why the VP Internal was not a signatory on the recent SSMU statement on Indigenous allyship, to which it was announced that Bhalla would be putting out a separate statement on the matter.
Councillor Jo Roy also asked about the status of the SSMU mini-courses, to which VP Student Life Billy Kawasaki stated that they were still being organized.
Councillor Bruno Marcoux brought up concerns over the use of profanity in a Facebook post from VP University Affairs Madeline Wilson condemning anti-Indigenous racism amongst the student body. In response to these concerns, Wilson responded that “I tend to use it […] specifically with regards to issues or topics I feel quite strongly about and that I feel deserve strong language, such as explicit racism directed at individuals, which is the reason I chose to use profanity in those communications.” Councillor Roy also pointed out that the debate over language amounted to tone policing, in addition to throwing support behind the VP University Affairs on the issue.Concerns about Free Trips Offered by Hillel
Finally, councillors discussed the recent offers of free trips to Israel from Hillel Montreal, given to a number of campus leaders – news of which was published in the Daily earlier that week. A number of SSMU staff – including Andrew Chase (Arts Representative), Adin Chan (Arts Representative and SSMU Director), Paige Collins (SSMU Director), Jonah Levitt (SSMU Director), and Jordyn Wright (Science Representative and SSMU Director) – all planned to attend the free trip at the time of Legislative Council. (As noted in The Bull and Bear, Councillor Chan has since declined the offer.) During the discussion there were concerns over both whether this represented a potential conflict of interest, as well as whether it would be possible to go on this trip as an individual completely independent of one’s office.
The feature, co-authored by McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) and McGill Students’ Chapter of Independent Jewish Voices (IJV), noted the expansion of Maccabee Task Force – an overt anti-BDS organization (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement) – to Canada in 2018. “Given that the first trip of this kind was allegedly offered by Hillel Montreal in the same year (2018), it is reasonable to suspect that MTF is providing much, if not all, of the funding for Hillel Montreal’s initiative,” SPHR and IJV wrote in the Daily. In response to these concerns, Councillors Chan and Chase read statements to why they felt this would not violate conflict of interest, as did Councillor Wright.
Following their statements, Wilson addressed Council, saying, “do not think it is possible to separate your position as arts representative, or whatever your position may be, from your personal interest in this trip. Whether you are compliant with the conflict of interest policy of not, I do not think is relevant in this case.” These sentiments were further echoed by VP External Adam Gwiazda-Amsel, Councillor Noah Meralli, and Councillor Jo Roy in separate statements.
Additionally, Councillor Lametti brought up concerns that “we have two different stories, one saying that members of council received these offers on a personal basis, and one saying they received it on the basis of the position they hold.”
“To me,” Lametti continued, “if it is the case that if they did indeed [receive] it based on the position they hold, this may or may not constitute a conflict of interest. I don’t think councillors should be receiving monetary gifts of a significant value based on their position.”

Project Genesis Gives Statement
Participants voiced their concerns about the state of Montreal’s welfare system in a press release from Project Genesis. As it stands now, participants in the Aim for Employment Program (Programme objectif emploi) only receive $669 per month as an independent adult, and recipients may have their participation allowance of $165 taken back if they do not participate in job training, according to Le Devoir. Considering the cost of living in Montreal – a studio apartment on the island costs about $649 per month, according to Sheetal Pathak, a community organizer from Project Genesis quoted in the press release – these funds are insufficient for those seeking employment.
Montreal’s welfare system actively penalizes those looking for full-time jobs, as any income earned over the $200 maximum is cut from a recipient’s subsequent welfare check dollar-for-dollar. Because of this, many of those on welfare are reluctant to work more than a precarious part-time job. In fact, recipients can only work 16 hours per month on minimum wage – the equivalent of $200, per the press release – before having their welfare check cut. There is also a great deal of paperwork involved in instituting these restrictions: welfare offices often require proof that recipients aren’t working full-time, and one woman reported that she was fired from her job simply because her employer was irritated with the amount of paperwork that employing her entailed.
The statement from Project Genesis details her story: “He clearly told me: ‘You do your job well, we like you around here, but I can’t take care of the paperwork anymore, I’m going to have to let you go.’”(«Tu fais bien ton travail, on t’aime bien ici, mais je ne peux plus m’occuper de toute cette paperasse, je vais devoir te congédier.»)
Furthermore, the process of entering the welfare system requires extensive documentation, including a piece of identification, a birth certificate, documents that “determine your […] current income and income ending during the month of the application,” among other items. At the bottom of Appendix 2 in the application for social assistance benefits there is also a disclaimer, stating that “the Ministère reserves the right to ask you at any time to provide any documents and information required to verify your eligibility for last-resort financial assistance and determine the amount that could be granted to you. Failure to provide documents or information may lead to the refusal of your application.”
Due to how difficult it is to receive approval for welfare, many recipients are extremely hesitant to leave the welfare system. Indeed, accepting work of any kind is a risk for welfare recipients: many of them work part-time or contract-based jobs, so they may exceed their maximum of 16 hours one month, yet not have any work at all the following month. In such cases, they receive less than the $669 which they would otherwise be entitled to during their unemployed month. The press release details this further, stating that those who work varying hours and wages are particularly subject to the instability propagated by the welfare system, as “welfare will prefer to cut ‘too much’ to avoid recipient accumulating debt.”
Despite the inefficient and counterproductive nature of Quebec’s welfare system, the government has balked at reforming it. In fact, the basic benefit which an individual recipient can claim each month ($644) has not changed since 1999. As the press release states, due to inflation, this means that the number of hours a recipient can work each month has decreased from 29 to 16 over the past two decades. The mandatory work program, Objectif Emploi, has also faced controversy. The program offers a participation allowance of $165 to members on the condition that they meet with a social welfare agent every two weeks to search for employment opportunities, according to Le Devoir. However, Project Genesis states that it has done little to meet recipients’ financial needs.
“This program is based on the same logic which works against what we can see at the Genesis Project, where recipients of welfare tell us that they want to work, but the welfare system itself works creates obstacles and makes looking for employment difficult, or even impossible.” (« Ce programme est basé sur une logique qui va à l’encontre de ce que nous constatons au Projet Genèse, où les prestataires d’aide sociale nous disent qu’ils et elles veulent travailler mais que le système d’aide sociale lui-même leur impose des obstacles et rend la recherche d’emploi difficile, voir impossible. »
In response to these issues, the demonstration’s participants advocate for increasing the amount of welfare given per month, increasing the maximum number of hours recipients may work, lightening the administrative burdens imposed on recipients, and making welfare more accessible. Project Genesis asks Minister Boulet to “fight poverty, not the people living in it.”

In the Wake of Reversing Opt-Outs in Ontario
Between November 12 and 14, the Concordia Student Union (CSU) held a by-election with a number of referendum questions, including one about making opt-outs for fee-levy-based organizations available online, instead of solely in-person. The question presented to voters explained that “a fee levy organization is a student-led organization or initiative at Concordia University” which students pay into, and that receives all (or part) of its operating budget from fees.
“Students have a right to opt out in-person to get their money back,” the question read. “Other universities allow you to do this online. The new system would allow you to opt out of each organization individually. Before opting out, students will be informed about what the organization does.” While the explanation also claims that “the system will be created in consultation with all fee-levy organizations,” it is unclear how exactly the CSU plans to do this.
The final question posed to students – “Do you support Concordia University bringing the opt out process online for student fee levy organizations?” – passed with 61.1 per cent of voters in favour of it, and 38.9 per cent against.
With this result, all fee-levy-based groups at Concordia may see their funding diminished. The list of organizations affected consists of student-run newspapers the Link and theConcordian, as well as a number of groups – many of them equity-based and social-justice-oriented – including Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) Concordia, the Center for Gender Advocacy, Cinema Politica, CJLO, Queer Concordia, Concordia University Television (CUTV), Concordia Food Coalition, Le Frigo Vert, and the People’s Potato, among others.
It is unclear at this time how much these groups’ funding will be affected. “More than half of our budget comes from student fee-levies,” Current Affairs Editor Erika Morris from the Link wrote in an email to the Daily, “but we don’t know how many students would choose to opt-out so it’s really up in the air.”
The Concordian is in a similar boat. “At the moment, we’re unsure about what to expect,” Matthew Coyte, Managing Editor at The Concordian, told the Daily.
“We could get lucky and the online opt-out rate turns out to be relatively low and doesn’t affect our financials too much. On the other hand, we could very well see a high opt-out rate that would put us in the same boat as student media organizations in Ontario who are dealing with the same issue.”
While both student-run newspapers are at this time unsure of what the future holds, Coyte added that in-person opt-outs are preferable. “You can’t blame students for wanting to save money, I get that,” he continued, “that’s why in-person opt-outs are nice. We get a chance to show students what their money is going towards.”
CUTV is also in a difficult position because of the referendum results. Jenny Cunningham, the Director of Communications at CUTV, told the Daily via email that the organization is “likely to lose a substantial amount of funding.” Per Cunningham, CUTV offers students access to production equipment, paid opportunities at Concordia, free workshops in production skills, and more.
“Many people rely on CUTV to further their projects and skills and it saddens us that this place they depend on could face changes,” she concluded. “However, we also understand the perspective that many students face financial pressures and having the option to opt out of these fees would be an attractive option.”
In addition to media outlets at Concordia, a number of equity-based organizations may be hit hard. Julie Michaud, Outreach Coordinator at the Centre for Gender Advocacy (CGA) told the Daily via email that the CGA is “very concerned about the additional loss of funding that this will entail.”
“Fee-levy groups not only provide many essential services that students rely on, including free lunches, affordable food, free and confidential peer support, support for LGBTQ+ students and much more, they also contribute to the overall culture at Concordia,” Michaud added.
But while Concordia may have taken a step in the same direction as Doug Ford’s vision of post-secondary opt-outable fees, Ontario student groups may get their funding back again. In a unanimous decision the Ontario Divisional Court struck down Ford’s Student Choice Initiative (SCI) and deemed it “unlawful,” instead ruling in favour of the Canadian Student’s Federation. Announced in January, the SCI allowed post-secondary students to opt-out of ancillary fees devoted to funding student groups, unions and university papers.
With opt-out rates for student papers varying from 90 per cent (The Lambda at Laurentian University) to 25 per cent (The Varsity at the University of Toronto), many university journalistic projects have been stalled or abandoned, “limiting ambition [of] young student creators.” In the case of U of T, full coverage of both campuses is no longer possible. Several papers, including The Eyeopener (Ryerson University) and The Varsity reported having to cut staff or delay hiring new employees, and losing the ability to provide honorariums to contributors.
“It has been harder,” Liane McLarty, general manager of The Eyeopener said. “We don’t have the same resources anymore, which fundamentally impacts things like how many stories we can cover at once, how much money we can invest into a story, how many resources we can offer to our editors who work hours on end for these jobs, how many volunteers we can compensate for their effort and energy into writing for us, and so many other things.”
While Josie Kao, editor-in-chief of The Varsity, described the effects of the SCI as a “huge loss” to the paper, she also spoke to campus support for student journalism. “25 per cent of our students opted out. While any opt-out is bad, this definitely isn’t the worst case scenario I could imagine. Since the opt-out, it’s been gratifying to see the support coming from the community – how people would advocate on behalf of The Varsity and journalism on campus.”
Although the Ontario Divisional Court’s decision is a victory for student groups and papers, it is unclear what the process of opt-outs will be going forward. The Varsity informed the Daily that U of T’s administration has acknowledged the ruling, but hasn’t outlined any future steps. “The SCI is officially dead now, but we really haven’t seen any proof of that,” Kao said. “The opt-out option is still currently live on our portal, students can still opt-out right now. […] I have no idea if this means this coming semester we’ll still have an opt-out, or if this will only be in effect next year.”
The Ford administration has not commented on the ruling, and it is unclear if they will appeal the Divisional Court’s decision.

The Invisible Labour of Sex Workers
Due to criminalization, sex workers are forced to perform invisible labour that is both stigmatized and unrecognized. The McGill Daily surveyed student sex workers on the labour and care that goes into their work, as well as the difficulties and benefits of their jobs. Like any industry, sex work suffers from the deficiencies of capitalism, namely the precarity of their labour. The Daily does not want to homogenize the realities of sex work, but instead offer a platform to the non-obvious and uncredited labour that sex workers do.
Though the labour of sex work is physically, emotionally and practically exhaustive, sex workers are left out of conversations of burnout and self care. Several students who work in the industry spoke to the Daily about the personal labour and care work that goes into sex work, and the necessity for making space for self-preservation and reflection. Between “taking necessary sexual precautions,” regular STI testing, maintaining their appearance, and physical safety, respondents spoke to the labour that goes into the day-to-day of their work on top of balancing their school work.
“A lot of times, more privileged people paint the industry as glamorous. They might have been lucky enough to get nicer clients maybe, but I think also more privileged able bodied thin white cis women will be treated nicer because their bodies are more valued. But we don’t all get that experience. I think we all need support because we *are* workers (this is work!) but support is not the same thing as the pretense that some of the more privileged strains of liberal feminism work with; namely it attempts to combat the stigma we face by acting like those of us in this line of work don’t face abuse by people who think their money entitles them to do whatever they want to our bodies. “
– McGill graduate student who does sugar baby work
An undergraduate student at McGill who works as an escort spoke to the emotional and practical difficulties in their work: “virtually all my clients are awful to varying degrees; it requires a performance of femininity that runs contrary to my preferred gender presentation; the risk of violence is extremely high; the process of negotiating over how much my services are worth is profoundly demeaning; and the fact that I can’t talk about these things with many people in my life.”
Community based organizations, such as Stella and Maggie’s, provide supportive groups and spaces for sex workers, but many student sex workers still feel the strain of not being able to share the day-to-day pressures of their work, as most workers outside of the industry can.
As forms of digital sex work become more prevalent in the industry, advertising services and screening client bases online comes with a distinct set of challenges. Due to restrictive “community standards” and platform guidelines, sex workers often find their content removed, or their accounts suspended or silently “shadowbanned.” Recent legislation such as the FOSTA/SESTA bill passed in the United States provide legitimacy for these restrictions as they attempt to combat sex trafficking. However, bills such as these group definitions of sex trafficking in with consensual sex work, censoring and preventing sex workers from discussing and offering services, further complicating the labour of sex workers and implicating their work as illicit. In conjunction with subscription sites such as Patreon, credit card processing firms like Google Pay and PayPal flag and ban transactions involving “adult content,” making it difficult for sex workers to safely and easily recieve compensation for their services. As they are pushed off these platforms, not only are environments like these delegitimizing for sex workers and their labour, it also places significant barriers on workers maintaining their livelihoods and safety. In an interview with Vice, camgirl Melody Kush explained that platforms are “not discriminating our content, they’re discriminating our persons, our work, our jobs. They’re invalidating us.”
Stella, a Montreal organization for sex workers, keeps record of bad clients based on reports from sex workers. The list is updated monthly, because the labour of safety is ongoing. This labour is done by sex workers to protect themselves, but also to protect each other. Outside of Montreal, unofficial whisper networks serve the same purpose and are common within sex worker communities.
In addition to maintaining this list, Stella also provides medical and other services for sex workers. As in all industries, industry-specific resources and services are vital to sex workers. Unlike many other industries, the task of providing those resources is relegated to community organizations; both stigma and the law prevent sex workers from seeking those resources in more public spaces. Stella is run by current and former sex workers, as well as community workers, who do this extra labour because the precarity of sex work in the North American context demands it. In areas without centralized community organizations and support systems, much of this labour is left to individual sex workers themselves.
 
“There’s a very nuanced and tense debate among [sex workers] about how one should view the industry. Personally I’m very critical of [sex work] as a phenomenon – I think that under our current social conditions (that is, under a capitalist and patriarchal system) it’s pretty intrinsically harmful and fucked up. That said, we can also reduce harm to workers by decriminalizing [sex work], and that should be an immediate priority – I just don’t think it’s enough in the long term, ultimately we need to topple the aforementioned systems altogether.” 
– McGill undergraduate student who does escort work 
Even in countries (such as Canada) where sex work is technically decriminalized, there are aspects of sex work that are still prosecuted. Canada operates on the “Nordic model,” i.e. criminalizing clients instead of sex workers themselves. In theory, this is supposed to make things easier for sex workers. In practice, they can still be criminalized for soliciting sex in a public place, using their homes as spaces in which to conduct their work, and living off of the profits obtained through sex work. In short, sex workers can’t be arrested for having sex, but they can be arrested for virtually every non-sexual part of their jobs. Many sex workers have reported that criminalization of their work has led to a reduced ability to negotiate safer sex with clients, as carrying condoms and lubricant can be used as evidence of sex work. Studies have also shown that disclosing one’s identity as a sex worker can have a negative impact on relationships with service providers, and could lead to police entrapment. One study showed that “even when physical access to cervical screening sites appears to be sufficient, social and structural barriers continue to impede regular, voluntary cervical screening among sex workers.”
While keeping oneself safe from prosecution is one type of labour that sex workers need to perform, they also need to consider their bodily safety. According to Maggie’s, a Toronto organization for sex workers, “many workers do choose to host at their own place or a hotel despite the legal risk because hosting offers other types of safety.” Maggie’s also suggests that people “work in well-lit, populated [areas] when possible. While this can discourage bad dates, it may lead to unwanted attention from police, neighbours, etc.” Having to decide between which type of safety is more important is an emotionally-draining type of labour that many don’t think of when considering sex work.
As a undergraduate student who does cam work told the Daily, “Some people talk about sex work as this dehumanizing thing, but in my experience with camming (which I know is very different from other kinds of sex work) it hasn’t been any more dehumanizing than working retail, for instance. Not to blame capitalism, but like, it’s because of capitalism. In my experience, neither customers nor employers see you as a human being. […] At least when you’re self-employed, like I am, you only have shitty customers to deal with.”
