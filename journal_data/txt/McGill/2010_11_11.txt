The main grievance at Tuesday’s Town Hall was the lack of student consultation on the hot-button issues of tuition and the allocation of student and research space as Principal Heather Munroe-Blum engaged with students en masse for the first time this school year.
Senators, council members, and core members of the activist group Mobilization McGill, along with other students, filled the Molson Hall common room. Unlike past town halls, few faculty or staff came forward to ask questions.
In response to questions about tuition, Munroe-Blum explained that when she came to McGill in 2003, Quebec universities faced a $350-million gap in average funding between Quebec and the rest of the country, but that government support was the highest in the country.
According to Munroe-Blum, government support is currently fifth or the sixth in the country. “And then we lack in Quebec the culture of philanthropy,” she added. She argued that tuition increases were a part of filling this funding shortfall.
“Tuition fees have their place if they are accompanied by a commitment to student financial aid, but our first stop is federal and provincial government,” she said.
Robyn Wright-Fraser, U1 Arts, asked how much of the current $800-million dollar gap in university funding would be filled by tuition hikes. According to Munroe-Blum, the majority of the gap will have to be filled by “sustained” government financing: “15 per cent less of our funding comes from tuition than other universites with our mandate,” she said.
Eli Freedman, U1 Management student and Management representative to SSMU council, voiced concerns over the emphasis on graduate programs and how this would impact the undergraduate student experience. Munroe-Blum explained that a Task Force on the issue and her appointment of a Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) in 2003 were meant to redress these concerns.
“We’ve increased our total revenues year after year for the better part of the last decade…there’s no question but that the overall investment in those domains [undergraduate life] has gone up,” she said.
Guy Mark Lifshitz, U4 Computer Science student and Mobilization McGill member, asked “why decisions regarding the Architecture Café [were] done in closed session,” referring to the confidential portions of Board of Governor’s meetings.
“Many of the decisions taken by the University develop on a multi-year basis – and the implementation of these decisions also happens on a multi-year basis,” Munroe-Blum replied. “Given the fact that student leadership changes every year, those who are involved are often not here when [decisions] are implemented.”
“One of the major goals of [Mendelson’s] working group is to understand how we can consult [in] ways that will have people who are affected, informed, and engaged in the decision-making process,” she continued.
She maintained, however, that there would always be closed sessions of the Board, to “to protect confidentiality, to deal with issues of competitiveness on real estate and other things.”
Heather Munroe-Blum repeatedly said that she was hearing of cuts in more localized areas for the first time – mainly grad student research space and employment as well as recent cuts to tier-two and tier-three sports teams.
Emily Essert, PhD 5 in English, said that she works in a department of “have and have-nots.”
“Those who have obtained RA-ships have study space, those who don’t may not…I got an email yesterday – when we go to teach, there may or may not be TA-ships available,” she said.
Munroe-Blum responded by saying, “We have narrowed the gap in support for our graduate students …but there is still a gap – we are looking to bridge it through philanthropy, and the majority of our campaign has gone to support students with a very special focus on providing financial aid and fellowships for our students.”
Joseph Giardini, U3 Computer Science, expressed his displeasure with a lack of “promised” follow-up on the bike forum held last month. Munroe-Blum deferred to Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell, who said that it wasn’t his understanding that there was a commitment to follow-up, but that there would be more “info sharing.”
“We’re working hard to eliminate those on the margins that don’t comply [with the ban on campus biking]…there’s not an appetite for going back on cars or bikes,” said Munroe-Blum.
In the wake of the Town Hall, SSMU VP University Affairs Josh Abaki, VP External Myriam Zaidi, President Zach Newburgh, and Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson met informally yesterday. They agreed that SSMU and the administration should work together on three issues. The issues, according to Zaidi, including Bill 100, government funding of universities, and government-sponsored financial aid to students.
“Ultimately the message at the meeting today is that we should be bringing the entire community together to lobby the government, rather than doing so in factions,” said Newburgh.
“We are in the process of developing an approach with the principal, and we sowed the seeds for this kind of partnership especially at today’s meeting,” he said.

Activists deem it recruitment, others disagree
On November 4, the Jewish Studies Student Association (JSSA), along with the Bronfman Israel Experience Centre, commonly known as Birthright, hosted a pizza lunch and discussion with three IDF soldiers in the Jewish Studies building. During the event, protesters gathered outside to demonstrate against the presence of Israeli military personnel.
Joseph Shapell, a member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), explained that SPHR had seen the event advertised and individual members of SPHR had decided to protest the event. “[We were protesting] on the principle of having military personnel on campus…I think a campus has to be a safe, secure environment for students,” Shapell said.
JSSA President Peter Fusco was surprised by the event’s high attendance and by the ensuing protest and interest among students. “Our events usually draw seven to eight people, and usually for the free food,” Fusco said. “Way more people showed up than I thought would.”
Fusco explained that the JSSA did not organize the event and that an event with IDF soldiers was “unprecedented” for the JSSA. Fusco said he was contacted through Eric Kaplan, Chair of the Jewish Studies Department, who was himself approached by Birthright.
“In reality it was just me sending out an email. I didn’t organize it… I just promoted it…it wasn’t really our event. We shy away from those kind of…loaded political issues,” Fusco said.
Fusco explained that the JSSA tries to be aware of their role as an academic student association: “[The JSSA is] a student organization that represents an academic department at McGill which is obviously supposed to be neutral, apolitical, objective as best it can, because it’s Jewish studies not a Jewish organization. … It’s not for Jewish students, it’s for people who want to study Jewish culture, history, and religion,” Fusco said.
“I think [protesters] found it inappropriate that a non-academic event involving a Zionist organization, which is what Birthright is… was on campus and that it was sponsored by a student group that was supposed to be academically oriented,” Fusco said about the JSSA’s involvement in the event.
Shapell attended the event and listened to the soldiers’ talk. The soldiers spoke at intervals about their lives and then took time to answer questions. Shapell said that “things went downhill very quickly.”
Shapell described the reaction of others at the event, saying that people criticized those who vocally disagreed with the soldiers. According to Shapell, a student in the audience told him to “be respectful and keep quiet” after Shapell questioned a soldier on civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.
Fusco’s view of events was different: “It seemed to me from my perspective that it was a very honest, open type of dialogue with these guys… They were speaking honestly about their lives, how they grew up, and what position they put themselves into or [had] been presented with. They seemed to me down to earth” Fusco said.
“[The soldiers] have to be willing to take questions form all sides. If there isn’t room for that then it isn’t an academic space. It’s abusing academic space – using space simply to further an ideological aim, which is inappropriate. They came to talk about their experience as soldiers: I have a right to ask about aspects of their military service that I am curious about,” Shapell said.
“They weren’t propagandists, throwing this staunch Zionist line,” Fusco said. “I don’t think it was recruitment as much as it was positive PR for Birthright.”
 Josh Pepin, Director of the Bronfman Israel Experience Centre, said the soldiers were “there for educational reasons, not for political reasons.”
Pepin went on to say that Israeli soldiers are not allowed to discuss politics in public events.
Pepin emphasized that the soldiers are “normal 18 to 20-year -olds with different lives,” referring to Israel’s policy of conscripting all 18-year-old non-Arab citizens into the military.
Shapell disagreed: “There are students here [at McGill] who are from the West Bank,” he said. “I think for Palestinian students the presence of IDF soldiers is a scary thing.”
“I think the administration has responsibility if military personnel are going to be on campus to make it as academic as possible and as open and unintimidating as possible,” Shapell continued. “Administration should be cognizant of when military will be on campus.”
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson said in an email to The Daily that he was not aware that IDF soldiers were on campus. “I don’t know why they would need approval for what seems to have been a meeting of their group in space in their department,” Mendelson wrote. “McGill does not ban members of the military from campus.”
“The University staunchly upholds freedom of expression on campus within the bounds of the law,” he continued.
Fusco echoed Mendelson’s assessment of free speech on campus, saying, “It’s totally appropriate to have Israeli soldiers on campus to speak. … It’s important to talk to people like that from a different perspective regardless of how worked up people get about the political issue.”
He added, however, that the collaboration with Birthright was problematic.
“I wouldn’t co-sponsor with Birthright or an organization like that again,” he said. “I would want to do it myself, in that it’s a purely academic, objective debate.”

Progress made; more still needed
A panel on women in leadership was held in the Bronfman building on Tuesday, organized by Management students Ralph Jeanbart and Stéphanie Elsliger-Garant. The panel featured many prominent executives from Montreal’s business sector, the majority of them women.
Students gathered to hear the panel optimistically project the future of leadership roles for women. Panelists agreed that women have gradually become more important players in the business world, and that their roles will only increase in time. Ingrid Langlois, Director of Commercial Banking at Scotia Bank Montreal, stated that she has seen more women in prominent positions at Scotia Bank since she started her career. 
“Statistically speaking,” Langlois said, “the percentage of women in managerial positions is on an upward trend.” 
Yet some panelists stressed that while there certainly has been a noticeable trend of growing female leadership in the workplace, the progress is far from complete. 
“There still exists an old boys club,” said Langlois. 
Kirk Johnson, partner at the law firm Irving, Mitchell, Kalichman – and the only male member on the panel – pointed towards his own experience in seeing many women in his graduate class eventually opt out of the business world. 
“Business is a tough, competitive place,” said Johnson, “and females are worried that they will be unable to complete.” 
Panelists, however, were confident that the barriers toward women in leadership would finally be overcome by the current generation of students. Dana Ades-Landy, Senior Vice President of National Accounts at Banque Laurentienne, predicted that in twenty years talent will rise to the top, regardless of gender. 
“The younger generation will accelerate the change,” said Ades-Landy. 
Edith Luc, an associate professor in Psychology at HEC Montréal, agreed with Johnson, pointing toward academic scholarship that illustrates that women can help companies succeed. 
Nonetheless, members of the panel stated that the change is not inevitable. They all maintained that action must be taken now by the current generation. 
“You are the next leaders, it’s on your shoulders,” said Natalie Francisci, Executive Vice President at Mandrake Groupe Conseil, looking directly at the student portion of the audience.
“Women are an asset to any organization,” said Johnson.

Ewa Jasiewicz is a British-Polish activist, a coordinator with the Free Gaza Movement, and a member of the editorial collective of Le Monde Diplomatique’s Polish edition. She was in the Gaza Strip throughout the conflict there in January of 2009. Last May, she rode on the Challenger 1, one of the six boats that attempted to break the siege of Gaza before they were apprehended in international waters by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Nine Turkish nationals were killed by the IDF soldiers aboard another of the boats, the Mavi Marmara. Gaza has been blockaded by Egyptian and Israeli forces since Hamas took control of the Strip in June 2007.
The Mcgill Daily: How did you get involved in Palestine solidarity activism?
Ewa Jasiewicz: I first got involved through the [International Solidarity Movement] in 2003, because of friends of mine who had been out to Palestine. … I didn’t know that much about Palestine when I went there. This was just about six months after [Operation] Defensive Shield, so there were still a lot of incursions and curfews and, you know, once you see what the Israel army and state is doing to the Palestinian people – you see people’s homes destroyed, blown up, people killed, people injured and just daily violence – you can’t really forget it, can you? You can’t not be active around it because it becomes personal.
MD: What were the objectives of the flotilla that was attacked in May?
EJ: The objective primarily was to break the siege. The carrying of humanitarian goods was for us symbolic. … It did physically ease the blockade because the Rafah crossing [between Egypt and Palestinian-controlled Rafah] is now open. Okay, still not far enough, and Egypt is still a co-oppressor in the siege, but thousands of people were able to cross who wouldn’t have been able to cross before. That’s one measure of success. But it was also the boost it gave to the [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)] movement because it shifted many people into supporting the BDS tactic who before had maybe been on the fence. So many artists, musical acts cancelled their acts afterwards – [like] the Gorillaz and the Pixies. And then of course the United Nations fact-finding mission report just shows you again how Israel has violated international law. But it is a success to have brought in effectively another country. The government of Turkey reacted strongly and demanded a NATO emergency meeting and got it and really diplomatically put the spotlight on condemning Israel. And that’s a really positive thing and the whole of Turkey was really behind that. And it has really changed the relationship between those two countries.
MD: Israel has claimed that some of the members of the flotilla are linked to Al-Qaeda and that IHH [The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Aid, a Turkish NGO] is also linked to Al-Qaeda.
EJ: This is just absolute bullshit. Because if Israel really believed that there’s no way they would have let everybody go and released everybody. … They didn’t do that because it’s not true.
MD: Can you describe the flotilla raid?
EJ: The flotilla raid began in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark. That was a political decision by the Israeli navy, because they wanted to use the darkness to terrorize us and also to hide the actions of their soldiers. … So they continued trailing us and we were outrunning them for a while, maybe half an hour. We did hear shooting [from the Marmara], that was really horrible, but we were carrying on and then our captain decided to stop because he was feeling like they were going to cut us off and ram us and he didn’t want that. So he cut the engine and then they came closer and closer and then they just opened fire on the boat with plastic projectiles, smoke bombs. And they hit my friend in the face and she had blood all over her face and they wouldn’t let me treat her, they wouldn’t let anyone get to her, they were beating [my friend] Huwaida, and smashed the glass door open on the inside of the boat, they tasered the Sydney Morning Herald journalist, they cuffed me, they cuffed Huwaida, they put a hood on Huwaida and [another friend] Anna, they threatened to taser us, they were really brutal, they stomped on my face and then they took us into custody. … When it came to us being deported we kept saying that we wanted to see our council or our lawyer, that we didn’t want to leave, that we didn’t agree to this deportation, and they were just physically very aggressive with us and forced us out. They were beating people with truncheons and throwing chairs, and it was really horrible.
MD: And that’s when you were in detention?
EJ: Yes, we were still in detention.
MD: Were any of your fellow activists carrying weapons?
EJ: No, there were no weapons. Every single boat was searched. there were absolutely no weapons aboard any of the boats. That’s why people on the Marmara had to blowtorch some of the railings to make primitive weapons, to make crowbars, because they didn’t have normal weapons. They did have the right to defend themselves. You even have the right to defend yourself using firearms if you’re attacked at sea [in international waters].
MD: Do you feel that Hamas needs to be engaged diplomatically?
EJ: Without a doubt.

Café closure sparked the move, but no longer an issue for ASA
The Architecture Students’ Association (ASA) formally joined the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) following a unanimous vote in favour of the motion at EUS Council Tuesday night.
The ASA became the seventh society to join the existing family of six independent departmental societies (including Chemical, Civil, and Mechanical Engineering) represented by the EUS’s Memorandum of Agreement with the McGill administration.
These departmental associations possess council privileges that include voting rights and representative seats on the EUS but also retain their individual structures and autonomy.
“Architecture is already part of the Faculty of Engineering, so this move makes a lot of sense,” EUS President Daniel Keresteci told the council. “We’ve worked a lot with the ASA in the past and we’d like to continue and improve that relationship.”
The motion was the formalization of a referendum passed during last week’s elections period, in which a majority of Architecture students voted in favour of the ASA joining the EUS. Of 170 Architecture students, 110 participated in the vote.
The motion was passed at EUS Council with no opposition or abstentions, although Keresteci took a moment to briefly clarify that this change would not affect student fees in either faculty. Josh Redel, EUS VP Communications, also reassured those present that ASA would retain the same rights and privileges as any other EUS departmental society, including U0 to U4 representative seats.
Joining the EUS grants the ASA a more formalized standing with the McGill administration via the EUS’s Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), a contract between the society and the University administration. ASA President Kyle Burrows stressed that this formal recognition was the main benefit of allying with the EUS, as MoAs are rarely granted to sub-faculty groups.
“[McGill’s administration] doesn’t recognize student groups below the faculty level,” Burrows said. “Lacking formal recognition with the school…has always limited what we can do.”
Meredith Toivanen, the ASA’s VP Communications, agreed that the move would improve the ASA’s standing and leverage with the McGill administration.
“It gives us a sense of legitimacy in the eyes of McGill,” Toivanen said.
Toivanen added that while the administration’s decision to close the Architecture Café this past summer pushed this issue forward, the alliance was intended to protect the ASA in the future and not to address past grievances.
“Essentially, the Architecture Café as an issue for the ASA has passed,” Toivanen said. “The EUS won’t be able to provide any assistance for what has happened in the past. However, if anything comes up in the future, as members of the EUS, we’ll be in better standing.”
In defending the motion from the EUS side, Keresteci said that bringing like-minded students closer together and representing a wider swath of the student population would benefit the EUS. Keresteci added that although the ASA is a latecomer to the EUS relative to the other six sub-faculty groups, the EUS constitution is designed to allow the inclusion of new departmental societies.
“This is definitely something that [the EUS] has sort of planned for,” Keresteci said. “The right pieces just needed to fall into place.”

Hospital management and categorization of care upsets
This year, as Canadians from all walks of life pay tribute to Canada’s fallen soldiers, some veterans and their families are facing uncertainty about what the future holds in store for them.
On Saturday, roughly eighty veterans and their supporters gathered in front of Bloc Québécois MP Josée Beaudin’s St. Lambert office as part of the Veterans National Day of Protest. They were protesting changes to veteran pensions and disability benefits prescribed by the New Veterans Charter.
The veterans also opposed the transfer of Ste. Anne’s Hospital – a facility operated by the federal government to exclusively treat and rehabilitate veterans – from the federal government to the provincial government.  Their fear is that both these measures could lead to a deterioration of veterans’ quality of life.
The New Veterans Charter was adopted in 2006 and changed how various benefits – like pensions and disability – are paid. Pierre Allard, Director of the Royal Canadian Legion’s Service Bureau, told The Daily that the legion supports the charter, but recognizes certain problems with it.
In June 2009, the New Veterans Charter Advisory Group (NVCAG) – of which Allard is a member – released a report entitled “Honouring our Commitments to Veterans and their Families.” Allard says that the report should be regarded as the “blueprint” for treatment of veterans.
The report emphasizes the nature of the charter as a “living” document, saying that “the spirit and intent of the New Veterans Charter is right,” but that “there are still gaps in services.”
The report points out that Veteran Affairs Canada (VAC) does not cover the cost of bereavement services for fallen soldiers, and that only four Permanent Impairment Allowances had been awarded as of January 2009, despite 149 veterans being deemed “totally and permanently incapacitated” as of October 2008. The VAC website describes the benefit as a monthly taxable allowance payable to soldiers suffering from lost job opportunities due to service-related impairments
In spite of these flaws, Allard did not waver in his support for the charter, saying that it is an effective rehabilitation support tool, and that it “encourages ability rather than disability.” He remained confident that the recommendations made by NVCAG to address the problems would be heeded.
Former VAC Ombudsman Pat Stogran, whose five-year term as VAC Ombudsman came to a controversial end yesterday after his appointment was not renewed, has been less forgiving. While accepting the New Veterans Charter as a blueprint for veteran treatment, he pointed out that it was roughly five years ago that the charter was adopted, and stressed that the recommended changes were long overdue.
Stogran wrote in a September 24 blog post that the changes to the charter should be “timely, comprehensive, transparent and retroactive.”
He added that “the fact that the Government was slow to make changes to a flawed piece of legislation should not be reason to penalize veterans who have basically suffered in silence until now.” He also expressed skepticism about the changes being any more than a tweaking of existing benefits, rather than reevaluation of the charter and its effects.
Stogran is also concerned about the existence, unbeknownst to the public, of different classes of veterans. The VAC divides veterans into two separate groups: Traditional and Canadian Forces (CF). Traditional veterans are those who fought in the second World War and the Korean War, while CF veterans are those that have fought in every war since. Stogran pointed out on his blog that certain services and facilities are only accessible to Traditional veterans, while the “eligibility criteria are so restrictive for CF veterans that it makes the numbers of those who receive [long term care] almost negligible.”
This is precisely the case of Ste. Anne’s Hospital. Because access to the hospital is restricted to Traditional veterans, there will soon no longer be a need for it to be a “veterans” hospital, given the scarcity of surviving Traditional veterans. Meanwhile, there is a fear that injured soldiers returning from Afghanistan and future missions will have to compete for beds with the civilian population, and be treated in facilities where the specificities of military injuries are poorly understood.
Given that Quebec has been struggling to provide effective health services to its general population, there are persistent fears in veteran communities about the transfer of the hospital from federal to provincial jurisdiction.
Corporal Matt Ramsey of Montreal’s Black Watch Regiment – recently returned from his first tour in Kandahar, Afghanistan – said that “the concern…is that the provincial government isn’t going to care as much.”
Ramsey also added, however, that “none of this particularly matters because anybody who is a veteran of any war other than World War II [and the Korean war] isn’t eligible anyways.”

Principal fields questions from student journalists
Principal Heather Munroe-Blum sat down with journalists from The Daily, the McGill Tribune, and Le Délit yesterday to discuss tuition, student aid, and private sector research at McGill, among other issues.
Asked if she would continue her long-standing support of the Ministry of Education’s stated objective of raising tuition in 2012, even if the provincial government declined to increase its financing of Quebec’s universities, Munroe-Blum did not give a definitive answer.
“No, our position is that they’ve got to invest in student aid and they’ve got to invest in the operating grant…it’s a package,” she said.
The principal also said that the administration “would be happy to report on, annually, whether or not the integrated policy of raising fees…along with a commitment to growing student aid, actually is reaching the goal.”
She went on to reiterate that Quebec universities face an $800-million funding gap compared to other Canadian provinces. She added that “the government needs to play its role at an effective level,” to combat under-financing.
The principal also stuck to her position that Quebec tuition should rise to the national average, which stands at $5,138 for undergraduates and $5,182 for graduates. This would amount to more than a 100 per cent increase – $2,723 – from the current rate for Quebec-resident undergraduates, and a similar leap for graduates.
Munroe-Blum’s most prominent recent exposition of her tuition plans came in early September at the National Assembly’s Committee on Culture and Education in Quebec City.
At the principal’s Town Hall on Tuesday, Adrian Kaats, PhD II Engineering student and a Daily columnist, asked Munroe-Blum if she told the McGill Board of Governors (BoG) this summer that she would “go to the standing committee on culture and education and tell our government that McGill thinks tuition should rise.”
Munroe-Blum’s complete response to Kaats was: “It was presented as ‘For Information’ to the Board [of Governors], and I heard no dissent to it.”
“I didn’t say that,” she said in the interview the next morning, when asked about the exchange. Kaats’ question, she maintained, was simply “on the principle of tuition.”
She went on to say, “I don’t actually remember who said what at the [BoG] meeting.”
When told that, at the Town Hall, she said the BoG had no objection to her planned presentation to the National Assembly, Munroe-Blum replied, “I think I qualified it,” adding, “I don’t like doing ‘he-said she-said.’”
She went on to say that the BoG did not vote on the plans she would present the committee.
At the Town Hall, Munroe-Blum said that she has not asked any of McGill’s student societies to “sign on,” to the administration’s tuition plans.
“Students have never been in support of increases in tuition,” she said at the interview. “I wasn’t when I was a student.”
Asked why students continued to feel this way, Munroe-Blum answered, “You think of your own experience, right? You don’t look at the trends across the population of the university or the population of the province.”
When asked by Le Délit if she would consider modulating tuition based on the projected future incomes of graduates, she said in French, “I don’t think it’s black and white.”
Munroe-Blum added, however, “there’s a question whether you might charge an Engineering student more,” than an Arts student based on the cost of the respective programs.
Early in the meeting, the principal said that low tuition alone does not increase accessibility to university. “My view is – and I think the data supports it, in fact – when you have…low tuition fees, and a declining investment per student on the part of government, accessibility is always hurt. It’s not facilitated.”
“Those who are in financial need don’t need low tuition,” she continued. “They need a grant of some kind…or a combination of grant and loan, to pay for all of the things you need when you’re going to university.”
Munroe-Blum went on to emphasize McGill’s intention of increasing student aid while raising tuition. McGill’s 2010-2011 budget projects a $2.9-million increase in student aid over last year, the product of a policy that earmarks thirty per cent of net new tuition revenue for financial aid. Seventy-five per cent of total student aid will go to graduates this year, with 25 per cent going to undergraduates.
Munroe-Blum conceded that there are still students who cannot afford to go to McGill.
“We know there’s still a big gap between our ability to be confident that every student who’s qualified to come to McGill can come independent of their financial need,” she said.
She added that McGill has been able to provide more student aid in programs that have seen tuition deregulated. The most recent such example is the MBA, which saw its in-province tuition skyrocket over the summer from under $2,000 to $32,500.
In April, the provincial government threatened to slash McGill’s general funding by up to $30,000 for each of the roughly 150 in-province students being made to pay the dramatically increased tuition. Responding to a question from the Tribune about the status of these threats, Munroe-Blum said, “We’re in discussions on that.”
The principal returned several times during the meeting to her distaste for parts of the Quebec government’s university policy.
She noted that the provincial government stopped tracking the income status of university students, suggesting that Quebec did so deliberately to cover the failure of their university policy.
“There’s only one reason to stop measuring,” she said. “When the policy doesn’t fit the outcome, you stop measuring.”
Munroe-Blum also objected to Bill 38, the province’s attempt in 2009 to mandate how universities compose their governing boards. She added that the government also meddles too much in what kind of research McGill does.
“Governments would have us do applied research, often, and not do the discovery, blue-sky thinking, scholarship and research that we believe is the fundamental role of the university,” she said. “As a publicly-funded university, the government wants to tell us what to do.”
She was more amenable to working with corporations. “There is room for us to have a much more productive relationship with the private sector,” she said.
“Corporations tend to understand our mission. … They often fund basic research, for example.”
 Speaking in French to Le Délit, she added, “I’m not afraid of businesses, of corporations…I don’t think there’s a corporatization of universities, not at all.”
She also noted that the administration is not alone in wanting industry to play a bigger role in research, saying, “There’s actually a very strong interest on the part of both the federal and the provincial government to increase the engagement of industry with [research and development].”
Asked if the influx of corporations sponsoring research might present cases of companies with poor records of corporate social responsibility working at McGill, Munroe-Blum said, “These are real fundamental questions.”
“Certainly we work very hard both on the philanthropic side and on the research side to not have partners that are lacking in public integrity as judged by the law.”
The principal ruled out a student-based body tasked with reviewing the corporations sponsoring research at McGill, however.

Quebec nationalists opposed to the idea
With the tenth anniversary of the death of world-renowned author and journalist Mordecai Richler months away, city councillors Michael Applebaum and Marvin Rotund have released an online petition to publicly commemorate the Montreal writer.
Richler was famous for his Governor General’s  and Commonwealth Award winning novels, his columns for the National Post and the Gazette, and his children’s books. His novels Joshua, Then and Now and The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz have been made into films, with a film based one of his other bestsellers, Barney’s Version, being released in December.
The petition has received over 600 online signatures since it was released last week, and asks the public for suggestions on how to commemorate the writer.
“Right now we’re at the point where we want to get the public on board in terms of suggestions… we’re interested in what the public has to say and there’s a short comment section on the petition where individuals can put forth ideas for what should be renamed. … So far we’ve received a wide variety of ideas, including nearby parks, streets, and libraries,” said Rotund.
The councillor said that another one of the suggestions was placing a plaque outside the house on St. Urbain that Richler grew up in, which today remains unmarked.
“Richer’s writing signifies Montreal and the experience of its citizens, especially the immigrant experience,” said Rotund. “Thousands of Montrealers can identify with Richler’s themes.”
Despite Richler’s popularity, the petition has a few challenges ahead. Some of Richler’s writings critical of Quebec sovereignty offended Quebec nationalists. Mario Beaulieu, president of the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste, has described Richler as an “anti-Quebec racist” because of the author’s criticisms of Quebec nationalism.
In response to the allegations, Rotund said, “The majority of Montrealers would still support the honouring of one of the most famous Canadian writers.”
Although there are no formal restrictions applied to Richler’s writings, his novels are rarely taught at McGill. In an interview with The Daily, English Professor Brian Trehearne said, “Richler’s works have been dropping out of McGill course syllabi. … One possible problem is the wealth of [Canadian] authors from the 1950s.”
When asked about the influence that the release of the film Barney’s Version and the possible street renaming would have, Trehearne said that “popular approval of certain authors doesn’t necessarily lead to their work being taught in an academic setting.”
Trehearne added that “another part of people’s unawareness of Richler is that Canadian authors don’t receive the recognition they deserve. … One goes to London or Boston and one is much more aware of the literary figures who used to be there”.
The petition remains open for everyone to submit their signatures and ideas. When The Daily went to print, the petition had collected 647 signatures.

Alliance sociale hopes to fight tuition hikes and cuts to social programs
Critical of the rising trend of political conservatism in Quebec – exemplified by the Liberal government’s budget cuts and the emergence of right-wing political movements – a new coalition of labour and student unions has formed to speak in favour of strong public services and against tuition hikes.
In an open letter published in Le Devoir on Friday, the newly formed Alliance sociale (Social Alliance) promoted a return to Quebec’s legacy of strong public services and left-of-centre politics. The Alliance will include the Fédération étudiante universitaire de Québec (FEUQ) and the equivalent federation for CEGEP students: the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ).
The movement originated as a response to dissatisfaction with the provincial government’s last budget in March. The new budget cuts spending in a variety of social programs.
“The Quebec government’s budget was very poorly received among our ranks,” Claudette Carbonneau, president of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), told The Daily in French. “It was seen as a breach in the social pact between citizens and the Quebec government. It was a violation of values of solidarity, of the capacity to intervene not only in public services, but also in the environment, in economic development, and in support for employment. [Each member of the alliance] reacted strongly from its own side … So we came to the idea to try to join our efforts to put forward another dialogue,” she said.
Among other issues, the Alliance is opposed to the government’s proposal to increase university tuition rates.
“This will put into question the accessibility of the majority of the population to higher studies, and it will impose a burden that is too heavy on students from lower and middle income families,” said Carbonneau. “It will contribute to a rate of debt that is overwhelming … In Quebec, we are already below the Canadian average in terms of higher education rates. We think that we should not accelerate this.”
The Alliance was also formed to act as a counterweight to the rise of right-wing political movements. Réseau Liberté-Québec – which echoes the U.S. Tea Party’s right-wing libertarianism – and the conservative movement headed by former PQ ministers Francois Legault and Joseph Facal have recently sprung up to shift the political dialogue in Quebec to the right.
“These are movements tha go a bit in the same direction as Quebec’s last budget,” FEUQ president Louis-Philippe Savoie told The Daily in French. “They put forward propositions that are regressive and that go against what made Quebec strong in the last forty years.”
“It was evident to us that we could not leave the public dialogue open so that people would only hear one point of view, only one way of seeing the future of Quebec society,” said Carbonneau.
The provincial budget reduced spending on social services in order to help remedy Quebec’s budget deficit. The Alliance believes that cuts to education spending will not solve this problem, and may potentially exacerbate it.
The Alliance is planning to organize several events to promote their message in the following months. In December, it will hold a meeting to bring together different actors from the educational sector, though plans are still being hammered out.
“It’s certain that at that moment there will be a student mobilization to bring forward the message that tuition hikes are not a viable solution for solving the problems of students,” said Savoie.
