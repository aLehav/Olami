Multimedia project points out flaws in refugee system
September 1 saw the launch of a multimedia project titled Never Home: Legislating Discrimination in Canadian Immigration, which features a 10,000-word report as well as video interviews documenting nine years of legislative changes to immigration policy and their effects on Canadian citizens and immigrants. The project was created by No One Is Illegal-Vancouver Unceded Coast Salish Territories, a grassroot organization.
The project focuses on recent actions of the Conservative government and various issues surrounding immigration, including the exploitation of temporary foreign workers, family reunification, and deportation.
The report includes many key findings. For instance, it found that between 2006 and 2014, 87,317 migrants were jailed without charge. It also found that there have been 111 new immigration policies since 2002; the majority of the policies are ministerial instructions from the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and thus require no parliamentary approval.
“We only value [immigrants] if we can exploit them.”
“This is not a new thing. It’s not going to go away any time soon, not unless we act. It’s about actually challenging the legislation that creates this difficulty in people getting over here. It’s talking to our families, our friends, and our co-workers about the refugee plight and really creating awareness about what’s happening globally,” said Sozan Savehilaghi, a member of No One Is Illegal-Vancouver, in an interview with The Daily.
“We only value [immigrants] if we can exploit them,” added Savehilaghi.
Savehilaghi further stated that the series of legislations created in the past nine years have resulted in less permanent residents with fewer secure statuses, juxtaposed with an incredible increase in temporary migrant workers who can have their status taken away at a moment’s notice.
“These are workers who have been legislated to be paid less,” said Savehilaghi, pointing out that a foreign worker’s immigration status is wholly dependent on their employer, often leading to the worker’s exploitation. Workers are also forced to work more without overtime benefits.
“The government is really bulking up on the temporary foreign workers.”
“The government is really bulking up on the temporary foreign workers.”
Omar Chu, one of the co-authors of the report, cited spousal sponsorship as another form of exploitation. “With spousal sponsorship, [the migrant’s] sponsorship is contingent on them staying with their spouse, which puts many women at risk [of] having to stay in abusive relationships because of fear of [deportation].”
Apart from key fact findings, the project also includes graphic images, and several videos with titles such as “We are the silent slaves,” “I am not a terrorist,” “The whole process was hell,” and “The Canadian government killed my parents.”
The multimedia report also sheds light on Canada’s treatment of refugees.
Since photos of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned while trying to reach Europe, were released on the internet on September 2, Canada’s immigration system has come under scrutiny. The criticism of the system’s slow and inadequate refugee process was intensified when it was revealed that Kurdi’s family had previously applied for asylum in Canada.
Various Canadian parties including the Liberals, Conservatives, and the New Democratic Party (NDP) have made pledges promising more refugees entry into Canada in the face of the upcoming elections.
“[Politicians] only think about numbers and commit to [bringing]over a certain number of Syrian refugees. But that ignores refugees that are coming from all over the world. And the policy changes that have been made over the past nine years […] need to be reversed. [They] are causing huge harm to people out in the world,” said Chu.
“When these legislations were passed, none of the political parties actually stood against any of them.”
“[Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s] only response to the refugee crisis was to continue to bomb Syria, which is absolutely ridiculous. Because it’s actually these kinds of policies, where we are engaged in military operations abroad, that are destroying infrastructure, destroying [homes], and creating a culture of fear and subjugation in the areas where people are living,” stated Savehilaghi. “When these legislations were passed, none of the political parties actually stood against any of them,” noted Savehilaghi.
According to the report, the Conservative government set $15 million towards stripping refugee status off of 875 applications annually.
“It’s quite unfortunate that it had to take the death of children and [a] fatality that is quite high profile for us to become aware. But here we are. We are aware now,” Savehilaghi said.

VP Finance announces additional deficit, interim Arts Rep appointed
On September 9, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Legislative Council held its first meeting of the new academic year. After executive members, representatives, and senators updated the councillors on their work over the summer, Council discussed four motions, all of which were adopted.
In his report to the Council, VP Finance Mirza Ali Shakir mentioned that over the past year, AUS has suffered from accounting difficulties, including misclassified transactions, that have led to an inaccurate reflection of AUS’s financial position.
According to Shakir, there were many incorrect entries, one of which was “a double entry of [more than] $106,000.” In addition, the fact that there was no VP Finance in summer 2014 to oversee Frosh finances was another factor that contributed to the deficit.
“We started planning Frosh 2015 with the assumption that Frosh 2014 made a $10,000 loss. However, midway through June we discovered that the deficit was actually [$30,250], so we had to adjust the Frosh budget by getting rid of many expenses,” Shakir said in an email to The Daily. “Because AUS is a student organization, it is even more important to demonstrate financial transparency.”
President Jacob Greenspon presented a motion regarding the adoption of a traditional territory acknowledgement, according to which AUS would acknowledge that McGill University is situated on unceded Kanien’kehá:ka traditional territory.
This was the second time such a motion was introduced to Council. According to Arts Senator Erin Sobat, this is because motions passed at AUS “only apply for the mandate of that [particular] Council year, unless something is written into bylaws.”
The motion was first introduced last year as part of a “university-wide push” and a step toward “decolonization,” Greenspon told Council. “It really is a part of a push to get McGill to acknowledge more of the land it occupies.”
In an interview with The Daily, Sobat pointed out the importance of students acknowledging Indigenous territory. “I think it is a starting point for us to develop more initiatives and programs around Indigeneity and decolonization in consultation with Indigenous stakeholders.”
Sobat hopes student associations taking the lead will help improve the relationship between post-secondary institutions and Indigenous communities. “Part of the motivation […] was in looking for McGill to adopt its own territory acknowledgement. It helps if we can point to student associations that are leading the way.”
SSMU also passed a similar motion last year.
The motion passed with a unanimous vote. The traditional territory acknowledgement is to be stated at all AUS Legislative Council meetings and featured on a prominent position on the AUS website.
A motion to hold a by-election for an Arts Representative to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) was passed in order to find a replacement for Samiha Sharif, who resigned from the position on September 3. Greenspon proposed a motion for a by-election for the new school year as it is a “more democratic” way to get “a wider pool of people to be involved” than electing from only the members of Council.
While Council voted to hold by-elections toward early October, it also appointed Kat Svikhnushin, who was the Director of Inclusivity and Equity for Arts Frosh and is the VP External of McGill’s Religious Studies Undergraduate Society, as interim representative to attend SSMU Council meetings.

Community groups prioritize early consent education
In the upcoming year, sex education classes will be reintroduced in Quebec schools after being removed from the province’s curriculum in 2005. The sex education pilot project is to be mandatory for all students from kindergarten through high school, regardless of the student’s or their parents’ religious and personal convictions.
The sex education program will be introduced in around 15 schools in the province and will last two years. While the pilot program will affect only 8,200 students, it could be adopted on a provincial level by 2017. Sex education will be taught for at least five hours a year at the primary level and 15 hours each year of secondary school. According to the Canadian Press, the province invested some $860,000 into the management of the project.
According to Victoria Pilger, Funding and Partnerships Coordinator at Head & Hands (a Montreal non-profit organization that provides medical, social, and legal services to the city’s youth) one of the potential benefits of the program is informing Quebec youth about the importance of healthy sex. Furthermore, the concept of health extends beyond contraception and sexually transmitted infections, and encompasses body image, communication, boundaries, and consent as well.
According to Gabrielle Bouchard, Peer Support and Trans Advocacy Coordinator of Concordia’s Centre for Gender Advocacy, “If you want to talk about any area of sexuality, you have to start with consent.”
“When you talk about these basic concepts of consent in a meaningful way. […] that will already be a very useful tool for anybody thinking about sex and sexual relationships,” Bouchard continued.
Introducing an educational program about consent to students from a young age could greatly impact community groups like Head & Hands and the Centre for Gender Advocacy.
“If the government of Quebec started doing [consent education], maybe we wouldn’t have to fight so much here at university to get consent workshops or [have] to deal with so much sexual violence and non-consensual situations at the university level,” added Bouchard.
“There’s no opting out of consent. Consent is mandatory, so knowing about consent should be mandatory also.”
Some of the concerns about the new sex education program regard the fact that there are no exemptions. Some – like Lorraine Normand-Charbonneau, the president of the Quebec School Principals Federation, who spoke to the CBC – have already voiced their opposition to the program, citing cultural reasons and arguing that some parents “don’t want their teen to learn about masturbation.”
“While recognizing that norms about sex and sexuality vary across cultures and communities, what remains the same is that every youth deserves access to unbiased and truthful information to help them be informed and empowered to make decisions about their bodies,” Pilger said.
Magaly Pirotte, Fédération du Québec pour le planning des naissances (FQPN) Project Coordinator, explained that sex education today tends to take a negative tone in talking about sex.
“A lot of the sex ed that we see happening talks about the risks of sexual activity and the possible negative outcomes of having sex when you’re young,” Pirotte told The Daily.
“This is a pretty disempowering way to talk about sex with teenagers. A lot of the time, notions of desire and sex positivity and consent are not part of classes, so we are not answering the needs and questions of the people.”
“Every youth deserves access to unbiased and truthful information to help them be informed and empowered to make decisions about their bodies.”
Pirotte also explained how critical it is that the pilot project not overlook the other issues related to sexuality. For example, homosexuality is often taught separately, as though it is not a part of ‘normal’ sex life, thus reinforcing heteronormativity. “For now, we’re just wondering and hoping that it’s going to be there.”
Another concern has to do with the effectiveness of the program, which could be less than ideal if the government does not consult and partner with people and groups who are involved with sex education on a community level.
“Are these groups […] with their expertise and experience just going to be put on the side?” asked Pirotte.
“Putting back a program is good, but if you don’t give the means to teach it in a meaningful way – […] the teachers haven’t been trained to give this class,” she said.
Pilger noted that the delivery of the pilot project is a main area of concern for Head & Hands as well.
“It’s really important [that] those educators have an actual grasp of youth sexuality and youth needs, and are trained so that they won’t be shaming youth for what they’re doing because of the generational gap,” Pilger said. “[Head & Hands] thinks it’s really important that the government consults community groups to learn from us what we’ve learned from youth. […] We have access to a lot of honest information you might not otherwise have access to.”

Activist organizations to push for collective action
On September 7, around 200 people gathered in Parc des Faubourgs to protest the austerity measures of the Quebec government. Groups of Service de Police de la ville de Montréal (SPVM) officers, some wearing riot gear, were also present, with more around the area in squad cars and vans.
The march launched from Parc des Faubourgs, with the demonstrators carrying picket signs with the words “PLQ dégage” (Parti libéral du Québec, get out!) and “Respect existence or expect resistance.”
The group then marched down Ontario until St. Hubert, continuing on to the entrance of the Berri-UQAM metro station. The group largely dispersed after police barricaded the doors to the metro and occupied one of the platforms.
A smaller group of just over 100 people reconvened at a small park near the Frontenac metro station, at around 7:15 p.m.. They marched until Dézéry, then dispersed as SPVM officers arrived with over 15 vans, cars, and buses.
“Austerity is basically a proven ineffective measure, and I think it is frankly silly that is is in place.”
However, the anti-austerity activities in the park had started earlier that day. From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) met to celebrate Labour Day with workers and public service employees, including nurses, social service workers, and postal service workers.
Some demonstrators were there because they are facing increasing economic insecurity. Others, like McGill student Connor Spencer and Concordia student Ben Goodman, were there in solidarity with public service employees.
In an interview with The Daily, Spencer said that things could change “if McGill starts paying attention and caring a little bit, if the student union at McGill starts actively involving the McGill population in what’s going on in the city that houses it.”
Students are also directly affected by the provincial austerity measures. According to Goodman, austerity measures greatly affect students: “Especially as we start school, [with] the budget cuts that are going to be taking place […] it’s frankly unfair.”
The collective agreements of many public sector workers in Quebec expired on March 31, and a few have already started their renegotiations. The provincial government has expressed its conviction to reach a zero-deficit budget by 2015-16, which goes against the public sector unions’ demand of a 4.5 per cent salary hike per year over the next three years.
Speaking to The Daily, IWW member and acting s Nicholas Harvest said, “The reforming of unemployment insurance at the federal level hits employees drastically.” He continued, “There’s huge compressions in the public sector, these teachers are living [in] horrible, horrible working conditions, and they will also find themselves out of a job. […] That, coupled with what’s happened to the [postal workers], it’s a general push towards privatization, we can see that very well.”
Goodman noted, “Austerity is basically a proven ineffective measure, and I think it is frankly silly that is is in place.”
Harvest said, “We think that the real political power comes from the workers, comes from collective organization and direct action.” He added that despite the fact that IWW has no direct stakes in the federal election, it “still aims for an ‘automne chaud’ at the provincial level.
Labour Day, as a first step toward this goal, saw IWW joined by groups including the Revolutionary Student Movement, the Front d’action socialiste, and Concordia’s Whalebone Collective.
Harvest explained, “I feel like the police basically saw our capabilities organizing May 1, and saw our capabilities of bringing people together and bringing a sense of community to those that don’t have privilege, and I think they’re afraid of that and I think the state is afraid of that. […] When the state sees workers organizing, it tends to get scared.”

Solidarity Across Borders calls out Mayor Coderre
Solidarity Across Borders (SAB), a migrant justice network based in Montreal, held a rally in front of City Hall on September 4 to demand Mayor Denis Coderre to take a public position concerning the actions of the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM), namely entering schools to detain undocumented students. The demonstrators were escorted to the basement and told to leave by security. That same day, Coderre met with Green Party MP Elizabeth May and told her that Montreal is ready to welcome Syrian refugees.
The rally was part of SAB’s “Bring Daniel Home” campaign, which was launched in March after the deportation of Daniel*, an undocumented minor, unaccompanied, to Mexico from a Montreal high school in October 2014.
As per SAB, Daniel and his family left Mexico in 2008 due to great insecurity in Mexico City. Daniel, who is partially deaf, and his mother made the decision to come to Canada believing that life with a disability was significantly more difficult in Mexico.
“We were basically treated like people who are not community members, who the mayor was responsible to, but as nuisances – people that don’t have any voice.”
The family applied for refugee status and was refused in 2010, but decided to stay in Canada as undocumented immigrants. In January 2014, after six years of living and attending public schools in Montreal, Daniel was told by his high school administration that if his mother did not pay registration fees, they would call Immigration Canada. SAB explained that to be able to continue his education without fear of deportation, Daniel changed high schools.
According to SAB, most undocumented families are annually billed $6,000 for each child attending public school in Quebec, although this is applied intermittently.
On October 8, 2014, Daniel’s 17th birthday, he went to his old high school to visit his friends. Immediately, he was targeted by security and the SPVM was called.
Daniel was arrested by SPVM officers before being taken to the Canadia Border Services Agency (CBSA), which subsequently detained him in solitary confinement for one week in the Laval Immigration Detention Centre.
Despite filing a permanent residence application on humanitarian grounds, Daniel was deported without his family back to Mexico on October 16, 2014.
Mary Foster, a member of the “Bring Daniel Home” campaign committee, explained in an interview with The Daily her frustrations with the mayor’s “disheartening” response to the rally.
“[The mayor’s team] didn’t show any interest. They didn’t seem to respect the point of view that the members of the Montreal community have. […] We were basically treated like people who are not community members, who the mayor was responsible to, but as nuisances – people that don’t have any voice.”
“People are not undocumented in Canada for no reason. They come to Canada as refugees, as people seeking a better life,” Foster said.
In an interview with The Daily, Noé Arteaga, another member of SAB and a former temporary migrant worker, explained that a common myth in discussions of international migration is that Canada’s laws make the process of immigration, seeking asylum, and integrating refugees into mainstream society simple.
However, according to CBSA statistics from 2013, Canadian immigration officials accepted only 5,790 people that year while deporting over 10,000 people, most of whom were refused as refugees. Others who take the risk to ignore deportation orders are estimated to number up to hundreds of thousands.
“The first and most difficult challenge to overcome is the linguistic one; a migrant worker will have a hard time understanding how locals speak and making themselves understood. Moreover, the obligatory processes are difficult and bureaucratic, which the language problem makes harder,” Arteaga told The Daily in Spanish.
“Many of the people seeking refugee status either don’t know about, or don’t have the proper documents needed to legally obtain immigrant or refugee status,” said Arteaga, adding, “These are things that maybe the refugees did have at one time, but were not prepared to bring with them to Canada to present to immigration officials.”
According to a SAB press release, the number of refugee claims in Canada decreased by 50 per cent and the number of accepted refugees dropped by 30 per cent between 2006 and 2012.
“The first and most difficult challenge to overcome is the linguistic one; a migrant worker will have a hard time understanding how locals speak and making themselves understood.”
Foster noted, “[Refugees] end up non-status in Canada, because [the CBSA is] systematically excluding people from Canada. [Coderre’s statement regarding Syrian refugees] shows either a huge lack of understanding of the issue or a lack of will to understand the issue. It’s surprising to me that [Coderre] would not know that there are already many refugees right here in Montreal who are undocumented.”
Foster explained that the best way for Coderre to truly make Montreal “ready to accept refugees” is to make life less difficult for undocumented refugees already living in the city, especially minors.
“There [are] things he could do immediately, like ordering the SPVM never to go into high schools. […] It’s within his power to do that,” Foster said. “That’s making it safe for refugees here. That’s welcoming refugees here.”
Through the “Bring Daniel Home” campaign, SAB is demanding the federal and provincial governments to prohibit the SPVM from entering schools with the express purpose of detaining undocumented immigrants, and the extension of amnesty on humanitarian grounds for minors and/or people with disabilities who do not have papers.
SAB will be staging a large-scale public demonstration on October 10, at Norman Bethune Square to march against deportations, and to call attention to the local, provincial, and federal government’s lack of response to this situation.
