The right of students to submit graded assessments in French will be more widely publicized, thanks to two amended motions passed at yesterday’s Senate meeting.
The first motion clarified the sort of assignments students are allowed to submit in French, and the second required all course outlines to reiterate that students have this right.
Jane Everett, Dean of Students, introduced the motions on behalf of the Senate Committee on Student Affairs (CSA).
“The right has been around since the eighties, but there is some question as to whether or not it exists in practice,” Everett explained.
She stressed how important it is to remind students who are more comfortable using French than English that they will not be at an academic disadvantage at McGill.
“The motion will establish a level playing ground for any student who is more familiar in French than in English. We are trying to accommodate that.”
Adding the article to course outlines was a contentious move – several professors felt that the syllabus is not the proper medium through which to communicate students’ rights – and only passed narrowly after three recounts.
With the second motion, CSA hoped to clarify the rule on submitting assignments in French and proposed changing the description of work that can be submitted from “essays, examinations, and theses” to “written work that is to be graded.” As before, this allowance does not apply to language proficiency courses.
The motion passed overwhelmingly.
The two proposals were originally introduced to Senate in last May, but procedural errors made their approval void, postponing their reevaluation.

With applause, standing ovations, a few salutes, and even tears, McGill students packed into a crowded Gert’s bar yesterday morning to watch as Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States.
Standing shoulder to shoulder, inches from the television screen, the crowd became silent as the moment drew near. In Washington, there was prayer, performance, and anxiety as President Barack Obama stumbled through the oath.
Visibly moved, Eby Heller from Chicago was overwhelmed and happy.
“It means there is a little bit of hope. He knows he has a long, hard road ahead of him. I hope that he respects himself as a human being, his family, and from there he will do good work.”
The feeling of hope in the room was so infectious that Eva-Queen Ngayap from Toronto couldn’t help but join Aretha Franklin in a chorus of “Freedom Ring.”
“I am expecting a breath of fresh air, a different stance, a new perspective and attitude,” Ngayap said.
“This is history and we all know it. Everyone is cherishing this moment.”
The Gert’s crowd fell silent as attention turned toward President Obama’s inauguration speech. Obama’s rather solemn words muted the celebration, as he spoke frankly to both Americans and the world about the challenges ahead.
Samantha Perera from Florida commented, “I feel like we are in really dark times, not only as a nation but as a world. Listening to Obama talk gives me hope that we will prevail, and that America will mean something in the end.”
There was, however, some skepticism.
“As a European, we’ve detested Bush from the start. And as much as we’d like to believe Obama will bring change, we are a little bit weary. We will give it a few months before we believe in Obama like Americans do,” one student who asked to remain anonymous said.
If they weren’t already believers, though, many in the Gert’s crowd walked away wanting to hope that the coming presidency will be as significant as it is symbolic.

Eugenics sparks debate on abortion rights
Pro-life speaker Mary Meehan was met with general applause and a significant number of boos at her talk on liberal and feminist support for the pro-life cause during an event at McGill on Monday.
The question and answer period, which lasted over an hour, saw many heated and a few virulent arguments.
The talk, organized by Choose Life and entitled “Why Liberals and Feminists Should Defend the Unborn,” drew almost 100 individuals of varying opinions on the issue of abortion. The left side of Leacock 232 attracted the pro-choice supporters, while the pro-life supporters and event organizers opted to sit on the far right.
Meehan criticized the left side’s current position of “worship[ping] at the shrine of choice.”
“Some choices really should not even be considered, because they do involve harming or taking the lives of other people,” she said. “Liberals indeed are anti-choice on many issues… the death penalty, most wars, torture, rape, racial discrimination, and many more. They should add abortion to the list.”
Speaking at length, Meehan suggested the existence of a “eugenics influence” in the pro-choice movement. She alleged that abortion is a new tool used for population control in the United States and around the world.
Meehan also cast abortion as a civil rights issue.
“Early in the 20th century, the eugenicists in the U.S. used compulsory sterilization of poor whites and poor African-Americans to keep their numbers down,” Meehan said. “But eugenicists did not have to use coercion after our Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade…. One of the ways they do it is by supporting public funding of abortion.”
Elise Eisenkraft Klein, U2 Jewish Studies, objected to what she believed was Meehan’s conflation of eugenics and the pro-choice movement.
“Choosing to have an abortion is not the same as forced sterilization,” she said.
Charles Pitman, U2 Economics and Philosophy, argued that support from eugenicists does not invalidate the legitimacy of the pro-choice position.
“All sides of the [abortion] issue have allies that they aren’t proud of. It’s not like the pro-life side has only friends that are reputable,” he said.
Meehan argued that abortions performed after neonatal testing for disabilities were wrong and that access to abortions increases paternal irresponsibility.
“Guys have to talk to guys about walking out [on women]. We need to reinstate the old stigma against guys walking out on their children.”
During the question period, Salma Moolji, U1 International Development Studies, told her story of becoming pro-choice while running a school for abused girls in Nicaragua.
“The day that I decided to be ‘pro-choice’ was the day that I saw the child [of a] child die of starvation…. If I put myself one generation back, I would be in India, where my grandfather was sold into child slave labour…. I might have been that girl.”
A few students in attendance were particularly incensed by Meehan’s sentiments. One such student, Elsa Beaulieu, a PhD candidate in Anthropology, called Meehan “arrogant” and “insidious.” At the end of a detailed and emotional criticism of Meehan’s points, she pleaded, “What about addressing the reality of women’s lives? What about the consequences of illegal abortions on women’s lives? What about it?”
But derogatory comments from the audience toward Meehan convinced Raphael Dumas, U1 Civil Engineering, to reconsider his position.
“Those few rude students actually pushed me in the direction of [the pro-life stance],” Dumas said.
Meehan insisted that her position is not hostile to women who have had abortions.
“I want to say to [those women who have had abortions] that I’m not out to make you feel badly or send you on a guilt trip, but I appeal to you to take another look at this issue, because there are more lives at stake every day. I hope that you will help save some of them.”
Choose Life, granted interim club status by SSMU in October 2008, will be applying for full club status at the end of this month. According to Choose Life’s Community Outreach coordinator Kathryn Sawyer, the group tries to offer resources to “women who want an alternative to abortion” on campus.

NAIROBI, Kenya—Nairobi’s storefronts were covered in posters with Obama’s face as the city geared up for his inauguration on Tuesday.
A Nairobi University professor explained that students “unilaterally took a day off school,” opting instead to watch Obama’s inauguration on a stage set up by Citizen TV, a local station. Bands were set to play for a party afterward.
Students buzzed around with smiles on their faces, and a few sported Obama t-shirts.
“I’ve never seen this many people at the University. It’s so busy!” said one student.
Nairobians appeared visibly proud that Obama – whose father is Kenyan – was taking his oath as the President of the U.S. For many, this election represents a new hope, a change mentality within the world’s most powerful nation and globally. Expectations have never been higher for one man.
Fred, a third-year student in Geography who hopes to one day be involved in politics, was inspired by Tuesday’s events.
“I’m proud to be a Kenyan. I’m happy to be an African. But now I’m proud to be a citizen of humanity. I know he will not help me personally in any way, but I’m proud of [Obama],” he said.

WASHINGTON—As a record-breaking sea of people assembled on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Tuesday to witness the inauguration of Barack Obama, America’s 44th president, a deep serenity washed over the crowd.
From all over the world, a pilgrimage of supporters calmly waited in anticipation to witness the historic ascent of the first black U.S. President, though their tranquility was perforated with intense displays of pride, relief, and jubilation.
The masses, stretching back from the Capitol Building where the swearing-in occurred, cheered appropriately with the entrance of Congressmen, Senators, and other dignitaries – which many viewers watched from the two dozen jumbotron screens erected on the Mall.
A brief display of negativity occurred with the entrance of outgoing-President George W. Bush. Some booed, though most remained respectively silent.
Spectators held their breath for Obama’s address to the nation, which soberly and sincerely called on the American people to commit to a new age of action and responsibility.
“Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America,” the new president proclaimed. “For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.”
With the official announcement of Obama’s inauguration, the crowd once again erupted into cheers, and furiously waved their freely-distributed American flags.
A Bermudan man, who had traveled to Washington to witness this event, captured the spirit of the crowd well.
“Today is a new day,” he said. “Now there is hope for change.”
A commercialization of the historic event was found on the sidewalks: inauguration paraphernalia t-shirts, oversized buttons, caps, and posters, all to commemorate the symbolic day of change.
The cheering quickly died down, though, as many began to automatically drift away.
With many recognizing the President as a sign of change, and endowed with their full confidence, the populous sensed their work was done: America had elected Obama. They could go home.
Suddenly Washington was faced with two-million lost people, who either could not access transit, or were impeded by barricades set up by over 8,000 security personnel on the northern side of Mall. The smiling crowds – both cold and tired–  moved slowly, with little yelling, chanting, or pushing. No arrests were made at the inauguration.
Tuesday’s event was the final of three days of the inauguration program. On Sunday, burgeoning crowds inched toward the Lincoln Memorial for a patriotic concert featuring performances from international artists, actors, and actresses.

International apathy leaves Hamas alone to protect Palestinians: anthropologist
Julius Grey, civil rights lawyer and human rights activist and Israeli-American political activist and anthropologist Jeff Halper spoke about the barriers to peace in the Middle East at McGill last Wednesday. The event was hosted by Young Jews for Social Justice (YJSJ) and Independent Jewish Voices (IJV).
Applause and cheers rang as Halper stood to speak.
Halper blamed Israeli tribal nationalism and a belief in exclusive ownership of land as the reasons why peace remains so elusive, likening “this is our land, but you can live here too” attitude to nationalist periods seen in Germany, Poland, Russia.
“Think of ‘The Motherland, The Homeland!’ People say Israel is a Western democracy, but it isn’t,” Halper said. “Zionism comes out of Eastern Europe, not Western Europe.”
Halper also claimed that this “doctrine of the permanent enemy” guides Israelis to assume that Arabs want to kill them, and thus that there is no political solution.
“Israel is a military state. It is run by generals and Israel has set up a set of parameters that make peace impossible,” Halper said.
Halper then used his “doctrine” to argue Hamas is the only group capable of protecting Palestinians from Israel, concluding that as a result armed resistance is legitimate according to international law.
Halper stopped once during his presentation and allowed a question to be asked by an upset Israeli, which was met with a raucous response from the audience – including one student who tactfully turned around, shouted, and dramatically mimed “zip-it-up.”
Halper concluded his presentation by claiming that the world was forgetting Palestinians and turning them into “surplus humanity” by apathy.
He proposed the abandonment of the two-state concept and a focus on a single-state solution, an option on neither party’s radar. He noted Israel has historically come to the negotiating table expecting to walk away with everything.
“I hope my message wasn’t a ‘down’ message, but there cannot be a win/lose resolution.”
Grey’s discussion preceded Halper. He felt Canadians have been far too passive in human rights activism, explaining that “safe” human rights activists avoid controversy– such as language laws and labour issues in Canada, and the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
“Human rights are quite useless if not accompanied by courage,”Grey said.
Grey implied Israel’s recent action in Gaza has darker Machiavellian undertones.
“Condemning the invasion is in the interest of Israel,” added Grey.
He found any real resolution to be in the hands of Israel’s government, who he said needs to step away from policies of hate and war. He then outlined how Canadian action can speed up that process.
Representatives from QPIRG and IJV claimed McGill tried to censor the event when it demanded an additional $250 for security on the day of the talk. The audience was asked for further donations to cover the unexpected cost.
