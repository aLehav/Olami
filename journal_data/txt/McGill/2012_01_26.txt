Council unanimously passes motion of confidence in Lex Gill
Correction appended Jan. 27, 2012
Approaching the one-year anniversary of Concordia Student Union (CSU) President Lex Gill’s contentious election, three Concordia students launched a petition yesterday to impeach her.
In a meeting that same night, CSU Council unanimously passed a motion of confidence in Gill.
There are 35 whereas clauses in the petition, available online at stoplexgill.com, detailing – among other issues – the recent decline in student representation on the Concordia Board of Governors, strained relations with other Concordia student societies, and a series of grievances related to the election of Gill’s slate, Your Concordia, last spring.
A parody of the petition site, stoplexgill.ca, was set up hours later.
Gill and her slate were elected last spring amidst a chaotic campaign that feature numerous campaign violations and targeted vandalism by the opposing slate, Action. The controversy continued into this year as a Council-initiated Judicial Board (J-Board) hearing found that Chief Electoral Officer Bram Goldstein had been inappropriately appointed in the midst of the election.
An appeal of the ruling from former CSU councillor Tomer Shavit was dismissed as out of order by J-Board. Shavit co-authored the petition with Alex Gordon, president of the Concordia Arts and Science Federation of Associations (ASFA), and Marianna Luciano, president of the Commerce and Administration Students’ Association (CASA).
In a statement emailed to The Daily, Gill condemned some of the whereas clauses as “rife with conjecture, misinformation, logical fallacies, defamatory statements, and straightforward lies about myself, and more importantly, the work of my executive team.”
“There is nothing more disappointing to me, or damaging to the CSU’s reputation, than watching a capable student union descend into petty infighting and internal chaos,” she wrote.
Gill devoted several paragraphs of her statement to outlining procedural issues with the petition. The CSU’s current bylaws only allow students to impeach an entire slate – not individual executives. In November 2011, a by-election changed the bylaws to allow individual impeachment; however, the changes do not take effect until March 1.
According to the Link, Shavit defended his petition at the meeting, saying he would continue to pursue an individual impeachment.
Shavit called the current bylaws “open to interpretation,” according to the Link.
In an interview with the Link, Shavit said the petition had been developing for months, but that “it took a while for everything to fall into place.” Before last night’s meeting, various CSU councillors expressed skepticism about the petition.
Anthony D’Urbano, councillor from the John Molson School of Business, said he wasn’t surprised the petition had come up.
“There’s been a lot of controversy with regards to the last election,” he said.
In an email to The Daily before the meeting, Arts and Science councillor Lina Saigol wrote that the petition “seems to be something of a personal vendetta” against Gill.
“Stuff like this happens every year,” Saigol continued. “I plan to have no part in it, as I find the accusations completely unfounded.”
Former Arts and Science councillor Bruno Joyal said Gill and Shavit have “been political opponents for some time,” and doubted the petition will raise the necessary signatures to be validated.
“I have no bad feelings dismissing this thing as a farce,” he continued. “Lex is honestly one of the best presidents the CSU has had in the past few years. She’s not some kind of dictator running the show.”
Gill wrote in her statement that “should a petition, collected after [new bylaws are enacted on] March 1 be validated, I’d be happy to call the General Meeting, book the room, and move the motion myself. That is, after all, how democracy works.”
In the printed version of this article, it states that Bruno Joyal is a CSU Arts and Science councillor; he is in fact a former councillor. The Daily regrets the error.

Justice discloses previous involvement with OPIRG
Since students Zach Newburgh and Brendan Steven announced the filing of a Judicial Board (J-Board) case against Elections SSMU’s Chief Electoral Officer Rebecca Tacoma, SSMU executives and J-Board justices have both released statements regarding their involvement in the case.
The case challenges the results of the fall 2011 referendum question regarding QPIRG’s existence and opt-out system.
SSMU President Maggie Knight released a statement explaining that VP University Affairs Emily Clare will spearhead SSMU decisions relating to the J-Board case.
Knight stated that she has “too many different roles in relation to the ongoing Judicial Board case” to make decisions regarding the case, including hiring J-Board justices, acting as supervisor to Tacoma, and a history of personal interactions with petitioners Newburgh and Steven.
Knight specified that she voted to censure Newburgh last year following his involvement with Jobbook.
Clare said that she plans to disclose any previous involvement with QPIRG, including professional interactions with the group in her capacity as Equity Commissioner last year.
“I’m not making the decision, just more facilitating the J-Board process,” said Clare.
SSMU’s Conflict of Interest Policy, which was redrafted following last year’s allegations against Newburgh, is also mentioned in the J-Board case itself. The case charges VP Clubs & Services, Carol Fraser, Clubs & Services representative Adam Winer, and former Arts representative Micha Stettin with conflicts of interest.
The three councillors played roles in bringing QPIRG and CKUT’s referendum questions to Council for approval. At the time, Fraser and Winer were members of the CKUT ‘yes’ committee, while Stettin sat on the QPIRG Board of Directors.
Discussion also arose around the history of J-Board Justice Raphael Szajnfarber, who was involved in a 2008 Hillel Ottawa dispute with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG).
On Tuesday, Szajnfarber released a statement detailing the situation. Then-President of Hillel Ottawa, Szajnfarber acted as spokesperson for the organization when Hillel complained that OPIRG had refused to provide funding for an event due to Hillel’s connection to Israel.
“I’m the one who liaised with [Szajnfarber] and asked him to put up that statement, because it’s just trying to get as much information out as possible,” Clare said.
Szajnfarber’s statement outlines the steps he took to inform SSMU of his involvement in the situation during his interview for the position of a J-Board Justice, as well as informing his fellow justices and filing an official disclosure form.
Chief Justice David Parry also filed an official disclosure form declaring his former position as staff writer with The Daily and Le Délit, though none of his work covered student politics.
Szajnfarber stated that he has “never met or been in contact with any of the parties to the dispute,” and that none have asked him to step down from the case. QPIRG McGill is not considered a party in the J-Board case; the named parties are Steven, Newburgh, and Tacoma.
SSMU Council will hold a public discussion about the case tonight.
According to a statement released by J-Board, there will not be a decision on the case at the hearing, but a judgment will be made “within a reasonable delay after the hearing.” The hearing is set for Monday, January 30.

The Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) discussed the Jutras Report – released last month in response to the events of November 10 – as well as changes to the Open Air Pub (OAP), during their first Council meeting of the semester on Monday.
A motion concerning amendments to the OAP bylaws passed. The amendments include a starker difference between the roles of VP Finance and the Chair of the OAP Committee regarding the execution and financing of OAP. The amendments also added a section on sponsorship, whereas up to three cooperate sponsors will be allowed kiosks per day. Previously, there had been no clause specifying a limit on corporate sponsorship. The event will now also serve non-alcoholic beverages.
The meeting included some general remarks from EUS President Josh Redel. Redel noted that the intramural broomball arena – termed the Iron Rink – will have its grand opening tomorrow, with various pick-up games planned.
Redel noted that the EUS was unable to carry out their previously planned improvements to the rink, due to McGill decreasing the amount of their funding. The University had anticipated higher performance from the fund financing the rink than it received.
“McGill went from giving [EUS] $55,000, to $15,000, to $1,000, but only if we really need it,” Redel said to Council. The installed improvements include an enlargement of the rink as well as new sideboards.
Discussion of the Jutras Report was limited. Ethan Landy, president of the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Society, said that, “[The report] was pretty well-balanced, and a lot of the claims that the students made in terms of the physical abuse were addressed and confirmed.”
“I didn’t find it biased,” Landy added.

Proposed amendment to constitution to be discussed at GA
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) General Assembly, which will be held next Tuesday, has sparked debate surrounding the current AUS structure and Constitution.
A special referendum was put forth to amend the current AUS Constitution so that the General Assembly (GA) would be the supreme governing body of AUS, rather than AUS Council.
The amendment would allow the AUS to become a member of the Coalition large de l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE), which the amendment describes as “a temporary coalition of CEGEP and university student associations from across Quebec” that have assembled in opposition of the proposed tuition hike, according to the referendum.
In an interview on CKUT’s Morning After show earlier this month, Jaime Maclean, a member of the AUS Mobilization Committee, highlighted that “joining CLASSE would mean that we would have a voice to go negotiate with the government to influence the way that the tuition increases go,” since “one solitary student association at one university doesn’t have that power to do that on their own.”
Elections AUS rejected the referendum, but will be meeting with members of the AUS and of CLASSE to discuss the matter further. According to Kevin Paul, another member of the AUS Mobilization Committee, the rejection was due to a claim by Elections AUS that the referendum’s whereas clauses were inaccurate, as a CLASSE executive was claimed to have deemed the AUS as “already democratic.”
Despite this claim by Elections AUS, Paul made clear that “multiple executives of CLASSE have made official statements to the contrary.”
The amendment will be addressed at the upcoming GA.
In response to the rejection, a motion has been brought forward to censure AUS Chief Returning Officer Victor Cheng for acting without adequate explanation in regards to the referendum.

Student journalists one target of 2011 media report
The Quebec government has paused plans to create a professional class of journalists, following widespread criticism of the proposals.
The plans first emerged with the publication of the Payette Report last January. Minister of Culture, Communications, and the Status of Women Christine St. Pierre asked Laval University professor and former Radio-Canada journalist Dominique Payette to recommend ways of improving journalistic standards in Quebec. One of the recommendations included in the Payette Report involved creating the title of “professional journalist.”
In the report, the Ministry argues that “the increasing number of news platforms do not guarantee better news quality” because amateur journalists, such as bloggers, are not required to follow the “high ethical standards” of professional journalists.  The Ministry believes that a professional title is in the public interest because it would distinguish professional journalists from other types of commentators.
Under the proposals, “professional journalists” would also have preferential access to governmental sources and meetings.
In April 2011, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Quebec (FPJQ) voted 86.6 per cent in favour of creating a professional title.
Claude Robillard, Secretary General for FPJQ, noted that “with the arrival of the Internet, blogs, social media, et cetera, everyone has begun writing and commenting.”
“Even in newsrooms, information is being diluted with the arrival of all sorts of commentators, such as politicians, ex-politicians, hockey players, and ex-hockey players,” he said.
“We say that, for the public, the difference between someone who has a hidden agenda, and the journalist who isn’t supposed to have any hidden agendas, isn’t necessarily evident,” Robillard added.
However, by the the end of 2011, the FPJQ was divided on the plans.
FPJQ President Brian Myles recently rescinded full support for the title of professional journalist, citing the divisions the plans created within the FPJQ.
The Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ) has critiqued the plan from the start.  In a statement posted on its website, the CAJ writes that, “The Quebec government’s proposal to divide journalists into classes, backed by legislation, and giving one group rights and privileges denied to the other is a fundamental interference by government in true freedom of the press.”
The CAJ also suggested that the plans implied that the public needed the government’s help to distinguish between good and bad journalism.
“Journalists rely on their credibility with their audience, with the public. Ultimately, that credibility does not reside in a journalist’s title or for whom they work. Credibility, whom readers and viewers will trust, comes from the content of their work,” continues the CAJ statement.
Sarah Deshaies, Quebec bureau chief for the Canadian University Press and chief copy editor for the Concordian, argued in a December 7 Ottawa Citizen blog post that the plans would severely hinder student journalism, in particular.
“Limiting the access of student journalists to sources, and privileging certain information to paid journalists, also limits Quebec’s youth,” Deshaies writes. “Student journalists are not only trying to build their craft, but they are also often mandated by the students they serve to report and reflect on student issues, a topic often overlooked by mainstream media.”
Speaking to the Link, Steve Faguy, a copy editor at the Montreal Gazette and creator of the blog Fagstein, agreed.
“Many people see [the word] ‘journalist’ and they think of a newspaper reporter,’ said Faguy. “But journalism is a lot more complicated than that, and it’s only going to get more so. I think it will be impossible for a line to be drawn between ‘journalist’ and ‘non-journalist,’ because I don’t believe such a distinction exists anymore.”

Faculty presidents offer their recommendations
The portfolio of senior administrator Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson’s profile is the topic of a for-discussion document written by SSMU President Maggie Knight and several presidents of McGill faculty associations.
Official signatories to the document, addressed to Provost Anthony Masi, include Knight and the presidents of eleven faculty associations.
The document started as a joint initiative between Knight and some of the faculty association presidents at McGill. The result is a document with recommendations aimed at improving the portfolio by making changes to the role of the Deputy Provost.
The document states a long-term goal of reassessing the Deputy Provost’s portfolio “to ensure its success in years to come, and enable McGill to further its mission as a student-centred University.”
Knight explained that the document arose from a letter sent by some faculty association presidents over the summer, which expressed concern about the extension of Mendelson’s term without consultation.
The document refers to conflicts between students and Mendelson, including the closure of the student-run Architecture Café in the summer of 2010 and the withdrawal of the McGill name from 132 student clubs and services last semester.
“Stemming from [the letter], when the Provost embarked on his revision of the Student Life and Learning portfolio, we were invited as a group to meet with him and discuss things. And given that there are a lot of different issues and it is a complex and detailed portfolio, we wanted to provide a document that was as thorough and constructive as possible,” said Knight.
Jade Calver, Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) president, did not sign the letter. She told The Daily she abstained from signing because AUS Council had recently submitted a similar document.
“[Last week’s document] was kind of going along the same lines of the earlier document we had sent to the Deputy Provost,” said Calver. “I didn’t think it was appropriate to sign on a similar letter.”
Calver clarified that, despite not signing the document, the AUS agrees with the sentiments expressed in it.
One of the recommendations states that “students should be informed and consulted in the decision-making process; in the case of decisions being made during the summer, there must be proactive consultation throughout the winter semester.”
Knight stressed the importance of stronger communication lines between the office of the Deputy Provost and students.
“There are clear forums for academic issues, like Senate. We have representation in those committees,” said Knight. “There is no similar body for the governance of student life. It’s very much centralized within the Deputy Provost office, and there isn’t the same committee structure or government council type structure.”
According to Josh Redel, president of the Engineering Undergraduate Society, another important feature of the document is the call for better relations between the portfolio and faculty associations.
“Right now we do get a decent amount of support from the portfolio, but unfortunately, on certain things, like the McGill name and Arch Café, it’s always reactionary as opposed to proactive,” he said.
Catherine Coursol, president of the Law Students’ Association, spoke to potential ways – mentioned in the document – of closing the gap between students and the administration.
“I think doing so would go a long way to minimize both the real disconnect that exists, and to bring the perceived extent of the disconnect into perspective,” she said.
In an email to The Daily , Masi addressed the recommendations.
“I very much appreciated the thoughtful contribution of these student leaders. Their presentation was impressive, both in terms of content and tone, so much so that we have incorporated some of their suggestions in the Terms of Reference questions for the [Student Life and Learning] review,” wrote Masi.
Masi said that consultation processes are ongoing.
“We will continue to consult with students and look forward to further productive conversations during a full day retreat on February 27, when we will convene, along with Principal Heather Munroe-Blum, to learn more about student perspectives and opinions,” he said.
 
In a previous version of this article the authorship of the document pertaining to the extension of the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) portfolio was misrepresented. The article attributed sole authorship to Maggie Knight. In fact the document was authored by several individuals of whom Knight was one. The Daily regrets the error.

Winter semester projects include revamping Constitution
It has been a busy year for U2 student and Music Undergraduate Students’ Association (MUSA) President Katie Larson. Ongoing activities, which include student services and administrative tasks like assigning practice rooms and lockers, have kept her, and the MUSA executive, occupied. “This seems trivial, but it’s a lot of work,” Larson explained. “But that’s what we’re here for.”
However, her duties as president have not kept her from spending hours practicing for her general Music degree programme, concentrating in Voice.
According to Larson, one of the most important services offered by the executive is in the area of musician health. Music students can be required to practice up to eight hours a day. MUSA offers yoga classes twice a week, seminars on physical well-being, and a Musician’s Health Week this March. “We are trying to get the faculty to latch onto this this year, because we see this as something very important,” she said.
A close relationship with MUSA and the faculty administration, says Larson, is something that is very important to Music students. Larson cited the two associate deans of Music, Julie Cumming and Sara Laimon, in particular.
“They are so willing to help, so willing to hear what we have to say,” she said.
“The amount of mutual work and mutual respect that I see in Music is unparalleled elsewhere on campus,” she added.
When it comes to relations with the central administration, Larson explained that interactions are much more formal and distant. “It’s a bummer that, when I have presidents’ meetings, and end up talking with others about central administrators, it’s more, ‘Well you guys are more your own thing, and we’re McGill… We [Music] are separate.’”
Larson prefers the small size of the faculty, the informality and the close-knit relations among the musicians. “Everybody knows everybody. There is a lot more fluidity,” she said.
Aspirations for the rest of her tenure include some tidying up and making provisions for the future. “This semester’s big project is to finalize our constitution, because it’s really old, and really bad,” Larson said.
Larson has some things she would like to see more of from students as well as the administration. “I’d like to see people get more involved,” she said, “I’d like to see people get out of [isolation].”

In response to the removal of a Canadian painting from the Building of Foreign Affairs, Joanne Corbeil, candidate for Westmount-Ville-Marie NDP, mailed a petition to Governor General David Johnston last Tuesday.
The Pellan Petition, submitted to the Office of the Governor General, protests the removal of paintings by Quebec artist Alfred Pellan from the lobby of the Foreign Affairs building in Ottawa.
The order to remove the paintings came from Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird last June, when they were replaced with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.
Although the petition managed to gather over 200 signatures, including those of some prominent members of Parliament – such as Thomas Mulcair – Corbeil has little hope that it will succeed.
“If something actually happened – well, that would be a miracle,” Corbeil said.
“The petition really aims at showing them that we do not all agree. I’m sure they’re aware of that, but I thought it was important that it was in writing, that people are not necessarily agreeing with this,” she said.
“So many people say, ‘Well, we want to keep our history alive.’ I have nothing against that,” she added.
“The history is part of our past, and we should not deny it. But at the same time, I believe we should look toward the future also. Modern Canada, for most Canadians, is not the Queen. She’s not part of our laws, she’s not part of our Parliament. She does not decide things with us or for us. She’s just a figure.”
The replacement of the Pellan paintings is one of a number of recent moves by the Harper administration to increase the presence of the monarchy in Canadian government.
In early September 2011, all Canadian embassies and missions abroad were ordered to have a portrait of the Queen on prominent display by September 15, 2011. The demand came shortly after the restoration of the word “Royal” to the names of the Canadian Air Force and Navy in August.
According to Joseph Lavoie, press secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the decision to swap the pictures was spurred by the approach of the Queen’s diamond jubilee, the sixty-year anniversary of her coronation.
“The Sovereign’s Wall is a tribute that befits our head of state, Queen Elizabeth II,” wrote Lavoie in an email to The Daily. “It was also established as a recognition of the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to the Pearson Building on July 1.”
However, Gilles Lapointe, director of the Art History Undergraduate Program at Université de Québec à Montréal, expressed concerns that the removal of the Pellan paintings compromises an important part of Canadian culture.
“I can absolutely not agree with it,” Lapointe said. “We don’t have that many great painters in Canada. Pellan is one of them for sure. It’s like we are trying to erase a part of our cultural history… Putting him in a closet is not doing Canada and Quebec a favour.”
“We know that the Harper government still sees Canada as a dominion. They still see Canada as bowing to the Queen. We’re supposed to be in a post-colonial era, but Harper is bringing us back into a colonial era. I don’t think it’s a good idea,” he added.
