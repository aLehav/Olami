International news for the week of Nov. 19
Ceasefire in Gaza 
On November 11, seven Palestinians in Gaza were killed by an Israeli special forces operation. This was the latest event in the violent, decades-long occupation of Gaza by Israel, though there had been a ceasefire since 2014, with Israel easing up its siege and allowing money and fuel to be sent over the border. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader, said on November 13 that if Israel “stops its aggression,” it would be possible to return to the ceasefire understanding of before. Even with the ceasefire, Gazans still live in unfair and inhumane conditions.
On November 14, an agreement was reached between the Palestinian and Israeli governments with the help of the deal brokered by Egyptian officials. Egypt has also been engaged in blockades against Gaza, restricting movement at the border between Egypt and Palestine. This deal, which was agreed upon in order to avoid the possibility of war, has reportedly already decreased violence in the region. The possibility of peace seemed to be in jeopardy after Israel’s covert mission, but Haniyeh has stated that “[Hamas] will respect this declaration as long as the Zionist enemy respects it.” Yahya Sinwar, another leader of Hamas, has said that he would also like to avoid war. “Through war, we achieve nothing,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also wishes to avoid war, as evidenced by his agreement to the deal. Gideon Levy, an editor at Al Jazeera, commented that while “both parties are not interested in war, [neither are] doing enough to prevent one.”
UK and EU Reach Deal
British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a Brexit deal this past Tuesday November 13, calling an emergency Cabinet meeting. Since the 2016 referendum, where over 50 per cent of UK citizens voted in favour of leaving the EU, there have been extensive deliberations on how Britain can and should exit the European Union.
May’s deal includes details of the 21-month withdrawal and transition period, the new rights and commitments of EU and UK citizens, as well as the the sum of money to be paid to the EU. On November 14, the deal was approved by Cabinet, but not without opposition. Since an agreement was reached, two Cabinet ministers and numerous junior ministers have resigned, and Prime Minister May has received several letters of non-confidence. If May is presented with 48 letters, a vote to oust her as leader and Prime-Minister could be held.
The deal will be up for EU approval at the emergency summit to be held on November 25. If passed, the current deal will be voted on within the UK Parliament. If Parliament does not back the deal, the government has 21 days to produce a new deal, or face following re-negotiations, or even hold a general election. If Parliament votes in favour of the deal, the EU will produce an official Withdrawal Bill which will have to go through a number of stages of approval at the EU ahead of the withdrawal, which will occur on March 29 2019.

Conflict in Cameroon Escalates 
Dozens have been killed in Cameroon this past week as fighting increases between Cameroon militia and separatist rebels. The increase in casualties on both sides follows the October re-election of President Paul Biya for a seventh term. Biya is the oldest leader in sub-Saharan Africa; he has ruled Cameroon for almost 40 years.
The conflict stems from a divide in the predominantly French-speaking nation between Anglophone separatists and government forces. The then-German protectorate of Kamerun was split between France and England by the League of Nations in 1919, causing the current language divide. Following a referendum in 1972, French and English speaking territories came together to form the United Republic of Cameroon.
Separatist rebels seek the creation of an independent, English-speaking state called “Ambazonia.” Separatists have targeted English-speaking areas that conform to the Cameroonian national identity, including kidnappings and violence in Western Cameroon. However, it is often unclear who is behind the violence. To stifle the rebels, army forces have actively killed, kidnapped, and targeted villages. Strict and enforced curfews have been imposed in English-speaking zones to limit separatist activities after dark. Reports indicate that more than half of the English-speaking city of Bamenda have fled their homes, with schools closing, and roads remaining unsafe. The crisis has forced civilians to flee Anglophone regions for French-speaking ones, or to neighbouring Nigeria.

Environmentalist Niloufar Bayani Remains Detained
Niloufar Bayani, who graduated from McGill with a BSc in Biology in 2009, is currently detained in Iran. Bayani, and five other environmental activists have been charged with national security crimes, including “corruption on earth,” an offence punishable by death in Iran. In January, Bayani and nine other environmentalists were detained. The environmentalists were working with the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF) when they were arrested on the suspicion of using the foundation as a front for collecting secret strategic information. Specifically, the Iranian government thought the organization was using their surveys of the endangered Asiatic cheetah’s habitat to spy on sensitive areas. This allegation has yet to be be proven. 
Iran is suffering its worst drought in decades, which has sparked nationwide protests over water shortages and other related environmental consequences. In turn, authorities have been cracking down on environmentalists. The Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a force independent from the Iranian government, has been engaging in mass arrests of environmentalists since January. Human Rights Watch reports that 50 other activists have been detained or arrested. 
Canadian – Iranian environmentalists Kavous Seyed Emami, founder of the PWHF, died in custody shortly after being arrested. Officials have released little information on the death of Seyed-Emami; they ruled his death a suicide. 
The UN Environment head, Erik Solheim, expressed to The Guardian his concerns about the case saying, “the message that needs to be sent is that environmentalists, like the dedicated people who are under arrest, deserve the utmost support and fullest protection which Iran’s laws and constitution guarantee. At present, Iran’s environment is under immense pressure – with water stress, land degradation, air pollution, loss of wildlife, and sand and dust storms. All who seek to protect it must be supported.” 
Bayani worked at the UN Environmental Programme as a project supervisor in the Disaster Risk Reduction portfolio. Bayani returned to her native country of Iran in 2017 to work on a conservation mission with PWHF. 
A friend of Bayani’s, Adam Rickards, a 2010 McGill graduate in Music Performance, reached out to the Daily in an email to raise awareness of Bayani’s situation and connection to Canada and McGill. “In late January 2018, I received a somewhat frantic message from another friend from my McGill days informing me that [Bayani] had been arrested as part of a crackdown by the Iranian judiciary (the religious extremist wing of Iran’s government),” wrote Rickards. “As you can well imagine, I was absolutely beside myself imagining that my good friend was in prison in Iran. But I thought quite reasonably that it would be best to remain calm, and I still reasonably assumed that things would be worked out, even if it took a little while.” Rickards also “noticed that the Canadian (and indeed international) press was largely silent on [Bayani]’s relationship to Canada, but I felt that maybe the best approach was indeed to be silent. Not anymore.” He continued on, writing, “On October 24, the Judiciary announced that the charges brought against the environmentalists, including [Bayani], would include ‘Corruption on Earth,’ one of the highest criminal charges possible in Iran and a charge that opens her and her fellow environmentalists to a possible death sentence […] this was a nauseating thing to wake up to. I wish only to reach out to the McGill community to support one of our own. I also wish that Canadian media would pick up on the fact that Niloufar has a strong connection to Canada and to Montreal, and that this story deserves important consideration. In short, I simply want this to be known, and to be spread widely.”

Activists Mark 80th Anniversary of the Kristallnacht 
content warning: genocide, anti-Semitic violence
On November 9, students at McGill and Concordia organized banner drops to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Kristallnacht. The Kristallnacht, or The Night of Broken Glass, was a pogrom against Jews throughout Germany and German-controlled territories on the night of November 9-10, 1938. Synagogues were burned, Jewish owned businesses were looted and vandalized, and many Jewish homes were attacked and destroyed. At least 91 Jews were killed, 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps, and many others were tortured and raped. 
At McGill, students gathered in front of the main entrance to the McLennan Library. The banner, placed along the railing on the pathway leading to McLennan, read “Jews Against Fascism,” with the Antifa flag within a Star of David. Abigail Drach opened with the lines: “we gather to show that the Jewish anti-fascist resistance is still here, and that we will outlive them.” The protest lasted about 70 minutes, during which time, those gathered sang “Ale Brider,” “Oyfn Priperchik,” “Ose Shalom,” “Partisan Lid,” and “This Little Light of Mine.” They also distributed flyers to people passing by. Drach told the Daily that they “received a lot of support from students passing by.” Within an hour of leaving the site, their banner – which had been left up – disappeared. 
Drach also told the Daily how the presence at the banner drop of Arts Representative to SSMU, Andrew Figueiredo affected the demonstration. She said that she was concerned when she saw the representative “taking pictures of the banner and the people gathered around it, who were mostly Jews and/or POC.” She further stated that “he called to us ‘smile’ in a tone that made [her] feel threatened. Such behaviour, regardless of intention, is completely inappropriate at a Holocaust commemoration where people are grieving massive loss of life. Moreover, the dynamic of a non-Jewish white man surveilling a group of predominantly Jewish and/or POC non-men at an antiNazi event is disturbing.” 
Representative Figueiredo responded to the statements in an email to the Daily, saying that “I can be found attending or observing events hosted by a variety of groups to better understand different perspectives. I took one picture of the rally and greeted those in attendance. I’m a friend of the Jewish community and will always advocate for the best interest of Arts students and McGill community more broadly.”
At Concordia, students unfurled a banner from the balcony of the mezzanine of the Hall Building which read “Jewish Anti-fascism,” with similar imagery to the banner at McGill. Then, from the ground floor, Tali Ioselevich gave a speech. In their speech, they said “[on the anniversary of the Kristallnacht,] we are reminded that the same words that were used to persecute Jews and deny them entry into safer countries as refugees in the 20th century are being revived today to persecute and deny safety to people of many religions and ethnicities.” Participants sang “Ale Brider.” Ioselevich then reread the speech, so that it would be heard by a new wave of passerby. 
Both protests disrupted foot traffic. Both also emphasized the importance of contemporary antifascist organizing. Ioselevich said “the memory of Kristallnacht moves us to highlight the rise of fascism today. […] This is not history; this violence is our reality.”

A Panel Discussion on Women, Media, and Politics
On November 8, students and community members gathered at Notman House for a panel discussion on issues regarding women in politics and the media. Put on by the McGill Students for UN Women, the panel featured four prominent women in Montreal’s political landscape: Jennifer Maccarone, Justine McIntyre, Mira Ahmad, and Vino Wijeyasuriyar. All four panelists spoke about their experiences as women navigating political spaces and the intricacies of women’s positions in media and politics. The panel was moderated by McGill Professor Elisabeth Gidengil, who noted the significance of the week’s triumphs in the American midterm elections, but acknowledged that despite the wins, there is still a “long, long way to go.” 
The discussion started with an analysis on the importance of women being involved with politics at all levels of government. The discourse was wide, reaching across each panelist’s area of expertise. In debating the so-called “parity zone” Justine McIntyre, political strategist and former City Councillor, made an important distinction between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. “What I want to see more of is women taking positions of leadership, positions of power. Women leading, using their voices. To me that is more important than a head count.” Mira Ahmad, a campaign manager, political strategist, and former President of the Young Liberals of Canada, believes that representation is paramount for the future of women’s involvement in politics. She described her early experiences in campaigning, knocking on doors, and entering “scary and intimidating” rooms full predominantly of men. “I was fortunate enough to have a lot of strong women who inspired me, whom I saw at the head of the table. It’s important to be able to see yourself in someone who holds a position you aspire to be in one day,” she said. 
The panelists had clear ideas about the goals women should be striving to achieve in politics. McGill student and Director of the Women in House program, Vino Wijeyasuriyar, said “if there was to be a women’s agenda, it would be choosing your own agenda.” Touching on the issue of women disproportionately being delegated to “care issues,” she argued the importance of allowing women to further whatever issues they find important, and not relying on stereotypical roles in society and politics. Ahmad offered her definition of feminism, saying “feminism is still misunderstood, a lot of people see it as ‘just a women’s issue,’ and not the equality of [all people].” This line of reasoning raised the question: can we look past the label of feminism when women are involved in politics? Justine McIntyre thinks yes. “It’s not because I’m a woman, that I should have to talk about feminist issues when they come up,” she said. However, Jennifer Maccarone, newly elected member of the Quebec National Assembly, thinks we are not there yet and that there is still much to be achieved before we abandon these issues. “It’s a woman’s role to take on that role of spokesperson, to demonstrate to women who are aspiring to be where you are, that you can do it too […] When those powerful women speak out, I notice. I take notice and I want to be that powerful woman, I want to have that voice for my daughter,” she said. 
The biggest obstacles to women in politics were considered by the panel to be deeply ingrained in our society. The lack of encouragement, empowerment, and accessible spaces makes entering the “boys’ club” of politics just as difficult as operating in it. Citing the decision to run for office as the first and most cumbersome stumbling block, the panelists left the audience with some advice: “make yourself wonder – instead of why should it be me, why shouldn’t it be me?” Wijeyasuriyar added her own piece of advice, saying, “walk into every room as if you’re a cisgender, white hereosexual male, and there’s nothing you can’t do,” she quipped. 
The discussion then shifted to the portrayal of women in media and strategies for women to better represent themselves. “Now that there are more women in politics, we’re not on a pedestal anymore. At first you’re this new shiny thing, glorified because ‘oh my gosh, there’s a woman in government now.’ But the minute you fail, they’re all over you,” McIntyre said. With agreement across the table, this brought up the need for women to be not glorified, but accepted. McIntyre counselled the audience to “be powerful, use the emotion” that women are so often vilified for, reminding attendees that “it’s a strength.” 
The panelists relayed their advice to the young women in the crowd. All four women encouraged the audience to begin their political engagement with the things that they are passionate about and to “put the things you bring to the table at the forefront,” Wijeyasuriyar said, urging attendees to, “start with the things that frustrate you, that usually means its a space where you can do some really good work. Give other women the advice you wish they would have given you. Use your platform […] it’s such a privilege.” 
Though panelists discussed many different experiences of occupying space in the political arena as women, discourse around intersectionality and privilege was overall notably absent. Wijeyasuriyar brought attention to inequalities among women. She referenced the “staggering numbers” of white women who voted Republican in the 2016 American election. “It’s important for everyone to get a chance to hold the mic,” she said during the panel, “if you have the privilege to be able to be politically engaged, do it. And then turn around and empower other people to advocate for themselves.” 
Following the discussion, the Daily asked Wijeyasuriyar to elaborate on the importance of everyone getting a platform. Speaking of her experiences as a young person getting involved with politics, Wijeyasuriyar said, “I never watched politics growing up and thought ‘I’m going to be up there.’ For a lot of reasons, of course: I’m a woman and the daughter of refugees. It felt like it wasn’t my place. So being able to be involved in something like this, that makes it so worthwhile.” Wijeyasuriyar stressed that “everyone has a unique perspective […] diverse voices [need] to be included.” She continued, “it’s important to use your voice so that others can have a voice, rather than speaking for other groups. If you have privilege, figure out how you can share that with other people. […] When you get that privilege, advocate for, and empower those communities so they can advocate for themselves. It’s performative allyship more than anything to go out and say, ‘here are my demands for this group […] I think the situation only improves when we get more voices involved in the conversation.”

King on Sporting Culture and the “Change the Name” Campaign
C. Richard King, Professor and Chair of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago, gave a keynote lecture on “Origins, Interpretations and Impacts” of Indigenous imagery in North American sporting culture on November 8. 
McGill’s First Peoples’ House, along with SSMU’s Indigenous Affairs Commissioner, Tomas Jirousek, brought Professor King to Montreal to present his research on the racialization and appropriation of Indigenous imagery in sports. Considering the success of the “Change the Name” Campaign in the Fall 2018 SSMU Referendum, Professor King directly addressed McGill’s history of racialized team names, mascots, and other appropriated images in sports. 
Professor King has dedicated 25 years to understanding the racial politics of culture and Indigeneity in sports and media. King has written several books dedicated to this subject, including Team Spirits: The Native American Mascot Controversy (2001), Native Athletes in Sport and Society (2005), and, most recently, Redskins: Insult and Brand (2015). 
The co-opting of Indigeneity by the West has resulted in images which misrepresent Indigenous people and cause them harm. Feelings of invisibility and fraudulent identity are some of the more widely-recognized harms that these dehumanizing images, appropriated symbols, names, and mascots have on Indigenous peoples. 
“Misrecognition” refers to the inability of broader society to understand Indigenous people as part of a present reality. King pointed out how phrases such as “you don’t look like an Indian” and stereotyped images contribute to the erasure and denial of Indigenous voices.
 During the Q&A period, McGill student Ella Martindale asked Professor King how one should respond to people who claim that the name does not refer to Indigenous people at all, but rather to James McGill’s Scottish heritage. Several other students spoke to the arguments they had heard against the name change, claiming that “R*dmen” has nothing to do with Indigenous people, and is part of McGill’s history and traditions. In response, King discussed how this rhetoric echoes a white-settler ownership over appropriated images while denying the structural violence that this name represents and contributes to. 
King also expressed the downfalls of thinking about race and power simply in terms of bad intentions, bad attitudes, and bad ideas. He believes that if something is done without any of the aforementioned in mind, then it is not bad or racist. This definition of racism directs attention and blame to the wrong place: individual action, rather than a system of racial violence. By focusing on who is to blame for the perpetuation of violence, the broader context of McGill’s “R*dmen” name becomes lost. 
Jirousek asked King what “is to be done after the vote to tackle the lingering generative qualities of these images?” In response, Professor King emphasized how McGill can incorporate practices of reconciliation in its institution. King suggested providing the tools for students, athletes, and faculty to inform themselves of Indigenous peoples’ histories. In fact, King said that “if McGill sees dehumanization as a bad thing, then it has an obligation to its students and most importantly its Indigenous students to address this issue directly.”
