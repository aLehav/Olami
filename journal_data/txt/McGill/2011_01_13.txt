HireRight error almost costs McGill student his job; truckers sue over falsified background check reports
HireRight, an American company that performs background checks on job applicants, is under scrutiny from several directions, including a former McGill student who claims that he was obstructed from a job in a retail store because of a background check report containing false information.
“HireRight performed a background report for a prospective employer of mine…and on the report were certain basic facts about me that matched those of a serious convict,” he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
“I’ve never been in jail, I’ve never been arrested, but on that basis, my job offer was rescinded before I was supposed to start working. After weeks of contacting HireRight, the information was finally corrected and I got the job. I was lucky not to be desperate at that time, and everything worked out, but if it were someone who really needed the job…a few weeks could be whether or not they could feed their family.”
In this case, HireRight’s matching via name and birth date meant that a job applicant was matched with wrong information. Several recent lawsuits challenging HireRight’s policies have arisen from within the American trucking industry.
Trucking companies use a HireRight report called Drive-a-Check (DAC) to make hiring decisions. The companies themselves submit reports to DAC on employees and former employees that later resurface in background checks on the employees. The company is required by law to provide a copy of the background check to the job applicant.
In one lawsuit, it is alleged that the company regularly failed to provide the report to the applicant until after a decision had been made based on the report’s contents. There have also been allegations that trucking companies submit false reports to the DACs in order to control and blackball the careers of certain drivers.
Allen Smith, of trucker’s association The Truth About Trucking, first became aware of the issue when false information was submitted to his own DAC and added to the report without question or investigation.
“I was on a trucking company lease program, and I wasn’t getting the miles, so I was getting starved out. So I returned the truck, but before I did, I made $3,600 worth of repairs to the truck. And they ended up putting on my DAC that I turned the truck in in bad need of repairs. That’s when the light went off that this thing was really a problem,” said Smith.
Another trucker, Bahir Smith, filed a suit in 2010 claiming that HireRight is in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires that the company take reasonable measures to ensure that its information is accurate and notify the applicant as they are being investigated.
In February 2006, Smith was arrested and pleaded guilty to defiant trespass and public drunkenness. In 2009, he applied for a trucking job; when he received the report that had been provided to his prospective employer, it was nine pages long and listed the single February 2006 incident three separate times, making his criminal record history seem much more serious than it actually was. Because the report was not forwarded to him at the same time that it was given to his potential employers, by the time he received the report it had already been used to make a hiring decision.
For the next job he applied for, later in 2009, the report was 11 pages long and listed the incident four times. After a third 2009 job application, he received a report listing his convictions four times, and he initiated a class-action lawsuit.
Allen Smith has created an online petition demanding that “the U.S. Government enact legislation that will protect truck drivers” from falsified DAC reports.
Currently his petition has almost 2,000 signatures, many from drivers who claim that the companies they worked for submitted false information to their reports, which HireRight failed to confirm before adding the damaging remarks to a driver’s report.
“When the DAC services were first formed, it was a good thing. It was to provide the trucking companies with information about employees…but what it has become is a retaliation tool against drivers,” said Smith.

Defence claims cancer cases in Quebec town unrelated to Canadian military’s contamination of groundwater
One of the largest class action lawsuits in North America began in the Quebec Superior Court on Monday over contaminated water in Shannon, Quebec, a small municipality 24 kilometres north of the provincial capital.
In a lawsuit that has been nearly a decade in the making, residents of Shannon and the Valcartier Canadian Forces Base (CFB) will seek compensation from the Department of National Defence (DND) and two ammunitions companies for damages suffered as a result of the carcinogen trichloroethylene (TCE) draining into the water supply from the 1940s to the 1980s.
It was not until 2000 that residents learned they had been consuming the colorless and tasteless TCE, a solvent to clean World War II-era cannons and ammunition. Research has shown TCE causes cancer approximately 35 years after exposure, which coincides with the increasing prevalence of cancer in the area.
In December 2003, Marie-Paule Spieser, a Shannon resident, filed the lawsuit in the Quebec Superior Court. Spieser is the lead plaintiff representing some 3,500 past and present residents of Shannon and CFB Valcartier. The court will hear 120 witnesses from Quebec and 23 experts from around the world.
“These are people who consider themselves victims of their own government.  Many of them cannot be here this morning because they are dead,” said Charles Veilleux, the lead attorney for the residents of Shannon and Valcartier, in his opening statement, as reported by the Toronto Sun.
According to the website shannoninfotce.tripod.com, administered by the Shannon residents themselves, the National Research Council formed the SNC Research Centre to develop ammunition in an “isolated laboratory” because of the dangerous materials.  While the large population of Quebec City was a safe 24 kilometres away, the city of Shannon remained a negligible distance.
The first traces of TCE were detected in a well near the SNC Research Centre in July 1992. Residents, who mistakenly presumed they were living healthy lifestyles, have complained that they did not learn of the TCE contamination until 2000.
Spieser experienced gastric problems, nausea, fatigue, and what her doctor believed to be an ulcer.  She claims that upon leaving Shannon in 1998 and deciding to drink only bottled water, she saw drastic improvement in her health.
Although the lawsuit is requesting $200 billion in compensation, the DND website “estimates the damages at $2 billion.” The gamut of damages for which the residents hope to be recompensed include physical, moral, and material hardship, damages to personal integrity, and harm to the environment.
The defence stated in their document presented at court on Monday that “the study of Dr. Tremblay, epidemiologist for the plaintiff, was unable to show that there are more cases of cancer in Shannon than elsewhere in Quebec that are linked to TCE.” These cases include 440 instances of cancer, 200 of which proved fatal, in a town of 4,000.
To receive this compensation, “the plaintiff must show fault, damages and a causal link,” according to the defence team’s court document.
Francine Robichaud, the department  of justice spokeswoman, told The Daily “that this is not the case.  It is our intention to show that the class action has no basis in law, either scientifically or factually.”
According to the Montreal Gazette, the government has given Shannon “$26.5 million to ensure an alternate, safe source of drinking water.”
Veilleux acknowledged in court that the minister of national defense gave Shannon $3.5 million to build an aqueduct after TCE was discovered in the water.  While preventing further TCE contamination, the aqueduct system left forty years worth of the toxic solvent in the groundwater.
Despite the rising instances of cancer, Jack Siemiatcycki, epidemiologist for the defence, asserts in the defense’s document that “the science of epidemiology recognizes a link only between TCE exposure and renal cancer and possibly liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.”

The Heavy Machinery Training Project for the Haitian diaspora living in Quebec
Correction appended 22 January 2010.
One year since an earthquake killed 200,000 and left a million homeless in the island nation of Haiti, Sylvain Tremblay had an idea to use what he had to help.
Tremblay described watching news footage of the earthquake, and seeing that the vast majority of rubble was that of former homes. “I said to myself: You cannot pick up all the debris there by hand with wheelbarrows and manual shovels, it will take heavy machinery. Then as a result of reflecting on it all in that moment I decided to see if our expertise that we have in heavy machinery could be beneficial for the people of Haiti,” said Tremblay in French.
Tremblay is from the town of Mont-Laurier – a rural logging community in Quebec’s northwest – and is the director of the Centre de Formation Professionelle Mont-Laurier (CFPML), a heavy machinery operation training school. His centre is contributing to a project that seeks to train thirty Haitian-Montrealers to operate construction equipment, and then go to Haiti for three to six months to assist in the reconstruction effort.
A place to learn
Tremblay took his idea and went to the only person of Haitian descent he knew: Michel Adrien, Mont-Laurier’s Mayor. An important question was where the training program would take place.
Adrien, in turn, thought of the Haitian neighbourhoods of Montreal, and reached out to city councillors Frantz Benjamin, Frank Venneri, and Emmanuel Dubourg in the Viau, St. Michel, Parc Extension, and Villeray boroughs. The neighbourhood is home to 11,000 Montrealers of Haitian descent.
In collaboration with the City’s public workers, they picked the sprawling St. Michel quarry as the site of the program.
“We provided the place and the technical support to have the access to the location and everything else that is required,” said a spokesperson for councillor Frank Venneri. “It’s a site we’ve used to train our own employees on using certain new equipment so this was an ideal situation for them.”
Benjamin said he was “proud to welcome [the] project in St. Michel.”
In the weeks following last year’s earthquake, St. Michel’s borough government  responded to the needs of it’s Haitian diaspora population quickly, opening a call centre to direct calls from concerned family members, as well as a multi-service aid centre.
Tremblay knew that it would be essential to involve members of the community, and had initial concerns that the program may attract those who wanted to learn to operate heavy machinery, but did not necessarily want to go to Haiti after their certification.
Nino Colavecchio, the spokesperson for Venneri, agreed. “For an arrondissement like our own there is constant demand for people who have that kind of training and it’s not easy to find,” she said.
The project – now christened the Heavy Machinery Training Project for the Haitian Diaspora living in Quebec – established a basic requirement: all applicants must be of Haitian background to participate in the training school. One-hundred twenty-five people applied, and out of the thirty accepted, most of them were born in Haiti.
Tremblay and Benjamin explain that the project has two aspirations: to help in the reconstruction of Haiti and to provide job skills for members of the Haitian community in Montreal. “One of the concerns we have in the Haitian community is what we can do to reinforce the capacity of the young people of the Haitian community to succeed at school and professional training,” Benjamin explained.
Mackelly Presumé, one of the thirty students in the project, spoke about his job prospects after the project.
“It’s a great opportunity for me in Montreal to actually work and contribute and to give back to the city for giving me this opportunity to have something that I would have never done,” he said.
Benjamin agreed.
“Having more young people of the Haitian community who have a professional training diploma, it’s something really good for the whole Haitian community and for Montreal.”
The Ministre de l’Éducation du Québec is funding the project through public money. However, as Tremblay discovered, there are limits to the funding available, describing the efforts to find continued funding as “door-to-door canvassing.” He has gotten some help from private industry, particularly John Deer and Komatsu, who have provided Tremblay’s CFPML with discount rental equipment. Tremblay’s biggest challenge, however, will be to find thirty placements in Haiti for the students who will complete their training on February 11.
The training
For the past five months, the training has been a combination of classroom sessions, intensive 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. days in the quarry and, currently, workshops with other Montreal organizations with relevant experience in Haiti – notably, police and firefighters who went to Haiti shortly after last year’s earthquake.
At the quarry, students learned how to operate excavators, bulldozers, graters, loaders, off-road trucks, and backhoes.
Presumé said that he has learned how to build roads, transport raw materials, and work in “difficult areas.”
“We would build roads. We learned how to transport from one place to another, how to manipulate the machines to work in difficult areas,” he said.
Tony Armenio, a public worker with the City of Montreal in St. Michel, observed the project from afar.
“Everything they did [was] as if there was an actual earthquake, so they took some ruined pieces of cars and trucks and buried them under the stones. … Their goal is to open up the streets in Haiti, that’s what the practice was all about for them,” he said.
Ian Bellavance is a CFPML instructor from Mont-Laurier who worked with the students in the quarry.
“None of the students had ever operated [equipment like this]. This thirty came from different backgrounds. We had all sorts of people. The main goal for them is to help their family in Haiti,” he said in French. “I have never taught a group of students so motivated.”
“A lot of us lost people over there so that was one of the main motivations of the group as a whole. It’s like to give back for the people we lost,” Presumé explained.
“It was a really good experience and the group has a really good vibe. We would see each other early in the morning and feel happy and leave at five and still be happy. Time went by so fast…everybody had fun learning,” Presumé said, adding “It was great; something that I didn’t see enough in my life.”
Looking ahead 
“You cannot imagine how proud I am of my students; all the work they did, all the skills they learned, and [I am] very proud – maybe too much,” Bellavance laughed as he reflected on the training experience, “I know the end is coming.”
Tremblay told The Daily of the enormous positive reaction the CFPML received from the Haitian community after a media event hosted on December 21. Looking to the year ahead Tremblay is optimistic.
“If we succeed to put our students in action, yes, we can do a second group next year because the demand is there…that is undeniable. The people of Haitian descent truly want to help their fellow citizens.”
But there is still a long way to go for Haiti. Tremblay noted that there are many different factors, among them the upcoming February general elections.
“Following the results of the elections in Haiti, we will see if the political level there will make it possible to take more action because, actually, I think that [maintaining] the same Haitian politics will [result in] paralysis from instability,”  he said.
Presumé contextualized the project in the larger goal of reconstruction.
“I think our project is just one of the small steps. I don’t think the impact is as big as we want it to be. We still do it and the impact that we are giving is good, we’re going to do our part. But it takes more than just the thirty of us to make a big change,” he said.
Correction: Nino Colavecchio was incorrectly referred to as Nina Colavecchio in the original publication of this article. The quote, “Having more young people of the Haitian community who have a professional training diploma, it’s something really good for the whole Haitian community and for Montreal,” was incorrectly attributed to Presumé. It was actually said by Benjamin. The Daily regrets the errors.

After feeling excluded from campus politics, U1 Political Science student and Conservative McGill Principal Secretary Brendan Steven and U2 History student Kevin Brendan Pidgeon have co-founded a new online newspaper called
the Prince Arthur Herald.
In an interview with The Daily, Steven described his feelings of exclusion from campus politics and highlighted what he sees as close-mindedness around topics such as tuition.
“The tone of rhetoric about tuition hikes has gotten a little ridiculous. … In the roundtable in Quebec City, when government groups and student groups were talking about tuition increases, many student groups simply walked out and refused to discuss tuition increases of any sort. … There was no negotiation and there is no room for compromise…it’s things of that nature where I think conservative students feel ostracized, and so my hope is that the Herald will provide a space for conservative students to feel safe and to feel that their opinion counts.”
The Herald’s online statement of principles outlines a right-wing mandate that includes “the belief in the limitation of state regulation to only the most fundamentally necessary areas of Canadian life;” “the importance of preventing the unnecessary growth of the public sector to ensure the maximum productive potential of the Canadian economy;” and “a dedication to the free market system that has provided Canadian society with wealth, prosperity and opportunity for all.”
Steven added that “we are a conservative newspaper consisting of many conservative writers, but we also have other writers consisting of [a] former President of Young Liberals of Canada, and another one of our columnists is on the board of directors for Queer McGill. … We have conservatives of all sorts, including Social Conservatives, Social Liberals, Classical Liberals, Old Tory Conservatives, and Libertarians.”
Describing the Herald’s politics section, Steven commented that, “Our politics section is structured as an opinion section.”
When deciding on the name for the Herald, Steven said, “ We settled on Prince Arthur for a variety of reasons, including the symbolic fact that the street Prince Arthur cuts through the centre of the McGill ghetto and we want to be a student-centric news source.”
Currently the Herald’s staff do not have plans to go into print, but are exploring the possibility of expanding to radio. The Herald has low operating costs and is completely volunteer-run; the current sections of the Herald’s website are administrative, campus life, culture, politics, and sports.

Customer focus turning the program into one of SSMU’s key revenue sources
An ongoing eighteen-month revamp of SSMU’s Mini Courses has turned the program into one of SSMU’s most profitable and popular operations.
Mini Courses – semester-long, publicly available evening classes in subjects as diverse as Japanese language, sketch, and Caribbean cooking – more than doubled its profits in the 2009-2010 school year and continues to generate strong profits in 2011. The courses have also drawn the attention of organizations outside McGill, including businesses wishing to subsidize Arabic language or public speaking training for their employees.
Mini Courses Supervisor Nell Slochowski, who took charge in the fall 2009, has overseen an ongoing Mini Courses overhaul that has included implementation of online registration, reassessment of course profitability, and greater variety in Mini Courses’ offerings.
“We’ve gone out [and] found new teachers for unique courses, changed prices around, and improved the website significantly,” Slochowski said of the improvements.
Slochowski also credits the increased interest in Mini Courses to the program’s higher focus on customer satisfaction. The Mini Courses team audits courses and solicits student feedback throughout the entire semester.
“We are on top of our teachers and we keep notes on everything,” Slochowski said. “There’s a lot of commitment to making Mini Courses better.”
Mini Courses sources both professional and student teachers in an effort to balance profitability, student involvement, and course quality. Slochowski has also sought to integrate Mini Courses with other McGill clubs, both to find knowledgeable teachers and to potentially provide the clubs themselves with a new revenue stream.
Surbhi Gupta, a U2 Engineering student who taught Indian cooking during the Fall 2010 semester, found the teaching process daunting at first but ultimately rewarding.
“I’ve never taught such a huge group, so it was a little bit of a challenge,” Gupta said. “[But] I thought it would be a good idea to expose students to all of the varieties of Indian food…and it was a very good experience.”
The Mini Courses team’s methodology has been accompanied by dramatic profit increases. Mini Courses revenue represented 18.7 per cent of SSMU’s Building operations revenue during the 2010 school year, up from 10.2 per cent the previous year. In March of last year, former SSMU VP Finance and Operations Jose Diaz cited Mini Courses’ profitability as a key factor in the balancing of SSMU’s budget.
Although some of the improvements have resulted in operational snarls – including traffic-based stalls in the online registration and the cancellation of courses with low registration, such as LSAT Practice and Ukrainian for beginners – Mini Courses saw almost as much profit this fall as the 2009 school year’s fall and winter semesters combined. Slochowski stressed, however, that even as profitability climbs, the focus remains on student satisfaction.
“It would be easy to let profit be the driving force behind all we do,” said Slochowski. “[But] I think we’ve really kept a sense of ‘customer comes first.’”

PGSS reallocates funds from its daycare program for support and legal aid; leaves program in limbo
PGSS Council passed an emergency motion yesterday reallocating $40,000 from its budget to fund legal counsel and research for postdoctoral students affected by the federal government’s elimination of the postdoctoral education tax credit in 2010.
Prior to 2010, postdoctoral students in Quebec were considered regular students. However, a change in federal tax law standardized the status of postdocs across Canada, categorizing them all as employees and trainees.
“If you are not pursuing a degree, you are not a student, according to the federal government,” said PGSS VP External Ryan Hughes.
According to Hughes, some McGill Postdoctoral Fellows have been audited by the federal government. As a result, their 2009 income has been declared taxable despite McGill’s issuance of the requisite T2202 forms to the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA), that normally exempt post-doc students from taxation.
The motion feared that “the CRA have put an untenable financial burden on these PGSS members and their families, and stand to threaten all PGSS members.”
It remains unclear how many postdoctoral students will be affected, and how much of their income may be collected as tax.
“Since education is a provincial purview, the question is whether the federal government has the right to determine who a student is,” said Hughes.
“Some students have been audited randomly at Laval [and] McGill, and will be taxed for this year and for the 2009 year. We are talking about thousands of dollars here, which will directly impact not only the students but also the families they support, “ Hughes added.
Hughes argued for the necessity to have funds available to challenge the changes in federal tax law if needed. The motion called for $2,000 to be allocated toward hiring the consultants needed to further research the implications of the changes and potential responses.
The remainder was to be allocated for providing graduate students with needed legal aid and financial support if audited.
The reallocation provoked heated debate at Council because the $40,000 was taken from the newly approved maternity and paternity program supporting graduate students with dependents.
PGSS had initially hoped that the McGill administration would match their $40,000 allocation in order to support a daycare program. When this did not happen, however, the daycare program was left in limbo.
PGSS Family Commissioner Hadley Myers, PhD Electrical Engineering, opposed the reallocation. Myers had planned on using the extra funds to buttress the current family care program, which currently receives $60,000, extending support to pregnant and ill graduate students. The current system only supports those who already have children.
“This was money that would have been used to benefit people. We had programs ready to go that we worked really hard on,” said Myers.
The PGSS Student Support Commissioner Ulrike Trojahn, MA Biochemistry, expressed concern about the reallocation of funding.
“I’m worried about the message we are sending regarding student families. They are a minority in our student society, and fundamentally these people have been overlooked,” said Trojahn.
“Last year, when the family care pilot project was launched, it was an exceptional step in terms of student societies taking care of their members, and I feel that this direction should be continued,” she added.
The emergency motion contained a clause, however, which would see Council hold final responsibility for the allocation of the remainder of the funds if legal action and financial support were not deemed to be appropriate responses, and would see the funds then funneled back into family care.
Despite the clause, Myers was still concerned about the decision to take the money from a program which had received widespread support from Council in previous meetings.
“It was an affirmative action program to support those who needed it. Taking it away now is unfair and many, many of the parents, a disproportionate number of them are in fact postdocs. So we are robbing postdocs to support ten postdocs,” said Myers.

Both parties hope to conclude negotiations by the end of the calendar year
 McGill officially begins  negotiations with its largest union of non-academic workers today after several months of informal discussions. The contract between the University and the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) – representing over 1,800 library workers, technicians, nurses, and clerical workers – expired November 30, 2010.
Kevin Whittaker, MUNACA’s president, identified salary and benefits as likely points of contention between the two parties, particularly the rate at which non-academic employees move up the pay scale.
“At McGill, at the current rate that we have for [salary] progression, it’ll take you thirty years to reach the top of your scale,” said Whittaker. “In other institutions, it’s half that, if not less. So, that’s something that our membership are very upset about, and they do want something done to adjust that,” he added.
In January 2010, McGill cut employee benefits by $1 million, prompting outrage among MUNACA members, who questioned the motivation behind the cuts.
“The rationale for cutting [benefits] was to save the University money. It had nothing to do with the actual benefits plan,” said Whittaker.
“It would be nice to have everything restored to the way it was. We understand that there are economic problems with that, but we would like to see our benefits at least brought up to level with what our members want, not necessarily cutting it just so the University can save money.”
Whittaker and Robert Comeau, Director of Labour and Employee Relations for McGill, both predicted that the first meeting would be a simple exchange of contract demands.
Comeau described the process as “the normal way to negotiate.”
Both sides were hesitant to identify their specific demands since they did not want to compromise negotiations, but a survey recently distributed to MUNACA members, and obtained by The Daily, outlines key issues in the eyes of MUNACA membership.
Besides asking members how important the wage scale issue is to them, the survey also raised grievances over University staffing. According to the survey, McGill gives “positions to new hires over current unionized employees. There have also been problems regarding management not filling vacant positions.”
The survey also alleges that, “McGill has been using loopholes in our collective agreement to take away union work and give it to managers and threatening our job security by moving positions out of the union.”
Comeau felt most of MUNACA’s grievances would be unsurprising to the administration.
“We’ve been discussing with MUNACA for a long time,” said Comeau. “We were able to get a sense of their approach with [Human Resources] within the last year and a half, so it wouldn’t be surprising if for the negotiations they come up with the same preoccupations.”
But before major concerns could be discussed, Comeau said both sides would likely seek to clarify language in the collective agreement.
Comeau also did not anticipate any major changes in the negotiating process though both parties have expanded their teams. The MUNACA negotiation committee has hired Morgan Gay as chief negotiator, from the Ottawa-based Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC)  – one of Canada’s largest unions  – representing over 172,000 workers and with which MUNACA is affiliated.
McGill’s new Vice Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa will oversee all negotiations between McGill and its unions, and report to the Board of Governors, but he will not engage directly in the process.
The next meeting between MUNACA and McGill is scheduled for January 26, with seven additional dates set through February and March. Whittaker said he hopes to conclude negotiations by December, while Comeau identified June as his target date for finalizing a new collective agreement.
In the past, McGill and MUNACA have had a tense relationship. Last year MUNACA protested their benefit cuts during McGill’s open house, and in September 2008 a mysterious fire alarm pull prevented a MUNACA strike vote. However, this time around the University seems determined to reach an agreement quickly.
“It seems that at this point the University is very eager to come to a resolution on the issues,” said Whittaker. “It’s good to see that they are very serious about this and that the process looks like it’s going to be quite quick.”
