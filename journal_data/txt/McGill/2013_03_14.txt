University’s latest offer “brazen disrespect,” say union leaders
After 15 months of tense contract negotiations with Concordia’s administration, Concordia’s full-time teachers’ union, the Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA), voted with a resounding 74 per cent in favour of an unlimited strike mandate this weekend. Three-quarters of the union’s members came out to vote.
The strike mandate is not itself a strike, but it allows the union to declare one at any time with 48 hours’ notice.
After CUFA announced in late February it would vote on a strike mandate, the university offered a renewed three-year contract, termed the “global offer.”
The offer itself, as well as the fact that the university posted it online instead of meeting with the union, represent “brazen disrespect” and an attempt to undermine the negotiating process, according to a statement posted to the union’s website on Tuesday.
CUFA President Lucie Lequin said the online posting was a move designed to preemptively influence CUFA membership prior to further meetings later this month.
“It’s a desire to go around the negotiation team and influence [CUFA] membership,” she told The Daily.
The statement also critiques the offer on the grounds that it misrepresents the value of the proposed salary increases, offers steps too small given the grid compression, attempts to divide the membership by offering inequitable steps, and refuses to review parts of the salary model which have not been updated in ten years.
The vote followed 45 meetings between CUFA and the administration, which began prior to the expiration of previous contracts in May 2012. Concordia requested a government-appointed conciliator last December when it became clear that demands on both sides stood too far apart on certain issues.
The conciliator serves as an impartial third-party observer experienced in negotiations processes, with the authority to make recommendations, but not decisions.
The university declined to comment on the strike mandate or the outrage provoked by its posting of the global offer online, reiterating instead the upcoming mediation dates.
“Concordia deposited a global offer of settlement for the renewal of the collective agreement with CUFA,” Christine Mota, Concordia’s media spokesperson, told The Daily. “Our next meeting is March 18. There are two more scheduled after that.”
Lequin, however, described the later date as part of a longstanding tendency toward unavailability on the part of the university.
“For the last two weeks, the university has not been available for conciliation,” she said.
In the statement responding to the global offer on its website, CUFA executives also write that, “Despite being condemned for doing this in the past, the Employer has once again stooped to posting its global offer on the web…thereby undermining the conciliation process. That this comes when the Employer is unavailable to come to the bargaining table until March 18 makes this move all the more deplorable.”
Despite a 13 per cent pay gap between Concordia’s faculty and professors at other Canadian universities, Lequin stressed that contention between the two parties revolve in large part around non-monetary issues, such as workload, hiring procedures, working conditions, and sabbaticals, and thus have little to do with Concordia’s expected $13 million in budget cuts.
“In the collective agreement, there are only two articles that are directly monetary,” she said. “We started to negotiate those in November.”
Professors are currently working under the conditions of the expired contract until a new deal is negotiated.
As for the mandate, Lequin pointed to the university’s role in avoiding a strike.
“We don’t know [if we’ll end up striking],” she said. “It takes two to tango.”

Contract has pay increases, reforms for casual employees
Nearly two and a half years after being organized into a union, the Association of McGill University Research Employees (AMURE) voted yesterday to ratify their first collective bargaining agreement.
Once signed, all members of the association will see a 3.2 per cent salary increase across the first two years, and a minimum 1.7 per cent increase in the following year.
In addition to the across-the-board increases, the contract establishes minimum salary levels for all employees. Casual employees will immediately see a minimum hourly salary of $11.18.
Full and part-time research associates, on the other hand, who typically have PhDs, will see a minimum hourly salary of $22.75. Assistants, usually working with Master’s degrees, will make a minimum hourly salary of $19.75.
Current salary rates for research employees are determined on an ad-hoc basis by research directors, and vary across departments.
In June 2015, a tiered salary rate will be implemented according to merit.
Full and part-time employees will also see increases in vacation time, up from two to three weeks a year. Employees of seven or more years will be entitled to five weeks vacation.
Currently, full-time research employees are eligible for tuition discounts for family members. Under the new contract, regular employees working at least 25 hours a week will be eligible for the same benefits.
While the new AMURE contract won’t be officially signed for a few weeks, the tentative agreement was overwhelmingly ratified by the membership. The union is split into two bargaining units, one for research assistants and one for research associates, which voted 96 and 95 per cent respectively in favour of the contract.
When signed, the new contracts will represent over 1,200 workers, according to AMURE’s president, Matthew Annis.
The contract is the culmination of over a year’s worth of negotiations, as bargainers first sat down with the University in January 2012.
Annis said that he is most proud of the protections achieved for casual employees, such as vacation premiums and written contracts.
The union was unable, however, to achieve reforms for what Annis called “false casuals,” or casuals that have been working at McGill for years and work enough hours to qualify as part-time employees, but are still classified as casuals and thus earn less money.
The negotiations were overseen by provincial arbitration last fall, after almost a year at the bargaining table. Previously, research employees had only been able to voice their concerns through the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT), Annis said.
“This is the first time we’ve had a unified voice,” he said.
There are still two groups of workers – invigilators and course lecturers – who have unionized but have yet to see a contract.

PGSS says one third of athletics fee subsidizes varsity programs
McGill Athletics and Recreation is asking for an ancillary fee increase for the first time in three years, after posting a $413,116 deficit for the 2013-2014 academic year.
In response, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) released a memo on January 23 criticizing the use of the fee for varsity programs.
According to PGSS, the 2013-2014 budget for McGill Athletics and Recreation saw an increase of $708,116 – 10.9 per cent – to their overall budget.
In an email to The Daily, Drew Love, the executive director of Athletics and Recreation, said that this budget increase encompassed several components, including university salary policy, facility improvements, and increased maintenance.
According to Love, approximately 35 per cent of the total budget – $3.8 million – is paid out in salaries and benefits to staff. An additional $3 million of the budget covers “facility operating expenses.”
Love also noted that the University had more than doubled the overhead charges for the athletics unit from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
To cover such costs, McGill’s athletics unit relies not only on student ancillary fees but also on other sources of revenue such as facility rentals and sponsorship.
However, PGSS pointed out in the memo that McGill’s yearly sponsorship revenue of $115,250 was low compared to that of other major universities. In comparison, they reported that the University of British Columbia received over $500,000 in sponsorship revenues.
PGSS was especially concerned with the heavy burden placed on students to make up for the deficit, and suggested that McGill Athletics and Recreation “reduce the subsidy for varsity athletics and diversify their revenue sources, and instead subsidize services more widely used by students.”
Love said that the athletics unit was aware of the need for additional sources of revenue, and was looking into alternate sources. “To supplement this external revenue we proposed in next year’s budget that we add a fundraiser position [with a $50,000 salary] to work with alumni and other groups to raise additional funds for our programs.”
It is in this financial context that McGill Athletics and Recreation is asking undergraduate students in the SSMU Winter 2013 Referendum period to approve a $7.25 per term fee increase, or about 6 per cent of the current $120.50 fee for full-time undergraduates. This is the first request for a fee increase since a $1.50 hike in 2009.
PGSS, however, has a different referendum fee increase question from SSMU. Academic Affairs Officer Adam Bouchard told The Daily that PGSS has been working closely with the McGill Athletics and Recreation Advisory Board and hopes to review the question in April.
In the memo, PGSS criticized the request for an increase, stating, “McGill students pay higher athletics fees, on average, than students at any other major university in Canada. Typically students pay roughly $60-$70 per term.”
Love disagreed with this. “I’m looking at [PGSS’s] calculations, and [I’m] not in support of all of their math,” he said at a SSMU Legislative Council meeting on January 24.
Love specified in an email to The Daily that comparing athletics fees across universities depended on a variety of costs including maintenance and upkeep of facilities, staff, programming, and others.
According to Love, the University of Toronto athletics fee encompasses similar costs to McGill, and is $150.01 per term for most full-time students.
PGSS also asked in their memo whether the increase would be justified, stating, “the fees that are collected would disproportionately benefit a very small fraction of the McGill student population.”
After an independent analysis of the athletics budget, PGSS determined that the costs of programs such as the fitness centre, intramural sports, and recreational activities, are not subsidized by the ancillary fees.
Instead, these programs run on an operational surplus from user fees which are additional to the mandatory per-semester contribution. PGSS noted that around 34.1 per cent of the ancillary fee subsidizes the direct costs of varsity athletics, including salaries of coaches, administration, and teams themselves.
According to the memo, there are a total of 578 varsity athletes. The memo also noted that the vast majority of funding is directed toward 238 varsity athletes on Level 1 teams such as football and men’s hockey.
In SSMU Legislative Council on January 24, Councillor Zachary Rosentzveig raised concern over this subsidization, especially because “[ancillary] fees are non-opt-outable.”
Love defended the subsidization of varsity programs, pointing out their “remarkable impact…on the university, the greater community, and our alumni.”

Demonstrators tackle “ongoing plague of violence against women”
Around 500 people gathered on March 8 for the 13th annual International Women’s Day demonstration in Montreal.
The Committee of Women of Diverse Origins – a Montreal-based grassroots organization – organized this year’s march to celebrate women’s achievements and draw attention to ongoing gender inequality.
The march kicked off at Place Émilie-Gamelin, with a long series of speakers, including representatives from the Immigrant Workers Centre (CTI-IWC), South-Asian Women’s Community Centre (SAWCC), Tamil Women’s Association, No One is Illegal, and PINAY: Filipino Women’s Organization in Quebec.
This year’s demonstration aimed to address the “ongoing plague of violence against women and its related aspects, as well as to celebrate the courage and tenacity of women who stand up to confront and challenge it in Montreal,” according to the Women of Diverse Origins website.
Typically, a series of workshops are offered as part of the events for Women’s Day. This year, however, the committee opted for a dance in support of the One Billion Rising movement, a campaign aimed at ending violence against women and challenging rape culture within mainstream society.
The dance was performed by members of PINAY, who advocate for female migrant workers in Montreal.
“Sometimes a workshop is too heavy,” said a member of PINAY on the Committee of Women of Diverse Origins. “In the past they’ve been a bit much for people to really absorb the information.”
Though the dance itself was well-received, the One Billion Rising movement was a contentious selection to include in the Women’s Day celebration.
Emma Pallotto, a community activist and member of an action group who challenged the One Billion Rising V-Day demonstration this past February, noted some of One Billion Rising’s shortcomings.
“I found what was wrong with [One Billion Rising] was its simplistic look at ending violence against women,” Pallatto told The Daily. “Of course, that’s what we want to do, but we need to address what we mean when we ask what is women, what is violence.”
She also pointed out limited understandings of violence within the movement.
“It only seems to count violence as physical violence, but what we don’t hear about is other forms of violence. There is no mention of the state and how it is violent against women and women of colour. There is nothing on lesbians and the counter-violence in their daily lives.”
Despite its efforts, International Women’s Day has long been criticized for essentializing gender and excluding non-conforming and queer identities.
“We have this idea that there is only one woman. Man violent, and woman passive, and that’s just way too essentialist,” Pallotto continued. “We need to think about how violence seeps into the lives of trans* women and trans* men.”
PINAY, however, chose to take a different look at the One Billion Rising initiative.
“Our version of the One Billion Rising was a Filipino version. It was more militant. We were following the music, and the lyrics in Filipino were saying, ‘women, it’s the right time now to rise up and fight,’” said a representative from PINAY. “We wanted to address a more imperialist theme in the lyrics, [rather] than a gendered one. This was important for us to bring up for Women’s Day.”

SSMU considers alternatives to student referenda
The Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS), funded by McGill students since 1994, is set to be subject to the ballot box next week as part of SSMU’s Winter 2013 Referendum period.
Because of its status as a student service with a levied fee, SACOMSS must run a referendum to renew its non-opt-outable $0.75 fee every three years.
SACOMSS is a volunteer-run organization and, according to a spokesperson, is the only sexual assault centre in Montreal that offers its services to people of all genders and sexualities under an anti-oppressive mandate.
“Having a sexual assault centre operating under that framework is really important […] especially on a university campus,” Lily Hoffman, an external coordinator with SACOMSS and co-chairperson of its ‘Yes’ committee, told The Daily.
“A sexual assault centre that’s available for support to people who experience sexual assault, or who have people in their communities who do, is really valuable to creating a safe community where people can feel they can talk about their experiences,” Hoffman said.
While SACOMSS would continue to exist even if it lost its referendum, the loss of student funding would jeopardize its ability to offer services.
According to its Facebook page, the $0.75 fee goes toward supporting its phone line, drop-in services, support groups, education campaigns, and advocacy and accompaniment services.
According to Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures & Equity) Lydia White, the University also provides services to survivors of sexual assault along with SACOMSS.
“The University offers a variety of services to students in crisis, including those who have been the victims of sexual assault,” White wrote in an email to The Daily. “These services include: the McGill Health Services, McGill Mental Health Services, McGill Counseling Services, McGill Security Services and McGill Chaplaincy Services.”
As for whether it was appropriate for a sexual assault centre to be subject to referenda, White noted, “It would be inappropriate for the University [to] comment on the SSMU referendum question, or the appropriateness of the fee renewal or increase.”
When asked about the inclusion of McGill Security Services as a resource for survivors of sexual assault, SSMU VP Club & Services Allison Cooper spoke to key differences between the two organizations.
“That speaks to the expertise that students have in running these services, because SACOMSS is so powerfully different than Security Services or those other services,” she told The Daily. “It speaks to a misunderstanding of [the issue].”
For Cooper, the notion of holding referenda for student services – especially for SACOMSS – is absurd. SSMU is currently looking into placing SACOMSS under the SSMU base fee so that it could avoid facing the ballot box every three years, she said.
The SSMU base fee accounts for the operating budget of the student union. It pays for administrative fees, governance, operations, campus events, and the upkeep of the Shatner building.

Lease negotiations threaten “core mission” of SSMU
On Monday, with a little over a month before the end of SSMU Council’s term, SSMU executives released an open letter to the administration regarding Shatner building lease negotiations, now ongoing for nearly three years.
If a new lease is not signed and approved by Council by April 30 – which this year’s executives admit is a possibility – lease negotiations will be passed on to a new executive for a third consecutive time, marking the fourth year of such negotiations.
They conceded in their letter “that running such a building has a cost [and] that the University is facing tough financial decisions,” but insisted that the University acknowledge the “massive value” of student life, and its responsibility to help SSMU achieve its core mission.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson told The Daily in an email that he doesn’t “disagree with anything in [the executives’] letter,” but that “unfortunately, the University Centre is an extremely expensive building to run, and McGill can no longer afford to support it as much as it has in the past.”
“McGill, like other Quebec universities, is unexpectedly facing extreme budget compression along with uncertainty about funding for the years ahead,” he continued.
But according to SSMU VP (Clubs & Services) Allison Cooper, since the provincial budget cuts, the proposals for the lease put forth by the University have not really changed. Instead, she says, the University’s “discourse” has changed.
“It’s meant more excuses,” Cooper said.
SSMU President Josh Redel sees a certain irony in the arguments McGill has been making to the government following cuts to university budgets, especially when contrasted with its plans for SSMU.
“Yes, we’re in a financial reality on planet Earth in Canada; in Quebec that requires cuts across everything,” he told The Daily. “[But] the University’s response has been, ‘Do you realize that these cuts threaten…the core mission of this University?’”
Noting this tone, Redel said some demands made by the University would “very much threaten the core mission of SSMU.”
SSMU executives are also frustrated with how drawn-out the process has been. The uncertainty that comes with operating a building without a master lease has become increasingly problematic, they argue. It entails nine-month subleases with second-floor tenants, postponed renovations, and a hesitancy to invest in long-term projects, such as a student-run cafe.
The content of lease negotiations are confidential – an added source of frustration, according to the executives’ letter – but the main points of contention have been a rent increase, the length of the lease, and the implementation of a cost-sharing system for the building’s utilities.
Despite the terms of the lease being far from complete, Redel believes that the Society will “very likely” have to hike the non-opt-outable fee it levies from students, and SSMU has already begun to tighten its belt.
In November, SSMU released a budget with a $211,320 projected deficit, which SSMU VP (Finance and Operations) Jean-Paul Briggs attributed in large part to estimates of future shared utility costs with the University.
To reduce the deficit, SSMU abolished a series of “non-essential” expenditures, cut the position for one full-time building manager, and dipped into the Student Life Fund.

Professor’s door defaced with Zionist slogans
A panel entitled “Zionism in Academia” discussed on Tuesday that academia in North America is complicit in privileging Zionist discourses, rendering the study, analysis, and discussion of Palestine invisible. Facilitated by Michelle Hartman, professor of Arabic Literature at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill, the panel – held as part of Israeli Apartheid Week – drew a crowd of fifty people.
The panel was composed of Mohsen al Attar, a visiting professor and human rights lawyer, and Douglas Smith, a PhD student who was a member of Tadamon!, a Montreal-based collective working in solidarity with struggles for self-determination, equality, and justice in the Middle East.
“I’m not interested in the question of if Zionism holds a privileged place within the environment of North American universities, because I think that it does. I don’t think that it is a question whether or not Palestine is colonized, because I think that it is,” Hartman said in her introduction to the panel.
“In many university spaces, to say this is not accepted,” she added. Instead, Hartman continued, the panel would focus on the way in which this privilege manifests itself.
Hartman told the audience that it had been hard to find people to talk at the event, as many people that she had approached didn’t want to talk about these issues in public.
Hartman herself was on the receiving end of political smearing at McGill in February, when her office door was defaced with Zionist slogans.
In 2009, Hartman, along with 81 other Montreal CEGEP and university professors, signed an open letter published in Le Devoir in the wake of the Israeli bombing of the Islamic University of Gaza.
The letter, which was in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, called for academics around the world to support a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, and an ending of all economic relations between Canada and Israel.
“We call on the Harper government to re-evaluate its policies and to unequivocally condemn the Israeli siege and assault on Gaza, which constitute serious violations of international and humanitarian law,” the letter read. “We further demand that the Israeli government immediately cease its violence,” it said.
Hartman previously had a copy of this letter posted on her door. Sometime between the evening of February 4 and the early morning of February 5, slogans stating that Hartman was a “lover of terrorists,” and that “Israel has been a state for 1,200 years,” were scrawled across her door.
“I don’t feel personally threatened. I see this rather as a way to silence the issue. My understanding of that defacing is in the context, not necessarily particularly here, but in a broader context of silencing of people on university campuses who talk about the issue of Palestine and Palestinians,” Hartman told The Daily shortly after the incident.
The incident was downplayed by her department, and her colleagues came to a consensus not to say anything publicly about it. Hartman, however, felt that it would have been better to issue a public statement about it.
Hartman said during the panel that many of her colleagues, but particularly students, often do not feel that they are able to speak about the question of Palestine in many places within the university, especially in classrooms.
A member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR), a group that advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people, and organizer of the conference, told The Daily that at McGill, “Zionist discourse has so ingrained itself in the university, you aren’t free to use the ‘anti’ [Zionism] discourse.”
Another SPHR member told The Daily that they actively try to hide their political ideas in their classes in fear of the consequences of voicing them. “People are afraid of talking about it more than any other issue,” they said.
Adrienne Hurley, a professor in East Asian studies who also signed the open letter, asserted to The Daily that McGill had taken a particularly aggressive stance against BDS.
“You have a university that has taken a side, and this is a really clear side. You have these slogans written that echo the political sentiment of the administration, and that specificity is important, ” she said.
Hurley speculated that had a similar political action been carried out in another department, the response would have been much different.
Al Attar, however, said during the panel discussion that the issue of Zionism, which as an idea contains many contradictions, is often oversimplified, and that academics self-censor as a direct consequence of irrational fears that stem from such oversimplification.
“Zionism is not overrepresented in academia, but oversimplification gives rise to the illusion of an overrepresentation of Zionism, and this gives rise to allegations of anti-semitism,” he said.
Smith outlined various cases across Canada and the U.S. where anti-Zionist voices had been silenced.
For instance, in February, around the same time that Hartman’s door was vandalized, New York City officials threatened to cut funding to Brooklyn College because the school’s political science department sponsored an event featuring Omar Barghouti and Judith Butler, both of whom are advocates of BDS. Glenn Greenwald wrote in the Guardian that this type of action was a threat to academic freedom.
Some professors believe that what is allowed to be said on campus has changed as McGill moves toward funding more programs through donors. Abby Lippman, a professor in Epidemiology, told The Daily by phone that “the way you have to go for funding has changed a lot over the years. That has changed the sort of research people can do.”
