When Lisa Parks clicks on photos of victims of the Darfur genocide on Google Earth, she worries that Google’s corporate agenda may skew the software’s potential to revolutionize global awareness.
“Every technology has the potential to be used in really progressive ways and really negative ways, except for the nuclear bomb,” Parks said in an interview with The Daily. “I think Google Earth has the potential to provide anyone around the world with access to technology, the ability to input data and to have a voice in a global digital database.”
Parks, a visiting media and films study professor from University of California, Santa Barbara, discussed a project initiated by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, in conjunction with Google Earth Outreach program, to add a Crisis in Darfur layer to the explosively popular Google Earth software, which had been downloaded over 200 million times at the time of the layer’s inclusion.
The Darfur layer provides georeferencing information for the region with stories, photos, and data aggregated from public domain sources, such as 900-page Amnesty International reports. For example, a photo layer links users to photos of people and events taken at the exact GPS location corresponding to where their curser lies on the screen, providing geophysical and political context.
Parks hypothesized that if used righteously, the burgeoning “Google Earth Effect” could revolutionize how the global community reacts to foreign events, comparing its potential to how televised news coverage moved the public to oppose the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
“Some say that CNN has played a role in shaping foreign policy at certain historical junctures. Let’s see if, when something happens in the world, instead of turning on CNN, people go to their computers and turn on Google Earth,” she postulated. “What would happen then, is that people could see what is going on directly from the multitude of voices who experience the event, rather than from CNN’s single verdict on the event.”
Although Parks recognized the added value that Google’s service provides, she criticized how Google claims ownership over public information. She felt its assertion of intellectual property over public information and methods of controlling what information is accessible through Google Earth usurps the potential to demystify our planet’s surface in favour of corporate profit.
“The image may be blurred or undated, but the Google brand is never lost,” she said. “My concern is that because of the intellectual property laws and the dominant position of Google in the global digital economy, there is a tendency for Google to set the parameters and structures of who can participate in Google Earth as well.”
Parks is visiting McGill between March 3 and 17 as a Beaverbrook Scholar in Residence. She was invited by Media@McGill, which is an academic group comprised of the faculty of McGill’s Department of Art History and Communications Studies along with other prominent Canadian scholars of media studies. As part of her time at McGill, Parks has been giving guest lectures, meeting with students about their research, and polishing off her new works regarding Google Earth and the digital TV transition.

Green Week speaker pushes for simple living
To hear audio from the walking tour of Chinatown, go to the multimedia blog at mcgilldaily.com
The pursuit of happiness should trump our desire for consumption, argued Professor Louis Chauvin during his Wednesday talk as part of McGill Green Week, hosted by the Science Undergraduate Society.
Chauvin, a management professor and President of Le Réseau Québécois pour la simplicité volontaire, an organization which promotes simplistic consumption, pointed directly to over-consumption as endangering our planet.
“For the past 14 years, I have asked myself why we are consciously destroying the carrying capacity of the Earth and what is needed for us to stop,” Chauvin told the audience.
Chauvin’s deep interest in consumption patterns and the environment inspired him to reach out to students, and teach them about responsible consumption and sustainability.
“I am a firm believer in education as a transformative process,” Chauvin said.
According to Chauvin, our society suffers from chronic dissatisfaction – a constant need for more – which harms the environment. He noted that many believe happiness is based on how much one consumes, which leads to over-consumption and depletes the world’s resources.
“People seek the high that comes with pleasure and are convinced that this sensation is the same as happiness,” explained Chauvin. “Whether it is gambling, excessive shopping, or a meaningless relationship, we give into these addictions and rely on such external factors for happiness.”
Chauvin added that usually as one consumes more and more, one requires a larger quantity of goods to maintain the excitement. He contrasted this attitude to pure happiness, which is rewarding for longer periods of time and leaves one with a feeling of fullness, without materialistic desires.
 “The pursuit of happiness is the ultimate goal for humans,” Chauvin said. “We want to be happy and we think certain commodities will make us happy or happier. The reality is, happiness comes from inside and is detached from consumption.”
During the question and answer period, one student asked whether the current economic crisis would act as a catalyst for responsible consumption.
“There is definitely an increased interest in voluntary simplicity,” answered Chauvin. “People are unable to get solutions from economists and politicians. Instead, they are looking for alternative ways to adjust their lifestyles.”
Later, one student asked whether or not a federal framework was needed for a real reduction in consumption.
“Even with federal frameworks, many societal issues, such as racism, are still present,” Chauvin said. “What we need to do is target individuals and promote personal transformations.”
Chauvin concluded with a message of hope and called for a change in lifestyle to save what is left of the planet.
“Our planet can only handle so much and so, simplicity is inevitable,” added Chauvin. “The question is, will it be voluntary or involuntary?”

Students pass QPIRG’s 75-cent fee increase
Around 50 people attended the election results party at Gert’s Thursday evening to witness Ivan Neilson and Alexandra Brown win the only two contested SSMU executive positions – President and VP Internal.
 Neilson won SSMU presidency with 50.8 per cent of votes to 38.2 per cent for Peters, and 11 per cent spoiled. Brown and Brendan Sullivan’s race for VP Internal was closer. Brown won with 50.2 per cent.
Approximately 3631 ballots – less than one-fifth of the undergraduate population – were cast overall. Some pointed to the low voter turnout as evidence of problems with elections promotion.
SSMU claimed it worked hard to market the elections, sending regular emails reminding people to vote, but outgoing SSMU President Kay Turner suggested that the McGill community may be sinking deeper into apathy.
“This is not the first off-year,” said Turner. “We’re doing just as much as we have in the past in terms of outreach. Students are just becoming more apathetic.”
Turner hesitated to name any specific cause for student apathy, but said that shifts in student demographics could have an effect. As acceptance to McGill becomes more competitive and as the academic standards rise every year, students seem to be more focused academically and less involved in student politics.
“It was interesting that there were no student-initiated referendums,” noted Turner, “but there probably could have been better promotion.”
All SSMU and administrative referendum motions passed, though a motion to raise the QPIRG fee by 75 cents – the first increase since its inception in 1988 – was briefly contested because it was unclear if its approval rate of 48.3 per cent for and 46.4 per cent against constituted a simple majority.
The QPIRG issue was initially raised in an online Twitter conversation between McGill graduates Jake Itzkowitz, former SSMU President, Yahel Carmon, former SSMU Council Speaker, and Cole Ryan, former AUS President. Responding from New York, Washington D.C., and London respectively, the trio questioned whether the motion should be overruled by a Judicial Board ruling from 1995 which spoke to counting simple majorities.
“[We decided] that the [Judicial Board] case didn’t apply because in that question, [it had] four options, ‘Yes, no, no response, spoiled.’ It doesn’t apply,” Turner said.
In the case of QPIRG, the SSMU executives decided not to count spoiled ballots as a ‘no,’ and that while a simple majority is required for a referendum item to be approved, Clause 20.2 of the SSMU constitution does not specify “simple majority of what.”
Turner was relieved to have the issue resolved. “I think [Carmon] and [Itzkowitz] should get [lives]. You can quote me on that,” she said.
The executives also decided to interpret the SSMU constitution in favour of the QPIRG. QPIRG member Leila Pourtavaf said the 75-cent increase will finally deliver much needed funds to her organization.
 “This was the first [fee] increase in 20 years. [It should bring] $30,000, but I don’t know the exact number,” QPIRG member Leila Pourtavaf said, adding that much of it would be used to just cover QPIRG’s debt.
“We had an $18,000 defect this year. A lot of it is just going to be getting us where we need to be.”
Turner and other executives also seemed pleased that a motion to reform the General Assembly (GA) passed. The motion approved the removal of requirements for quorum, advertising, and its occurrence each term.
“I was surprised it passed despite the negative press. The Tribune thought it was quite deceptive,” commented Julia Webster, current VP Internal of SSMU.
“I think, [though,] that we all know we need GA reform because the process isn’t working. The issues keep coming back in perpetuity.”
When asked how she felt about the GA possibly only occurring once a year – or less – Webster said that a regularly scheduled session would not necessarily guarantee a successful event.
“You need an engaging issue to bring people to the GA. You’re not going to come unless something touches you personally,” she said.
Both McGill ancillary fees passed, with the Athletic fee approved 54 per cent to 45.7 per cent, and the student service fee approved 53.7 per cent to 45.5 per cent.
The McGill Undergraduate Students Fee renewal passed with 57.2 per cent to 36.6 per cent, and the Athletic Improvement fund passed 50.7 per cent to 44.3 per cent.

Campaign engages students with nearby neighbourhoods
To hear the whole Green Week talk by Professor Chauvin on consumption and the environment, go to the multimedia blog at mcgilldaily.com
McGill students got to know different parts of the Montreal community last week as part of the Office of Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE)’s “Burst Your Bubble 2009.”
Events included walking tours of Parc-Extension and Chinatown, as well as visits to Kanien’kehaka Onkwawén:na Raotitiohkwa Mohawk Language and Cultural Center in Khanawake and the Multi-Ethnic Association for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities (AMEIPH) just south of Little Italy.
“With this weather we can all get stuck in the ‘McGill bubble’: [the area bounded by] Sherbrooke, Pine, University, and Peel. It is so convenient to stay in that little square,” said Adama Kaba, SEDE’s Administrative Coordinator. “But as a university student you need concrete experiences. You can come here and get As, but if you want hands-on experience you need to get involved.”
This year’s campaign included events at Macdonald campus for the first time, and allowed McGill students to interact with Montreal’s least understood community groups. The trip to the South Shore was especially ambitious.
“People don’t go out to Khanawake,” said Kaba. “There is still a lot of prejudice attached to the First Nations people. But the visit to Khanawake was the first to be completely filled. By going out there and meeting with the organization, we hope students can learn more about the community and how they can be involved.”
SEDE is staffed by a young, diverse, and enthusiastic group that joined students on Thursday evening’s visit to the AMEIPH.
“We wanted people to learn more about the issue and about the specific challenges some disabled people are faced with,” said Kaba. “If you are an immigrant with a disability, and you don’t speak the language, how do you find the services that are available to you?”
Although Thursday’s visit showed low student turnout, Kaba insists that “Burst Your Bubble” is becoming increasingly popular.
“This year’s response has been even stronger and the numbers attending the visits have doubled. We have already received feedback about our walking tours and people really enjoyed them. We also receive feedback from community organizations that let us know when students become involved with them.”
Last year’s “Burst Your Bubble” campaign allowed McGill students to learn more about Montreal’s past with a visit to Écomusée du fier monde, a museum of industrial and working class history at the corner of Amherst and Ontario. Students also learned to appreciate Montreal’s diversity with visits to the Côte-des-Neiges Black Community Association and Kapit Bisig Filipino Community Centre.
Food appears to be a key incentive in drawing support from students, with community organizations preparing a few dishes for each visit. Students visiting the AMEIPH discussed the organization’s objectives over an elaborate, multi-ethnic meal.
As well, the cafeterias in Bishop Hall, Douglas Hall, and RVC served “finger food from different countries” on March 5.
SEDE will wrap up the multi-week campaign with a “Community Connections” dinner and film screening in partnership with Radio Canada International on March 18, although the RSVP deadline has passed.

Supporters raise $997 for fellow citizen stranded in Sudan
In an act of civil disobedience, more than 100 Canadians have pooled their money to purchase a plane ticket for Abousfian Abdelrazik, a Canadian national stranded in Sudan. Abdelrazik was arrested and allegedly tortured by Sudanese officials – before they declared him innocent – while visiting Sudan in 2003. Following this, Abdelrazik was designated as a terrorist by the United States, and labelled as an Al-Qaida operative by the United Nations.
At a press conference on Thursday, supporters of Abdelrazik released the names of 115 people who have contributed money to purchase a $997 plane ticket to bring him home to Canada.
“We are doctors. We are lawyers, teachers, artists, activists, mothers, and we have put our money together because we would like [Abdelrazik] to get home as soon as he can,” said Cory Legassic, a Montreal teacher who donated $20 for the ticket.
Under the Al-Qaida and Taliban Regulations of Canada’s United Nations Act, it is a federal offence to knowingly collect or provide funds to be used by “Usama bin Laden or his associates.”
Since Abdelrazik’s name appears on a UN blacklist – known as the UN Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee Consolidated List – he is considered one of these “associates.” Violating the act may lead to a prison sentence of up to ten years, according to Abdelrazik’s lawyer, Yavar Hameed.
“Those people who have collected the money to purchase this ticket have done so at great peril and personal risk,” Hameed said.
Human rights activist Samaa Elibyar, who contributed $20 for the ticket, said the case of Abdelrazik calls into question the basic freedoms of Canadians.
“When I see that the government is intimidating us, and saying that we will be penalized if we help Abousfian to return home, I just say no,” she stated.
The flight, on Etihad Airways – an airline based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) –  is scheduled to leave Khartoum on April 3, headed for Toronto via Abu Dhabi, UAE.
Supporters of Abdelrazik attempted to purchase him a ticket to  Canada last year, but Passport Canada said in an email to Hameed that they would not issue the travel documents until a paid ticket and itinerary were confirmed.
Foreign Affairs spokesperson Daniel Barbarie declined to comment about whether Passport Canada would issue the necessary travel documents. He also refused to confirm whether Abdelrazik’s supporters would be charged with violating the United Nations Act.
However, Barbarie did state that as a member country of the UN, Canada has “an obligation to implement the declarations of the Security Council,” including regulations that prohibit the financial support of terrorists.
These recent developments in Abdelrazik’s ordeal follow the release of classified documents suggesting that Sudanese authorities arrested him on the recommendation of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada’s intelligence agency. Hameed obtained these documents last month under the Privacy Act and the Canada Evidence Act.
He noted one document in particular, marked “secret,” and “Canadian eyes only,” with large portions blacked out. It says that “Abdelrazik was arrested on September 10, 2003 [blacked out] and recommendation by CSIS, for suspected involvement with terrorist elements.”
The document also states that Canadian officials interviewed Abdelrazik after the arrest. Hameed said that the Sudanese authorities tortured Abdelrazik before the interview.
“Our understanding of the situation…is that CSIS is the one that actually recommended Abdelrazik be detained in order to facilitate the process of having him as a captive,” Hameed said. “Opportunistically, they capitalized on that [situation] to interrogate him.”
Hameed described this practice as Canada “outsourcing torture.”
When asked about Canada’s  role in Abdelrazik’s detention, CSIS spokesperson Manon Berube said that an earlier statement, published in a Globe and Mail article on March 5, still stands: “CSIS does not and has not arranged for the arrest of Canadian citizens overseas…In the case of Mr. Abdelrazik, CSIS reiterates that it acted in accordance with the CSIS Act, law and policy.”
However, this is cold comfort for Saskatchewan farmer and former Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament David Orchard, who donated $400 towards Abdelrazik’s plane ticket.
“I’m against torture, period. And I’m against the torture of Canadians,” he said. “And I’m against my country asking foreign nations to torture people for us.”
The UN put Abdelrazik on its terrorist blacklist in 2006, following the lead of the U.S.. But in a letter dated November 2007, an assistant commissioner for the National Security Criminal Investigations wing of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that no “current or substantive evidence” supports his continued listing.

Correction appended
International tuition hikes for students in four faculties were outlined in an email sent late Wednesday to all students that linked to the financial aid web site.
Students Currently enrolled in Science, Engineering, Law, and Management can expect an eight per cent increase by Fall 2009 and a further 10 per cent increase by Summer 2010, while Arts students will face a five per cent increase by Summer 2010, the first in change in three years, according to the McGill web site. Students who enroll starting in Fall 2009, however, will experience substantially higher changes to annual tuition: Management will jump from $16,200 to $23,000; Law from $15,090 to $20,000; and Science and Engineering from $16,650 to $20,000. These one-year increases amount to 42, 33, and 20 per cent, respectively.
When asked how he felt about the announcement, future Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) president Andrew Doyle said he supported the increase, the second greatest of the announced hikes.
“As a Montrealer, I’m not that opposed to the increase [because Quebec] taxes are fairly substantial. My parents pay for international students to go to school,” he said, predicting that Quebeckers would likely face an tuition increase in future years.
SSMU VP External Devin Alfaro was not surprised by the new figures, though he did not support the hike.
“I think this is going the wrong direction for the University. It will limit access,” he said. “The University says [international tuition deregulation] means [more funding for] student aid, but will only grant a 30 per cent [aid increase].”
In the fall, the Quebec Ministry of Education allowed for the deregulation of international tuition, giving universities the freedom to set fees, and seek higher revenue margins. The McGill administration has indicated in the past that they normally increase international tuition fees by 8 per cent per annum.

49-step plan aims to increase bike and pedestrian activity in the long term
The Plateau approved a 49-step, 15-year plan last week in an effort to help the city transition from cars to more sustainable alteratives for public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians.
The Plan de Déplacement Urbain (PDU), the product of three years of research and public consultation, aims to shift often dangerous, fast-moving traffic toward arterial roads such as Parc, St. Laurent, and St. Denis so that side streets are free for slow local traffic, bikes, and pedestrians.
“The first step is to slow down the cars in the local network, slowing traffic around schools and parks, making green neighbourhoods, making large intersections…[to make a better] transport cocktail,” said Michel Labrecque, a Mile End borough Councillor, the new Société de transport de Montréal (STM) chief, and a major proponent of the Plateau PDU.
During and after the public consultation process, neighbourhood groups such as the Congestion Committee of the Maison d’Aurore, a citizens’ group, were skeptical that the plan will not effect lasting change.
“There are very few [actions in the PDU] that will lead to a reduction in circulation,” said Isabelle Gaudette, the group’s coordinator, in French. “There need to be measures that reduce the vehicular capacity on the roads at the same time that we’re adding public transportation.”
While Chris Erb, a writer from urban blog Spacing Montreal, also feels the Plateau’s plan will not suffice, he sees it as a step in the right direction.
“These local initiatives are a really good first step; they can create the necessary dialogue to create these big changes in the city.”
PDU calls first for lowered speed limits, increased radar coverage, and speed bumps on side streets in the Plateau. Later, more substantial changes will take place, such as widened sidewalks, more bike and bus lanes, and the replacement of car traffic with pedestrian walkways.
“We have established the first PDU with a 15-year scope, because we don’t have the money,” Labrecque said. “It is not sustainable to tear up and rebuild the streets and sidewalks; it will be an ongoing process.”
During the two-year data collection phase of the plan, researchers studied how people moved within the Plateau. The research revealed that over 60 per cent of Plateau dwellers used active or mass transit.
“We are implementing the PDU to build on what we’ve got – to build on the trends around sustainable development and sustainable transit in the Plateau,” said Labrecque.
Yet just 12 days ago, Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay announced that the city is cutting $40-million from the STM, a move that has been heavily criticized. Labrecque, who now presides over the STM, stressed the City was still able to maintain STM fares and service at current levels despite the cuts.
Labrecque and a panel of experts are meeting weekly to look for ways to save money and to monitor ridership.
“Mass transit at this moment is more important than ever,” said Labrecque. “If people lose their jobs, if petrol costs go up, we need to be there full throttle.”
The new Montreal master transport plan calls for a PDU to be developed in every borough of Montreal, but the Plateau is the first to develop a PDU.
Erb said that alone, the Plateau’s plan, “will not encourage that many people to get out of their cars. It will just move the traffic out of the Plateau. There has been a push to get more people into transit, more buses in rush hour.
“The current administration in the Plateau seems pretty progressive,” Erb said. “But you have different levels of government fighting each other for infrastructure projects, which ultimately causes nothing to get done. You need to take political risks to get people out of cars.”
