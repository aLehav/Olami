U4 Arts student Ethan Feldman given disciplinary notice. 
On February 22, U4 Arts student Ethan Feldman was given disciplinary notice regarding an incident on February 15 in the Leacock building. A McGill Senate meeting took place in Leacock 232 on February 15, outside of which some students – including Feldman – were present.
The notice alleges that Feldman violated section 8b of the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures, which states that no student shall “knowingly create a condition which unnecessarily endangers or threatens or undermines the health, safety, well-being, or dignity of another person or persons, threatens to cause humiliation or threatens the damage or destruction of property.”
Feldman said that since the disciplinary notice did not specify, he could not be sure what incident it refers to.
Feldman explained that he talked to a security guard about entry to Senate – which was a limited-access meeting, and was livestreamed in the Redpath Museum – and later handed out copies of the Quebec Private Security Act in the Leacock building. He said that he later went to the Redpath Museum to watch the livestream.
An initial meeting with Associate Dean of Students Linda Starkey took place on Wednesday, one week after the notice was delivered.
Associate Professor of Philosophy Alison Laywine and Philosophy Professor Hasana Sharp accompanied Feldman to his meeting with Starkey. Laywine and Sharp were not allowed to sit in on the meeting.
Starkey allowed the two professors to meet with herself and Feldman once the initial meeting was complete.
Another meeting has been scheduled for March 7 to exchange evidence between both parties. However, Feldman explained that “I don’t know what the case is, so I don’t know what evidence I could provide.”
“I was surprised at the opacity,” Laywine told The Daily after the meeting. “It strikes me that that’s a problem with the way the disciplinary process is set up.”
The Code of Student Conduct is currently under revision, a point that Feldman said Starkey mentioned during their meeting.
Feldman’s notice came on the same day that other McGill students received notice of disciplinary action for the January 31 interruption of a Board of Governors meeting.
He said that he did not formally identify himself to University authorities in the Leacock building, but that security personnel are familiar with him. Feldman was a fifth floor occupier on November 10, and a sixth floor occupier during #6party.

Tuition protests continue at McGill
At around 11 a.m. yesterday morning, students from McGill and other universities and CEGEPs in and around Montreal gathered in front of the Shatner Building to participate in a demonstration in support of the unlimited general student strike in Quebec.
The strike aims to place economic pressure on the Quebec government, in order to force it to reverse its decision to raise tuition hikes by $325 per year over the next five years.
The demonstration moved through campus, making its way through the Leacock Building and McLennan Library, and pausing briefly at the Y-intersection. After about an hour, a smaller group of students moved off McGill campus, making their way to Université de Québec à Montréal (UQAM).
According to Kevin Paul, a U3 Cultural Studies student and member of the AUS Mobilization Committee, the event was organized by a group of independent students from McGill.
“I’m in my last year,” Paul said. “I won’t be directly financially affected. However, I want to live in a society that values education not as a commodity but as a fundamental right.”
Paul explained that he was pleased with the turnout from other Montreal schools.
“There are students that are on strike at other universities and CEGEP campuses coming to McGill. It’s a powerful show of solidarity as a strike vote approaches at McGill,” he said.
Cedric Lejeune, a first year Biology student at UQAM, spoke on behalf of a group of UQAM Science students who participated in the demonstration.
“When we hear that there is an organized protest, we try to give our support,” he said. “Tomorrow [March 1], we are going to Quebec City. There is a huge protest there. We hope [that there will be] over 10,000 people. We hope 100 Science students will be going tomorrow. From UQAM, there will be a lot.”
He said that if the tuition rates are to increase, it will affect many students at UQAM. “We will all need to work more and longer. We will have less time to study and less time to sleep. If we have to work more, it’s more stressful.”
Carolamn Beigeven, a student of the CEGEP du Vieux Montréal, explained that this was the first time she attended a tuition hike-related demonstration. If the government goes through with the increase, she said, she will not be able to attend a Quebec university.
Melanie Le Berre, a U2 Physical Therapy student at McGill who participated in the demonstration, shared similar sentiments. “I feel enraged for people who won’t have access. I feel we are collectively concerned and responsible for the others. I don’t feel people are concerned [at McGill], and I think it’s sad… This protest is very small.”
Not all students are against tuition hikes, however. Rasul Abdoullakhi, a U2 Chemical Engineering student from Montreal, was standing outside of the McConnell Engineering building, during the demonstration.
“There’s always going to be hikes,” he explained. “There’s always going to be inflation. I saw at least 10 people there wearing $500 to $700 jackets. If you can cut on that and spend that money for education instead of walking around yelling ridiculous slogans, you could get a decent education. It’s something that you have to accept.”
“I think it’s a bit ridiculous,” he added.
As the demonstration moved through McLennan, they were joined by a number of students and McGill workers. Nancy Crowe, a library assistant at McLennan Library and a MUNACA worker, clapped along in support as the students chanted.
“University needs to be accessible,” she explained. “I don’t want to speak for all of us, but a lot of us are sympathetic to this cause.”
“I’m from Quebec, and I went to university on loans and bursaries, so I know what it’s like,” she added.
With many universities and CEGEPs already on strike, the Arts Undergraduate Society and Science Undergraduate Society will vote on joining the strike in separate General Assemblies in March.

Science Mobilization Committee worried about losing quorum
Last Monday, February 27, the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) announced that its General Assembly (GA) would be held on Friday, March 2 at 5 p.m., rather than on its original date of February 29.
The announcement was made over the weekly listserv email that SUS VP Communications, Maria Zamfir, sends to Science students.
Askshay Rajaram, SUS president, said in an email to The Daily that midterm season was responsible for the lack of room availability.
The room shortage was also the reason that SUS delayed the official announcement of the GA to February 13, even though it had decided on an original date of February 2.
Because they delayed the official announcement, students had four days to submit motions before the deadline, which, according to SUS bylaws, is two weeks before the actual GA.
Rajaram said, “The time between February 2 and February 13 was spent trying to find a room for the GA, which was exceedingly difficult given that the campus is in the middle of midterms and all available rooms have been taken for this purpose.”
It has been decided that the final location will be in the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building.
Carl Dion Laplante, a U1 Biology student and member of the Science Mobilization Committee, expressed concern about the location and new date.
In an email to Rajaram, he wrote, “Unless the intent is to lose quorum or not reach it at all, a Friday night is not the right moment for a GA.”
At least 125 Science students are required to be at the GA to maintain quorum.
Noemi Stern, a U1 Cognitive Science student and a member of the Committee, shared similar worries.
“On Fridays, people usually have other plans. Wednesday would [have been] a good day. We would have [had] two days in advance to mobilize people,” Stern said.
There has also been a lack of advertising for the GA. According to Rajaram, this was because the SUS executive wanted to “make sure that only one set of correct dates and times was sent out.”
Even though the GA is scheduled, Laplante still believes that the SUS is falling behind the rest of the Quebec student movement. “Ideally we should have started mobilizing for the strike,” he said.
“McGill [students] haven’t been having a lot of mobilizations, petitions, or strikes. If we wanted to have a strike, we [would] have [had] to start mobilizing early for the strike,” he continued.
The Science Mobilization Committee started to take action in January, when they submitted a petition to call for a Special GA to discuss and mobilize around tuition hikes and accessible education. This petition was approved by the SUS on January 24.
Two motions will be voted on at the GA. The first is a motion regarding accessibility, which calls for the SUS to adopt a policy in favor of accessible education and against tuition hikes, with the long-term goal of obtaining free education for all students. The second motion is regarding the recognition of an SUS Strike Committee.

No termination clause in contract, legal action planned
Francis (Danji) Buck-Moore, a Solin Hall floor fellow, had his position terminated on Wednesday. His dismissal was due to participation in the occupation of the office of Morton Mendelson, deputy provost (Student Life and Learning), in the James Administration building for five days in February.
Buck-Moore, a U3 student who has been a floor fellow for two years, was informed in a meeting with Michael Porritt, executive director of McGill Residences and Student Housing, that his position – and the benefits package that accompanies it – was “terminated, effective immediately.”
Porritt refused to comment on Buck-Moore’s dismissal because it was a personnel matter.
A second Solin floor fellow, who wished to remain anonymous, also occupied the sixth floor of the James building. The floor fellow had a meeting scheduled for Wednesday with Porritt, however, he was unable to attend. At press time the floor fellow still retained his position. The meeting has been rescheduled for this morning.
Both floor fellows were told in separate meetings with Porritt on February 14 that their positions as floor fellows were at risk.
The dismissals come after a consultation process with McGill’s residence community, which began on February 16.
Porritt sent an email to all residence councils and floor fellows calling for individuals to “speak now or forever hold your peace” in respect to “the current issue regarding our floor fellow team and the residence community related to the James occupation.” The email was also shared with all residents on the two fellows’ floors.
During and after Porritt’s consultation process, two petitions calling for Porritt to drop proceedings against the floor fellows were prepared. Members of the McGill community, including 11 professors, signed the first petition. The second peition, presented to Porritt today, has signatures from 61 floor fellows, dons, and MORE fellows.
Prior to his dismissal, Buck-Moore was presented with a letter outlining his options. The first mandated that he turn in his keys and remove his belongings from his Solin Hall apartment before Friday. It also barred him from entering any McGill residence for the remainder of the academic year, but ensured him a place at Greenbriar Apartments at regular rental rates.
The second option would allow him to stay in Solin Hall for the remainder of the year, but require him to pay regular rental fees, and would strip him of his duties and responsibilities as a floor fellow. Although Buck-Moore is required to answer by Thursday, he explained that he plans to dispute the legality of the action.
In an interview with The Daily prior to his dismissal, Buck-Moore said he had consulted with Legal Aid. “It’s a little bit unclear as to what labour codes or standards we fall under or into, given our nebulous condition as student academic staff,” he said, adding that he will likely file for wrongful dismissal. “We’re definitely employees though, that’s for sure.”
There is no official termination clause in floor fellows’ contracts with Residence Life. Guidelines within the contract under the “Responsibilities of Floor Fellows, Dons, and MORE Fellows” include being a “positive role model,” and also require that floor fellows, who are not paid for their work but receive free room and board, are “vigilant at all times of how their behavior…might affect their position and reflect on the residence community.”
Another Solin floor fellow, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed concern in an interview with The Daily that, “If you can be fired by the discretion of whoever is in power, then there needs to be a clear and defined set what you can and cannot do because, as it stands, the contract is incredibly vague.”
“If I were to reapply this year, I would feel very differently about what it means to be a floor fellow,” the floor fellow continued.
Buck-Moore described the action as “completely discretionary,” adding that  “Porritt’s boss is Morton Mendelson, and Michael Porritt is my boss. The other people that were on the sixth floor don’t have that direct employment connection [to the administration]… It’s easier for him to get to me.”
One of the initial demands made by students who occupied the sixth floor was for Mendelson to resign. Occupiers presented the action as Mendelson’s “surprise resignation party.”
In an email to all McGill students and staff on February 9, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa stated, “Complaints will be lodged against the protestors under the Student Code of Conduct.” Disciplinary procedures within the University are confidential at the discretion of the individual charged.
