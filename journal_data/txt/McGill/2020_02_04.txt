Hosted by SSMU Indigenous Affairs and the Indigenous Student Alliance, McGill students gathered at the Y-intersection on Friday, January 11 to stand in solidarity with the Unist’ot’en Camps and all five Hereditary Chiefs from the Wet’suwet’en clans.
From the event description:
“We recognize and stand witness to the unlawful incursion of Coastal GasLink fracked gas pipeline across northern British Columbia. Under ‘Anuch niwh’it’en (Wet’suwet’en law) the five clans have unanimously opposed all pipeline proposals and have not given consent to Coastal GasLink to continue working on Wet’suwet’en lands.”
