McGill students talk to The Daily about their experiences
“When I skipped a [chemistry] midterm to sit alone in the library, I knew I needed help,” Dylan*, then a U0 Science student, told The Daily. He never thought that he would be affected by anxiety; he was in many ways a typical, easy-going undergraduate student. “I had a great time at Frosh, I was making lots of new friends, and was generally taking it slow for the first part of the semester.”
Then, around his first midterms, panic set in.
“At first, I thought it was just normal stress. Everyone goes through crunch time in October. Then, it started to get worse; I skipped classes because I felt unprepared and stressed out. At a certain point, I just couldn’t leave my room anymore.”
Dylan’s story is one of many at McGill. Mental Health Services saw an estimated 20,000 visits in the 2010-11 school year, double the figure seen five years prior.
Nina*, an Arts student who met with a counsellor in her second semester, also found the transition to McGill very trying.
“McGill was scary […] I did really poorly in my first semester, and felt pretty lost,” she said. In addition, she was coping with family mental health issues and the stress of working part-time. By the time her second semester began, Nina was suffering from depression.
A recurring theme in conversations about mental health at McGill is the role of academic stress in triggering or exacerbating mental health issues. Students who spoke with The Daily pointed to grade deflation and adjustment to life in a new city as triggering mental health issues.
This issue is gaining a great deal of attention nationwide. According to The Globe and Mail, after having experienced a rash of student deaths in the last few years, Queen’s University established a committee in 2012 to reduce the impact of mental health issues at the university. The committee produced a report outlining 116 recommendations for change, ranging from proactive intervention, to the rescheduling of exams, to the extension of the semester.
According to Katrina Bartellas, co-founder of the McGill chapter of Unleash the Noise, a peer support group run as a supplement to campus mental health services, student mental health issues often go unaddressed until they reach a breaking point.
“We are not helping ourselves by neglecting our mental health until it reaches a critical point,” she told The Daily by email. “Instead, we need to be mindful of our mental health on a continual basis, especially as students.”
Nina, for example, only sought help at the suggestion of a professor at the end of her first year. By this point, she had already reached a low point and was considering dropping out.
Like many others, Nina encountered difficulties in relating her experience to her peers. “McGill creates a very competitive atmosphere that’s conducive to harsh judgment between peers […] some people have serious difficulties that require specific support.”
Bartellas spoke to the stigmatization of mental health issues by pointing to the “Bridge the Gap” speaker series run by Unleash the Noise.
“The mandate of the speaker series is to bridge the gap in understanding between McGill students, faculty, and staff with either direct or indirect lived experience[s] with mental illness and those without,” she said. “Simply put, individuals at McGill with mental illness, or with a friend or family member with mental illness, share their personal story with others to decrease stigmatized attitudes on campus.”
The Queen’s University report ultimately recommended greater administrative and academic flexibility, comprehensive stress-management strategies, and longer semesters with less dense coursework to help prevent many students from experiencing severe anxiety and depression.
This year at McGill has seen various initiatives at McGill to address mental health. The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)has formed an ad-hoc mental health committee, and the University’s joint Senate-Board of Governors meeting this year featured a theme on mental health. Additionally, according to information provided by McGill’s Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet, wait lists at Mental Health Services have gone down this term from 270 to 56 people.
According to Bartellas, a new mental health policy created under the SSMU ad-hoc committee will soon be presented to Council.
As for Dylan, his outcome was fortunate; not wanting to wait for help from McGill, he decided to see a private therapist. “It’s expensive, yeah, but I was facing academic probation and I knew that I couldn’t go on suffering.” With cognitive behavioural therapy and stress management planning, in addition to informing and working with professors, he learned to manage his anxiety and organize his thoughts positively.
“I know there [are] lots of people who are nervous to get psychological help; I was one of them. Just go for it, and don’t worry about others; your health matters first.”

Demonstrators demand government action, increased awareness
On February 14, over 500 people gathered in the snow at Place Émilie-Gamelin for the annual March for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, organized by the Missing Justice Collective. According to organizers’ estimates, it was the biggest march since the collective began organizing it in Montreal in 2010.
The first March for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women took place in Vancouver in 1991 after the murder of a First Nations woman. In an interview with The Daily, Bianca Mugyenyi, the Programming and Campaigns Coordinator at the Centre for Gender Advocacy, explained the continuing legacy of the event.
“These marches are meant to symbolize a spirit of women’s resistance, [of] women standing up for themselves – specifically with the goal of being free of violence regardless of race or gender,” said Mugyenyi. “We are trying to generate a public presence, we are trying to generate solidarity, and we want to see less violence in the future.”
According to a 2010 report from the Native Women’s Association’s Sisters in Spirit (SIS) initiative, 582 Indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered, with roughly 75 per cent of those cases estimated to have occurred from the 1990s onward.
Later in 2010, SIS lost its federal funding and was unable to continue its research; however, a similar project was conducted by Maryanne Pearce at the University of Ottawa in 2013. Pearce’s research led to a database that has recorded 3,329 missing and murdered Canadian women, 824 of whom are Indigenous.
This year’s march began with an opening prayer, music from the Buffalo Hat Singers, and motivational words from a few speakers. Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, a member of the Collective, shared with the crowd some of the reasons why she participates in the march.
“I march because we lose track of what is urgent and what is not. Our sense of collective urgency is skewed and stunted. Some would have us believe that violence against women is no longer urgent in these parts, or that it is never urgent when measured against more pressing ‘life and death’ issues like war or climate change. I wish that they understood that dealing with any issue in a vacuum makes no sense at all, and will only create more work for all of us.”
“These marches are meant to symbolize a spirit of women’s resistance, [of] women standing up for themselves – specifically with the goal of being free of violence regardless of race or gender.”
From 6:45 to 8 p.m., the hundreds of protesters took to the streets of downtown Montreal with chants, banners, and flyers. Attendees participated in the march for a variety of reasons. Stephanie Guico of the Montreal organization Head & Hands felt both personal and professional connections to the event.
“[At Head & Hands] we work partly with First Nations populations and First Nations women offering social legal and medical services,” Guico told The Daily. “Also on a personal level, my experience as a racialized minority in Montreal, and to a certain extent having known people who have been marginalized […] I feel a particular affinity with this cause.”
Some demonstrators, like Hannah Harris-Sutro, sought to show solidarity with the cause from other communities.
“I’m here this year, and especially tonight, because there was a demonstration scheduled in the Village by another collective [tonight],” Harris-Sutro told The Daily. “It felt really important to be here as a queer presence […] because I thought that it was just completely inappropriate [for the other demonstration] to be competing with this march.”
The demonstration ended at Place des Arts with more music from the Buffalo Hat Singers, some closing words, and hot chocolate for the frozen protesters.
Addressing the demonstrators prior to the march, Rolbin-Ghanie encouraged people to think critically and empathetically in the face of social issues. “We need to ask ourselves continually and repeatedly, ‘Am I motivated by love or by fear?’ and then make adjustments accordingly.”

University and food service provider blame low demand
Correction appended February 18, 2014.
Practicing Muslim students continue to face limited availability of halal foods at McGill, and the situation remains largely unchanged since The Daily last reported on the issue in 2008.
Halal meat, which must come from an animal raised and slaughtered according to Islamic rules, is available at several McGill dining halls, including Bishop Mountain Hall, New Residence Hall (NRH), and Carrefour Sherbrooke. Additionally, vegetarian meals are also suitable for those who eat halal.
However, the lack of variety in the options offered is unsatisfactory to some students. “The only halal food [in NRH] was beef and chicken burgers,” said Umar Kahn, student and member of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Policy Advocacy Resource Committee. “After a while, you can’t keep eating the same thing.”
Others pointed to the prohibitive cost of the halal options. “New Rez is ridiculously expensive,” said Tanbin Rafee, student and member of the Muslim Students’ Association (MSA) and Daily staff member. “Food is expensive on its own, and halal options [are] even more [expensive].”
On campus, halal options are even more scarce. “There’s none that I know of in terms of meat,” said Karim El-Baba, a U1 Engineering student.
Instead, Muslim students turn to off-campus locations for halal food. “I don’t think there’s [many halal options] around. I have to eat at Arabic or Egyptian restaurants,” said Rafee.
“Sometimes, we have to go to Concordia to get food,” added Kahn.
The food service provider Aramark, which manages many food outlets on McGill’s campus, justified the lack of availability by citing low demand. “Halal being for a very small minority of students, they are not regular items. We accommodate them on a case-by-case [basis]. If we supply the cafeteria with halal food and nobody buys it, then we make a loss,” said Marketing and Nutrition Counselor for Student Housing and Hospitality Services Monique Lauzon.
MSA President Nazem Husseini suggested that the demand is in fact substantial. “The demand is pretty high among Muslim students,” Husseini wrote in an email to The Daily. “If the Food and Dining services [show] that they are willing to offer halal meals, they will find a huge number of Muslim customers to add to their regular customers.”
Lauzon placed the onus on students to make sure that their needs are met. “They would have to manifest an interest. We haven’t received [much] communication from Muslim students. If we suddenly had lots of interest in halal food, we would adjust,” she said.
Rafee spoke to the accessibility problems posed by this request-based approach. “Not everyone is confident enough to ask in front of people,” he said.
Husseini echoed that sentiment, blaming the administration for its lack of cooperation. “Most just opt for the vegetarian meals or get halal meals from food outlets off campus […] as they don’t expect the University will address their demands for halal meals,” he wrote. “McGill’s administration has not been very cooperative in accommodating religious needs on campus, and this definitely discourages students from taking initiative.”
According to SSMU VP Clubs and Services Stefan Fong, the SSMU building stands as an exception and provides a greater variety of options suitable for Muslim students than other outlets on campus.
“There are many more available options in the SSMU building than I would expect there to be on campus, namely all of the vegetarian and vegan options we have,” he wrote in an email to The Daily.
“While they may not include meat, Midnight Kitchen offers free vegan lunches and The Nest provides more vegetarian options than I, as a vegetarian, have seen at any other restaurant on campus.”
A previous version of this article incorrectly labelled Monique Lauzon as an Aramark representative; in fact, she is the Marketing and Nutrition Counselor for Student Housing and Hospitality Services. The Daily regrets the error.

Demonstrators clash about increased police presence
Friday saw two protests in Montreal’s Gay Village, one calling for increased police presence in the neighbourhood, and a counter-protest of around 100 people opposing the calls for more police. The call for an increased police presence stems from an alleged spate of violent attacks in the Village, the most recent dating back to December 12.
The march and rally in favour of an increase in police presence was organized by a group called the Collectif Carré Rose Montreal (CCRM). According to the CCRM’s French-language Facebook page, the group, which uses the pink square as a symbol, aims to fight homophobia and “promote security in the Village by using preventative and positive actions.”
Not everyone agrees with the goals of the CCRM. Mona Luxion, one of the organizers of the counter-protest and a former Daily columnist, asserted that police do not make a neighbourhood safe for everyone.
“When you look at the role of the police, they’re not simply a neutral body that exists to protect everyone,” Luxion said. “They serve specific interests – namely, protecting private property and the interests of the capitalist [and] colonial state.”
The founder of the CCRM, Louis-Alain Robitaille, works as a real estate agent in the Village and around the city. According to Luxion, the commercial interests of Robitaille, along with other CCRM members, are apparent in the CCRM’s goal to make the neighbourhood safer for “businesses, customers of all the area’s businesses, workers in the area, tourists, et cetera.”
Robitaille could not be contacted for an interview by press time.
The counter-protesters took to the streets at around 5:45 p.m. and were met with immediate police resistance. The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) declared the protest illegal within minutes of demonstrators moving from the sidewalk to the street. After an altercation with an officer, where one protester was pushed to the ground, the group blocked the intersection at Ste. Catherine, just steps from the CCRM rally.
Separated by a police line, the majority of the demonstrators eventually dispersed to join the March for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women down the street at Place Émelie-Gamelin.
Yet some protesters remained. Approximately 300 people supporting the CCRM began their march at around 6:45 p.m. and tensions rose between the pink square wearers and the Pink Bloc, an anti-capitalist queer activist group. Throughout the CCRM rally and march, the Pink Bloc often broke out into song and dance, and denounced the CCRM as a ‘social cleansing’ project.
Pink Bloc members pointed to the open invitation extended to Denis Coderre, Montreal’s mayor, as an illustration of the alleged gentrifying and social cleansing goals of the CCRM.
During the march, one Pink Bloc member argued with a CCRM member about the role of the police moving forward. The CCRM member denounced the number of social service organizations in the neighbourhood, saying that they “attract homeless people” and other people that make the neighbourhood feel “less safe,” and suggested that the police were needed to fix the problem.
The Pink Bloc member disagreed, and said, “Police can never be part of the solution because they are part of the problem.”
Luxion agreed with the sentiment, and stressed, “We have to ask who is made safer by police presence and at whose expense.”
The CCRM march dispersed at around 7 p.m..

Educational Community Living Environment looks forward to new house
The McGill student-run initiative Educational Community Living Environment (ECOLE) has obtained the necessary funding to officially launch for its pilot year in September 2014. The ECOLE house will be located at 3559 University, across the street from McGill’s School of Environment, and will take the place of a current MORE residence house.
“[It was a] very long process to put together all of the different pieces […and] find a physical house within residences, reach out to the Milton-Parc community, put together a student working group that’s empowered to take ownership [among other things],” Lily Schwarzbaum, one of the coordinators of ECOLE, told The Daily.
The house is designed to be a sustainable living environment and community centre for McGill students and the surrounding Milton-Parc community. The top floor of the house will be home to the facilitators of the project, with the ground floor and basement serving as public space for use by anyone in the community.
Currently, ECOLE is still in search of eight to twelve facilitators who will live on the top floor and aim to live sustainably. The facilitators will simultaneously conduct independent studies on a component of their sustainable lifestyle.
“We are looking for diversity [of facilitators] in terms of various backgrounds and all types of social group memberships, but also diversity in terms of academic majors and research interests,” Courtney Ayukawa, head project coordinator and U3 student in Sustainability, Science and Society, said in an interview with The Daily.
“We don’t want a house full of environmental students or students in Environment and Geography […] We want a student in Engineering looking at the carbon footprint of the house, and maybe one student in Environment looking into urban agriculture, and one student in Management looking at conflict resolution and how that could be applied to businesses, or a Philosophy major looking into the dualism of man and nature and how that plays out in the house,” said Ayukawa.
Ayukawa and Schwarzbaum plan to have the facilitators hired by reading week. They also intend to hire two summer interns and a summer project coordinator in the coming month.
After hiring the full staff, the coordinators intend on brainstorming ways to create house rules together. Approaches include deciding, “What conflict resolution techniques will facilitators and coordinators be doing?” Ayukawa said.
The idea for the ECOLE project began approximately three years ago. The project has encountered financial hurdles since its initiation. When members of the sustainable Greenhaus classroom, sponsored by an Alternative University Project (AltU) comprised of McGill and Concordia students, applied to the McGill Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) in the summer of 2012 for ECOLE sponsorship, they were turned down. The students applied for a second time later that year to see their application rejected again.
When the ECOLE project later received Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) support in Fall 2012, members began to create partnerships with other groups at McGill, deliver presentations, and eventually hire coordinators in the spring of 2013 who were previously uninvolved with the initiative. After learning of ECOLE’s mission, the coordinators put together a timeline for the establishment of an ECOLE space to ensure that it would be adequately funded and prepared by Fall 2014.
“Where we are right now is that we’ve received our funding from the SPF, which is so incredibly exciting because [now that] we have the funding, the project is definitely going to launch in September 2014,” said Ayukawa.
Living costs for ECOLE facilitators will also be partially subsidized. Although rent for the current MORE house is approximately $1,000 per person, rent stipends bring individual rents to around $400 per month, according to Ayukawa.
The coordinators are optimistic about the public spaces of the house. “The common spaces will have things like a couch, and a projector […] and a whiteboard if people wanted to have meetings there,” Ayukawa said.
“We want ECOLE to last for many years. The two main goals are to be a model for sustainable living, and for ECOLE to serve as a catalyst for a surviving connected community for sustainability that integrates community outreach, sustainable living, and equity into the very definition of what sustainable living at McGill is,” said Schwarzbaum.
The deadline to apply for the position of ECOLE facilitator is midnight on February 19.

Organizers attempt to address criticism of last year’s campaign
This past week marked McGill’s second “Who Needs Feminism?” campaign, a movement initially created in 2012 by 16 women at Duke University in North Carolina. According to the “Who Needs Feminism?” website, the goal of the campaign is to “challenge existing stereotypes surrounding feminists and assert the importance of feminism today.”
A key component of the campaign at McGill, both this year and last year, has been the creation of a Tumblr page consisting of photos taken by students expressing what feminism means to them. Elizabeth Groeneveld, the Faculty Chair of the Women’s Studies Program at McGill, highlighted the merits of this aspect of the campaign, and addressed some of the criticism it has received.
“I think that the format is really accessible. Some people have criticized the campaign for just being about making little blurbs about feminism, but I think that if you’re new to feminism it feels really accessible as a campaign, and if you’re not new to feminism it can maybe spark a moment of reflection on how you would want to sum up what feminism means to you,” she said.
Groeneveld stated that another criticism of the campaign has been that it portrays feminism as individualistic, rather than as a movement about collective change and social justice.
Eden Haber, the Community Engagement Facilitator for Residence Life, questioned the legitimacy of this complaint. “First of all, I would sort of question how problematic the individualization even is. I think that finding a personal connection to feminism through understanding how it can affect one’s own life can really help a person to contextualize him or herself within the feminist movement.”
“But I think that my overall response to the individualization of feminism is that if you look at the individual photos you might get that impression, but if you look at them as a collection they actually do present very much a holistic view,” Haber continued.
Nevertheless, organizers of the campaign at McGill this year tried to make changes based on the feedback that was received last year. “One of the other main criticisms with the campaign is that people don’t think very critically or engage critically with feminism which is something that I agree with,” Haber explained.
As a result, in an effort to encourage deeper analysis and critical engagement, this year’s campaign included an Anti-Oppression and Feminism workshop, a Faculty in Rez discussion about feminism held by Groeneveld, and a discussion on feminism in the media focusing on Beyoncé and her new visual album.
Commenting on these additions to the campaign, Haber voiced her belief that the workshops did have a beneficial impact. “I think that people who did a picture after attending an event tended to be more in that headspace of engaging critically and that produced a pretty interesting result,” she stated.
The last criticism which Haber claimed campaign organizers tried to address this year was the potential exclusivity of the phrase “I need feminism.” In order to combat it, the campaign “tried to really open up the statement, and so if you look online a lot of people wrote, ‘I support feminism’ or ‘I need womanism’ or ‘I am pro-feminist,’” Haber stated. “We thought that that would make it more inclusive and help the campaign reflect a greater breadth of voices.”
As organizers wait to receive feedback on this year’s campaign, Haber said that she is generally satisfied with its results at McGill. “I think it’s important to recognize everyone [has] to start somewhere. I’m happy with the campaign. Even if the campaign creates a dialogue about what’s wrong with it, I will still be happy.”
