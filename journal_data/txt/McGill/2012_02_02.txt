Conference coincides with McGill email warning of potential demonstrations on campus 
Last Tuesday, the Post Graduate Students’ Society of McGill (PGSS) announced its 2012 campaign to fight against the $1,625 tuition fee hike planned over the next five years.
The press conference – hosted by PGSS VP External Mariève Isabel and attended by eight people, most of whom were student journalists – took place on the same day that VP (Finance and Administration) Michael Di Grappa warned, in an email to all staff and students the day before, that tuition demonstrations could intrude on campus.
Di Grappa’s email specifically referred to demonstrations supposedly planned by the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ)  and the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ) .
The email stated: “We are writing today to alert you to the possibility – however remote – of some turmoil on our downtown campus tomorrow.”
At the press conference, Isabel expressed concern that the message was directed toward  PGSS, explaining that, as far as she knew, the press conference was the only event connected to FEUQ or FECQ that had been planned on campus for Tuesday.
According to Isabel, PGSS is the only McGill student organization that works closely with FEUQ. She added that FEUQ does not come onto campus for events or demonstrations.
“[McGill administrators are] not defending this email,” said Isabel in an email to The Daily. “Rather, they apologized for singling out FEUQ. They mentioned that they didn’t mean to damage anyone’s image.”
According to Di Grappa, the email “was not about anything specific, although there were examples given of some events. We just were aware of a number of activities that were happening in the run-up to the call for the general strike in March, and in light of circumstances in the past, we thought it was important to inform members of the community about this.”
Tuition hike demonstrations have twice this year spilled onto campus: on October 4 and  November 10.
When asked whether the University will continue to send out similar emails regarding demonstrations on and around campus, Di Grappa said, “We’ll think about it on a case-by-case basis, depending on what’s being planned.”
According to FEUQ President Martine Desjardins, the group had nothing planned for Tuesday, although some of its member associations had independent plans for “symbolic action.” Among these was a delivery of 1,625 letters to the Minister of Education by Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) students.
Desjardins confirmed that the only event planned at McGill was the PGSS press conference.
Referring to the email, she said, “We’re not that kind of association. It’s great visibility for us, but it’s not what we’re planning. We reserve the right to make the government back down, but it’s very pacific demonstrations and symbolic actions.”
This is not the first time McGill has been criticized for mass emails sent to staff and students.
“During the MUNACA strike, there were a lot of messages that were sent that were criticized for being biased,” said Isabel. However, she pointed out that this is the first time she has seen a specific student group targeted.
At the press conference, Isabel laid out the PGSS’ plans for the winter semester. “We will continue to campaign against the raise in tuition fees – we are more convinced than ever that it is necessary.”
The campaign includes a conference in March about alternatives to raising tuition fees, and ongoing research on the effects of ancillary fees on students.
PGSS is also planning on participating in the March 22 one-day student strike, a demonstration Isabel hoped will be “peaceful and festive, and humongous.”

Environmentalists skeptical of University of Calgary professors’ research
University of Calgary (UC) professors Howard Ceri and Raymond Turner have been working to develop a biofilm that will be able to absorb much of the toxic metal residue associated with tar sands’ tailing ponds, which store contaminated water from processing oil.
Turner, a biochemistry professor, explained that the technological discovery began as a side project, when the team decided to start researching biofilms naturally occurring in the tailings ponds ecosystem.
“What’s novel about what we’re doing,” Turner said, “is that we are growing these communities as biofilms.”
When explaining the benefit of using biofilms, Turner likens the communities to that of a city.
“We don’t have everyone in a city, every single organism, every human in the city, can do every job.  We have the specialist; we have the plumber; we have the accountant; we have all these specialty organisms within a city community. Every individual species within the biofilm will only be able to degrade a certain amount of one kind of compound,” said Turner.
“As a community, in the biofilm, they are close together like we are in a city,” Turner added. “They can work together to get things done.”
Currently, remediation of tailings ponds occurs in a multi-step process.
“The tailings ponds have a lot of microbial activity. The problem is that, there would be metal contamination such that, with that metabolism, [degradation] happens quite slowly. If you can isolate the community organisms that can process all the organic pollutants as well as deal with the heavy metal components, you’d have a super community, if you will,” Turner explained.
This led Turner to collaborate with Ceri, who has spent much of his career looking at metal tolerance comparison between bacteria growing in a biofilm versus other forms of growth. Together they are trying to develop seed organism inoculants to treat the water layer that could be integrated with traditional water treatment.
The goal, Turner said, is “to create metal resistant bacteria that would lead to better organic, and maybe metal remediation, and be able to generate a water treatment process for remediation.”
Biofilms have been used in water treatment and bioremediation before. Water treatment plants in municipal facilities use some forms of biofilm in treating human waste. Other mining tailings have used biofilms for tailings, such as copper. But while a precedent has been set, biofilms are not widely used in the treatment of tailings.
There are many stakeholders who want to emphasize that the success of treating the tailing ponds doesn’t diminish the negative aspects associated with them.
Ramsey Hart, the Canada Program Coordinator of MiningWatch Canada, stated that while this discovery will improve the situation, it does not significantly alter the argument.
“If the water and sediments in the tar sands tailings ponds could be made environmentally benign then certainly that would improve the situation,” he said.
“However, there are still issues of the amount of land and energy the whole system is using, but storing millions of meters cubed of clean water and sediments would be better than the status quo,” Hart continued.
He also expressed reservations about the large-scale application. “I’m quite skeptical that this could be scaled up, but it’s kind of my job to be skeptical,” he said.
Turner and Ceri are nearly done their portion of the research. Turner said they will soon pass the research over to a team of engineers at the University of Alberta, who will begin testing the biofilms in a water treatment system.
“We gave the project six months to see if it would work,” Turner said in an interview with the Canadian University Press. “I never thought it would work in a lab… Where we are now is where we thought we would be in five years.”

Some of the issues discussed at last Tuesday’s GA included formation of a strike committee, tuition hikes, and reforms to AUS Frosh
After losing quorum slightly over an hour into its proceedings, the second Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) General Assembly (GA) of the year saw multiple challenges to the Speaker’s authority, as well as to the representative ability of GAs in general.
Some of the issues discussed at last Tuesday’s GA included formation of a strike committee, tuition hikes, and reforms to AUS Frosh. The GA was held in the Stewart Biology building rather than the Shatner building, as it was last semester.
After reaching quorum, the assembly began debate on a motion for recognition of an AUS strike committee. Following a number of amendments and debate periods, and just prior to voting procedure on the motion, the GA lost quorum.
The loss of quorum results in all motions passed acting as recommendations to the AUS Council, as opposed to binding resolutions. However, Council lost quorum at its meeting on Wednesday before having time to vote on many of these recommendations.
The motion regarding the recognition of an AUS Strike Committee passed at the GA as a recommendation to Council.
The GA then passed a motion regarding accessible education, which would require the AUS to “adopt a policy in favor of accessible education and against all tuition hikes.”
Both of these motions were tabled at Wednesday’s AUS Council until the next scheduled Council meeting on February 15.
At the GA, one AUS member motioned to suspend the rules and indefinitely suspend AUS Speaker Ben Lerer, in which case AUS President Jade Calver would replace him.
Lerer noted that the motion to suspend the Speaker of the GA was allowed, but if there were a desire to suspend the Speaker as a position on AUS Council, “it would have needed to be added to the agenda [earlier].”
The motion was voted on, but ultimately failed without a two-thirds majority.
A motion for the AUS to pursue membership of the pro-strike organization Coalition Large de l’Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante (CLASSE) was tabled to be voted on at the next GA due to the loss of quorum.
A related special referendum will be held in February. The question to be voted on amends the AUS Constitution so that the GA is the supreme governing body of the Society. The amendment would make the AUS eligible to join CLASSE.
The next motions passed called for the AUS to “be mandated to transform the current AUS Frosh model into a safe space,” and a request for the relocation of the historic Hochelaga Rock.
Both of these motions were passed with minor amendments by the AUS Council on Wednesday before it lost quorum.
Following the GA, there has been criticism regarding the conduct in which the assembly was run.
Jaime Maclean, one of the movers of the motion for recognition of an AUS Strike Committee, and a member of the AUS Mobilization Committee, stated that, while debate is important, at the GA, “The debate period and question period were used almost as stall tactics to avoid voting on the question and to lose quorum before we could actually have the chance to vote.”
Daniel Wolfe, another member of the Mobilization Committee, emphasized that part of the issue lies in the fact that the people do not have “the right to choose the Speaker,” as it is a hired position.
When questioned about the motion to suspend him, Lerer stated that he believed he performed his duties “without bias,” and that he “ensured that debate was not stifled by the majority” during the assembly.
Calver also weighed in with an assertion that “the motion [to suspend the speaker] was invalid under the Robert’s Rules of Order.”
During the GA, Lerer referred to either Calver or the text of Robert’s Rules several times to look up procedure.
Following adjournment of the Council meeting, Mobilization Committee member Amber Gross called the two tabled motions “very disappointing” as they are “really important and time-sensitive” issues.
Calver and Lerer are looking into planning another GA within the next two weeks.

Radio station wants fee to become non-opt-outable
With the positive results of their respective existence referenda questions voided by the administration three weeks ago, CKUT intends to field another referendum question this winter. QPIRG, however, does not.
The administration cited a lack of clarity in both questions as the justification for its decision. In an email to The Daily, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson said that, in the past, “some fee referenda have not been implemented, because they also lacked clarity.”
Kira Page, a member of the QPIRG Board of Directors, said QPIRG is still trying to get last semester’s referendum results recognized.
“We’ve just been sitting down with Mendelson and his negotiation team in the last couple of weeks to explore other options,” said Page.
“We’re not currently looking into the possibility of running another referendum,” she continued.
QPIRG’s referendum results have also been challenged by students Zach Newburgh and Brendan Steven in a Judicial Board (J-Board) case. In a press release, Newburgh and Steven said they shared “serious concerns about the integrity of the referendum process.”
SSMU Council suspended the case until further notice last week, however, citing a need to clarify the relationship between the SSMU Board of Directors and the J-Board in the Society’s Constitution.
“[The J-Board] is part of the student democratic process for people who want to challenge the referendum results,” said Page, who added that the administration has “no right” to void the results.
“We had 132 students on our campaign who worked so hard and tirelessly,” continued Page. “We think it’s very disrespectful to the work of those people to do it all again.”
According to Page, QPIRG is committed to its current funding model, and is not looking into other financial sources.
“We’re not interested in turning into an NGO that is always scrambling for funding and applying for grants,” said Page, “especially in the context of the kind of political situation we are in Canada, where funding is being cut anyway.”
CKUT Funding and Outreach Coordinator Caitlin Manicom said the radio station does not currently have the financial capacity to legally contest the University on the case.
Manicom maintained that CKUT’s referendum results were valid, however.
“The administration should recognize the results of that vote,” she said, “especially given the fact that the University…has no legal right to unilaterally interfere with the administration of [our fees].”
According to Manicom, CKUT will be running two questions in the winter referendum period. One question will seek to affirm student support for their continued existence, and the other will ask that their fee become non-opt-outable.
“It is crucial that we become non-opt-outable,” said Manicom. “It is otherwise impossible for us to balance our books, while offering the types of events and opportunities to students that we currently do.”
Differences between the respective organizations’ Memoranda of Agreement (MoA) with McGill underlie their respective strategies.
“We need to maintain a working relationship with the administration because we depend on them to deliver those fees to us, as per our MoA,” said Manicom.
In the station’s last MoA negotiations five years ago, McGill withheld CKUT’s fees until it agreed to drop “McGill” from its name.
McGill has given the two groups have until February 16 to submit student-initiated referendum questions.

Newburgh and Steven motion to reinstate J-Board fails
Only two of seven motions were passed as binding decisions during SSMU’s 2012 Winter General Assembly (GA), as the necessary quorum of 100 students  lasted for less than two hours. SSMU Legislative Council will discuss all other motions passed next week.
Before the agenda was approved, students Zach Newburgh and Brendan Steven moved a motion from the floor “in support of an independent judiciary.” The motion sought to reinstate Judicial Board (J-Board) activities immediately.
The SSMU Board of Directors (BoD) suspended all J-Board activities last week citing a legal need to clarify their relationship with the J-Board in the SSMU Constitution. The decision suspended a J-Board case Newburgh and Steven filed disputing the results of QPIRG referendum question last November.
During debate on the motion, Newburgh said he considered the BoD decision “entirely out of order, illegal, and an affront to democracy in our Society.”
“I am concerned about the faultiness of the advice that the SSMU lawyer provided to the SSMU, our corporation, our student union,” he continued.
After a vote and a reconsideration vote, the motion did not attain the two-thirds majority necessary to be added to the agenda.
Following the executive reports, the motions “Regarding the Selection of the Financial Auditor” and “Regarding Student-Run Café” – both moved by VP Finance and Operations Shyam Patel – passed.
However, quorum was lost halfway through debate on the motion “Regarding Frosh Reform,” rendering the GA a consultative body with no binding decision-making power.
The Frosh Reform motion passed, as well as a motion regarding policy on negative corporative influence on campus moved by Clubs and Services representative Adam Winer, the latter after intense debate.
Winer responded to student concerns that severing ties with corporations could harm potential student employment.
“We live in a social context, and you cannot just abstract away from that and use finding jobs as a way to obscure that entire discussion,” said Winer.
The motion “Regarding a Student Strike Solidarity Fund,” which would provide assistance to students affected by an extended student strike, also fuelled extensive debate before passing.
“If you want to protest, fine…that’s your right. But ultimately, Gandhi did not ask for a handout and neither should any of you here,” said one member of the assembly, speaking against the motion.
The last motion to be discussed, “Regarding the Commission of a Portrait of Karl Marx,” was the only motion that failed to pass.
Other motions passed by the consultative body included a motion “Regarding the Denouncement of Bill C-10,” and a motion to lobby SSMU Council to buy chess sets for Gerts.
SSMU President Maggie Knight spoke to The Daily after the GA about the chronic lack of attendance at GAs.
“We could have offered food, but you know that’s expensive, so people would get upset about that. There are tales about a lack of successful process out of the [Arts Undergraduate Society] GA last night – that may have put some other students that are not in the Arts faculty off,” said Knight.
Knight also referred to the extensive debate at the start of the GA.
“We were very bogged down in procedural matters at the start of the GA, which delayed things and probably made people a little bit more frustrated … I think that there is also a responsibility for all students who attend the GA to act in good faith with the process and try to facilitate a meaningful exchange of ideas,” she added.

This past Tuesday, McGill’s Emergency Measures Office (EMO) launched its new emergency communication software, Alertus. The software is a part of McGill Attention! –  the University’s mass emergency notification system.
In order to function, Alertus must be downloaded and installed onto a computer. When the program is triggered, pop-up messages appear on computers that have it installed. Computer users must click an “Acknowledge” button in order for the message to disappear. According to Alertus’ website, the process is tracked by the system on a unit-by-unit basis.
McGill stated in an email to all students on Monday that Alertus would be activated only in the event of an emergency, evacuation, or University closure.
The email also stated that Alertus is part of the EMO’s ongoing efforts to improve emergency communications at McGill, based on the recommendations of Dean of Law Daniel Jutras’ report on November 10.
The Jutras Report states that “Security Services should…establish fixed lines of communication with the different constituencies on campus, particularly with student groups and University community organizations.”
A major criticism following the events of November 10 was that McGill failed to communicate to students about what was occuring on campus.
Director of University Safety Louise Savard said that McGill was made aware of Alertus a year and a half ago, when approached by the company, Alertus Technologies.
“It’s been in development here for I would say probably more than half a year,” she said.
Savard added that Alertus is “a complement to our mass notification tool kit…that doesn’t replace anything that we’ve previously been using.”
Alertus Technologies was founded in 2002 after a tornado killed two students at the University of Maryland. The company specializes in alert systems for large-scale facilities.
According to Savard, most computers on campus will have Alertus software installed. The software was first tested on 1,413 computers. As of Tuesday morning, 3,625 computers are now registered with Alertus.
If activated, Alertus’ message can only be targeted to computers on McGill’s downtown campus, Macdonald campus, or laptops.
A valid McGill username is needed to install Alertus.
“The service is intended for the McGill community,” Savard said.

Discussion of Jutras Report recommendations on agenda
McGill’s highest decision-making body adjourned five minutes after beginning an open session to discuss the Jutras Report last Tuesday.
Following opening remarks from Principal Heather Munroe-Blum and Board of Governors (BoG) Chair Stuart Cobbett, a group of students in the gallery, most of whom were dressed in pirate costumes, stood and began to sing a rendition of “Barrett’s Privateers.”
After several attempts to call for order, Cobbett adjourned the meeting.
Speaking to The Daily, Munroe-Blum said the goal of the open session was to encourage discussion on the Jutras Report and to incorporate the feedback into her own report.
Munroe-Blum has announced that McGill accepts all recommendations made in the Jutras Report, and that a report concerning the implementation of the recommendations will be forthcoming.
“What we were supposed to have [at the meeting] was lost, and that’s unfortunate,” she said. “I won’t get the benefit of consultation before responding, though I would encourage various communities to engage in conversation.”
Minutes after the students’ singing started, members of the BoG began to leave the room.
According to one student who participated in the action, “I acted to hijack the proceedings and plunder the macadamia nut cookies of the BoG. We committed mutiny and vanquished the scurvy scoundrels of the captain’s chambers.”
Several administrators and board members remained in the room to discuss the demonstration with students who participated.
Sunci Avlijas, a biology graduate student, spoke to reasons behind the action.
“[BoG] is a place where we don’t have real input – we just come here to listen and watch them make decisions for us… The point of the action was to delegitimize their power to make decisions for the rest of the University without any accountability to the student body and rest of the community.”
Gallery members do not have speaking rights in BoG meetings.
SSMU President Maggie Knight, one of two student representatives to the BoG, spoke to The Daily after the meeting was adjourned.
“I guess I’m not surprised, because [the students] want to pressure the system, and this was their way to voice their opinions,” Knight said. “But [the administration] didn’t have to hold an open session.”
BoG meetings are comprised of a public open session and a closed session in which only BoG members are permitted. On Tuesday, the closed session of the meeting took place before the open session.
PGSS President Roland Nassim, the other student representative to the BoG, said he was disappointed that the meeting was interrupted. “This is not the student voice – 19 people hijacked the student voice; they eliminated it for thousands and thousands of people.”
“How am I going to approach the principal tomorrow and tell her we need to have open conversation [when] she asks me: ‘Are [students] going to come and sing again?’” Nassim continued. “This is the ramification of these kinds of things: it loses our credibility as student leaders.”
David Kalant, administrative and support staff representative to the BoG, said he understood the students’ concerns but had reservations.
“I was elected to represent similar concerns – to open things up, make things more transparent, but I don’t think this is going to achieve that,” he said.
Philosophy professor Alison Laywine, who is not a member of the BoG but was present for the open session, said that she felt energized.
“I think [the action] drew attention [to the need] for the conversation between the Board of Governors and the constituents in the University,” she said.
It was the second BoG meeting in a row in which students have staged protests.
At the time of press, it was unknown if an open session to discuss the recommendations of the Jutras Report will be rescheduled.

Part of a series on faculty association presidents: LSA gets political
Law Students’ Association (LSA) President Catherine Coursol’s main job is to coordinate amongst the VPs, meet the dean weekly, and stay on-pace with SSMU and the administration. “The president last year convinced me to run,” said Coursol, who also served as LSA’s VP Internal two years ago.
Comparing the LSA to other faculty associations, Coursol said, “It’s easier because we’re smaller and people are just really involved.”
Although she sits on the presidents’ round table, Coursol admitted to not knowing much about the undergraduate side of McGill’s faculty associations, SSMU included. The LSA does collaborate with the Medical Students’ Society during small events, because of their similarities in size and demographic.
Two years ago, the LSA tried to leave SSMU. Coursol insisted it is not a plan this year. “I think this year the faculty presidents are all really close,” she said.
She also describes the LSA’s relationship with the administration as positive. “We don’t agree about everything, but at least we talk.”
The LSA wavered between stances of neutrality and support for MUNACA during the union’s strike last semester. At first, LSA Council voted to stay neutral. In the LSA General Assembly, however, a motion to support MUNACA passed. Finally, another LSA student filed a petition that led to an online and offline referendum on the issue; the result was a renewed LSA stance of neutrality.
Although LSA executives were present at the protests on November 10, Coursol did not meet with Dean of Law Daniel Jutras during the two months he worked on his investigation into the day’s events.
“Some people from other faculties were saying it maybe was not neutral, but…he’s really someone you can trust,” said Coursol. “I’m sure he did his best and that it was neutral.”
In Coursol’s last meeting with Jutras, she said they discussed the Jutras Report for “only one minute.”
Coursol explained that she is impressed at the level of political involvement within the faculty this year, having never seen similar levels of involvement in her four years in law. She said that she was surprised that the LSA came out against tuition increases.
Coursol insisted that this initiative was not about strikes or protests, however.  “We gave solutions that weren’t, ‘We want free education.’” The LSA wrote a letter to the Montreal Gazette, for example, outlining their plan for increased bursaries.
This year, the LSA has also been advocating for renaming the undergraduate LL.B. (Bachelor of Law) degree to the J.D. (Juris Doctor). Coursol said the switch would benefit students who want to work internationally, where the J.D. is more recognizable. The name change could be accompanied with program changes. Ultimately, the decision to rename the degree rests with the faculty.
“If the faculty knows it will benefit students, they will change it,” said Coursol.
This year, the LSA also introduced smaller initiatives to encourage faculty involvement, including an open-door policy and biweekly “breakfast with the execs” in the LSA office. Coursul said having two VP Internals also made things smoother this year, a success evidenced by 95 per cent attendance at LSA Frosh this year.
