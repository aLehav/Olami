Former British prime minister speaks on eight-school Faith and Globalization program
Speaking to a Montreal audience Friday, former British prime minister Tony Blair discussed the importance of inter-faith dialogue as McGill formally launched its partnership with the Faith and Globalization Initiative. Established three years ago by the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, the initiative is aimed at creating an intellectual and academic framework for understanding the relationship between faith and globalization.
In a discussion moderated by CBC host and McGill Religious Studies graduate Evan Solomon, Blair explained the ideology of the initiative, and fielded questions from the audience on the changing role of religion in society.
For Blair, globalization is both an opportunity and an unstoppable force. He also believes it is a phenomenon that has exacerbated the need for greater religious understanding, and the inclusion of religion in the realm of politics, he said.
“Does religious faith become a means of providing civilizing values to civilization and thereby be a force of progress, or does religious faith become a badge of identity in opposition to those who aren’t of the same faith?” asked Blair. “I think this is the dominant question of the 21st century.”
According to Blair, distinctions between left-right political ideologies are increasingly subordinate to the basic question of whether a society is open or closed to cultural and religious differences. Successful integration and public policy will rely on societies’ attitudes toward diversity, and their ability to find commonality irrelevant to one’s faith, or lack thereof, said the former prime minister.
“If you want to be a leader today in politics, in business, in civic society, you can not be religiously ignorant. You may not agree with it, you may not even like it, but you’ve got to know about it,” said Blair. “Even if you don’t believe in someone’s faith, you can respect their right to believe, that it is an alternative path to salvation, and in respecting that you get quite close to respecting their spirituality.”
Blair maintained that religiosity continues to grow despite predictions that it would decrease as countries became more prosperous.
“Within debates about our society, religious faith is an issue, it is in the public space. So the question is not whether it is there; the question is what it is doing when it is there and what are the rules that guide proper debate.”
McGill is currently the only Canadian university to be invited to participate in the initiative, which includes seven other universities such as Yale, Durham (U.K.), and the National University of Singapore. In August, five McGill students travelled to Singapore to discuss inter-university collaboration within the initiative.
Earlier Friday morning, Blair spoke to a 300-level special topics course on Religion and Globalization co-taught by professors Daniel Cere and Ellen Aitken. Cere explained that faculty members stepped back and the “whole class was run by the students.” Students from a variety of disciplines conducted interviews with Blair on the intersections between religion, law, gender, and globalization.
According to Cere, a member of Blair’s team, Drew Collins, said that this particular experience was one of the best exchanges with university students that Blair had had.
Cere added that the course methodology was fairly unique: each week, students write a 500-word blog entry, and they are encouraged to interact with each other on the internet.
“Some of these blogs will go up on a secure blog site that will allow these students to interact with students at Yale, Peking, other parts of the world – pretty appropriate given the theme: religion and globalization,” he said.
Cere felt that the  initiative signalled the beginning of a new program of research and study at McGill.
“There are so many areas where religion interacts with culture – religion and law, religion and politics, religion and gender issues – these points of interaction will probably be future areas of research avenues for teaching and collaboration,” said Cere.
Juliette Dupre, a U1 Arts student, was a member of the McGill contingent who participated in the Singapore conference.
“Especially considering how important religion is to such a large number of people, not only in their private lives, but as an influence over the way that they think and act and how they choose to live, this is an extremely important initiative,” said Dupre.
“I think this is a good start on an important problem, and I think it’s an ambitious start. Ultimately it is a very interesting initiative for McGill to be involved in.”

Extensive debate centres around striking the word “inoffensive”
Correction appended – Monday, Nov 15
SSMU Council voted Thursday to approve a new equity policy. The policy passed after significant debate over two amendments tacked on by Arts councillor Spencer Burger.
Equity Commissioner Emily Clare applauded Council’s final decision, saying, “I think the best policy went through today,” although the legislative process involved “a lot of give and take.”
The new policy is the product of work done by the 2009-2010 Equity Committee and Rebecca Dooley, former VP University Affairs, who returned to Council to see the policy passed. “I’m ecstatic,” she said. “That policy is the result of a lot of time and energy put in by a lot of different people.”
She added that the new policy is “far, far superior to the previous policy,” implemented in 2008, partly because it is “easier to understand.”
Approval was scheduled for the previous Council meeting, but was ruled out of order, since the Steering Committee had not read through the policy twice, as necessary. The document was endorsed by the Steering Committee during their report to Council on Thursday, however.
The new policy outlines SSMU’s background, history, and development of equity policies, and lists SSMU groups and services that hold a “strong commitment to equity, safety, and the creation of safe(r) spaces for its membership.”
An appendix also includes relevant sections from McGill’s Charter of Students’ Rights, and previous SSMU policies that “deal with varying aspects of discrimination and harassment.”
The policy applies to all members and staff of SSMU, including all activities, events, and funding allocated by the Society. It seeks to provide a “functional anti-oppressive environment” and outline the responsibilities of SSMU.
Procedures for submitting complaints are outlined, which are investigated first by the four Equity Officers, who are the Equity Commissioner and three members of the Executive Committee. The committee can make recommendations to Council, which then has the option to discipline offenders, including a suspension of financial support from SSMU.
Clare prefaced Council debate by explaining the strength of the policy.
“We’re taking the equity policy as a signal of change of how equity will be run at McGill. We want it to be a lot more accessible to students, and we’re taking this as the starting point,” she said.
Myles Gaulin, Policy and Equity Coordinator for Queer McGill, also spoke in favour of the policy, saying that despite advances in equity practices, “McGill can still be an oppressive, intimidating environment for many people.”
Debate centred around Burger’s three proposed amendments to the policy. The first, written in coordination with the Equity Committee, changed the policy’s definition of “oppression” to, “the exercise of power by a group of people over another group of people with specific consideration of cultural, historical, and living legacies.”
Clare supported the change, arguing that it “highlights nuances dealt with in an equity complaint.”
“It’s a simple amendment, but I think it really strengthens the equity policy,” she added.
A second amendment, which required extensive negotiation amongst councillors, moved to strike the words “inoffensive,” “collegial,” and “respectful” from the description guiding acceptable discussion between students and student groups. Of the three terms, Council only struck “inoffensive,” from the passage in question.
Burger said that the inclusion of his amendment is “a big step for freedom of speech on McGill campus and on university campuses in general.” He added, “SSMU does not have the right to censor someone based on the perception that what someone says is offensive. This equity policy is still somewhat jumbled, but I hope the acceptance of my amendments will make freedom of speech a much more integral part of our campus.”
A third amendment, which failed, sought to add a section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the equity policy. The section described the fundamental freedoms of Canadians.
The policy was passed with a large majority of councellors voting in favor of adoption. Clare highlighted that the policy “situated equity in general in the context of the history of McGill,” and shows that “SSMU has been a leader in equity.”
The amendments that passed “do not have a negative effect on the policy,” she said. “The discussion that happened was really useful for a lot of people on Council to understand what the equity policy means to our members and our organizations.

Council upholds students’ right to govern their space
SSMU Council passed a resolution Thursday affirming the Soceity’s support for a proposal to reopen the Architecture Café. The motion was tabled by the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) and the Architecture Students Association (ASA). Under the plan, the Architecture Café would become an EUS-run service.
Only three councillors abstained from voting on the measure: Nick Drew, Eli Freedman, and Spencer Burger, who admitted to being distracted while voting.
The resolution further stipulated that SSMU would be required to submit a formal letter in support of the proposal to both the EUS and to the McGill administration.
“The administration closed the Architecture Café due to financial reasons. It did not consult with students, and we now have Engineering and Architecture students who want to engage with the administration and try to solve this issue so that they won’t have to close the Arch Café,” said Gustavo Marquez, Engineering representative and co-author of the motion. “I think it’s extremely important that we recognize the effort and the time these students put into writing the report, and more importantly, to applaud their initiative.”
The proposal, jointly authored by members of the EUS and ASA before the latter organization officially joined the EUS as a departmental association, contained an elaborate outline of how the Arch Café would function under EUS, citing other successful EUS endeavours, such as Frostbite and Copi-EUS.  The proposal was rejected by the administration on October 9 in a response from Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson, who explained that the University is shifting away from student-run food services.
Lauren Hudak, Science repre-sentative and co-author of the motion, addressed the administration’s rejection of the proposal, while maintaining that SSMU should support the student initiative.
“Mendelson said that even though he liked the effort that had been put into [the motion], it was ultimately rejected because the McGill administration has moved away from student initiatives. However, we [the authors] still think it’s a very important endeavour, because instead of just saying we’re going to support something – both the EUS and the ASA took an incredible amount of time to draft this document,” she said.
Responding to questions about whether or not a declaration of support for the proposal would be effective in re-opening the Café, considering the administration’s apparent lack of approval for such a project, Hudak stressed that, “SSMU’s support is critical, because [it] has a great deal of power and influence.”
SSMU President Zach Newburgh went on to note the symbolic nature of SSMU’s support for the proposal, saying “The motion exists simply to support the right [of student societies] to govern their own space.”

McGill PhD students study terrorist recruitment videos from Central Asia and East Africa
Last Friday, Christopher Anzalone and Aisha Ahmad hosted “Insurgent Media: Somalia & Afghanistan/Pakistan.” The screening featured three films produced by the media outlets of Somalia’s al-Shabab, and the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban. Anzalone is a PhD candidate in the institute of Islamic Studies and has collected and studied insurgent films from across the Muslim world. Ahmad is a Ph.D candidate in Political Science, and has extensive knowledge of the Somali and Afghan conflicts.
The McGill Daily: Why is it important to study insurgency propaganda as source documents?
Christopher Anzalone: The reason I study them is because it’s important to know and to understand and to analyze how these movements and these groups basically – number one – define themselves, and – number two – how they interact with audiences which they are addressing. Both the people they are fighting and the people that are allied with them, and the people they hope will be allied but are not at the moment. The best way to do that is through primary source documents. I think it’s very important to look at them as much as possible without having them mediated in any way. Not to read an article about them – of which of course there are lots when Osama bin Laden or [Ayman] al-Zawahiri releases something – you’ll see dozens or hundreds of articles about that. They’re important, but just like any document you would look at, you’re not going to read just what somebody else has to say about it. If you have access to [the document] and can use it, you should really do that yourself, because it’s always going to be shaded.
MD: Why do you think films like these aren’t studied as much?
CA: The policy people [study them] a lot. There are academics who study them. It’s certainly a field which is starting to grow, and there’s much more room for growth in terms of the academic study. A lot of the policy people, not all of them, but many of them, don’t have as much background in either the regional or the religious topics to unpack some of the things [in the films]. I think there should be more of a conversation between the more traditional academic and the more policy-oriented kind of stuff.
MD: How has the internet affected these types of propaganda films?
CA: [The films] exist before, for example in Afghanistan in the eighties,  but they would be on video cassette or news channels playing the footage. The internet though, the really revolutionary thing about it, is the freedom it gives over the [process of] distribution. Before then, when Al-Qaeda Central [al-Qaeda’s media outlet] was delivering tapes to Al-Jazeera, they still do that for some things. A couple of bin Laden’s tapes were delivered first to al-Jazeera first through video tape or DVD-R, but the bulk of the stuff now doesn’t have to go through [these channels]. They know that the websites where you can get these videos are monitored either by governments – I’m sure the U.S. and the Canadian as well, and by academics and by analysts as well. But to reach their audience, their supporters now, they don’t have to rely on someone else to decide whether to show it or not. Distribution and how they can reach audiences is the most important change.
 MD: People in North America have probably seen bin Laden’s face thousands of times since 9/11. We now have a generation that has grown up with the War on Terror. But we never hear his voice. What kind of impact does that has?
 CA: Even comparing bin Laden or al-Zawahiri, they all have very different ways of speaking. Bin Laden is the most, in my opinion, conversational. Even when he’s speaking to you, it feels like he’s speaking in a conversation. When al-Zawahiri  speaks, it feels like he’s speaking to you. On film, he does all these [aggressive] hand motions that reinforce that. But bin Laden has a much more calming voice. I think it’s really important to understand that, and that just can’t be captured by reading about bin Laden.
The McGill Daily: Why do you study these types of documents that are so rarely looked at?
 Aisha Ahmad: The information operations in insurgencies are an integral part of the battle for hearts and minds. Unless we look at both sides of the propaganda war in conflict, we’re not going to necessarily understand why populations living under insurgencies may shift their political opinions in favour of an insurgency rather than in favour of the government. Understanding domestic public opinion in civil wars means that we have to understand what people are talking about, how people are understanding the conflict. The competition for the narrative is really important, so essentially these films allow us to start to have a discussion about the competition that we’ve had over the narrative.
NATO has certainly worked hard trying to present the conflict to the Afghan people in a certain way, to the Pakistani audience in a certain way. The African Union has tried to present the conflict in Somalia to the domestic audience in a certain way. But insurgents also have a response, and that response, at times, has been more effective and compelling in getting the support of the domestic audience, which is so coveted. It’s important to understand how they’re framing the conflict. [The videos] also give us an insight into what they might want to gain from the conflict; what their objectives are. It also gives us an insight into their recruitment and mobilization strategies.
 MD: Why do you think that these types of primary source documents aren’t more widely studied in North America?
 AA: I think that they ought to be studied by students of Political Science. I came up with the idea of doing this because I’m a TA for POLI 442, International Relations of Ethnic Conflict. In talking to my students, they were all really interested to know how narrative, imagery, myth, symbol factor in developing the narrative around an insurgency, and building momentum for an insurgency, affecting domestic political opinion in a contested situation. So when the political contest on the battlefield is ongoing, it’s akin to an election campaign, in a way. Both sides are making their pitch. I think the reason, maybe, that we shy from watching things like this is, number one: to be quite frank, they are violent, and the violence is real, as opposed to Hollywood. We were very careful in the selection of films to make sure that we didn’t choose anything that was actually just vile. I do know that people who study information operations do do this, but we as a community of scholars are still relatively new to the study of information operations. This is a new area for us, but we really need to invest more effort into doing this, especially given that – on the whole – Western or NATO information operations have not fared as well in the battle for hearts and minds as have counter-propaganda.
