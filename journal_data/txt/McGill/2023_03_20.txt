Students express frustration in accessing food in residence cafeterias and declining balance plan
Food for Thought is a new column investigating food services at McGill and documenting the conversations happening on campus around food affordability and accessibility.
McGill Student Housing and Hospitality Services (SHHS) is considering a switch to an All-You-Care-To-Eat (AYCTE) meal plan model in dining halls for students living in residences, to be implemented tentatively at the start of the Fall 2023 semester. 
The current model – mandatory for students living in all undergraduate residences apart from Solin Hall – is a declining balance plan. The plan essentially functions as a debit card, with students having to budget their allowance throughout the year. For first year-students in residences, the current plan costs $6,200 in total, which includes the mandatory meal plan, a $975 administrative fee, and $500 OneCard dollars. The Daily spoke with three students regarding details of the AYCTE model, the student consultation process, and whether the plan has potential to mitigate concerns of first-year students regarding food access on campus.
Throughout the past semester, there has been an increase in concerns among students surrounding food prices and quality within residence cafeterias. “Lets Eat McGill,” a campaign with the goal of creating affordable, sustainable, and cooperative food options on campus, arose partly due to the concerns first-year students have about having enough to eat. 
At an assembly on food insecurity, hosted by Let’s Eat McGill on March 8, students expressed their frustrations in accessing food in residence cafeterias. Students mentioned struggling to budget in a way that allows for the plan to last the entire year. This is challenging given that the meal plan is only enough for two meals a day due to high cafeteria prices. Students also expressed their disappointment with the limited variety and low-quality options that often do not reflect the high price of items. One student said that food rationing and skipping meals has become the norm for many living in their residence. 
Kerry Yang, VP University Affairs at SSMU, has met with SHHS and relayed information from their February 24 meeting to the Daily. Yang believes this switch to an AYCTE meal plan model will be a step in the right direction within residences because it might help with the current plan being either too much or too little money for students. According to Yang’s meeting with SHHS, he told the Daily that SHHS began to review the current model in September and that SHHS is quite serious about the AYCTE switch. Once students are enrolled into the meal plan, they will be able to swipe their card whenever they want to access the cafeteria. Additionally, the model is only dine-in, with hopes to reduce the use of packaging and single-use containers. SHHS also hopes the dine-in model will encourage students to socialize. Those not enrolled in the meal plan, but who may still want to access the cafeterias, will be required to pay an entrance-fee. According to Yang, SHHS are still working out the details of the plan, and weighing different options for students. Further details about the plan will tentatively be posted in May and will be ready to be rolled out in the new academic year.
The Daily spoke to Liam O’Connell, the Food Representative on the Environmental Residence Council, about the prospective ACTYE plan. As the food representative, O’Connell attends University Residence Council (URC) meetings to advocate for improved sustainability practices, increased variety, and affordability in pricing within residence cafeterias. According to O’Connell, members of SHHS started developing this new model in response to students wanting a change from the declining balance plan currently in place. He expressed that SHHS is open to ideas and change; “I just feel like they don’t have these ideas,” he says, “so if people have any ideas, it would be very helpful for them to tell SHHS and talk about it.”
O’Connell says that although he has attended most meetings that took place, “a lot of it has been going on behind the scenes … without students.” Student consultation regarding the plan has been limited to the food representatives on residence council, per O’Connell.
Marcel Bendaly, VP External at RVC, told the Daily  that “since we [RVC] are the main cafeteria on campus, I have heard a lot of stories of people foregoing their meals or skipping meals or budgeting to extreme lengths because of the food security issues.” When the Daily asked Bendaly if he believes the AYCTE meal plan will remedy the food issue for first-year students living in residences, Bendaly said in interviews with media outlets regarding food security, McGill’s response has been to refer to the AYCTE model. Bendaly said that the pricing and sustainability details of the plan are still unknown: “they have not defined exactly what it will be like. All they have given us are just the usual marketing slogans that students will have to select from natural or whatever locally sourced, that sort of thing,” said Bendaly.
Bendaly also commented on McGill’s lack of collaboration with student groups: “If McGill does really want to provide us with a good solution to the food insecurity issues, it would start first by working with the student groups, which are tackling the issue and establishing some sort of rapport where we are able to review the plans they have, give our opinion on them and be agents and actually changing that into something that would be good for students.” Such groups may include Midnight Kitchen, Let’s Eat McGill and Macdonald Student-Run Ecological Gardens.

Discussion about the New Vic case 
On March 8, International Women’s Day, SSMU hosted a panel with the kanien’kehà:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) to discuss their ongoing fight over land and human rights recognition. The talk was chaired by Nancy R. Tapias Torrado, a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the McGill Centre for Human Rights & Legal Pluralism (CHRLP). 
During the talk, the Mohawk Mothers discussed the New Vic case; their experience dealing with the Canadian legal system; the importance of raising awareness about the human rights violations and injustices that Indigenous people still endure; and their responsibilities and duties as Ka’nisténhsera’. 
Panelists began by defining the word Ka’nisténhsera’, or “life-giver,” which refers to women and mothers, and includes their connection to nature and creation. Ka’nisténhsera’ have a responsibility towards  Ienthi’nistenhah tsi ionhontsá:te’, Mother Earth, and to the tahatikonhsontóntie, the children yet to come. The Ka’nisténhsera’ then discussed how their language highlights their ties to the earth. Engaged in the struggle for Indigenous rights since the 1960s, Kahentinetha  added that “our language is the vehicle of our way of life”. During a discussion with the Daily, Kwetiio emphasized the importance of the role of women and specifically mothers: “Women have a specific duty of caring and nurturing [which] comes from their way of living. Ka’nisténhsera’ comes from the word O’nísta, which means the umbilical cord connecting a child to its mother and a community to Mother Earth.” 
When asked about their activism and fight in the New Vic case, the Ka’nisténhsera’ responded that “this is not simply activism, this is our life […] to us, it’s just survival”. In 2015, speculation started to circulate that there may be unmarked graves of Indigenous people, including children, present at the Royal Victoria Hospital site resulting from unethical experiments carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. On October 27, 2022, the Mohawk Mothers made history when Justice Gregory Moore granted them an interlocutory injunction to immediately halt “any excavation in furtherance of the redevelopment of the Allan Memorial Institute or the Royal Victoria Hospital.” This decision marked the first time in Canadian history that self-represented Indigenous people won an injunction without the use of attorneys, and instead based on their own governance system, the Kaianere’kó:wa (Great Peace). When discussing the New Vic case, the Mohawk Mothers agreed that “this is an opportunity for Canada and Quebec to have a new relationship with the people and the land.” 
However, the Mohawk Mothers emphasized the crucial importance of raising awareness and consciousness of our surroundings and of how we act. They said that “this knowledge will no longer stay silent […] if you know something and do nothing, then you are part of the problem.” They added that things needed to change. Kwetiios’s mother emphasized the fact that “being sorry is not enough,” to which Kahentinetha responded that “the word sorry is empty. In our language, there is no word to say sorry […] instead you make it right.” 
Finally, the Mohawk Mothers explained the necessity to uncover the truth and end these human rights violations by reevaluating the whole judicial system, which systematically reproduces injustices while giving the “illusion of empowerment.” The last question asked by Torrado was about their vision for the future, to which they responded that they would like “the land to be respected again, returning to a value system and stop taking things for granted.” They added that they would like women to be able to properly care for their children. Kwetiio said, “We will do whatever we have to do to have our dignity respected. Creation stands with us.”

“The struggle for equality is worldwide and intersectional” 
On March 8, in honour of International Women’s Day, hundreds gathered in front of the Roddick gates in support for all women and the fight for equality. The march was organized by Women of Diverse Origins, a grassroots anti-imperialist women’s network based in Montreal. 
One of the speakers addressed the crowd, saying: “We stand by the brave women of Iran or Afghanistan protesting oppressive regimes, and fight for their fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and right to receive a proper education […] and we are here [to] request the recognition and protection of the rights of all women.” 
“The struggle for equality is worldwide and intersectional,” said another speaker, before adding that “intersectionality is a unifying force.” Intersectionality demonstrates the way in which even inequality is not equal; women suffer in different ways depending on the different characteristics of their identity. This idea expresses how people’s social identities can overlap, creating compounding experiences of discrimination. 
During the march, the Daily spoke with Marie Boti, one of the organizers of the march and spokesperson for Women of Diverse Origins. She noted that “this is the 22nd year in a row that we have organized this march.”  She then added that one of the main demands was to regularize the “500,000 people in Canada that don’t have regular immigration status.”  Women living without regular status are especially at risk; Boti explained that “they are totally vulnerable to any form of exploitation, including sexual abuse or being taken advantage by a landlord or an employer.” 
Another important demand of the march was related to the inequality sustained by an unjust economic system. “There is still an economic system that is based on exploitation  and making profit more important than women and human beings. This is the system of capitalism and imperialism, where rich countries exploit the resources of poorer countries forcing people to migrate in search of a better life. They end up dying on our doorstep because we are not letting them in,” concluded Boti. 
The Daily also spoke with Ambrine Lambert, a student at McGill and head delegate of the IRSAM Youth Advisory Delegation, who participated in the 67th Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations. The McGill delegation team met with multiple permanent missions to discuss “global health, climate change, and inequality” in relation to women’s rights. Ambrine emphasized the “importance of educating people on women’s rights.” Her main take away from the commission was that “the state of women’s rights and the solutions that can be offered varies significantly depending on geography. And we are seeing a positive evolution, but events in the US and Iran for example are proof that we should be cautious in claiming victory.” 
When asked about the future of feminist activism, Boti told the Daily , “We’ve been doing this for over two decades and we are getting tired, we need more young people joining us […] We shouldn’t take things for granted, the struggle for women’s rights won’t end until they are recognized for every woman everywhere.”
