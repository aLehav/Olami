Vatican canonization process marked by dispute over Kateri Tekakwitha’s nationality
Since December, reports of a Mohawk saint’s imminent canonization have peppered news media across Canada and the world.
Most know her as Kateri Tekakwitha, though the name is just one of many less-than-certain traits of a woman remembered for her intense devotion, self-mortification, and attachment to nature. Tekakwitha’s name and image adorn shrines, churches, and other public buildings across Quebec and North America. Pope Benedict XVI is expected to canonize her in 2012, making her the first North American indigenous woman to complete the Vatican’s long and multi-step evaluation of sainthood.
Two miracles must be approved by the pope before a saint can be canonized. Tekakwitha earned her second when a boy from Washington state was cured of a serious infection in 2006 after persistent prayers to the Mohawk ascetic.
Tekakwitha was born in what is now Auriesville, New York, around 1656, but made the journey to – and ultimately died in – Kahnawake, a few kilometers from Montreal. Tekakwitha found a community of Mohawk Catholics in Kahnawake more tolerant of her beliefs.
Tekakwitha is said to act as a patroness for children, those persecuted for their faith, and the environment, according to Deacon Ron Boyer of the St. Francis Xavier Church in Kahnawake, where Tekakwitha is entombed and enshrined.
“The best way to find God is in nature. She didn’t praise nature, she found God in it,” he said.
Boyer shares the position of Vice Postulator with an American Monsignor. Postulators are appointed by the Catholic Church to manage cases for sainthood and investigate the miracles required for canonization.
While reports from CTV and the Toronto Star highlight claims for Tekakwitha’s nationality as Canadian or American, she died long before either country existed.
Boyer dismissed the media-reported debate over which country “owns” Tekakwitha’s memory.
“That borderline – we didn’t make that line,” said Boyer. “We look at ourselves as North American… People look up to her, native [or] non-native. She’s well-known.”
McGill History professor Allan Greer wrote a biography of Tekakwitha in 2005. He noted that claiming her citizenship for one side of the border or the other would make for an anachronistic label. “People who claim her as a Mohawk saint probably have a more reasonable claim,” he said.
As Greer’s book, Mohawk Saint: Catherine Tekakwitha and the Jesuits, recounts, different parties have long sought to define Tekakwitha for their own purposes, beginning just after her death. Two French Jesuit priests, impressed by the Mohawk woman’s spiritual devotion, penned hagiographic accounts of her life in an attempt to win canonization.
In 1884, the American Catholic Church, then associated with working-class immigrants, took notice of Tekakwitha’s record.
“The American church was looking for some way to Americanize themselves with a symbolic anchor in American soil,” Greer explained. “She’s as far from being an immigrant as you can get.”
The American Catholic Church’s authorities petitioned Rome to consider Tekakwitha’s beatification, an intermediary step toward full sainthood. Within a few years, romanticized depictions of Tekakwitha’s life were published that emphasized a generic native identity. Greer wrote in his book that the name “Kateri” is likely the result of an American author’s attempt to indigenize the name “Catherine,” under which Tekakwitha was baptized at age nineteen.
The French-Canadian church promoted Tekakwitha by establishing a shrine for her in Kahnawake. Another shrine exists in Auriesville, marking Tekakwitha’s incorporation into the identities of European Catholics, conservative French nationalists, and Americanizing Catholic immigrants alike, according to Greer.
“She has been assimilated into these various identities, even as she has been made to stand for the antithesis of modernity,” he writes in Mohawk Saint.
The only other native saint recognized by the Vatican in 2002 is Juan Diego, an indigenous Mexican who lived in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The Tekakwitha Conference, based in Great Falls, Montana, describes itself on its website as “the only Catholic Native American/Aboriginal Religious organization in North America.” The organization holds annual conferences to bring native Catholics together, and oversees a network of “Kateri Circles.”
Martin Loft, public programs supervisor at the Kahnawake Cultural Centre, spoke to the impact of Tekakwitha’s expected canonization in Kahnawake, saying there has been an impact “among people who are traditional-minded.
“But among people who are not – they’re not paying attention, to be honest,” he continued.
“We were known at one time as the praying Iroquois, the praying Mohawk,” he said. “Now, only a handful go to the masses.”

Tuition hikes dominate debate at Concordia
Five of the eight hopefuls vying to become the next leader of the NDP gathered last Wednesday for a debate at Concordia’s Loyola Campus.
With Oscar Peterson Hall almost at capacity, the candidates – Nikki Ashton, Nathan Cullen, Peggy Nash, Martin Singh, and Brian Topp  –  quickly settled into a two-hour debate comprised of four pre-set questions and three questions from the audience.
Nathan Cullen, MP for Skeena-Bulkley Valley, BC, stated in his opening remarks, “The progressive majority in this country needs a voice against the false majority of [Prime Minister] Stephen Harper.”
Compared to recent Republican  candidate debates south of the border, the NDP candidates remained cordial, often sharing the same stance on the issues being presented.
Some of the issues tackled by the candidates included tuition hikes and accessibility to post-secondary education, environmental issues, and views on Palestinian statehood. All the candidates were in favour of Palestinian sovereignty.
Nikki Ashton, MP for Churchill, Manitoba, spoke to the issue of post-secondary funding.
“Your fight is the fight of a generation.  Your fight is a fight we all have to be part of,” she said to the crowd.
Peggy Nash, MP for Parkdale-High Park, echoed a similar sentiment. “We have to insist, in a modern democratic society, that young people have the right to an education. And a right to an education means financially accessible education.”
Notably absent from the event were candidates Paul Dewar, MP for Ottawa Centre – who was campaigning in the Maritimes – and MP for Outremont Thomas Mulcair, who was at another event that evening. Abitibi–Baie James–Nunavik–Eeyou MP Romeo Saganash was scheduled to attend, but had to back out at the last minute due to a family illness.
The debate was hosted by several NDP riding associations, including Lac-Saint-Louis and NDG-Lachine branches as well as NDP Concordia and NDP McGill. The NDP will vote for the next party leader on March 24.
 
Establishing the NDP’s economic platform
Peggy Nash stands as one of the eight candidates running for leadership of the NDP, and one of two female candidates. From a background of community and international work, she has been an MP in the Toronto riding of Parkdale-High Park since 2006.
“I got to a point where I was feeling very frustrated, that we would work and work and mobilize for change and politicians would agree with us and then ultimately not do anything,” Nash said when asked how she got involved in politics.
Nash is one of the founders of Equal Voice, a multi-partisan organization that encourages women to get involved with politics. Her participation in the organization was a motivating factor in making the jump into politics.
“I also felt, ‘Look in the mirror. You are encouraging other women to be involved, you should be involved,’” she said.
Nash has served as both industry and finance critic for the NDP, positions she says makes her an ideal candidate for leadership.
“[Former NDP leader Jack Layton] appointed me to be finance critic in our opposition caucus because he knew I would work to establish our credibility on economic issues,” she said.
“If we are going to win, we have to persuade Canadians…that we can also manage the economy.”
Nash said she believes that this year’s large leadership race is an opportunity for people to get involved with building the social democratic movement with the goal of winning the government in 2015.
“This is not a time to sit out. We have a Conservative government that was elected with less than 40 per cent of those who voted.”
“This government is taking us in the wrong direction, taking us backwards. So if we really want to build the kind of Canada that we want to live in, then people have to get involved.”
 
Proposing a post-partisan Canada
Nathan Cullen, MP for Skeena-Bulkley Valley, BC, is not the front-runner in the race for NDP leadership. Though he is the longest-serving MP in the race, Cullen  does not have the visibility of candidates like Outremont MP Thomas Mulcair and former NDP President Brian Topp.
Cullen was elected as an MP after several years working in international development.
“It wasn’t a plan, it wasn’t setting up my education or my career step to step,” he said.
Cullen has served as MP in his riding for eight years, and has stood out by proposing the idea of “joint nomination meetings.”
“I would allow our ridings to hold a joint nomination meeting, like a primary, with the Greens and Liberals, and choose one candidate out of that to run against the Conservatives,” he explained.
It is something he labels as “radical” – a word that he believes is being used by the current government against those who oppose them.
“You are raising a concern that there may be pollution? You are a radical.  You say you have questions about the jobs? Radical. And that is just insulting to me, it really is. It insults me as a Canadian,” Cullen said.
“I think there is a post-partisan era coming,” he added. “I don’t know if it is here yet…[where] parties will just naturally work together more often. I hope for it, I really do.”
Cullen discussed Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the current political climate he thinks Harper has fostered.
“I don’t want to be overdramatic about it, but it’s a fact the stakes are high,” he said.
“What [Conservatives] are trying to do is really ramp down your expectations of what a government is.”

SSMU President Maggie Knight previewed the motions for the upcoming SSMU General Assembly (GA) at last week’s Legislative Council. Knight also expressed her enthusiasm over student participation in the writing and presentation of motions for this GA.
“There were some really exciting motions, and not all of them were moved by people who sit on this Council,” said Knight.
One such instance was the “Motion Regarding Student Strike Solidarity Fund” submitted by Arts students Daniel Wolfe and Kevin Paul.
The motion is an attempt to create a strike solidarity fund, which would serve to provide financial support to students who cannot meet basic needs due to the effects of a student strike. A general student strike is expected to begin in Quebec next month.
SSMU Clubs and Services Representative Adam Winer moved a motion seeking to reduce “negative corporate influence on campus.” The motion resolves that the “SSMU works to build a University community governed by students, staff and faculty internal to the University community rather than by corporate agenda.”
The “Motion Regarding Denouncement of Bill C-10,” moved by Law Representative Ian Clarke, would mandate SSMU to denounce the bill – the Conservatives’ contested Safe Streets and Community Act – in the media and to the Minister of Justice.
The motion stands out because it deals with affairs external to SSMU. Such motions require a quorum of 500 students, as per Article 28.2 of the SSMU Constitution.
Councillors expressed a concern over the space capabilities of the Shatner ballroom if 500 people try to attend the GA.
Knight told Council that those details were yet to be resolved.
“If it happens, that would be more than the capacity of the ballroom, so obviously in that event then it will be fishy, and we will see what we can do about that,” she said.
Other motions include the “Commission of a Reasonably Priced yet Glorious Portrait of Karl Marx, to be Displayed Publicly in the William Shatner University Centre” and a “Motion to Reform Frosh.”
The GA is set to be held on Wednesday, February 1 at 4:30 p.m. in the Shatner ballroom.

By-law Committee set to review SSMU Constitution
The SSMU Board of Directors (BoD) has decided to suspend all activities of the Judicial Board (J-Board) as of January 27, and to send the J-Board structure for review by the SSMU By-law Committee.
The determination came at last Thursday’s Legislative Council, when councillors discussed the potential legal liabilities of the current formulation of the J-Board.
Concerns over liabilities were brought to the attention of SSMU by the J-Board case seeking to invalidate the results of the fall 2011 referendum regarding the existence of QPIRG and CKUT.
The case, filed by former SSMU President Zach Newburgh and student Brendan Steven, was scheduled to be heard by J-Board on January 30.
The BoD decision does not throw out the Newburgh/Steven case, but suspends it until further notice.
Liability issues arose from inconsistencies between the SSMU Constitution and provincial law.
SSMU VP University Affairs Emily Clare explained to The Daily that the case is complex, because it could lead to violations of both the Quebec Corporations Act and the Accreditation Act.
Because SSMU is both a corporation and a student union, it is required to follow the Business Corporations Act.
“[J-Board is] in violation of Quebec law, and that’s because under Quebec law, the Board of Directors has to be the highest governing authority of the SSMU. That means that nothing can limit the power or overturn the decisions of the Board of Directors,” said Clare.
According to the SSMU Constitution, J-Board has the final authority on “the interpretation and legality of all procedures, questions and results of all referenda and elections,” rather than the BoD.
If J-Board had ruled to invalidate the QPIRG and CKUT referenda, it would have resulted in a direct contravention of what SSMU members decided in the referendum.
According to Clare, “Under the Accreditation Act, every member of SSMU is given the right to vote in referenda and have that decision to be binding. What the J-Board case did was basically putting forward the possibility of overturning a vote of the members, which effectively retroactively takes away that right, which is given under the law to SSMU members.”
The decision made by the BoD to suspend the activities of the J-Board followed recommendations of a resolution passed during Council.
The legislative body also advised the BoD to submit a reform of the J-Board to the ad hoc Bylaw Review Committee in order to resolve inconsistencies with Quebec law.
Arts Senator Matt Crawford pointed out the importance of not only suspending the activities, but also reforming the structure that led to the legal liabilities.
“There is a very important ambiguity that contradicts the general will of this Society, and that needs to be resolved immediately,” said Crawford.
Councillor Adam Winer echoed the sentiments, stating that to maintain a reputation of a “law-abiding organization,” Council had to solve the conflict.
The By-law Committee is set to meet this Monday to begin the process of reforming the J-Board.

First action for student coalition CLASSE
Work was cancelled last Friday for the employees of 600 Fullum, the site of the Montreal offices of the Ministère de l’Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport. University and CEGEP students blockaded all entrances to the building for about three hours in protest of the Quebec government’s tuition increases. Beginning this year, tuition in Quebec will increase by $325 each year for the next five years, for a total hike of $1,625.
The blockade was organized by the Coalition large de l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE), a branch of the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante (ASSÉ), which organized the 30,000-strong November 10 march against tuition hikes.
CLASSE is a temporary coalition of Quebec student associations formed to protest tuition hikes through a general student strike, scheduled to begin next month.
“It was the first action of our coalition, so it was a really a way for us to launch the campaign,” said ASSÉ spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois. “[These] kinds of actions are going to be more and more numerous in the next month until the strike begins in the end of February.”
SSMU VP External Joël Pedneault took part in the blockade along with other McGill students. Pedneault explained the logistics of the general strike, which will begin with a demonstration after seven student associations representing at least 20,000 students on at least three university or CEGEP campuses vote for a strike mandate.
“Today’s action was to keep up visibility and to keep up pressure,” he said. “It also had the very tangible effect of cancelling a day’s work for the Ministry of Education, and that fits within the perspective of making it very costly for the Quebec government to go ahead with the decision to [raise] tuition fees.”
McGill Arts students have brought forward motions to have the Arts Undergraduate Society give the society a mandate to join CLASSE for the general strike.
According to Nadeau-Dubois, the blockade started at 8 a.m. with about 200 people positioned at the building’s entrances and holding banners. The blockade ended once participants learned of the workday’s cancellation.
“This kind of disruption or work stoppage will keep happening as long as [the Quebec government] decides to continue raising fees,” said Pedneault.

Police commit to administering consequences
Last Tuesday, the City of Montreal revealed its plans for a new committee to fight racial and social profiling within the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
The committee, which is part of a three-year plan, is composed of elected officials from the SPVM, the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), as well as the city and its boroughs at large. The committee has been mandated to closely examine six main areas, including public security, equality of access to employment, social development, and the fight against poverty.
Marc Parent, director of the SPVM, hails the new plan as “one of the best in Canada,” and has already taken steps to adapt the SPVM’s definition of racial profiling to that of the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse (CDPDJ).
According to the CDPDJ definition, racial profiling is “any action taken by one or more people in authority with respect to a person or group of persons, for reasons of safety, security, or public order, that is based on actual or presumed membership in a group defined by race, colour, ethnic or national origin, or religion, without factual grounds or reasonable suspicion, that results in the person or group being exposed to differential treatment or scrutiny.”
The City of Montreal, and in particular the SPVM and STM, have a long history of racial profiling which has provoked public outcry and garnered media attention over the years. The most notable  case is that of Fredy Villenueva, an 18-year-old who was fatally shot in a Montreal Nord Park in 2008.
Fo Niemi, the executive director of the Centre for Research-Actions on Race Relations, a non-profit civil rights organization in Montreal, explained that while “[Parent’s] leadership gives many of us hope of better, fairer, and more harmonious police community relations. The real skepticism lies in the position of the Police Brotherhood Union on racial and social profiling, and how it will work with the police management team to equip all officers with better management skills to police a diverse city. To date, the position is not clearly articulated where the plan of action is concerned.”
Parent has said that officers caught profiling will face consequences ranging from reprimands to dismissals.
In a January 17 press release, the SPVM pledged to do its part to curb racial profiling through “its code of ethics, the continuous training of its first-line employees, and the growth of its human resource pool,  so as to better represent the community it serves.”
According to Fady Dagher, a representative of the SPVM involved in the formation of the committee, they “would like to sit down with the Human Rights Commission and develop a new partnership to see how we can work better to respond to each complaint.”
Dagher noted that the effectiveness of the committee is yet to be determined. “To eliminate [racial profiling] completely is extremely difficult, but to make progress and to get better is definitely possible,” he said.
Niemi, on the other hand, is not so confident. He explained that due to increasing racial diversity, poverty, and homelessness, “the police will continue to be the tools to leverage and control social change and economic disparities.”
The committee is set to release a report to the public at the end of 2012, detailing the results of the new action plans of both the SPVM and STM.

The most recent installment of the twice-annual student consultation fair was held last Tuesday to discuss safety and security on campus, in the light of November 10 and the events preceding it.
The consultation fair was hosted by SSMU, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS), and the Office of the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning).
The concept for the fair resulted from a recommendation by the Student Consultation and Communication Work Group, which was formed last year after the closure of the Arch Café.
The fair – publicized by the SSMU listserv, Facebook, and student senators who dressed up as suggestion boxes – was designed to give students and staff the opportunity to discuss concerns, as well as ideas, with McGill administrators in an open forum. The fair’s organization falls into the portfolio of SSMU VP University Affairs Emily Clare.
“One of the things we’re working on is reaching out to students,” Clare said. “There are actually quite a few more students than last time that [don’t usually partake in student politics], so I think it’s working. I think one of the main problems is that most people just don’t know what a consultation fair is.”
Several tables were set up in the SSMU ballroom, each with a theme, an administrator, a student senator, and a faculty facilitator. Attendees chose a table to engage in a discussion for twenty minutes, and then moved on to another table.
Themes included “Safety and Security on Campus” with James Nicell, associate vice-principal (Student Services), “Community Engagement on the Rights of Free Expression and Peaceful Assembly on Campus” with Provost Anthony Masi, and “Student Rights and Responsibilities” with Dean of Students Jane Everett.
While many students and administrators spoke of having constructive, positive experiences, the mood was, at times, markedly confrontational.
The student senator at Masi’s table, Music senator Emil Briones, said that it had been an “intense” and “sensitive” discussion.
“Obviously, the issues raised here just aren’t the kind that can be resolved right now, or this easily,” Briones added.
At the conclusion of the roundtable discussions, the group agreed nearly unanimously on a suggestion from Nicell’s table to have security guards regularly posted in the same area, in order to make them more familiar and approachable.
Between rotations, SSMU President Maggie Knight and PGSS VP Academic Lily Han led brainstorming sessions in which people were free to shout out answers to questions such as “How would you improve McGill?” Responses included “Governance reform!” and “Respecting student referenda!”
