Funding cuts come after long struggle to secure a home
A mainstay of the Jewish community at McGill, Ghetto Shul, is now in danger of losing its space in the Plateau, after nearly two years of real estate limbo.
Hillel Montreal, a Jewish students’ association that promotes cultural learning, has cut Ghetto Shul’s rent from its budget.
Jeff Bicher, the Interim Managing Director for Hillel Montreal, explained that the Shul cuts were part of a $185,000 scale-down in the face of the economic crisis.
“In an analysis of expenditures, if we don’t change our spending habits, we’re looking at spending $1.4-million, and we’re only bringing in $1.2-million.”
Ghetto Shul, a student-run and largely student-funded grassroots synagogue,  launched a fundraising campaign to make the rent at its location on Clark in the Plateau. According to Erin Kizell, students initiated a phone-a-thon that draws from their home communities for pledges.
With activities now split between the Clark Street Shul and Hillel House, Josh Tal, Public Relations Representative for Ghetto Shul and U3 Cultural Studies, said that Ghetto Shul has suffered drops in attendance, especially since the weather has gotten harsh and cold.
“It’s not just a synagogue, it’s more of an environment and a certain type of community and warmth. We lose that spark that attracts people without our own space,” said Tal.
Jeff Bicher echoed Tal’s sentiments. “Its main group of students are out-of-towners who are living in the McGill Ghetto,” said Bicher describing them as those who don’t have their own home community to fall back on, which makes having a space specifically in the Plateau even more important.
Full access to an independent space is crucial to the services the Shul provides, explained Emily Foxen-Craft, VP Internal, in a written statement to the board.
“Though it may seem materialistic to value a building so much, it really ties together so many elements of the grassroots organization of Ghetto Shul, unifying its members, new and old, to a specific place which they can associate with their private and communal exploration of Judaism,” wrote Foxen-Craft.
The Shul’s latest residential predicament comes after a long struggle to secure its own space. Two years ago, a zoning issue forced the Shul out of a building on Lorne Avenue in the Ghetto, where it had been running its operations since it was founded in 2000. In the following year, it continued its activities out of Hillel House, which hosts Jewish holiday programming year-round on Stanley.
Last August, Ghetto Shul finally got a home of its own when a new five-year lease was initiated at a location on Parc, near Milton. According to Erin Kizell, VP External at the Shul and U1 Arts, the space was acquired with “the generous support of Hillel Montreal.”
After three months on Parc, the group was forced to relocate again after the building next door to theirs was torn down, exposing pipes that froze, broke, and flooded the space. Bicher remained optimistic that Hillel Montreal would soon recover financially.
“We are still looking, connecting with potential donors,” said Bicher. “We aren’t giving up.”
Kizell was sympathetic to Hillel Montreal’s financial situation.
“Funding was never guaranteed by Hillel Montreal; there was no assurance we would be able to maintain the needed or same amount of donor funding.”
Hillel Montreal facilitated the donor funding that was given to Ghetto Shul for their leases and Rabbi salaries. The Shul’s other sources of funding include Central Address for Jewish Philanthropy and Community Service, a Montreal-based organization that works to support grassroots Jewish communities throughout the world.
Tal hoped the Shul would find a new space with a lower rent somewhere in the Ghetto.

McGill professors support call for Israeli boycott
Prompted by recent events in the Gaza Strip, dozens of McGill professors and employees have signed a petition in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, and an academic boycott of Israeli institutions.
Professors from Concordia University, Université de Quebec À Montreal, Université de Montreal, and numerous other postsecondary institutions in Quebec have also signed the document.
The petition, published last Saturday in Le Devoir, was compiled in response to a January 22 call by the Palestinian Federation of Unions of University Professors and Employees urging academics world-wide to denounce the Israeli occupation and its repeated violations of international law.
Many of the petition’s signatories expressed exasperation with Israeli policies, including the continued blockade of Gaza. They felt boycotts could be a peaceful way of pressuring the Israeli government to comply with international law.
“What else is there?” asked McGill professor and signatory Abby Lippman. “The UN has provided resolutions; Israel hasn’t listened. The world has condemned what’s been done; Israel hasn’t listened. This is a peaceful way of saying ‘No.’”
Adrienne Hurley, another McGill professor, supported the petition because of Israeli air strikes on Palestinian- and United Nations-sponsored schools, and an Israeli ban on reporters, researchers, and aid workers to the Gaza Strip.
“To me, it’s very important to send the message that this is not acceptable, that knowledge is important,” she said.
The academic boycott, perhaps the most controversial aspect of the campaign, seeks to isolate Israeli universities on the international scene. According to the BDS website, such institutions help maintain the intellectual theories and justifications that underpin the occupation and Israeli policies of discrimination.
Lippman said the initiative is not directed at individual Israeli scholars. She noted, though, that the boycott would prevent McGill from partnering with Israeli universities, or collaborating on research projects.
McGill Professor Wael Hallaq felt that Israeli academics have a moral responsibility to speak out against the state’s treatment of the Palestinian population.
“Academics are a little more detached from the world of politics. Israeli scholars…are the only group of scholars in the world that I know that serve in the army systematically. And at the same time they are scholars. They can make a difference,” Hallaq explained. They can, for example, become refuseniks. They can criticize; they are in powerful positions. They are also judges…. They are in government committees…. They can work from the inside…. If they cannot do this much then all of us are in trouble.”
Launched in 2005, BDS is modelled after a campaign applied to apartheid-era South Africa, and is supported by more than 170 Palestinian organizations. It attempts to pressure the Israeli government to end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and to dismantle the Separation Barrier. The campaign also calls on Israel to recognize the rights of Palestinian-Israelis, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
Support for the BDS initiative has gained ground in Quebec. In June, L’Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante (ASSÉ), a student union representing over 42,000 students, voted to actively endorse the campaign. The Federation National des Enseignants et Enseignantes du Quebec (FNEEQ-CSN) has also voted to support the boycott.

Speaker urges recognition of aboriginal influence on Canadian law
Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul addressed the aboriginal influence on Canadian culture and legal tradition Tuesday at the McGill Law Journal Annual Lecture, which attracted an audience of 250-300 people, necessitating the creation of an “overflow” room where his talk was simulcast.
Saul asserted at the McGill Law Journal Annual Lecture that Canada’s legal culture was based on aboriginal ideas of egalitarianism, welfare, and justice – and not on tensions between the French civil code and English common law. He eschewed the current model of Canadian history that focuses on the French and English as the country’s founders.
“There’s a classic thing to say, that we’re a more European country than the States, but we’re the least European country in the [western] world,” he said. “Canada is built on three founding pillars: anglophones, francophones, and aboriginals.”
Saul argued that Canadian concepts such as single-tier health care, legal aid, and even multiculturalism cannot be traced to Europe, but rather to First Nations’ philosophies that the country’s migrants inherited. The uniqueness of Canadian geography makes many European concepts irrelevant, he contended, noting that early settlers had to give up the wheel – what many Westerners consider a sign of “civilization” – for the canoe when traversing the Canadian Shield.
“Everything that works in Canada cannot be traced back to Europe,” he said. “Every time we try to do something European, we do conscription, or ban languages, or racism.”
Shane Murphy, U3 Law and English executive editor for the McGill Law Journal, was happy to see a speaker challenge the diametric view of law that’s commonly taught.
“We wanted to invite someone in here who would challenge our view of Canadian legal history,” Murphy said. “Although we’re taught aboriginal law at McGill, it’s almost seen as separate from Canadian law.”
In his lecture, Saul also accused the media of tokenizing its coverage of indigenous groups by focusing on pity-inducing stories about alcoholism or suicide rates, trying to make the aboriginal question disappear. He related the current political climate in aboriginal communities to that of the francophones in the 1960s.
“If you look at the past 50 years of Canadian history, it’s been about the attempt to reestablish the power of the francophone pillar,” he said. “One can say that it’s been pretty successful, whether the country falls apart or not, because the francophone fact has been reasserted. But that other pillar, the original pillar, has been virtually ignored.”
Saul’s theories resonated with many audience members.
Michael Doxtater, McGill’s only First Nations professor, said Saul’s ideas will gain more traction as the country moves into recession.
“You’re going to have to completely rethink the way the economy runs, the way wealth is distributed, the way we demonstrate our humanity to each other,” he said, adding that Canadians can find wisdom in indigenous models of trade networks and commerce as the monetary system begins to collapse.
While Mae Jane Nam, U2 Law, was impressed by Saul’s reconception of Canadian history, she said his belief that Canadians are eager to embrace a new model of their identity is optimistic.
“Even in our school, with issues surrounding our Chancellor [referring to pre-European Canada as ‘un pays de sauvages’], a lot of us are very hesitant to acknowledge the contribution of civilizations that existed before European colonization and imperialism,” she said.
But Nam said she believes that with a lot of re-education – which begins with intellectuals like Saul disseminating their ideas – the three-pillar model of Canadian identity could someday become mainstream.

McGill contests the union’s formation
The Association of McGill Undergraduate Student Employees (AMUSE) decided to suspend its bid for formal union accreditation from the Quebec Labour Board last week, after McGill issued a formal letter to the Board, threatening to contest their application.
“We decided that fighting McGill…would be a waste of our energy, and we could do more by continuing our campaign, and then reapply later,” said AMUSE member and U3 History student Dan Pudjak.
The grounds for McGill’s objection, according to Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning), was AMUSE’s manner of categorizing student workers into student, non-academic – like gym employees or floor fellows – and casual workers; McGill proposed a division into just non-academic and casual workers.
Mendelson added that McGill did not find the union sustainable because certain job titles could be filled by non-undergraduate employees.
“The union defines a community of interest; they define a group that they think is an appropriate group…[but] we have jobs where one person is a student, and another is not,” said Mendelson, indicating that McGill was prepared to propose new categories to the Board.
“The employer can accept that that’s an appropriate group, or it can present an alternative,” he said.
AMUSE member Jacob Feygin, however, thought McGill’s objection was just a delay tactic.
“We think the union we submitted is perfectly viable, and that McGill is just delaying us by trying to challenge us,” Feygin said.
This was not the first time that McGill has obstructed AMUSE’s efforts to gain accreditation. This fall, when the union was seeking signatures necessary for its application to the Board, McGill withheld lists of student employees, for legal and privacy reasons. Working without a formal list, AMUSE organizers held events – like free beer and pizza nights – to identify students who worked for the University.
Further complications with the application arose because the entire AMUSE union did not apply for accreditation at once, as the organizers decided to only submit a bid for the non-academic staff section where they had enough signatories.
According to Max Silverman, former SSMU VP External and a current AMUSE organizer, it was not appropriate for the union to apply on behalf of other internal units – such as casual and academic workers – because they did not acquire sufficient signatures from those areas.
Feygin explained that ultimately AMUSE decided to regroup and submit their bid later this year, when they have enough signatures from all sections.
“The game plan is to let it be known that AMUSE is here and AMUSE is going to be staying,” said Pudjak. “Even though that last court battle didn’t happen, there will be future court battles, and we’re not going anywhere.”

TA shows  movies while prof remains ill in India after conference
The students of RELG 353 – Ghandi: His Life and Thought – have been without their professor all semester, and some in the class of around 80 students are concerned that the material presented in their professor’s absence has not prepared them for the upcoming midterm.
Professor Arvind Sharma, an authority on Hinduism and the life and beliefs of Mahatma Ghandi in, was scheduled to miss the first few weeks of the semester in order to attend a conference in India, but fell ill and has, up to this point, been unable to secure a flight back to Montreal.
Ellen Aitken, Dean of the Faculty of Religious Studies, wanted to assure students that despite Sharma’s prolonged absence, the course plan was being followed.
“Professor Sharma was in India for a conference the Faculty [of Religious Studies] was co-sponsoring,” said Aitken. “Suitable arrangements were made for covering the first few weeks of class.”
Lecture time, for the past five weeks, has been filled with film screenings on Hinduism and Jainism – including the feature-film Ghandi – and multiple lectures given by teaching assistant (TA) Tom Pokinko.
“We’ve had class discussions, and I asked the students to write a personal response on two aspects of the film [Ghandi],” said Pokinko, as examples of different lecture activities.
Yet some students questioned the relevancy of the material they were watching to the course as a whole.
“What are we paying for if there’s no prof? We could watch the movies on our own,” said a student in the class, who asked to remain anonymous. “The class cost $600, and $200 [a third of the semester] of that wasn’t going to anything.”
As of yesterday, Professor Katherine Young has assumed Professor Sharma’s role, a replacement Aitken said the Faculty was fortunate to secure.
“Most universities don’t have multiple professors in single subjects,” said Aitken. “We were lucky that someone like Professor Young, who is familiar with the information, was available during class time.”
Aitken also supported the instruction given by Pokinko, a PhD student in Hindu and Jain ethics, who ran the class for the first third of the semester, providing several lectures, organizing movies, and distributing assignments, all under the instruction of Sharma.
“Often grad students and TAs know the course material best, and are in the best position to follow the course plan,” Aitken said.
Pokinko added that the material presented in class was approved by the absent professor.
“I’ve been in email contact with [Professor Sharma],” said Pokinko. “He advised me to lecture on Ghandi’s life and the course outline, interspersed with various concepts relevant to the course.”
Some students said that the quality of their learning had not been affected.
“Everything was really fine,” said Emily Blake, U2 International Development Studies. “We understand why the prof has been away, and the TA has been great.”
Still, with the midterm approaching students expressed concern over the content of examinations due to the relative lack of time spent on lecture. Because RELG 353 is a high level course, students committed to majoring or minoring in Religious Studies feel particularly worried.
“A decent amount of the [students in the] class are specialized,” said the student. “For most people, it’s not just an elective.”
The midterm has since been changed to a take-home examination. Aitken believed that there has been good instruction in the course, given the circumstances, and that the course has been running as planned.
“Generally, courses gel at various points [and] many students don’t understand how various concepts fit together until a few weeks into the semester,” said Aitken. “When the professor returns, he will be able to tie the first few weeks of the course together.”

Money lost, bookkeeper sued, recall petition thwarted, fingers pointed
The Concordia Student Union (CSU) is embroiled in yet another scandal, this time involving a $500,000 deficit, a lawsuit against its former bookkeeper, and a petition to recall the entire executive that has been taken to the Judicial Board.
The union is suing Marie Lyonnais, a former CSU bookkeeper and Chartered Accountant, for a total amount of $363,238.25 for alleged “negligent behaviour.”
Executives, both current and from as far back as 2000, have been pointing fingers at each other and Lyonnais for financial mismanagement – that, according to the CSU, caused the union to incur a combined deficit of nearly $500,000 for the fiscal years ending May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2007.
“These kids don’t know what the hell they’re doing,” said a former executive who wished not to be named. “This is very, very serious […] This is not something you play around with.”
But current CSU president Keyana Kashfi redirected the blame to past executives.
“They didn’t know where they [stood], but they just kept spending,” Kashfi said, “So as long as their cheques cleared, they kept spending.”
When Fauve Castagna, former CSU VP Finance, started her term in the summer of 2007, an audit hadn’t been filed by the CSU since the 2004-2005 academic year. The CSU’s bank accounts were also seized by the Canadia Revenue Agency just one month after her term started.
“Certain taxes hadn’t been paid, and the government was owed large sums of money in penalties and interest,” Castagna explained. “It was a nice way to come into office.”
The Gazette reported that the finances were so disorganized that forensic accountants hired for an audit by the union could not decide whether funds were improperly or fraudulently spent or managed. They eventually just gave up.
Ironically, Lyonnais, who is no longer a member of the Order of Quebec Chartered Accountants, was hired by Patrice Blais in 2000 to watch the finances after almost $200,000 was embezzled by a former CSU VP Finance.
Mohamed Shuriye, CSU president of 2005-2006, said he could not have foreseen the mismanagement by an employee, especially since he wasn’t the one in charge of the books.
“For this current executive to say that we should have questioned the numbers from a chartered accountant is unreasonable,” Shuriye said. “I’m appalled that this executive has the tenacity to question my judgment especially since they’re being recalled.”
Patrice Blais, the current Secretary and Treasurer of the Concordia Student Broadcasting Corporation, spearheaded a recall late last fall after the executive tried to hold a fee referendum in spite of numerous breaches of regulations and a Chief Electoral Officer who was no longer a student. But it was contested by Chair of Council Jessica Nudo, because she said nearly two-thirds of the 3,600 signatures were invalid. The Chair’s ruling was based on provisions in the Standing Regulations of the CSU that were approved only three days before the petition was submitted by bailiff at Nudo’s home, because she was consistently unavailable at school.
Hours after the ruling was issued, the Chair resigned. The issue is now at the Judicial Board, at which the current executive is arguing that it is too late in the semester, and too close to the general election, to remove them from power, and have a special election to fill the positions for the remainder of the terms.
“With an election scheduled for March, the CSU will say, ‘It’s too late now,’ even though they are the cause of the delay,” said Blais.
The Chair is now being filled on an interim basis by Brent Farrington, the current Deputy Chairperson for the Canadian Federation of Students, who was president of the CSU in 2003-2004. He was at the head of the slate of candidates whose succeeding incarnations have swept CSU elections ever since.
Judicial Board Chair Tristan Teixeira hopes for a speedy end to the recall case.
“Hopefully this case should be wrapped up by the second Monday in February,” Teixeira said.
The case of the CSU and CUSACorp, their corporation, against Lyonnais will be heard at the Palais de Justice on February 23 at 9 a.m., although a bailiff has yet to locate her to serve her with the lawsuit.
This article is a compilation of articles from The Link, a Concordia student paper, over the academic year, with files from Justin Giovannetti. Lyonnais and Nudo have been unavailable or refused to comment to The Link for at least a month as these stories have developed.
