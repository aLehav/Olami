Quebec group mobilizes against non-French speaking director
The recent appointment of Angelo Persichilli as Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s communications director has sparked controversy in Quebec.
Persichilli, a former Toronto Star columnist and editor of the Italian-language newspaper Corriere Canadese, speaks English and Italian but cannot speak French. This prompted a Quebec group to file a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission regarding the appointment.
Gilles Rheuame, from the Ligue québécoise contre la francophobie canadienne filed the complaint with the Commission on behalf of the Ligue, calling the appointment and previous comments made by Persichilli “absolutely unacceptable.” He claims that the fact Persichilli is unable to speak French violates the rights of francophone Canadians.
“It is against the constitution, against Canadian laws governing official languages and violates federal rules about linguistic aspects of civil servants of Canada,” said Rheaume.
Section 20 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom states: “Any member of the public in Canada has the right to communicate with, and to receive available services from, any head or central office of an institution of the Parliament or government of Canada in English or French.”
Rheaume continued, “We feel that Francophone Canadians, especially those who are members of the media, will not have access to the Prime Minister’s communications director.”
The Ligue has also criticized Persichilli for comments he made in April 2010 Toronto Star column. In the column, Persichilli writes, “Many are tired of the annoying lament from a province that keeps yelling at those who pay part of its bills and are concerned by the over-representation of francophones in our bureaucracy, our Parliament and our institutions.”
In the same article Persichilli also argues that “special treatment given to Quebec is balkanizing this country so that all provinces are starting to consider Ottawa only as an ATM machine.”
Rheuame is calling for Harper to fire Persichilli, saying that the comments made in his columns are “pure racism” and that “if we spoke this way about any other group in Canada in the same way he talks about the French Canadians in Quebec it would be a scandal.”
Persichilli told the Globe and Mail he will treat Quebeckers with the “utmost respect,” and that he will learn French, though he does not know how long it will take.
According to Rheuame, mobilization against Persichilli’s appointment will continue. “We will continue to inform the other French countries in the world who are members with Canada of the [International Organization of the Francophonie] of this appointment,” he said.
Persichilli’s first day in office was last Tuesday. He took over the position from former communications director Dimitri Soudas, who announced that he would be stepping down in June.
Persichilli could not be reached for comment by The Daily.

AUS Council votes not to sign memo
Morton Mendelson will keep his job for another two years after his contract was extended this past summer.
The decision to extend Mendelson’s term as Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) has drawn the ire of student politicians, who have begun circulating a memo denouncing what they deem a lack of consultation about the matter.
On June 5, the SSMU executive sent a memo to Provost Anthony Masi inquiring about a committee to review Mendelson’s contract.
After SSMU sent a follow-up memo on June 17, Masi replied in a memo that he had made the decision to extend the contract, and that it was approved by Principal Heather Munroe-Blum.
Masi’s memo also promises to “work closely with the SSMU in assessing the structure and functioning of the Office of the Deputy Provost in assuring this important position at McGill University be clearly defined so that we will be able to find an appropriate candidate to fill it when Prof. Mendelson steps down in 2013.”
SSMU President Maggie Knight said that the student union executive “was expecting there to be student representation on a committee…in keeping with established practice.”
The McGill Charter of Students’ Rights states that the university “has an obligation to ensure that administrative decisions are made, or actions taken, with fair regard for the known and legitimate interests of students.”
In response to the contract extension, the presidents of 11 McGill undergraduate societies, along with SSMU, have signed a memo condemning a lack of consultation.
The memo is addressed to Masi and will be sent today. It identifies a “lack of trust in existing consultation processes.”
“Engaging in consultation about a key issue affecting students only after a decision has been made does not appear to be acting to remedy,” the memo reads.
Mendelson became the first-ever Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) when the position was created in 2006.
According to the McGill website, the position is “a central liaison among the University’s senior administration, faculties, student organizations and Senate, with a view to ensuring that impact on student life and learning is factored into decision-making.”
Mendelson was a target of student anger last year, as the administration’s primary point person after the closure of the Architecture Café.  The cafe was the only student-run eatery on campus, and was operated by the Architecture Students Association.
Notably, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) declined to sign the letter. While AUS President Jade Calver would not comment on her executive’s opposition to signing the memo, several sources from AUS have said that much of the opposition to the memo had to do with the AUS’s tense relationship with Mendelson.
Last February, after years of AUS financial mismanagement came to light, Mendelson withheld $90,000 in student fees from the society.
The minutes from Wednesday’s AUS council meeting were not available before The Daily went to print early Saturday morning.
AUS councilor John Cohen was one of six people who voted in favor of signing the memo. 24 councilors voted against signing the memo.
“AUS is certainly in a difficult position, and I understand what Jade [Calver] said about the need to tread softly with regard to Provost Mendelson, but that doesn’t mean that the values need to be compromised,” Cohen said, referring to student consultation.
Mendelson was unavailable for comment Friday, due to administration meetings.

Boroughs impose fines and spark debate over intellectual property rights
In light of the City of Montreal’s recent efforts to crack down on vandalism, at least two of Montreal’s boroughs, those of Côte Des Neiges-Notre Dame de Grâce (CDG-NDG) and Saint-Léonard, have begun charging fines of up to  $4,000 to business owners who do not remove, or “buff” graffiti in a timely fashion. Individual home owners may be charged as much as $2,000, and, if caught, the artists themselves may be fined up to $100.
This system has some members of the community upset, claiming that to fine the property owner is a misdirection of punishment away from the lawbreaker.
“People don’t like the fact that they didn’t ask to have graffiti on their building and now they’re going to get a fine because they have graffiti on their house or their garage,” said Sebastien Pitre, owner of a graffiti removal company called Solutions Graffiti in an interview with The Daily.
Pitre, who receives about 70 percent of his business from the City of Montreal and its boroughs, said that to prevent graffiti, the issue needs to be taken seriously.  “Right now some people think [graffiti] is very, very bad, but some people think it’s just a little painting on the wall,” he said.
Pitre spoke about how to unify the perception of graffiti and make changes. “First of all they need to make a real law, make people respect that law and be very strict… Put more police officers on the graffiti problem and really take care of it. Everybody’s talking about graffiti, but nobody’s taking real action about it.”
The fines are the latest effort in a city-wide battle which has been raging since the 1990s. In 2007, Montreal spent $1.3 million removing graffiti.
In other boroughs, such as Verdun, police have begun to send bills covering clean-up costs to adult offenders and to the parents of youth offenders. While this solution has been met with less opposition than the fines introduced in CDN-NDG and Saint-Léonard, it has met with some opposition. According to a Montreal graffiti artist who goes by the name Sohoe, “They’ll charge a few hundred dollars to buff a wall that would take about thirty dollars to do with latex paint.”
Some also remain sceptical that the threat of serious fines will be effective in reducing graffiti.
“A crackdown is just a way for the authorities to give the impression that they’re addressing the problem, but I sincerely doubt that it would do anything,” an anonymous graffiti artist told The Daily. “For me, it doesn’t change anything. It’s an urban legend, a news headline to reassure the public that everything’s under control, but graffiti is impossible to control.”
While the City’s crackdown on graffiti has prompted property owners and graffiti artists to enter into debate over which party owns the graffiti and should therefore be held responsible for fines, a second long-standing debate around graffiti has been reopened concerning the intellectual property rights of graffiti artists. A panel addressing this issue was hosted by McGill’s Faculty of Law in 2009.
“They assume [the artists] are ignorant people with no means to legal representation,” Sterling Downey, a street artist and publisher of Under Pressure magazine, told the McGill Reporter in 2009.
“The problem is they don’t have any authorization to put graffiti on the building,” said Pitre. “How can they come after me saying that I’m not allowed to remove their graffiti if they were not allowed to put the graffiti there in the first place? If that ever happens to me, I’m going to call my lawyer and have fun with that.”
“Sometimes it may look like art,” said Francine Morin, a spokesperson for Verdun borough mayor Claude Trudel, in an interview with The Daily, “but they don’t have permission to put it there, so it’s not art.”
Some artists, such as Sohoe, remain unconvinced that anything can be done to preserve their intellectual property rights.
“I probably should say that I feel like my art’s being stolen or something…” Sohoe told The Daily, “but I think in all reality, unless you have permission to do that, then you’ve sort of given up your right to take ownership of that work… How’s someone supposed to come and ask you? Even if they had to get permission, there’d be no way of getting it without proving that you did this illegal thing.”
Attempts to reconcile the city’s wish to reduce vandalism and the rights of the artists to self-expression have been made in the past; Montreal is home to five legal graffiti walls. However, as one artist who preferred to remain anonymous pointed out, “[Graffiti]’s in the streets and that’s where it has to be. Legal walls don’t work. They ruin the point of it.”
Sohoe is optimistic about the future of graffiti in Montreal.
“There’s always going to be graffiti,” he said. He noted the exclusivity of graffiti but said that he thinks there will always be people willing to do it.
“The graffiti writer, his thing is that he’s putting graffiti out there and yeah, the public may see it, but it’s also more for the graffiti community and the notoriety that he’s going to receive from the community for putting tags out there,” Sohoe added.

Construction of “District Griffin” continues despite residents’ doubts over its effectiveness at revitalizing the Griffintown neighbourhood.
Developer Devimco, along with its partners Group Cholette, the Fonds immobilier de solidarité (FTQ), and the City of Montreal, have invested $745 million in their plan to transform the area.
The first of three phases of construction is currently under way, and will include 1,375 condo units, a hotel, 200,000 square feet of office space, shops, and other businesses. The next two phases will include 1,045 residential units, as well as office and commercial space.
In 2008, Devimco proposed a much larger Projet Griffintown that would have brought, among other things, big box stores and a concert hall to the neighbourhood, but the group altered their proposition after strong community opposition.
Jeffrey Dungen, spokesperson for the Committee for Sustainable Redevelopment of Griffintown, said he was happy the project has been scaled back.
“But the big problem is really that the zoning from Projet Griffintown still exists. That got voted in and hasn’t been repealed,” said Dungen.
Griffintown residents and city officials have also expressed concern over the number of affordable and social housing units included in the developments. With the announcement of Phase One, Devimco promised to offer 206 affordable housing units and 275 social housing units, surpassing the City’s requirement that they comprise 30 per cent of new residential units.
While Devimco President Serge Goulet insisted that the company would honour its promises, community members like Dungen are upset over the placement of these units within a small triangle of land bordered by Ottawa, Murray and de la Montagne streets.
“The whole idea of having social housing is that it’s inclusive,” said Dungen, explaining that a lot of people took huge offense to this triangle becoming a “dumping ground for social housing,” while residents paying full rent in the taller towers will enjoy better views.
Residents have also voiced opposition to the high height allowances that developers have negotiated. Construction on the second phase of development is set to begin in November.
“The best we can do for the future phases is to ensure…that they tailor everything to the changing neighbourhood,” said Dungen. “We’re not going to go and jump in front of bulldozers or anything like that.”

Activists speak out against SPVM project mandated to monitor marginal groups 
Activists across Montreal are protesting a new Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) project, calling it a breach of fundamental human rights.
The project, made public in May, is called Guet des activités et des mouvements marginaux et anarchists (surveillance of marginal and anarchist groups’ activities), or GAMMA.
According to an SPVM press release, it was launched in response to the May 1st anti-capitalist demonstration in downtown Montreal at which six police officers were injured.
However, it is unclear when exactly the project began. Jacques Robinette, assistant Montreal police chief and head of special investigations, told the Gazette the project has been in existence since January.
Leftist student advocacy group Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) has filed a complaint to the Quebec Human Rights Commission about the alleged involvement of GAMMA in four student arrests, three of whom were ASSÉ executives.
The students were arrested for their involvement in protest activities on March 24 and 31, including the occupation of Finance Minister Raymond Bachand’s office.
ASSÉ has argued that the arrests stand in direct violation of section 10 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states: “Every person has a right to full and equal recognition and exercise of his human rights and freedoms, without distinction, exclusion or preference based on…political convictions.”
The SPVM responded in a press release, saying that “when crimes are being committed, however, SPVM officers must clearly take steps to stop them,” while reiterating their full support for the freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Quebec and Canadian Charters of Rights and Freedoms.
Coalition contre la repression et abus policier member Alexandre Popovic has filed similar complaints.
“In the provincial [charter] we have this protection against discrimination, including discrimination based on political conviction,” said Popovic.
“It’s not only an attack against anarchists and anyone else who defines themselves as an anarchist, but it’s also an attack against this section of the charter.”
Université du Québec à Montréal professor and anti-police brutality advocate, Francis Dupuis-Déri, told The Daily in an interview, “In principle, you are not supposed to be targeted for your political beliefs – that is not supposed to happen in a liberal society like Canada. That would not be fair according to the idea that the legal system is blind with regard to race, religion and political opinions.”
“The problem is not that you are an anarchist, but that you are smashing a window. So targeting a specific political ideology is problematic from this perspective,” he continued.
Speaking about recent protests, Dupuis-Déri said, “What should be known is that the reaction of police with regards to social movements is generally not motivated by what people do in the streets, but by who they are.”

MUNACA takes issue with administrator emails
Student and faculty mobilization marked the first day of conciliation meetings between McGill and its largest union last Thursday, whose meetings are now being mediated by a government official.
Students from the SSMU Mobilization Committee (Mob Squad),  members of the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), and a number of faculty members joined picket lines on Thursday morning in a show of solidarity with the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA).
The group marched from the Roddick Gates to the James Administration building and the Milton Gates, then crossed campus and joined picketers at McTavish and Sherbrooke.
Members of the Board of Governors (BoG) were also scheduled to meet on campus Thursday morning.
According to Maggie Knight, SSMU President and the undergraduate student representative on the BoG, the meeting was an orientation for new board members.
“You could hear [the march] when it came by the building, but there wasn’t really any formal acknowledgement of it,” Knight said.
AGSEM, with help from the Association of McGill Undergraduate Support Employees (AMUSE) and the Association of McGill University Research Employees (AMURE), organized a lunch at the picket line to show support for the strike and to increase visibility to their own members. The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), of which AGSEM is a member, has aided the union through both legal advising and funding for the luncheon. CSN also provided a sound system for Thursday, which AGSEM used at each picket line to speak in solidarity.
“We had a lot of volunteers come out to support our efforts,” said Jonathan Mooney, a member of AGSEM’s bargaining team. He estimated that more than fifty members attended to learn about AGSEM positions and issues.
A group of about 15 faculty members from the McGill Faculty Labour Action Group (MFLAG) were also among those in attendance. The group, which formed last week, is still deliberating as to future actions, but has plans to organize another group to march in picket lines for early next week.
Administration updates staff and students
Provost Anthony Masi sent a message to all McGill staff on Thursday outlining the University’s position on negotiations. The email – which MUNACA members did not receive because they are locked out of their McGill emails – included a disclaimer that Masi is “not at the bargaining table and this letter is not addressed, not designed to influence, members of the MUNACA bargaining unit.”
Masi then detailed 19 points that staff “should know” about negotiations. Among the first issues discussed were the fact that McGill has accumulated a deficit of over $100 million on its operating budget, and that a further $6 million will be added to the deficit for the fiscal year 2012 budget.
MUNACA president Kevin Whittaker said the union will be responding to the email, and will prepare a formal letter to address some of the issues raised. The McGill Inter-union Council, comprised of MUNACA, AGSEM, AMUSE and AMURE, are also preparing a separate statement in response to the email.
“There are legal restrictions on how communication [about negotiations] is to transpire,” Whittaker said.
“From what we see Mr. Masi doing, he’s being careful, [but] it may be borderline because he’s not supposed to be negotiating outside of the negotiation table.”
An email from Michael Di Grappa, VP Administration and Finance, was then sent to all staff and students due to “feedback from faculty and students that the McGill community is seeking greater clarity” about disputes.
In a section of the email titled “pension differences,” Di Grappa states that “MUNACA has asked to be able to veto any changes to the [pension] plan,” which covers all employees of the University. Currently, McGill’s offer is that they will agree to consult systematically with MUNACA and other employee groups.
Whittaker took issue with Di Grappa’s wording, explaining that MUNACA is asking for “a committee that has equal say, so that the only way to come to an agreement is with consensus. So that means everybody, if you want to call it veto power, would have that power. [Veto power] would not be unique to us.”
MUNACA suspects scab labour
Di Grappa’s email also reminds students and staff that certain managers are able to complete work normally done by MUNACA workers, and that “McGill is respecting those provisions of the law.”
MUNACA’s website has a form for reporting suspected scab labour; Whittaker said that the union has received “a huge number” of reports. According to the Quebec Labour Code, once reports are received, the Minister of Labour may send an investigator to decide whether provisions to protect strikers’ work have been broken. Government investigations into MUNACA complaints began on Thursday.
