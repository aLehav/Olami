Students call for more transparency in the outcomes of sexual assault cases
On October 29, The Student Society of McGill University (SSMU) announced that they had formally signed on to a petition created by student delegates at UQAM which calls on the Quebec National Assembly to repeal the policy known as the “code of silence,” which prohibits schools from publicizing the sanctions faced by those accused of sexual assault. The proposed change would require the administrations of CEGEPs and universities to be fully transparent with those who have experienced sexual violence about the process and outcome for handling a complaint regarding sexual violence and to divulge the sanctions applied to aggressors.
In 2017, the Quebec National Assembly adopted the Act to prevent and combat sexual violence in higher education institutions (CQLR c P-22.1). This Act, known as Bill 151 before passing, provides measures to prevent and manage sexual violence in college and university settings, and requires the adoption of institutional policies against sexual violence. However, the Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information (CQLR c A- 2.1) prohibits CEGEP and university administrations from disclosing the penalties imposed on an attacker targeted by a complaint. In other words, while this might not affect the investigation of an instance of sexual violence, survivors who have filed complaints against their aggressors will never know if sanctions have been imposed on their aggressor, nor will they know the nature of these sanctions.
“This code of silence is another example of how the institution protects the aggressor while keeping the survivor in the dark,” says Brooklyn Frizzle, VP of University Affairs. According to them, “Under the act, as it stands now, survivors will never truly know how or if justice was carried out – while the reputation of the aggressor is protected behind confidentiality.”
With the Act in its present form, survivors are discouraged from filing official complaints with their institutions, Frizzle explained. “All evidence shows that [the code of silence] contributes to […] lack of trust in institutional channels,” claim the authors of the petition; “It keeps the person most affected by the complaint from accessing crucial information for their healing process and to their sense of safety at school and/or work.” As a result, many survivors choose not to go through official channels to obtain justice and seek protection. Maeve Botham, the Anti-Sexual Violence Mobilization and Advocacy Commissioner for SSMU, told the Daily, “A lot of the times that people do make reports it’s because they’re looking for specific outcomes or they’re feeling like their safety is affecting their ability to live their lives and be a part of campus life.” If survivors are not made aware of outcomes that may grant them safety and justice, they are less likely to report it through the university. According to Botham, “It’s a big limiting factor into really feeling like they’re gaining back safety, or gaining resolution or closure.”
The National Assembly’s Committee on Institutions is currently studying Bill 64, an Act that modernizes legislative provisions in regards to the protection of personal information. In their petition, UQAM student delegates are calling for an amendment to Bill 64 to “force post-secondary institutions to divulge the sanctions applied to aggressors.” This amendment would force universities and CEGEPs to be transparent about how, or even if, complaints of sexual violence are processed and resolved. “Doing so would allow survivors of sexual violence access to informations which many consider essential for their healing process and overall sense of safety,” says Frizzle.
As of now, the online petition is over halfway to its goal of 5,000 signatures. Amending the Act, however, will not erase all of the obstacles to justice and safety faced by survivors of sexual violence. “If everything goes perfectly in even a confidential investigation process, and it rarely does, the entire process has the potential to be incredibly retraumatizing for survivors,” says Frizzle, “Even then, there’s no promise the university – or any institution – will act on their complaint.”
When this policy was revised two years ago, McGill was supportive of dismissing the “code of silence,” but claimed their hands were tied because of Quebec’s privacy laws, per Botham. Now that these laws are subject to change, it will be up to the University to decide how and if they will revise their own policies. “I’d like to see them step up and take action on this so that it’s not just students having to drive this change, but we see institutions take responsibility and take action to do this too,” says Botham.
According to Botham, future reforms should go beyond the traditional ways of responding to harms, specifically looking to make these responses more intersectional, and moving towards restorative instead of punitive justice. While breaking the code of silence and amending Bill 64 is certainly a step in the right direction, she says, more work is to be done.

McGill and Quebec Must Denounce Bill 21, MSA Says
In June 2019, Quebec introduced Bill 21, which banned anyone with a government job – including teachers, police officers, and lawyers amongst many others – from wearing religious symbols of any kind in an alleged attempt to “protect the laicity of the state.” In other words, the goal of the bill is to ensure every aspect of provincial affairs is secular. Much of the support for the bill is founded in islamophobia, a poll by the Association of Canadian Studies found – while the bill targets all religions, it disproportionately affects marginalized groups, particularly Muslims. 
On Monday, November 2, dozens of students gathered at the Palais de Justice de Montréal at 8 AM. The Daily spoke to Mustafa Fakih, President of the Muslim Student Association (MSA) at McGill, who said the demonstration was held to make sure they are listened to, and to hold the government accountable. Trials challenging the constitutionality of the bill are taking place in the Superior Court of Quebec, but Fakih wants to ensure that the issue is not overlooked – explaining that with the constant news of COVID and the US election, “the last thing [he wants] is the public forgetting how a significant part of their community continues to be marginalized in the name of secularism.” According to Fakih, the protest was successful, especially in reminding the public that the fight against Bill 21 is not over.
According to the bill’s supporters, Global News reports, the goal of Bill 21 is to destigmatize religious symbols. However, many studies have shown that the creation of an “us and them” sentiment between religions – as Bill 21 does – intensifies prejudices between groups.  Further, Fakih emphasized that  “[the bill’s] implementation has legitimized the feeling of hatred” as the province has essentially endorsed these prejudicial feelings. However, Fakih says that Quebec’s religious communities have accumulated a significant increase in support than they had before the implementation of the bill: “Having this bill in writing has proven and publicized the oppression religious communities face in Quebec.” 
McGill University did not show up for its Muslim student population, Fakih maintained. In a statement made before Bill 21 was passed into law, the university issued an overview of the bill while reassuring students that the bill would not affect any of McGill’s policies or practices, despite protests early last year proving otherwise. According to Faikh, instead of the statement providing a sense of support, the message only amplified the administration’s “disconnect with what students are experiencing on the ground.” After considerable prodding from activist groups on campus, including MSA, McGill issued another statement after the bill passed, expressing some concern on the impact the bill would have on job opportunities for students in the future. Since the statement McGill’s action has stalled, Fakih emphasizes, “concern without action is meritless.” 
As a result of McGill’s response, several McGill staff, students, and student organizations formed the coalition McGill Against Bill 21 which planned a motion to submit to the McGill Senate, mandating an official denouncement of the bill by the university. The motion would include concrete steps to stand behind students affected, but the pandemic and the university’s closure leaves the coalition’s plans on hold indefinitely.
