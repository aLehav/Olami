Future uncertain as member associations hold disaffiliation referenda
The Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) faced yet another setback on Friday when the Vice-Secretary General of Communications and Internal Relations announced his resignation in a letter addressed to the student association. Guillaume Fortin, who was elected in May 2013, stated in the letter that he thought he “could work in this degrading situation, but I can’t anymore.”
Fortin’s resignation is just one of several pressing problems within the student roundtable, which has seen tension between members throughout the year. Recently, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) took first steps to leave the organization, with a motion passed during the February 6 SSMU Council creating a referendum question asking SSMU members whether they wish to leave the roundtable association.
SSMU VP External Samuel Harris noted that since the University of Sherbrooke’s graduate student society, Regroupement des étudiants de maîtrise, de diplôme et de doctorat de l’Université de Sherbrooke (REMDUS) voted to disaffiliate from TaCEQ this semester, SSMU is one of three student associations left in the organization.
“For TaCEQ the thing is, because REMDUS has already left, there are only three associations left, including McGill […] it’s kind of falling apart,” Harris told The Daily.
Additionally, with the loss of REMDUS, SSMU has lost its major ally in the roundtable association.
Regarding Fortin’s resignation, Harris said, “In terms of his job of communications, there really isn’t that much to do communications-wise – or even politically – because [TaCEQ] is starting to wrap up.”
Fortin stated in his resignation letter that one of the issues prompting his resignation was the cancellation of an inter-association congress originally planned for the fall of 2013.
In an interview with The Daily, Fortin addressed the issue, explaining, “We were putting a lot on this congress to make things better at TaCEQ, but in the end it got cancelled, so many people were sad and mad about this.”
Fortin noted that after four months of preparation, the cancellation caused tensions between member student associations.
“SSMU and REMDUS were pretty pissed off about [the congress] and it made for a very unpleasant meetings.”
According to Fortin, this also caused a roadblock for the rest of the work TaCEQ could have done this year.
With Fortin’s resignation, there are only two secretary generals left, but since one of the remaining secretary generals, Xavier Laberge, is from REMDUS, he will also be gone at the end of the month.
“In terms of actual secretary generals, as of March 1, there is only going to be one of three that started the year,” Harris told The Daily.However, he noted that Laberge will be hired back as a paid employee without his former title, as his role of finance and administration is critical to the organization.
Harris said he would be very surprised if TaCEQ elected a new person to fill Fortin’s absence.
“I think everyone kind of agrees there is no point in doing communications and social media if TaCEQ has nothing to announce,” a feeling that Fortin himself echoed, stating, “Right now with the current state and current situation with TaCEQ […] there was nothing really going on with the communication side of TaCEQ.”
As to the future of TaCEQ, Fortin explained that along with SSMU, one of TaCEQ’s two other member organizations, L’Association des étudiantes et des étudiants de Laval inscrits aux études supérieures (ÆLIÉS), will be holding a referendum on disaffiliation in February, leaving only the Confédération des associations d’étudiants et étudiantes de l’Université Laval (CADEUL) in the roundtable.
“It is pretty much the end for TaCEQ, I think,” he said.
SSMU members will vote on whether or not to leave TaCEQ during the SSMU referendum period, from March 14 to 21.

Student Assessment Policy questioned at Senate
After years of effort on the part of advocates and students alike, on February 19, Senate approved the creation of an Indigenous Studies minor, along with several new academic programs as part of the 453rd Report of the Academic Policy Committee (APC).
The meeting also saw direct action against the People, Processes & Partnerships (PPP) plan to reorganize the Leacock building. Just before the meeting started, demonstrators from Support Our Staff-McGill (SOS) handed out letters addressed to Principal Suzanne Fortier.
Gretchen King, a fourth-year doctoral student in Communication Studies, told The Daily that SOS-McGill wanted to address Fortier directly, because they felt that their concerns about the PPP plan have not been heard by Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi.
“We wanted to be sure that the principal knew that there were anti-democratic things happening within the Faculty of Arts, and decision-making that’s not transparent. And we think that kind of goes against an ethos [Fortier] has tried to establish,” King explained.
While the letter SOS-McGill distributed was not brought up during Senate discussions, Fortier later said in an email to The Daily that the Faculty of Arts, under the leadership of Manfredi, was well in place to manage its resources regarding the PPP.
Indigenous Studies program
Though it was not discussed extensively at the meeting, the APC report sought the approval of some new Masters and Bachelors programs, including the new minor concentration in Indigenous Studies.
The Indigenous Studies minor will be officially introduced in the 2014-15 academic year. The approval also opens the path for the creation of two new courses on Indigenous Studies.
“This is really the last stage of what has been an immensely long project, starting from the early 2000s and beating so many obstacles along the way [such as] lack of institutional support [and] lack of faculty support. It was really a big student push that catalyzed this,” said Arts Senator Claire Stewart-Kanigan in an interview with The Daily.
University Student Assessment Policy
Senate discussed the University Student Assessment Policy, which guarantees in section 6.1.3 that the maximum weight of a final examination in a regularly scheduled course shall be no more than 75 per cent of the course grade, with certain exceptions.
A motion passed at the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) General Assembly on February mandated SSMU to support the inclusion of an abbreviated outline of student academic rights, with an emphasis on the aforementioned section on course outlines.
With this in mind, student senators inquired about the steps the University is taking to promote awareness of and compliance to this policy, and how the University is ensuring that the said policy is being respected and followed.
In his official answer to the question, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens stated, “Normally, there ‘should’ be more than one evaluation for a course. However, as long as the evaluation is fair and reasonable, one single evaluation for a course is permitted.”
Speaking at Senate, SSMU VP University Affairs Joey Shea asked Dyens to point out the specific parts of the policy where these exceptions were explained.
“I can’t respond to that at the moment,” Dyens replied.
In an interview with The Daily, Stewart-Kanigan stated that she and the other senators were not satisfied with the answer given by Dyens.
“Other than Law and Medicine, there are no other exceptions included in the policy, and the language is [that] the assessment shall not be over 75 per cent. Whereas in Dyens’ response to our question […] he said that the language of the policy actually should not. That’s a misquoting of the policy,” Stewart-Kanigan explained.
“The effect of his answer was saying that the policy was more of a suggested guideline for professors,” she continued.
Dyens told Senate that he would report findings and recommendations back to Senate through the APC.

Unions demand rationale behind calculations
As the deadline for pay equity adjustments fast approaches later this month, many McGill employees have expressed concern with salary adjustment calculations. The adjustments largely affect the salaries of McGill employees in lower-paid, female-dominated positions.
Pay equity refers to the equalization of pay between male- and female-dominated jobs performing work of similar value, as per the Pay Equity Act.
In February 2013, the University met with the Pay Equity Commission and committed to retroactively adjusting all employee salaries dating back to 2001, when the pay equity adjustments were initially introduced. This decision was made in response to a complaint filed by the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) concerning how the adjustments were initially calculated.
The retroactive adjustments, made in compliance with the Pay Equity Act, must be made by February 28, one year after the University’s agreement with the Commission.
“Those that were subject to retroactivity will receive lump sums, going back as far as 2001,” MUNACA President Kevin Whittaker told The Daily.
On February 14, the University began making retroactive payments and sending letters informing employees of the amount of the adjustments. Since then, many McGill employees have expressed dissatisfaction with the pay equity adjustments.
To start, the letters that employees received allegedly contained only the magnitude of the adjustment and no indication as to how it had been calculated.
“There are a lot of people with complicated situations who’ve moved around in positions,” one MUNACA employee told The Daily. “I guess that makes it even more complicated to track, but if you don’t have a formula […] how do you know you’re not being short-changed?”
According to an email from Association of McGill University Research Employees (AMURE) president Sean Cory, McGill told unions in an email that, “The amount of money that people received could go up or down and to keep it in mind that the money might have to be returned.”
“That upset a lot of people as there are no clear reasons why the money people received might be decreased,” he added.
Furthermore, AMURE and MUNACA only recently found out that McGill has only applied the pay adjustments to employees hired before 2005, leaving the unions displeased. “MUNACA and AMURE argue that it is the pay scales of the positions being adjusted and employees hired after 2005 should still receive the benefits of those adjustments,” Cory said.
To deal with complaints, McGill Human Resources (HR) is holding informational sessions, and will be dealing with individual concerns on a case-by-case basis.
On February 20, at one of the informational sessions provided by McGill HR, Alice Kieran, Director, Total Compensation at McGill HR, explained the formula used to calculate the adjustments.
Only female-dominated jobs – where 60 per cent or more of the employees are female – whose salaries fall below a “pay equity curve,” have their salaries adjusted. The curve is calculated by pitting job value – determined by a system that allots points based on characteristics of jobs such as qualifications and physical and mental effort – against the job’s maximum salary. McGill originally used a linear regression, which resulted in less of an adjustment for fewer jobs.
When asked why McGill has refrained from releasing the exact calculations it used for the pay equity adjustments, Kieran responded by saying that sending out specific numbers to each McGill employee was not feasible.
According to Whittaker, MUNACA will soon be meeting with McGill. “We’re still awaiting a time to meet with the University to discuss this, because they have a deadline of February 28 […] for us to come up with an agreement to cover the people that we have already identified they missed,” he said.

Event series pushes boundaries of conventional understandings of sex
This past Wednesday marked the beginning of the Union for Gender Empowerment (UGE) and Queer McGill’s (QM) sixth annual Rad Sex Week, which aims to broaden the conventional understanding of sexualities and to give people more exposure to radical sex. According to QM Resource Coordinator Sabine Grutter, radical sex is defined as “Any sex that is consensual, outside the norm, and not talked about in the mainstream media.”
Lily Hoffman, a member of the UGE, explained to The Daily that the organization helped put together the series because “we don’t feel like there is enough of a platform for alternative radical sexual conversation and practice to happen.”
“We wanted to give a platform to people who are already doing these things and working in these organizations, to share these ideas with other people, and also to give a chance to people to explore things that they maybe have never heard of,” Hoffman added.
Cameryn Moore, a playwright, performer, and sex activist, expressed appreciation for the series and its links between politics and sexuality.
“I think that radical politics give us a chance to really explore and be free,” said Moore. “Generally when we are moving outside of the box, and when we are taking our sexuality outside of the box, and […] consciously thinking about what it is that we want and how we want it, there is a lot of territory there to discover, and that’s very exciting.”
Similar to other initiatives on campus, such as Rez Project, Rad Sex Week is a mobilization against events such as Frosh. “Based on my own understanding [… and from] continuous involvement in McGill, [events] that happen like Carnival or Frosh set kind of a standard of what sexual culture at McGill is,” Hoffman said, adding that this standard was “pretty non-consensual, intersects a lot with drug and alcohol use, and is very heteronormative and sexist.”
Rad Sex Week also allows students to interact with communities outside of the McGill bubble. “There is not always a connection between Montreal and McGill, and it is really great when those organizations that try to reach out and people that are interested are able to meet,” Amanda Unruh, Student Health Services Health Promotion Coordinator, told The Daily. Examples of these organizations are Stella, a sex workers’ organization, and Head & Hands, a group that provides medical, social, and legal services to youth.
Even though initiatives focused on alternative sexual education can be found in Montreal, they usually tend to be located in specific milieus. One major reason for this could be the lack of funding or public interest.
“I think that most of these groups and organizations that work on specific sexual issues or sex education issues are often non-profit, and struggling for funding and sustainability,” Hoffman said. “They usually have a pretty awesome group of committed people who want to make that happen, but always struggle for resources and struggle for recognition and validation.”
Grutter added that it is important to keep room for those initiatives. “[These spaces] are important because they didn’t exist beforehand. And if we are not going to create them, they are not going to be available to be explored.”
Moore, who originally came from the U.S., stated that Montreal was a much more open space for alternative sex practices than other cities. “Generally, I think the [one reason why] there is not a lot of room is maybe that there is not as much of a nightlife, like lifestyle clubs or play party clubs,” Moore said. “There is not a whole lot of that happening [in other cities].”
As the founder of Sexploreum, an immersive art-sex project, Moore tries to open more spaces for people of all genders to explore their sexuality. She is responsible for events in Montreal such as the Masturbate-a-thon, “an annual solo sex play party, where it’s all genders, no touching anybody else,” and monthly events like the Porn Café, which features screenings of classic porn followed by discussions.
According to Unruh, it’s not only conversation on rad sex that is missing in Montreal; sex education in Quebec is greatly lacking. “[Reforms] in 2005 got rid of the class that used to teach sex education […] The health side of things ended up in the science class, so there still is this health and [sexually transmitted infection] prevention – which is mostly fear-based education, unfortunately – and pregnancy prevention, but nothing else.”
“There is no set curriculum that students have to go through; it happens in haphazard ways, sometimes not at all, and sometimes really awfully,” Hoffman added. “If the Quebec school system is not creating a way for people to learn these tools, or for people to be exposed to these things, then the only thing that we can trust that high school-aged youth will be exposed to are images of sex in the media, and depictions of sex, that for the most part are super sexist, heteronormative, racist, normative, and super non-consensual.”
“I can’t say that [sex is] going to save someone’s life necessarily, but it affects one’s quality of life and mental state so much,” said Moore. “That can transform people’s lives in a very serious way.”

Slate candidacy banned for upcoming elections
The Students’ Society of McGill University’s (SSMU) Legislative Council convened on February 20 to vote on a new mental health policy and electoral by-laws, and discuss the state of equity on Canadian campuses.
Council unanimously passed a motion to adopt the new mental health policy, created by an ad-hoc mental health committee that was formed at the beginning of this year.
Medicine representative David Benrimoh told The Daily that the policy was an important step forward. “It was very important to us that we had not just a philosophy and ideas, but a concrete set of steps that will lead to actual change […] it will serve as the foundation for a new mental health network.”
The policy will become the groundwork for a mental health network, comprised of existing student resources for mental health, and will focus on awareness, resources, advocacy, and solidarity.
The motion also included a coordinating five-year plan, which calls for the hiring of a SSMU mental health coordinator and the creation of a website, among other things.
After recent campus-wide debate over equity issues, Chelsea Barnett, one of three student SSMU Equity researchers, gave a presentation on the current findings of their review of the SSMU Equity institutions. The researchers compared SSMU to the student unions at six other universities across North America.
According to Barnett, “SSMU is doing a lot more than anyone else,” and SSMU Equity’s research discovered that “SSMU is the only school that we surveyed […] to have an equity policy of its own.”
She recommended to Council that, “An executive position be added that would oversee equity […] equity is on the forefront; it’s important for us.”
Ben Fung, Elections SSMU’s Chief Electoral Officer, came in to present a motion to amend several by-laws that apply to SSMU elections. The motion states that Elections SSMU created these changes based on research on 15 universities across Canada. Major changes included an updated campus publication definition, to encompass publications who publish more than four times a year, thus putting publications like the Bull and the Bear on par with The Daily and the McGill Tribune, and allowing them to make candidate endorsements.
A discussion was also sparked in Council regarding a specific by-law to ban slate candidacy. Slate candidacy is when multiple candidates run in multi-seat elections on a similar platform. Clubs and Services Representative Zachary Rosentzveig proposed an amendment to strike this by-law change from the motion. “Being able to be on a slate doesn’t favour any party over any other party, it simply allows candidates to work together to develop stronger possible proposals[…],” Rosentzveig said.
Fung insisted that, “The logistics of banning slate candidacy [are] much less [difficult] than the logistics of allowing slate candidacy […] It’s much harder to allow slate candidacy than to ban slate candidacy.”
The amendment was opposed and the by-law motion passed.

Federal changes complicate negotiations
Montreal’s crossing guards are seeking a new collective agreement with the city, arguing that the federal government’s employment insurance reform has left them at a disadvantage. Crossing guards in the city have been without a contract since August 2011.
The changes to employment insurance made by the federal government, in place since January 2013, require frequent claimants to undertake a “reasonable job search” to continue receiving benefits, and to accept any job for which they are qualified that offers at least 70 per cent of their previous wages. Seasonal workers, such as crossing guards, typically apply for employment insurance during the time that they do not work.
With the changes, Montreal’s approximately 650 crossing guards risk losing their unemployment benefits, as they do not work during the summer or the winter break while school is not in session.
“Now, they will have to actively seek work, even during the [winter] holiday season, to remain eligible,” Carole Bouchard, representative at the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told The Daily in French.
Moustapha, a crossing guard who works in western Montreal, has experienced the effects of the reform firsthand. “Last year, I didn’t get unemployment benefits during the summer. Usually we have it, but this year, I didn’t even submit an application, as I knew it would be complicated,” he told The Daily in French.
The crossing guards are requesting that Montreal’s mayor Denis Coderre grant them six paid vacation days during the holiday season, as is already the case for other city employees and for the majority of crossing guards across Quebec. This would allow them to evade the requirement to seek work during the winter holidays.
“We’re asking the employer to offer crossing guards paid statutory holidays, as it does for all the other salaried workers at the City of Montreal, to save them from [an] active job search during the winter holidays,” Bouchard told The Daily.
While negotiations are underway, the union’s demands have been met with indifference. “[Our request] has been refused. The employer says that as long as the government provides [employment insurance], it doesn’t have to give anything to the crossing guards,” added Bouchard.
For Fernande Tremblay, president of the Montreal union of crossing guards, these are reasonable demands. “We’re not asking Mr. Coderre for the moon. We wish to preserve our job and our income in spite of the restrictions on employment insurance. We’re asking for a little more acknowledgement of our work, which has children’s security at stake,” she wrote in French in a press release.
Coderre has refused to provide details on the negotiations. “We’ll make our position known at the negotiation table, as we do not wish to negotiate in public,” he wrote in French in an email sent to La Presse.
Finding a job during the summer is difficult for crossing guards, who are paid $14.62 an hour and are on average 58 years old. “The problem is that we’re only unemployed during the summer vacation – that’s barely over two months,” noted Moustapha.
During the school year, working a second job is inconvenient because of their irregular schedule.
“They’re paid four hours per day, but they’re busy during the entire day; they have to be at their crossings in the morning, at noon, and in the afternoon. So they cannot have another job,” Bouchard explained.
As they are a part of the Montreal police force, crossing guards are classified as an essential service, and cannot go on strike. They must therefore use alternative pressure tactics to convey their message.
“Maybe we’ll do [similar to] the security guards in the metro – wear a vest [dossard] – without endangering the security of anyone, very basic things,” said Moustapha.

New group aims to bring accessibility issues to the forefront
In the winter, Montrealers often gripe about the inconvenience of snow and wet roads. For Paul Tshuma, however, the city’s snow removal sometimes piles up on the ramp outside of his apartment, making it impossible for him to leave.
“I cannot just decide and say ‘I’m going out, I’m going downtown,’” said Tshuma, a member of the group Accessibilize Montreal, which tries to raise awareness about discrimination against people with disabilities in the city. “I have to call special transport, and I have to plan all my days in advance. That’s why I’m limited in Montreal.”
Accessibility in Montreal is an issue often overlooked by large swathes of the population. “I’ve realized that there’s a lot of ignorance,” Tshuma said. “If you don’t have a friend or a family member that has a disability, [certain things don’t] ring a bell in your head.”
“The thing that [Accessibilize Montreal is] asking for, perhaps the most, is just openness among Montreal residents,” said Aimee Louw, co-founder of Accessibilize Montreal. “Just […] hearing our message and trying to make things more inclusive for everybody.”
Accessibilize Montreal was born out of discussions with Louw’s friends about different experiences of accessibility in Montreal. Although the group is still fairly small, Louw said that membership is not identity-based. “It’s cool to have such diverse perspectives too […] and it only strengthen[s] how we view accessibility.”
The group currently blends traditional political activism, such as lobbying for changes in infrastructure, with workshops and “Strateg-teas,” or meetings where members can share their stories.
“We also want to change the mindsets of people in Montreal, because it’s one thing to have a physically accessible place for people with physical disabilities, [but] it’s another […] to have an accessible or open perception of people in Montreal,” Louw said.
Access to the public transportation system managed by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) is one of the focal points of Accessibilize Montreal. Currently, there are only seven metro stations that have elevators, and although a few bus routes are wheelchair-accessible, information is often unavailable or incorrect.
Accessibilize Montreal has started to organize “Question Bombs” at the question and answer components of monthly STM board meetings. Prior to the group’s participation, Louw explained, most of the people at the question and answer sessions were people with disabilities, “a sign that things need to change.”
“I’m going to be honest, it’s a slow process […] there have been hundreds of people, if not more, fighting for it since the beginning of the STM; it’s not a new fight,” Louw said. “But what we’re hoping to bring is some more public awareness so there’s a stronger base of support for it.”
According to the CBC, the STM is behind on a ten-year transport plan adopted in 2008, which pledged to renovate three metro stations per year. The plan is currently behind schedule due to a lack of funds, according to a City of Montreal employee.
Money is often cited as a barrier to renovations of the current STM service, Louw said. “In any big institution, I find that excuses for not making things better are because of finances. So there’s pretty much a unanimous statement that there just isn’t enough money to make the regular transit [and the paratransit] system more accessible.”
At McGill, the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) helps students with physical, mental, and other disabilities. For smaller accommodations, such as switching the classroom for a course, students contact the OSD.
After years of questions about how to effectively handle bigger requests from students with physical disabilities, the Universal Access Capital Projects Working Group was formed. With a budget of around $400,000, according to Frédéric Fovet, director of the OSD, the Working Group will channel any requests for renovations or other large-scale projects.
The next impending project – renovations to make the First Peoples’ House accessible – will take place in the summer. A project to renovate Morrice Hall was approved by the Working Group on February 10, and a project at Otto Maass Chemistry building is undergoing a review process.
According to Louw, there are significant barriers to making McGill’s campus more accessible, and McGill’s administration is one of them. She pointed to McGill’s alleged unwillingness to renovate the CKUT and QPIRG building on University as an example of “McGill […] putting aesthetics above universal access, which is a big problem.”
However, according to Fovet, McGill’s hands are tied by strict municipal regulations regarding alterations to a building’s historical appearance. “At [the] First Peoples’ House, building a ramp on the front was never an option,” he said. “That’s why they started looking at access through the Brown building, and going for the first floor instead of going through the street [entrance].”
“Universal access to all the buildings is unfortunately not feasible, simply because if you did a tally of the costs, it would go beyond anything that McGill has available, or that even the government would be willing to provide,” Fovet said, estimating the cost of renovating one of the historical houses on Peel or University at over $1 million.
“It’s not just McGill, it’s something that affects the whole city and province, the […] lack of interest in disability. But it is surprising given that it’s a place of learning and a place of openness and free talk,” Louw said.
Fovet was hopeful overall about the state of physical accessibility at McGill. “I can’t tell you it has been great in the past few years, because nothing much has happened,” he said. “Thankfully [now] there is movement that is actually […] going in the right direction.”
