Students debate whether “pro-life” is oppressive
The pro-life group Choose Life is now a full-status SSMU club.   Council voted 16 to seven, by secret ballot, to approve the change from interim to full status after a long and divided debate involving councillors and an overflowed gallery.
The Clubs & Services Committee Chair, Sarah Olle, said Choose Life deserves to exist as a full-status club because “their application was complete and extremely thorough,” and because Council has twice agreed that Choose Life is acceptable as a club – once when it voted to approve it for interim-status, and once when it accepted the Equity Officers’ decision not to reprimand the club for its event displaying fetuses at the Y-intersection.
“Their mandate works toward opening up a discussion which, again, the Committee supports,” said Olle. “The Committee continues to believe that this club should not be shut down.”
But Councillor Sarah Woolf said that Council should not approve Choose Life now just because it was approved in October.
“This is not the same debate we had three months ago,” said Woolf. “We could not allow a club to form without seeing what they would do. We can [now] ground our opinion in the club’s actions, not on hypothesis.”
Woolf also pointed out that denying Choose Life the right to exist as a club would limit students’ freedom of speech, and would instead reflect back on SSMU.
“Students have opinions; clubs have goals,” said Woolf.
She went on to compare the issue to blood drives, which were banned in the Shatner Building in 2006 because homosexual men could not give blood, sparking a year-long debate that extended to a General Assembly (GA), a referendum question, and a Judicial Board challenge. Woolf said that even if there are problems with the procedure, everyone could agree that blood drives were objectively good, while that could not be said for showing students who have had abortions pictures of aborted fetuses around campus.
“My constituents don’t want to go around questioning the things they’ve done,” Woolf said.
In presenting the official report that Council eventually approved to change the status, Olle explained that even with approval, Choose Life would still be held accountable for its activities.
“Full status is not ‘permanent’ status,” said Olle. “Both interim and full status clubs are subject to the same scrutiny of SSMU. Any group can be reprimanded or disbanded at any time by J-Board, the Equity Officers, Council, or the Executive Committee.”
Iris Erdile, the SSMU Equity Commissioner and Officer, spoke as a member of the gallery and said that she disagreed with the Equity Officers who decided that Choose Life did not violate the anti-oppressive policy of SSMU, namely President Kay Turner and VP University Affairs Nadya Wilkinson. Erdile compared the event to the recent GA at which students decided SSMU should not engage in divisive political issues, while reminding the room that the equity policy was in the midst of being updated.
“We have a very recent precedent of SSMU members refusing to discuss an issue because it was divisive,” said Erdile.
But Councillors vociferously supporting the club, including Clubs and Services Representative Alexandra Brown, Arts Representative Hanchu Chen, and Law Senator Alexandre Shee, focused on Council’s past nearly-unanimous support of the club’s right to exist – Choose Life was was granted interim status in a 21-to-two vote.
“That right was proven months ago when this legislative body said ‘You provide a unique service,’”  argued Chen.
“At the Council meeting where we ratified the equity report, nobody spoke up or raised concerns,” added Brown.
And Shee confirmed with Olle that Choose Life had fulfilled every single criterion for becoming a full-status club.
Chen also answered former Law Senator Erica Martin’s question about whether the Clubs & Services Committee considered constitutionality in those criteria.
“Constitutionality is something we discussed when considering interim club status,” said Chen. “We decided it was constitutional.”
The change from interim- to full-status will allow Choose Life to apply for an office and to the Club Fund, privileges denied to interim groups, complicating booking rooms for events; getting a mailbox, email address, and web space from SSMU; and applying to the Campus Life Fund for money.

New licensing for McGill’s health technologies could benefit many
A coalition of globally-minded students are one step closer to amending McGill’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)policy to include equitable licensing, allowing for medical discoveries made at McGill to be simultaneously licensed to companies in the developing and developed world.
During Senate last Wednesday, the McGill Global Health Network (MGHN) – an agglomeration of interdisciplinary groups including Human Rights Working Group (HRWG), McGill International Health Initiative, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM), McGill Global AIDS Coalition, and McGill Nurses for Global Health – succeeded in placing their question on McGill’s IPR review in the Senate agenda, which was asked by Law senator Faizel Gulamhussein.
As McGill receives considerable public and private funding for its health research, equitable licensing would allow corporate companies that invested at McGill to profit from the University’s research in the developed world, but would permit the University to work with generic companies in the developing world to produce cheaper medicines for at-risk populations, according to a report by UAEM.
“Universities do the vast majority of the early pipeline research that’s then taken up and used by health care industry actors,” explained oline Twiss, Law 3, and a member of the HRWG, who was present in the  Senate gallery.
“It’s really important that licences at the early level are developed as open and as broadly as possible as to maximize the dissemination of innovations,” she said.
With a Senate response from Vice Principal of Research and International Relations, Denis Therien, MGHN was given the green light to meet with members of the working group for IPR review – something that UAEM has been trying to secure for over a year when they sent a letter to VP Research that went unanswered. UAEM McGill has modelled their initiative after one began by UAEM Yale to introduce such licensing with the university’s patent and intellectual property arrangements.
“We’re totally open to meet with MGHN,” said Therien at Senate. “They have a very interesting point of view, and we want to see how we can continue the conversation.”
However, Therien explained that the University was also considering the interests of other actors and had informal interaction with faculty members, private companies, and government bodies.
“At least we have this as a concrete step to ensuring that the University has [equitable licensing] in mind,” said Jake Hirsch-Allen, Law 3, and a member of HRWG.
The IPR review will include an overview of policy committees and a committee inside the Office of Technology Transfer, in addition to the Senate Steering Committee of Technology Transfer. Therien thought this process would allow McGill to develop its priorities.
“We’re not entering the review with a fixed agenda,” said Therien, adding that no forum has addressed this question in depth in the three years he has been in his position at McGill. “It will be part of the review to establish these priorities, [but] they will certainly be different than they were ten years ago, because the world has changed.”
 The McGill Board of Governors  (BOG) and Senate jointly review McGill policies, and this year’s focus has been on IPR. The review bodies had a false start early last fall when their attempts to strike a working group failed. The joint Senate-BOG committee held its only meeting in October. Currently, the composition of the new working group is being established and is expected to meet shortly, although no date has been fixed.

Council approved a combined $20.40 a year increase to ancillary fees Thursday, allowing the administration to increase the Student Services Fee, the Athletics Fee, and administrative charges.
However, a further $10 a year for the Student Services Fee and the Athletics Fee were submitted for approval in a referendum in March, because combined with the other increases, they were more than inflation.
SSMU by-laws allow, but do not require, Council to approve fees that at or under inflation. Fees that are not approved can be rejected or sent to a referendum.
A full-time student taking the standard 15 credits a term will pay $956.30 a year in ancillary fees, which also include the Information Technology and Registration Charges.
Increases to the registration fee for new students – from $60 to $70 for in-province students and from $80 to $84 for others – were rejected mainly because councillors felt it reduced access to the University, although the in-province increase was rejected because Councillor Hanchu Chen noticed, at the last minute, that the increase was well over inflation. Council had the opportunity to send these two fees to referendum as well, but because students rejected similar increases in a fall referendum, it decided to pass a motion stating it would not authorize any increase in registration fees for the 2009-2010 academic year.
However, because the recently-passed Quebec law requiring students to approve ancillary fee increases only applies to McGill students, not applicants, McGill is still charging the higher rate to applicants and will refund the difference for those who actually enroll.
Council also passed a number of changes to SSMU by-laws, which it has failed to pass for many meetings due to a lack of quorum for by-law changes – two-thirds, as opposed to the normal half-plus-one for most business.
Also, one week earlier, immediately after the General Assembly (GA), Council agreed to approve four referendum questions, three of which were fee renewals and increases from last semester that failed to reach quorum.
The questions are a $0.75 per semester increase for QPIRG, and renewals for the $10 per semester Athletics Facilities Improvement Fee and the $19 per semester McGill Undergraduate Student Fund, which includes the Access Bursary Fund, the Library Improvement Fund, and the Campus Life Fund. The last question is on GA reform.
McGill says annual undergraduate society fees range from $289.60 to $563.76.

Plans to bailout bankrupt Hippodrome in conflict with community centre proposals for 2,500 social housing units
Members of the Côtes-des-Neiges (CDN) community are not impressed with Quebec’s  plan to replace the  bankrupt horse track in their borough with 300 video lottery terminals (VLTs). Instead, they want to use the space to develop 2,500 social housing units.
The Quebec government is currently negotiatiating with Attractions Hippiques, the horse racing company owned by Liberal senator Paul Massicote, an estimated $1-billion dollar bailout that will permanently close Hippodrome de Montréal and replace it with a casino.
Under the plan, Attractions Hippiques would be released from its original contractual obligations; it would not be required to build a replacement track in the area, nor would they be obligated to pay the $1.5-million it currently owes in municipal taxes.
Provincial horse breeders are widely opposed to the proposal because of the replacement track provision. The plan will cut their annual revenues from horse racing betting by about $18-million.
Warren Allmand, City Councillor for the Loyola district of the CDN-Notre Dame de Grace borough, is certain that a casino in the area will exacerbate poverty in CDN, where 40 per cent of the population already lives at the poverty line. He pointed out that VLTs are especially addictive and have been linked to suicide and financial instability.
“We’re totally opposed to [the casino],” Allmand said. “We don’t want to give comfort to those who are steaming ahead with the plan. We’re [only] making plans to stop it.”
Allmand said, though, that the councillors in the CDN-NDG doubt the borough council will approve the gaming complex, nixing the government’s plan.
Denyse Lacelle, coordinator for the Côte-des -Neiges Community Council, an amalgamation of 50 community organizations, referred to the plan as “total nonsense.” She and other members of the council feel that “to build a private casino [in the area] is the worst plan possible.”
Ian Wetherly, the president and CEO of Attractions Hippiques, maintained that the gaming complex’s clients do not come from the CDN area and will thus not affect the borough. He felt that the concerns of CDN community members are unfounded, and argued that if the gambling venue is built, there will still be room for the housing development.
Despite the failure of Attractions Hippique’s previous venues in Trois Rivieres and Quebec City, Wetherly is confident that the proposed gaming complex – which he insisted is not a “casino” – will be a success.
“[Our racing complexes in Quebec] have just been a total flop,” Wetherly said. “[The gaming complex] will be the same as the existing [venues], but it’s a good site. Clients will come from all over the island.”
Attractions Hippiques has suffered losses for several years, has been in bankruptcy protection since June, and has not held any live horse races since December. Last week, the Montreal Superior Court granted them an extension of creditor protection, set to expire on March 9.
According to Wetherly, the bailout is the only chance for the survival of horseracing in Quebec, as the casino plan will also include an outdoor racetrack, and the preservation of over 3,000 jobs in the industry. “Our opinion is that if we don’t come up with a deal, our company won’t be in existence, nor will the horse racing industry,” Wetherly said.

Federal infrastructure money to help refurbish cultural centre and NDG theatre
The city of Montreal began Black History Month with a pledge to restore the Charles H. Este Cultural Centre in Little Burgundy, as well as the Empress Theatre in NDG, also known as the Cinema V­.
The initiatives will be financed by the $7-billion earmarked in the recent federal budget for municipal infrastructure programs.
Christiane Loiselle, the Centre’s Project Coordinator, said that governmental funding for the project is critical, partly because so few private investors have shown an interest in restoring the theatre.
“The City has given us amazing support,” she said, adding that the Centre has been discussing the renewal project with Heritage Canada. It is also waiting for a response to a grant proposal made to the government of Quebec.
The Centre, located at 2035 Coursol, was run by the Negro Community Centre (NCC) until a portion of the exterior wall collapsed in 1987. Around the same time, the NCC lost its funding from Centraide, and it has largely relied on private donors ever since.
Lawrence Fraser, who sits on the NCC Board of Directors, said that many members of the black community are excited about the prospect of reviving the Cultural Centre.
“At the present, what we’re doing is contacting all 300 of our members, and determining what programs are needed within the community,” he said, adding that the Centre will probably host a youth hip hop dance class.
The NCC intends to use the building as a museum, in addition to a black community centre, once the renovations are complete. Fraser said that housing for seniors will be created on one of the building’s floors, in order to cover the costs of maintaining the building. The Centre will also run a computer literacy program for seniors.
The Empress Theatre, at 5560 Sherbrooke West, was built in 1927, and attempted to synthesize contemporary art deco with the architectural style of ancient Egypt. It continued operating as a movie theatre until 1992, when a fire gutted much of the inside of the building. It has remained unused ever since.
The Black Theatre Workshop joined the Empress Cultural Centre in 2007, and will be permanently housed at the Empress Theatre once the renovations are complete.
“We were very happy when the Black Theatre Workshop signed on,” said Loiselle. “They appeal to everyone, but they also have a particular relevance to the local community.”
The Empress Cultural Centre, a non-profit community organization, has owned the building ever since it was bought by the city in 1999, but has not yet managed to raise the estimated $9-million needed to refurbish the theatre.

Jean Saint-Vil’s audience of 60 buckled over in laughter Thursday, during his speech “Black History Now,” the centerpiece of 2009 Black History Month at McGill, organized by Black Students Network (BSN). Provocative and frank, the Haitian-born Canadian exposed distortions of black history that remain mainstream today. He dispelled the myth that ancient Egyptians were white, reminded the audience that the fastest computer in 1989 was engineered by a black man, and tore down the association between Haiti’s 1804 Revolution and the French Revolution.
Saint-Vil argued that black people today are damaged by institutionalized white supremacy that convinces them God is white and white is Godly.
“Everybody is white: Mary, Joseph…. You have to look under the foot of St. Michael: there’s a devil there somewhere. He’s the only one who looks like you. God is supposed to look like you, but Africans don’t have that,” he said.
Challenging white scientists’ assertion that Egyptian D.N.A. is white, he argued that ancient Egyptian architecture and mythology is crucial to reconstructing black identity.
“I don’t care what anyone tells me; I have been inside the pyramids, the brothers are black…. A whole bunch of us went to the Louvre and saw the statue of Osiris and it was like a family reunion. I was like, ‘Brother, I never knew about you.’”
Urging a development policy in Africa, led by Africans rather than foreign NGOs, the International Monetary Fund, and western countries, Saint-Vil again turned to Egypt for inspiration.
“If we believe we are the people who built the pyramids, we know we can build more than missionary schools and bridges that break,” he said.
Saint-Vil pointed to the disproportionate presence of black men in jail – 6.7 per cent of detainees in Canada are black, but only 2.2 per cent of the total population is black.
“It is earth-shattering how many of these potential geniuses are being wasted in jail. If you are looking for black leadership today, you have to go to jail – that’s where the black men are, they aren’t all in the White House.”
Saint-Vil  frequently returned to Obama, discussing both the symbolic triumph he represents and the potential dangers of investing too much pride in his image.
“The image of Obama is the tragedy of the black nation. All it takes is one bullet and the dream is dead. Yet, we cannot stop from celebrating that not only this black man but a black family going to a house they were supposed to build, but not inhabit.”
“Amens” from the audience answered Saint-Vil as he continued.
“Obama is walking tall today because Rosa [Parks] decided to sit.”
Jean Saint-Vil was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and immigrated to Canada in 1983. He is based in Ottawa and works as a writer, actor, film producer, and journalist. He hosts two radio talkshows, CHUO-FM’s “Bouyon-Rasin” and CKCU-FM’s “Rendez-Vous Haitien”.
Upcoming Events
BSN will continue to host a series of events, including an exhibit in the McLennan-Redpath hallway until month’s end, and Children’s Day, next Thursday from 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. in the Shatner Ballroom. They’re still looking for volunteers to assist with the 100 elementary school children visiting that day. The Concordia Student Union is hosting director Spike Lee, who will give a lecture Wednesday, February 18, at 4:30 p.m. in H-110.

Economic Task Force’s first Town Hall encourages open and creative atmosphere
Over 60 McGill staffers gathered Thursday afternoon to brainstorm budget-friendly measures at the Provost’s Administrative Task Force on Dealing with Economic Uncertainty’s first open-forum Town Hall.
The Town Hall was the first of four hosted by the recently formed task force, and provided an open forum at which to publicly address the economic challenges facing McGill in the current recession. Principal Heather Munroe-Blum and Provost Anthony Masi, who presided over the meeting,     emphasized that the University can maintain McGill’s academic excellence if costs are cut carefully.
“Not a day goes by when you don’t see the sea change around us,” Munroe-Blum said. “We are not immune…and we cannot be ignorant.”
Following the Principal’s and Provost’s statements, the meeting adopted an open-forum format, where audience members suggested cost-cutting strategies.
Several faculty members proposed streamlining administrative processes by cutting outdated office relocation procedures and addressing informational redundancies. Staffers also suggested increased investment in distance learning, E-lectures, and summer terms as new sources of revenue.
Among the brainstorming session’s more novel products were proposals to invest in university infrastructure in Iraq and to offer a cash prize to whichever community member could develop the most cost-efficient measures.
Increasing individual responsibility for energy costs seemed to be the greatest source of potential savings. Following comments on wasteful electricity and paper usage, Director of Media Relations Doug Sweet proposed informing community members of the micro-costs of their actions by, for example, tacking stickers with the exact cost of leaving lights on overnight next to light switches.
Vaughan Dowie of the Public Affairs Office also emphasized the need to increase budgetary responsibility among staff members.
“People should understand the costs of the decisions they make,” said Dowie.
Masi and Munroe-Blum assuaged concerns about the administration’s economic priorities, reassuring those present that areas like staff development and library maintenance were considered fruitful investments, not excess costs. Munroe-Blum added that the task force bases its decisions on the most pessimistic economic forecasts in order to develop long-term measures to protect McGill
Masi repeatedly assured members that deep, across-the-board cuts were not an option. The meeting was not designed to reach any firm conclusions, but all questions and comments were recorded so that the task force could revisit and investigate the suggestions made.
SSMU VP University Affairs Nadya Wilkinson, the undergraduate representative on the Task Force, stressed that the task force has great potential but is still in its infant stages.
“It’s still quite young,” said Wilkinson. “You’ve got a whole bunch of people who have never had to deal with the entire University’s finances, and there’s a pretty steep learning curve.”
Following three more Town Halls – one today at noon in the Education Building and two on the first school day back from reading week – Munroe-Blum will make preliminary budgetary recommendations to the Board of Governors in March and send an open letter to the McGill community in April with the task force’s preliminary conclusions. The task force will continue meeting until November, and deliver its final report in January 2010.
