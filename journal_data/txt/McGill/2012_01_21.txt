How student cafes make ends meet
After the closing of the Architecture Café last year, the finances of student-run food services came under fire. Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson described the Arch Café as being “run like a lemonade stand.” The Daily investigates how remaining student-run food services are operating on campus this year.
AUS SNAX
Located in a nook within Leacock, SNAX is a non-profit managed and run by Arts students, and operates under the purview of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS). This year SNAX received $2,000 from the Arts Undergraduate Improvement Fund.
An average transaction at SNAX amounts to $2, and with about 500 customers a day, the outfit turns daily revenue of $1,000. All profits go towards the operating start-up cost at the beginning of each academic year, which includes $8,000 worth of product.
Manager Jennifer Cox said spacing presents a challenge for SNAX, as a lack of storage space means buying products in bulk is not possible. SNAX is taking steps to improve sustainability with a price-incentive campaign to encourage re-usable mugs.
“I think we’re going to continually raise our coffee prices little by little as an incentive. The cost of that cup is something we would like to take out of our expenses all together,” she said.
Midnight Kitchen (MK)
Another food service on campus, MK, is one of the last still offering full meals. Run by a collective of students, MK’s success in the spring 2011 referendum won the service a one dollar fee levy, raising fees to $2.25 per student per semester.
The collective spends between $1,000 and $1,500 on bulk food orders each month. Approximately 150 students attend each serving and donations vary from $15 to $50 each day.
Lisa Miatello, volunteer coordinator of the collective, noted that MK sustains a loss from opt-outs. “About 12 to 14 per cent of undergraduates opt-out, so we take a substantially big hit from that,” she said.
Despite opt-outs, the increased fee levy allowed MK to hire four paid staff members. Three coordinators earn an annual $9,216 stipend, and one driver earns a $3,072 stipend. The coordinators work between 15 to 18 hours a week and the driver works 6 hours. The four stipends amount to 38 per cent of the collective’s annual budget.
MK also created a $500 discretionary fund that will be awarded on a monthly basis to sponsor like-minded social and political projects. The fund sets $250 as the maximum amount that can be allocated per project.
Organic Campus
The farmers’ market at McGill sells the products of one farmer, Berhanu, who grows, bakes, and delivers all foodstuffs for Organic Campus at no cost. Organic Campus sells Berhanu’s goods, and writes him a cheque for 90 per cent of the revenue. If Organic Campus has no plans to use the remaining 10 per cent, it also goes to Berhanu.
Julien Dinerstein, treasurer of Organic Campus, said that “sales near the beginning of the semester and towards the end are a bit lower. When we’re outside, we tend to sell a lot more – it can range from $500 to $1,000 a week.”
Products usually sell-out by week’s end – if not, leftovers are donated to MK. Organic Campus also has ties with SNAX, selling them bread weekly, at cost, for an additional $104 of revenue.
Organic Campus is volunteer-run. “[Barhanu] tried to pay us once, but we couldn’t accept it,” said Dinerstein.
Frostbite
The finances of the ice cream operation are an annex of the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS). Between 20 and 300 customers come by a day – depending on the season – which amounts to anywhere from $50 to $400 in profits each day.
Frostbite tries to keep its prices as low as possible, despite financial obstacles. Manager Juan Giha said, “We’re scratching our heads as to how to keep our profit margins low while competing with rising costs, taxes, and minimum wage.” Frostbite increased prices by 25 cents last month.
Other obstacles included construction in the Engineering complex over the past two years that caused frequent power outages, twice melting all ice cream. In correspondence, Giha said McGill reimbursed the costs.

Donors contribute millions to McGill’s budget every year
McGill runs on $1.04 billion a year.
It is the only Canadian university to place in the top 25 of the QS World University Rankings eight years in a row, competing against privately-funded universities in North America.
Like many other schools, McGill places considerable effort into obtaining donations to support its competitive status – between 2008 and 2011, McGill received $78.5 million from 32,051 donors.
Derek Cassoff, director of communications of Development and Alumni Relations, explained that “about 75 per cent of our gifts come from individuals, the majority of whom are alumni.”
“Every donation shows not only a big financial investment, but the personal engagement speaks volumes to the rest of the community both in Montreal and Canada,” he said.
Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi pointed out that McGill “was founded as a result of a philanthropic gift – James McGill’s bequest – so our origins are in philanthropy, and like most universities, [McGill] has depended on philanthropy for a portion of its revenue.”
Ayesha Mayan, associate director of the Annual Fund – McGill’s yearly appeal to alumni, parents, faculty and staff, and friends to help support the University – pointed to a long history of alumni support. The Annual Fund has existed since 1948.
Lesley Preston, a U2 Chemistry and Political Science student, worked at the Phonathon, a program that solicits donations from alumni and parents. It hires 60 to 75 students a year, each of whom spend a minimum of eight hours a week calling potential donors.
Preston spoke to being subject to aggressive responses from some – one person she called “went on for many minutes about how he would never donate to McGill because they support Israeli apartheid.”
During the MUNACA strike, some alumni and parents expressed similar sentiments about their donations.
Still, Cassoff estimated that about 25 per cent of alumni donate.
According to Mayan, “45 per cent of our donations from the Annual Fund are under $100, which totals about half a million dollars.”
Service Point, which has existed for two years, was supported by the Annual Fund in order to create an “accessible way for students to get information they need,” said Mayan.
Alumni and parents can donate to any organization on campus. “You could donate to the Red Cross through McGill, so you’re not necessarily supporting McGill administration and stances, but the students that are trying to get involved even outside the University,” Preston said.
Mayan agreed: “The overwhelming majority of dollars we bring in go to specific programs, not the overall budget of the University.”
She explained that the Annual Fund has recently begun soliciting donations from parents of students.
“The culture of philanthropy in the States has been longer standing than in Canada,” said Mayan.
Cassoff agreed. “In Canada, there is a certain culture that education is considered as part of service that government provides,” he said.
“In the US there is a long history of private education, separate from government service,” Cassoff said. “Here, it’s equated with healthcare and other social service deliveries.”
Manfredi explained that “certainly, philanthropy is not our main revenue; McGill is largely a publically funded University.”
“I’d say philanthropy contributes in total maybe 10 to 15 per cent of the overall revenue available to the University,” he said.
“When you look at where McGill ranks internationally, we are operating with a much lower budget, and we are still having the same output on a research level,” said  Mayan.
“[Donations] can have a huge impact, and an impact right away,” Mayan said.

Union to sit down with administration this winter
McGill’s newly unionized course lecturers have approved a preliminary list of demands for their first collective bargaining session with the administration.
The demands were approved at a December 6 unit assembly, but have not been formally presented to the administration.
Course lecturers are paid to teach courses on a contract basis, and currently earn $7,200 a course.
AGSEM, the union which also represents teaching assistants and invigilators, was accredited to represent course lecturers in August, following a nearly 18 month long unionization effort. During the union drive, McGill announced a $2,200 per course raise, which the union claimed as a victory.
During the union drive, Provost Anthony Masi ordered building directors on campus to tear down posters encouraging course lecturers to join the union. The administration said the use of posters by the union violated Quebec labour laws.
Despite the raise, the union says that McGill’s course lecturers are among the lowest paid in Quebec.
The union is demanding what it describes as equity with other Quebec universities, which would mean a pension and retirement plan, wage increases, and paid sick leave.
The union is also seeking to implement a seniority-based hiring system.
Rick Hink, the chair of the course lecturers’ bargaining committee, estimates that there are between 1,300 and 1,500 course lecturers, though the numbers are constantly in flux.
Hink explained that some course lecturers are graduate students who teach to pay the bills, while others have been teaching full time for as long as 25 years.
According to Hink, course lecturers have no protections and can be fired at any time, owing to the course-by-course nature of their contracts.
In addition to salary and benefit demands, the union is also demanding protections for courses that are traditionally taught by course lecturers, as in much of the School of Continuing Studies.
“We don’t want to see a situation where all of a sudden you can throw hundreds and hundreds of people out of their jobs,” Hink said.
Describing the findings of the union’s bargaining survery, Hink said that some course lecturers have no experience, while others have forty years on the job.
“To talk to some of these people who have been unceremoniously dumped at the end of 25 years of service? It’s inconceivable,” he said.
The union is hoping to sit down at the bargaining table by the end of February, when they will formally present their demands to the administration.
Masi wrote in an email to The Daily that, “the University is committed to doing everything within its power to minimize the probability of another strike occurring during this academic year or in the foreseeable future for that matter.”
AGSEM’s course lecturers are one of three bargaining units currently negotiating a contract with McGill, including invigilators and support workers organized under AMUSE – the labour union for casual employees at McGill.
Concordia’s course lecturers are paid $7,770 dollars per course, while course lecturers at l’Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscaminque earn $8,748.99 per course.

Events honored disgraced former CEO Arthur Porter
Following Arthur Porter’s resignation from his position as CEO of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) last December, the hospital hosted two benefits in his honor. The combined budget for these events was between $15,000 and $20,000.
Porter has been the subject of controversy since early November, when the National Post reported that he wired $200,000 from a personal account to a Montreal-based international lobbyist and alleged arms dealer for an infrastructure project in his native Sierra Leone. He resigned from his position as Chairman of Canada’s Security Intelligence Review Committee – the country’s “spy watchdog” – shortly thereafter, and from his position at MUHC on December 5.
The first farewell party, which took place last Tuesday at the Mount Royal Club, was an invitation-only reception, whose guest list included government officials, McGill representatives, and donors. Wendy Thomson, director of McGill’s School of Social Work and one of two McGill-designated members of the MUHC Board of Directors also attended the reception.
The second event, which took place the next afternoon at the Montreal General Hospital, was a staff reception. It included a live acoustic band, speeches from Porter’s co-workers, and a slide show. None of the guests or speakers commented on the controversy that led to Porter’s resignation.
According to Ian Popple, communications coordinator at MUHC, these types of receptions are not uncommon, and provide the opportunity for staff to meet and talk. “They help with team building,” he said.
Judy Pasiolan, vice-president of the 5,000-member Confédération des syndicates nationaux local at the MUHC, told the Montreal Gazette she didn’t recall the Centre holding such parties when Porter’s predecessor, Hugh Scott, retired.
Popple stated that the events’ large budget was “not an unreasonable amount of money” given the number of guests and MUHC staff who were present. He estimated that at least 400 people were in attendance, but that this number “could be double that because the events were several hours long, and guests came and went over time.”
Popple also emphasized that the funds for these events did not come from the hospital’s own budget or donations, but rather from guests who wanted to ensure that Porter was properly seen off after his nearly ten years of service.
Popple declined to comment on the controversy, saying only that Porter’s decision to resign was his own and that “he will be missed.”

McGill student societies pursue financial reform
Just what exactly do SSMU and PGSS do with all of your money? “Have a look” is the answer that this year’s VP Finances are likely to tell you.
In his first six months in office, Adrian Kaats, VP Finance for the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) and former Daily columnist has revamped and streamlined the society’s budget. He separated all revenues and expenses into categories that matched those of a third party auditor’s, so that students are able to see the specific amounts PGSS has spent on a certain item, with the numbers backed up by an independent assessment of the finances.
In previous years, when comparing the year-end audit reports to the final, year-end budget, the average student would have difficulties verifying the accuracy of the budget, said Kaats. Money that was allocated to sections of the budget might appear in different sections in the auditor’s report or be lumped together with different categories of funds.
Of the new budget, Kaats said, “There’s so much transparency that it is nearly impossible for people to mistake what we are doing if they are interested in discovering [it].”
“It’s very difficult for the PGSS to perform in a way that’s not indicating [what] it’s doing,” he continued.
The revamped PGSS budget is projecting a cash deficit of $65,281 for this year. SSMU, on the other hand, came out of last year with a $515,556 surplus. The most recent SSMU budget, approved by legislative council in November, is projecting to break even.
Transparency of society finances is also a priority for Shyam Patel, VP Finance of SSMU.
“I do have students who come to me sometimes and ask to see the finances of SSMU,” Patel said.  “It’s more than encouraged. Students can come in and ask, ‘Where did you spend money?’ and it is my responsibility to show [them].”
Long-term financial plans are priorities for PGSS and SSMU. PGSS is working on a daycare space for the dependents of graduate students, and is hoping to combine miscellaneous bursaries into a single fund to cut administration costs, and also to achieve better returns on McGill’s investment portfolio.
Having a singular fund will also improve accessibility for the various bursaries since, under the current scheme, students may get rejected because of a lack of money in the specific fund to which they are applying.
“In one year you might see a great deal of need in one of the areas and not in the other, so the money accumulates in a pool here while another bunch of people are rejected,” said Kaats. “It isn’t fair that somebody apply to the fund at time X and then, five months later, because we spent all the money on that, at time Y, somebody with the exact same need gets rejected because we were spending too quickly.”
SSMU’s long term financial plans include the creation of a student-run cafe in 2013. Patel said a financial plan, which requires the approval of legislative council, would allow for continuity from year to year between the successive SSMU VP Finances, and “so that the teams coming in have an idea of what the projects are.”
Both Kaats and Patel bemoaned the lack of training they received for their positions. Kaats – who was elected interim VP Finance last winter – said much of his training came from the math work he did as part of his engineering degree.
“There is no training at PGSS,” he said. “It’s a very, very serious problem.”
“The mathematics of [the job] is pretty simple, and if you’re attuned to system design in general,” he continued. “The difficulty lies in the political aspect of making appropriate judgement calls.”
Patel, as SSMU Funding Coordinator in 2010-2011, worked closely with his predecessor Nick Drew and said he still felt less than prepared for his role as VP Finance.
“For my successor, I’m going to be a little bit different. For my successor, training will be very, very rigid,” he said.
