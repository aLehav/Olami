BoD to Vote on Accountability Committee’s Report Thursday
SSMU’s Accountability Committee plans to present a report to the Board of Directors (BoD) recommending that VP University Affairs Madeline Wilson be suspended without pay for five days, according to documents received by the Daily through an anonymous source. The recommendation – written by the Accountability Committee of the SSMU BoD – cites Wilson’s “refusal to comply” with mandates issued by the Legislative Council and ratified by the BoD, as well as her “insubordination.”
The recommendation is as follows: “On the basis of the December 4th Complaint, the Accountability Committee recommends to the [SSMU BoD] that the Vice-President (University Affairs), Madeline Wilson, be suspended in her capacity as an Officer for a period of five (5) working days without pay, to take effect at 9:00 a.m. on 27 January 2020 and end at 5:00 p.m. on 31 January 2020.”
Instigated by Wilson’s “use of profanity” in a Facebook post addressing McGill’s decision against divestment – made to the University Affairs page on December 4, 2019 – the recommendation was written following a complaint made by a Councillor of SSMU Legislative Council on the same day to the Accountability Committee. The post in question included “profanity” in the text of the post following a content warning, calling on the McGill administration to “step the fuck up.”
As outlined by the recommendation, Wilson’s post on December 4, 2019 is a continuation of her challenges against the BoD ruling, which resulted from complaints following a Facebook post to the University Affairs page on October 31, 2019. Condemning anti-Indigenous racism in the McGill community, Wilson posted in solidarity with Indigenous Affairs Commissioner Tomas Jirousek, stating that racists “can go fuck themselves.”
The original mandate – approved in Legislative Council on November 28, 2019 – singles Wilson out by her position, and states that SSMU Executives are “[prohibited from] the use of profanity in Official SSMU Communications”. The motion, while obtaining a majority of votes, also faced substantial opposition. Former Social Work Councilor Jo Roy stated in the previous council on November 14, 2019 that the motion “amounted to tone policing.” Wilson defended her language, stating that she “[chooses] to use profanity” in communications “specifically with regards to issues or topics [she feels] quite strongly about and that [she feels] deserve strong language, such as explicit racism directed at individuals.” The final vote in Legislative Council had 19 councilors vote in favour, four against, and five abstentions.
According to the recommendation, Wilson has stated both in the Senate Caucus and in the December 2 BoD meeting that she would not comply with the BoD’s ruling on the mandate, which was also cited as the rationale for her suspension.
The recommendation will be received by the BoD and voted on in their meeting on Thursday, January 23, 2020.
This is a developing story. The Daily will provide updates as information is released.

Councillors Reconvene For the Year’s First Council
On January 16, SSMU Legislative Council reconvened for the first meeting of the Winter 2020 semester. On the agenda were several items that carried over from sessions prior to the break, as well as new business.
Announcements 
During announcements, VP External Adam Gwiazda-Amsel mentioned the strikes taking place regarding Law 21, as well as the recent decision of McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) to implement a “decarbonization plan” rather than divest from fossil fuels. Gwiazda Amsel called upon councillors to keep their constituents aware of both of these changes, as well as the difference between decarbonization and divestment. Additionally, he mentioned an upcoming series of information sessions in collaboration with Community Affairs on students moving into the Milton Park Community. Councillor Darshan Daryanani announced that the annual “Work Your BA” series, hosted by McGill’s Career Planning Service, will be taking place from January 20-31, related information can be found via Facebook. VP Internal Sanchi Bhalla announced that tickets to the Faculty Olympics “hype night” had opened up, and that further information could be found on the SSMU website. SSMU President Bryan Buraga noted that the Winter General Assembly will take place February 24 at 6 p.m. in the New Residence Hall Ballroom, as well as mentioning the upcoming McGill BoG Student Forum on January 30 at 4 p.m. Additionally, SSMU Speaker Husayn Jamal announced his resignation, effective January 31, upon which a motion was introduced and passed unanimously, expressing gratitude to his three years of service. Finally, a moment of silence was observed to honour the 175 victims of the recent plane crash in Iran. 
Motions 
Regarding motions, there was a Motion to Endorse the Student Mobilization Against Bill 21, which passed unanimously; a Motion Regarding Plan on Clubs and Services as SSMU’s Highest Priority, which was committed to an ad-hoc committee composed of members of the clubs and finance committees; a Motion Regarding a Provincial Student Assembly that passed; and a Motion Regarding Changes to the Committee Terms of Reference that passed. Additionally, there were a number of notices of motions, including one Regarding Amendments to the Internal Regulations of Student Groups, one Regarding Amendments to the Effective Committees Policy, one Regarding Adoption of the SSMU Mental Health Policy and Plan, and finally, one Regarding the Adoption of the Gendered and Sexual Violence Committee Terms of Reference. 
Discussions 
Finally, there were two additional discussions that took place which took a significant portion of the meeting. Firstly, there was the Report of the Comprehensive Governance Review Committee, which involved changes to seat allocations. Councillors debated moving to one seat per faculty maximum, two seats maximum, or remaining at the default of four seats as a maximum. In addition, a generative discussion took place regarding SSMU’s Relationship with UTILE and Potential Financing Models, which pertained to future collaboration with UTILE to create affordable housing units for students.
