Event series seeks to bring awareness of Israeli human rights abuses 
From March 10 to March 17, McGill and Concordia hosted the Montreal events for the tenth annual Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW), an international series of events that seeks to raise awareness about Israel’s apartheid policies toward Palestinians, and build support for the growing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.
The BDS campaign was initiated in 2005, and demands “full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, an end to the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands – including the Golan Heights, the Occupied West Bank with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip – and dismantling the Wall, and the protection of Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in U.N. resolution 194,” according to the website for Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) USA.
On March 11, Noura Erakat, a human rights attorney and writer, came to McGill to talk about the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli apartheid regime that she referred to as “an Indigenous struggle against settler colonialism.”
Through the examination of Israeli law, Erakat works to denounce the institutionalized discrimination established against the Palestinian Christian and Arab population. She highlighted the fact that without an established constitution, the Basic Laws of Israel, which form an important part of the Israeli constitution, hold no guaranteed right to equality.
“What separates these two populations has not necessarily been a physical separation but even more so, it is the privilege that is afforded to the Jewish-Israeli population,” Erakat explained.
“We describe this situation as ‘the Palestinian-Israeli conflicts,’” she continued, “which distorts what is actually going on [because] it equates the Palestinian people and the Israeli people in the form of a conflict, when in fact what would be more accurate would be to say, ‘The Palestinian and Israeli conflict is a conflict because Israel has been a state since 1948, and Palestinians have been a stateless people since 1948.’”
Rana Salah, an organizer of IAW Montreal, told The Daily, “I hope that IAW will bring about understanding and empowerment to the McGill community. The unfortunate reality is that IAW continues to be a taboo topic for many. This taboo nature only continues to entrench racist attitudes towards Palestinians. A clearer understanding of the Palestine-Israel topic will foster a greater sense of understanding and respect amongst the McGill community.
 “It also empowers McGill students by encouraging them to voice their concerns on the ongoing apartheid treatment of Palestinians, and to resist via the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. The BDS movement aims to pressure Israel to respect human rights and to cease with its apartheid policies,” Salah continued.
Salah mentioned that she is very happy with the results of IAW so far. She explained, “Israeli Apartheid Week once started as a very fringe, ‘radical’ movement. It has now moved to the centre of the Israeli-Palestinian debate. It has not yet penetrated mainstream societal views, but support continues to grow.”

Action follows public backlash over sexual assault case
On March 31, Bianca Tétrault will take office as McGill’s Liaison Officer (Harm Reduction), a newly-created position reporting to the Dean of Students, according to an announcement from Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens.
Tétrault will “act as a central liaison for the units and groups involved in the prevention and reduction of discrimination, substance abuse, aggression, sexual assault, and other forms of harm,” as well as “develop and implement […] educational programming, resources, and events,” according to an email sent on behalf of Dyens.
In November 2013, a Montreal Gazette article revealed that three McGill football players were allowed to remain on the team in spite of an active sexual assault case against them. The public backlash inspired a series of actions on the part of the University, including a Forum on Consent held in February, an annual Forum on Safe Space to be held starting next October, and the creation of Tétrault’s position.
“[The position] came out of the backlash stemming from that incident, and also [from] highlighting the fact that there’s not a single person yet at this university who is dedicated to matters of sexual assault – even though these issues are quite prevalent, particularly on university campuses,” explained Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP University Affairs Joey Shea.
Shea, who was the only student serving on the hiring committee for the position, spoke favourably of Tétrault. “I think she’s absolutely perfect. […] She was by far the most qualified candidate […] for this position,” Shea told The Daily.
“I felt she would be able to work really well with the student groups – she speaks their language, she is a graduate of McGill in Social Work, she’s been a crisis support counsellor for many years, and really understands the issue quite well, so I am very pleased with her being picked.”
Tétrault’s course of action will first be to examine the sexual assault resources already in place at the university, and to then work on coordinating policy and designing outreach programs, according to Dean of Students André Costopoulos.
Costopoulos indicated that the Liaison Officer will “look at all the policy pieces we have in place in different places […] and see how we can bring them all under one package, one umbrella, and then ask ourselves: Is that enough, is that sufficient, or do we need more, and if we do, what more do we need?”
Costopoulos emphasized the importance of working with existing student groups. “We’ve […] been talking with SACOMSS [the Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society], with the [Feminist Collective at McGill Law], the UGE [Union for Gender Empowerment], and a bunch of other groups, and they’ve been involved in discussions with us as we think about this position,” said Costopoulos in an interview with The Daily.
“One of the first things that [Tétrault] needs to do is get in touch, connect […] with all those constituencies, and listen to them,” he added.
The Daily could not reach Tétrault for an interview before press time.
In an open letter published online last Friday and republished in The Daily this week, student groups recognized the University’s “increasing attention to issues of sexual assault on campus,” nonetheless expressing their disappointment with the administration’s “lack of consultation with relevant campus groups, who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to tackling the prevalence of sexual violence and rape culture in our community.” SACOMSS, the Feminist Collective at McGill Law, and the UGE are among the signatories.
Shea hopes that the University will display its commitment to combatting rape culture on campus by working closely with student groups and institutionalizing the position.
“Right now it’s only a year-long contract, so I really hope that the University sees this as an issue that’s important enough to make a permanent position and not just a year-long contract,” she said.

Anti-military research campus group to continue quest for information
Correction appended March 25, 2014
As part of its ongoing fight for access to information (ATI) requests from McGill concerning the University’s military research, Demilitarize McGill, a campus group that aims to end military research at McGill, has recently released selections from its ATI requests to the University. The group aims to make all such documents public in the upcoming weeks.
The disclosure of the documents is the result of a settlement in January between the University and a group of respondents. The settlement, which gave McGill until late February to begin to disclose the long-standing ATI requests, also ruled that the University could not deem requests systemic or abusive in nature.
Despite the disclosure of the documents, the actual information remains heavily, if not completely, redacted. “For […] my request of the documents [that I received from McGill], there was quite a bit of redaction, quite a bit of black marker. Dozens of pages were blacked out,” Isaac Stethem, a member of Demilitarize McGill, told The Daily.
Stethem noted, “In a couple of cases, the University wrote to us that third parties had essentially vetoed the release of any documents, so we didn’t even get black documents, we just have mysterious research agreements – we don’t necessarily know what […] they’re for.”
In a press conference held on March 7 for campus media, Line Thibault, McGill’s General Counsel, told The Daily that one of the reasons behind documents being heavily redacted could be “because the third parties told us, ‘We don’t want you to [release the information].’”
According to An Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information, the University is required to consult third parties whose information may be disclosed in an ATI before releasing the request. If the third party rejects such disclosure, the University cannot reveal the information in question.
“But the students could decide to go to the [Commission d’accès à l’information] and say, ‘This is incorrect. The third parties are applying the exceptions too broadly,’” stated Thibault. “And the Commission will try to [do] a mediation, and then [if] that’s not successful, we will call a hearing […] and then the Commission will decide whether or not the documents [should be] disclosed.”
When asked whether they would appeal to the Commission, Stethem said, “It’s a possibility […] It’s something we’re trying to figure out.”
Although most of the information provided in the documents received by Demilitarize McGill was redacted, Stethem described one of his received ATIs, which included the unredacted name of a company with which the University is currently conducting military research.
“I received one in terms of military research between McGill at the [Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab] and Lockheed Martin, one of the largest military manufacturers and suppliers in the U.S. […] What the research is [however] is still not known.”
“When all of them are redacted, it mainly just goes to show the efforts that the University has taken to hide this information.”
The disclosure of Lockheed Martin’s involvement with McGill research also comes on the heels of documents released in recent weeks, not connected with the settlement, which detailed contracts between researchers at McGill and the Canadian military for research into drone software. This information led to a blockade last week of the Aerospace Mechatronics Laboratory by Demilitarize McGill.
Kevin Paul, a member of Demilitarize McGill, spoke to the lack of openness on the part of the University, upon also having obtained heavily redacted military research documents following a request to the University.
“When all of them are redacted, it mainly just goes to show the efforts that the University has taken to hide this information,” Paul added. “The result of the way that they’re handling ATIs is that there’s no possibility of an open dialogue, an open debate, on the issues regarding military research on campus.”
Demilitarize McGill intends to release a summary, as well as an analysis of all documents requested through the ATI process that it has received thus far, in the next few weeks on its website.
An earlier version of this article stated that Lockheed Martin and the Aerospace Mechatronic Laboratory were involved in research; in fact, Lockheed Martin is involved with the Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. The Daily regrets the error.

Focuses on gender representation in business and politics
Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke to a crowd of thousands at the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal on Tuesday evening. The former U.S. Secretary of State and Senator from New York focused primarily on gender and the necessity of more representation of women in business and politics.
“There are so many opportunities in our own two countries to continue to push the expansion of the rights and opportunities for women and girls, but particularly for Americans and Canadians to do more to open the doors of progress, to create equality and justice everywhere,” said Clinton.
Clinton went on to describe her transition toward viewing gender issues in economic terms. “I’ve done this work for a very long time and for most of that time, I made what was the argument of morality, the argument of justice, that every person should be respected for the gifts that he or she has, that there shouldn’t be artificial barriers. But then, in the last seven or so years, the economic arguments have become so compelling,” she said.
“We see in every country in the world what a difference it would make to this chamber of commerce, to this country’s GDP, to that in my own country, if women and girls were able to have full access and participate in the economy to the fullest of their abilities.”
Erin Cully, a recent graduate from McGill who attended the event, noted, “The economic argument for gender is a little utilitarian, which is unfortunate.”
Rebeca Cipollitti, a U1 Arts and Science student, shared the sentiment, telling The Daily, “I feel it seems like how women can make it to the top is through business, and I don’t think that is the only issue we should be attacking. I mean, there’s other things that women can help […] like the environment for example – she barely touched on that and I feel like that’s a really important issue.”
Following her speech, Clinton sat down for a question-and-answer session with the President and CEO of GazMetro, Sophie Brochu. Brochu’s questions ranged from addressing Clinton’s stance on maternity leave, to her opinions on the relationship between Canada and the U.S., to her experiences as Secretary of State.
One of Brochu’s last, and more provocative, questions centred around the idea of entering a “new Cold War.” Clinton’s response focused on the need for European countries to gain energy independence in order to be immune to Russian aggression. “The Russians can only intimidate you if you are dependent upon them,” Clinton said.
“What Putin did is illegal. It is against international law. It is not because we gave the poor little Baltic states NATO protection. And people need to say that, and they need to be very clear, that this is a clash of values and it’s an effort by Putin to re-write the boundaries of post-World War II Europe,” Clinton asserted.
Zachary Rosentzveig, a U3 Arts student who also attended the event, said, “I think it’s ironic that she criticizes Putin for beginning illegal wars when she was in Senate when the Senate voted for illegal wars.”
The event concluded with Brochu asking Clinton whether she would run for president in 2016, to which Clinton responded that she has not yet made up her mind.

Referendum question in support of Midnight Kitchen passes
Last Friday, the preliminary results of the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) elections were released, naming Juan Camilo Pinto as Secretary-General. Pinto ran unopposed for the position and was part of a slate of executives running under the same platform, all of whom were elected. Four of the seven referendum questions brought to vote passed, including increased funding for the grants program, and a renewal of funding for the health and dental plan.
The elections saw a turnout of 1,102 voters, or 13.6 per cent of those eligible to vote. The results are not yet final and may be contested within the next three days if pertaining to an individual candidate, or seven days if there are criticisms of the process as a whole.
The only position that was not uncontested was that of Academic Affairs Officer, for which Jennifer Murray was selected. “I worked really hard on this,” Murray told The Daily. “So it’s nice to know that I can do the job.”
In her platform, Murray stated that she wants to increase access to library resources, to improve student-supervisor relationships, and to bring together graduate students from different departments.
Aside from Murray, all the executives who were elected had campaigned under a single platform, also known as a slate candidacy.
“When we found out most of us were running unopposed, we started talking and figuring out what we [wanted] to do for next year,” explained Nikki Meadows, who was elected as Financial Affairs Officer. “We have a lot of really fun and exciting things planned, so hopefully we’ll be able to put them in action really soon.”
“Slate election doesn’t happen very often in PGSS,” added GeSa, newly-elected Internal Affairs Officer. “It’s great that we’ve got a common platform. We all got elected so that we can carry on that common platform which we promised to our voters.”
The incoming executives plan to focus on a set of issues that they feel are most relevant to PGSS members, including independence from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), revising the grant policy, and improved mental health services for graduate students.
Meadows explained that one of her main objectives will be to revise the grant policy. “I think right now [the] wonderful projects that grants are submitted for aren’t getting funded because [of] the way the grant policy is currently written,” she told The Daily. “They are not given as high a priority as other projects that in spirit are probably not as exciting.”
“Since my position is kind of political,” Julien Ouelett, newly-elected External Affairs Officer, told The Daily, “I will base my strategy […] on the results of the provincial elections.”
Ouelett said that he also plans to lobby the government concerning the PGSS lawsuit against the CFS.
Brigita Lungu, newly-elected Member Services Officer, was not available to make a statement to The Daily at the time the election results were released.
The referendum questions passed include standard renewals of the health and dental plan, a fee levy to fund Midnight Kitchen, a new fee for the bursary fund, and increased fees for the PGSS grants program. However, fee increases for the athletics fund, graduate applications, and PGSS membership were all voted down.
“The only [referendum] that I’m sad [about] that didn’t pass, because we need it, was the membership fee,” Pinto told The Daily. “We needed that one to pay for the lease of Thomson House.”
Overall, current PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney said that he was pleased with how the elections turned out. “We’re going to have a great team next year,” said Mooney, “and [I’m] looking forward to seeing all that they accomplish.”

Protesters advocate for more concrete action 
On March 21, demonstrators gathered at the Mont Royal metro station for a demonstration and march against colonialism, racism, and the proposed Quebec Charter of Values.
The peaceful two-hour demonstration, part of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and a recognition of the anniversary of the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa, was organized by Ensemble contre la Charte xénophobe.
According to information on the organizers’ website, the march was meant to address many issues that are prevalent in Quebec.
The site reads, “We support the self-determination and sovereignty of all Indigenous peoples in ‘Canada’ and ‘Quebec.’ […] We remember and salute the anti-racist struggles of the past, especially the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. […] We are opposed to the proposed Quebec Charter of Values (Bill 60), which is an electoral ploy that encourages racism and xenophobia in Quebec society. We march for many more reasons, united in opposition to all forms of oppression and in the belief that our solidarity and unity against colonialism and racism is our most effective tool.”
Demonstrators took the opportunity to address issues of Indigenous land rights. In a speech prior to the march, an activist for Indigenous issues from Calgary (Treaty 7 territory) maintained that recognizing injustice is not enough to combat systemic oppression. “I would of course first like to acknowledge that this demo is taking place on unceded Haudenosaunee territory,” the activist said. “And, having said that, I want to further acknowledge that recognizing that we live and work on stolen territory should be just the first step in respecting those whose lands we are occupying.”
“To be respectful guests on others’ lands requires more than just a simple acknowledgement, and I encourage all settlers and visitors to learn […] and be a good guest while you’re here.”
Many protesters also advocated against the Quebec Charter of Values, proposed by the Parti Québécois (PQ) in September 2013. The Charter would prevent “overt and conspicuous” religious symbols from being worn by public servants. The ability of the PQ to pass the Charter hinges on the results of the next provincial election in Quebec, which will take place on April 7.
Orlando, a demonstrator who identified himself as a member of the “Montreal Local” of the International Communist League, attended the demonstration to protest the Charter. “The Charte [des valeurs] is a racist law that targets a minority of women, mostly, and also Jewish people and Sikhs,” stated Orlando.
“At the same time, [the Montreal Local] talk[s] about the hypocrisy of English Canada, who attacks the Quebec government, but it forgets that it deports immigrants all the time. There are similar laws, although not as radical as this one, in English Canada.”
On the timing of the march, Orlando added, “We believe that elections are a time when people get political.”
An anonymous demonstrator, who identified themselves as a Concordia geography student, related their issues with the Charter back to the student movement of 2012. “I was really involved with the student strike in 2012, and it would just seem really shitty to not go on the streets for […] a more important cause, I think.”
Aggravated, they continued, “This Charter makes me very angry. […] There has got to be better ways to address everyone’s concerns, instead of this talk-down, polarizing thing.”
People of all ages participated in the march, from young children to seniors. One colourful group, The Montreal Raging Grannies, closed the march with a song for Quebec Premier Pauline Marois.

Discusses rape culture, access to information, and divestment 
On March 21, McGill’s Principal and Vice-Chancellor, Suzanne Fortier, met with campus media for the Principal’s annual recap of both the University’s high points, and the improvements needed for the upcoming year.
Fortier opened with what she believed were McGill’s current strengths, such as the University’s level of alumni retention, its relative size to other universities in Canada, and its location in the heart of culturally diverse downtown Montreal.
She argued that the University must set a few priorities for further improvement: namely, the creation of an intellectually engaging environment, a connected community, and an improved physical campus structure.
The McGill Daily (MD): Recently, Demilitarize McGill has finally obtained a response from McGill about their access to information (ATI) requests, and the documents have been heavily redacted. There has also been a lot of controversy over labs at McGill and McGill’s conduct with respect to research funded by the military. What are your views on this? Do you think that it is a contradiction to say that research done with the military funding might not be for military purposes?
Suzanne Fortier (SF): No, I don’t think it is a contradiction at all. […] There’s a lot of research you would do with the military that is extremely important research, and I don’t think there’s any problem in doing research for [the Department of National Defence]. If there is a problem, it’s in the specific intent of the research. A very telling test that you would do is – is this research going to be published in the public domain or is it research that is confidential? I believe that in the case that you mentioned, [the] research is totally public, there’s no research here that is proprietary or confidential.
The documents you’re referring to – that’s a different story. We’re not talking about the outcome of research here. There are laws in Canada that govern us in terms of privacy protection and access to information, two principles that often challenge one another. My understanding is that – and I have of course been seeing those requests for information for many years – the redaction is often done to follow the law with respect to privacy.
Le Délit français* (DF): During your mandate, we have seen a good evolution of the place of French on campus, for example, conferences entirely in French, the creation of the French theatre [Franc-Jeu], so many student initiatives. On your side, being francophone, how have you led this evolution within your administration?
SF: There has been an evolution also within the administration, in the sense that we are increasingly working in both languages. […] I think we have to give our students the opportunity to learn French, to take advantage of Montreal’s bilingual environment, but I don’t think it’s a good idea for McGill to become a university where instruction is given in French, because we have very good French-language universities in Montreal. That’s why I came here; if I wanted to be taught in French, I would have gone somewhere else. It’s a choice that even French-speaking students have made, and I respect that.
The Bull & Bear (B&B): Regarding administrative issues and technology, is there anything tangible already set in stone or anything that is currently being planned?
SF: Yes, we are planning a number of things. We need to make progress in the number of classes that are well-equipped digitally and in terms of our library. We already have specific actions that we’d like to put in place. At the moment, because we are entering an election, we don’t have a budget yet from the provincial government and are unlikely to have one soon.
The McGill Tribune (MT): With the government’s planned reinvestment in universities in the coming year, what are the priorities for where the money would go?
SF: A lot of it has to do with improvement to the learning environment in the area of student advising, because that’s an area that the community feels that we need to have more human resources in. We were working on an agreement with government, but with the election, nothing has been confirmed. So we will have to wait to see if, indeed, we get the money as was anticipated. […] Not a single university in the province has a signed agreement at this point. We’ll have to wait until after the elections. We don’t know at this point – c’est la vie.
B&B: Given the political situation that’s going on right now, how do you see that affecting our school?
SF: I believe that McGill will always see that as an important part of who we are – not only to be welcoming, but to be promoting cultural diversity on campus. From the very beginning, when we started to have conversations, when we spoke about the Charter of Values, we shared the views of the McGill community, fairly and strongly, and that will always be quite important.
MD: One of the big stories this year at McGill was the sexual assault case that the Montreal Gazette broke. Do you think that the University has to do more to combat rape culture, and what is your opinion on the slow and poor response to the sexual assault case?
SF: I don’t want to refer to that specific case, because it’s a very complex case, but generally there certainly is a need in society, not just on campuses of universities, to make people more sensitive to these issues. We’ve evolved as a society [since the 1980s], and that whole thing has evolved as well. […] I must say, I find it very courageous of people to address those issues which are incredibly difficult. […] The attribution of guilt and so on, that gets very complicated when you have individuals who are not in the best situation in terms of judgement. I think it is important that we talk about it very openly, but it is hard.
DF: We’ve heard a lot of talk about divestment from fossil fuels. SSMU has already chosen to renounce these investments, the many actions by Divest McGill, the incident that occurred during the Petrocultures conference. Do you think these events have had an impact on McGill? Is the University on the path to divestment?
SF: Firstly, yes, there has certainly been an impact. We were at the moment of the review of the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility’s terms of reference, and for the first time in history, we decided to consult the larger community. […] People from Divest McGill have asked us to integrate an element of research in the process, so that decisions can be made on the basis of solid data. […] It was well-received by the members of the Committee; we’ll be taking a new look at the process.
