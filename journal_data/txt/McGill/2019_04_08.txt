Increased Funding Leads to Paid Positions
The McGill Rez Project provides workshops on equity, inclusion, diversity, and anti-oppression to the nearly 3,000 students living in residence. Started in 2005 by a group of floor fellows, the workshops were created in response to a lack of understanding of consent, as well as the culture of racism, homophobia, and transphobia experienced in residences. Since then, the project has grown from four workshops over the academic year to over 100 each semester. 
“The program is constantly evolving,” Equity Facilitator Eve Finley said in an interview with the Daily. “Each year, different coordinating teams have changed [the program] and tried to deliver it in different ways, and I’m very curious to see over the years how it keeps getting better.” 
Spearheaded by Finley and fellow coordinators Charlene Lewis-Sutherland and Christelle Tessono, Rez Project has undergone several changes for the 2018-19 academic year. Following an increase in program funding and new oversight in the form of the Dean of Students, Rez Project has been able to implement new accommodations and improve accessibility. For the first time in the project’s history, coordinators were able to hire and compensate facilitators instead of recruiting them on a volunteer basis. Paid positions have allowed for longer and more in-depth training, while also reducing the number of facilitators needed to run workshops. Finley spoke to the significance of the new facilitator positions; according to her, the ability for more comprehensive training has created space for facilitators to become more deeply involved in the process. Increased funding also allowed for projectors, snacks for participants, and better facilities for workshops. The workshops themselves have also changed; the content is now aimed towards being more interactive and fostering dialogue between students. The workshops are varied in size and structure, giving students opportunities to choose a workshop best suited to their learning style. 
Finley explained that there are many misconceptions among those living in residence about the program, saying that “they think it’s going to be a couple activist students sitting down and yelling at students.” 
Finley stressed the importance of the programming, saying, “we’re talking about thousands of 17 and 18 year olds who are living alone for the first time and coming from all over the world, and all over in terms of politics, identity, knowledge and interests. So there’s bound to be conflict, there’s bound to be discrimination. So all these things are the context for why there’s a need for preventative education programming.” 
Cheryl, an undergraduate student and Rez Project facilitator, also elaborated on this point: “I want to say that the culture has gotten better – people are more willing to listen even if they don’t want to be there – but it can be difficult. Students can be disruptive or just not show up, not wanting to accept anything that doesn’t fit with their view. Even though attendance rates have gone down, the people who do show up are the ones who want to go and have a discussion and learn more, which is great.” 
“People often ask us if there are more students who ‘know this stuff already,’” Finley said. “I always say that it kind of feels that way, but there’s no way to test that. Yes, there are more students that come in knowing more, but there’s just as many students who don’t know. It’s not like that number has gone down. So it’s not like we can stop doing the programming that we’re doing. But what I think we have noticed that we’re seeing different kinds of conversations between students.” 
Organizers are working to expand the project beyond residences through partnerships with individual faculties. They hope to orchestrate more workshops on MacDonald campus, and to make the program available for first-year students who don’t live in residence, as well as for other undergraduate students at McGill. 
“There’s a lot of programming that gets directed towards first year students in residence, which is great and definitely needed, but at the same time these resources and tools should really be made available to students living off-campus as well,” Finley told the Daily. 
In addition to expanding the project, Finley spoke of plans to hire four new facilitators, two French-speaking and two Mandarin-speaking, in order to make workshops more accessible to the large population of students who are not native English speakers. Finally, organizers of the project are planning to change the name. “Rez Project” is too similar to the colloquial term for Indigenous Reserves, and does not accurately convey the program’s functions and purpose. Regarding the name change, Finley stressed the importance of the project’s history, expressing that the basis of its origins should always be emphasized as the Rez Project moves forward. 
Finley also addressed the continued impacts of the project, saying, “we do know that lots of students, students who have been marginalized in some way or experienced sexual assault, come up to us after workshops and really have a very positive experience and feel very validated in what they’ve gone through. And there are also a lot of people who who just think that having the workshops in and of themselves sends a really positive message to the student body, especially marginalized students. I think the impact is long term, which we’ll continue to see as the project continues.” 
Cheryl agreed, saying, “[Rez Project] gives students a sort of insight into what the culture here is, while also giving them the tools to understand how to deal with issues that may come up for them. I remember in my in my first year I didn’t have that, and it took me years to find the resources I needed. This program can just hand it to you in the first month. I think it’s so helpful for students.”

Or: A Star Trek Retirement Party
The Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) held their annual general meeting (AGM) last Thursday, April 4. QPIRG is a non-profit, student-run organization committed to social and environmental justice through campus and community activism. QPIRG’s main vehicle of activism is its educational programs, such as Social Justice Days, as well as initiatives providing funding to various working groups. The AGM provides a space for these various working groups to come together and discuss projects they worked on during the previous year. The Star Trek retirement party-themed meeting, held in Leacock 232, began by adopting the agenda and approving last year’s AGM minutes. 
Becca Yu, QPIRG’s Finance Coordinator, then presented the organization’s financial reports. The organization ended the 2017- 2018 year with a larger surplus than the year before, largely due to the third full-time staff position remaining unfilled for a short period of time, as well as lower working group spending. With this surplus, the organization bought a camera, a projector, and laptops for staff members and working groups to use. 
QPIRG staff members then proceeded to give their reports. Staff updated attendees on School Schmool as well as QPIRG’s Popular Education Event Series, which includes Culture Shock and Social Justice Days. 
Coordinators of Rad Frosh reflected on their alternative to SSMU’s Frosh that took place in September. This year’s Rad Frosh theme was “We’ve got the beat,” which the coordinators described as an attempt to “archive the reciprocal relationship of social justice and political activism of the ‘80s in relation to the present.” Rad Frosh took place in September and offered 152 participants events such as radical campus tours, Queer prom, a DIY fair, and benefit concerts hosted by BIPOC artists. According to staff members, it was highly attended and a very successful event. 
Other presentations included the organization’s outreach report and the summer stipend report, which was awarded to the Third Eye Collective this past summer to construct a zine with resources for sexual and genderbased violence. After updates from the library coordinator, the Community University Research Exchange (CURE), and the Prisoner Correspondence Project, the meeting moved to board reports. 
The Board of Directors, the radical research committee, the policy committee, and the accessibility committee all presented brief updates from the past year. Their biggest challenge for the year was reaching quorum and disseminating information between board members for time-sensitive issues. 
The meeting then moved to elections for student members and community spots on the Board of Directors, as well as elections for the Conflict Resolution and Complaints Committee (CRCC). Everyone who ran for the positions was elected; this includes nine students elected as student representatives to the Board of Directors, two individuals elected as community representatives to the Board, and two individuals elected to the CRCC. 
Finally, all of QPIRG’s working groups in attendance gave their annual reports. A great deal of QPIRG’s mandate is carried out through working groups, who operate autonomously from QPIRG, but receive funding and resources from QPIRG. This past year, QPIRG supported 18 working groups, all of which centre their research and action around social and environmental issues. Working groups include Food against Fascism, Independent Jewish Voice, McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, Women from the Committee of Women of Diverse Origins, Black Indigenous Harm Reduction Alliance, Solidarity Across Borders, and STAND for Prison Justice, among others. 
The AGM allowed QPIRG and its working groups to report to its members on the work they have done over the year. For attendees, it was a reminder of all the various organizations that exist on campus and in the community, and what students can look forward to for the upcoming year

McGill Students Await Principal’s Decision
Students are still waiting on a final verdict from the administration regarding a potential change to the men’s varsity team name. In an email sent to students in January, Principal Suzanne Fortier stated that she would communicate her decision by the end of this term. She has yet to release a decision. 
“I honestly am very optimistic that it will be changed within the next month. In any other circumstances I wouldn’t believe this to be true, but I really do think that we’ve crossed our t’s and dotted our i’s here,” explains Tomas Jirousek, a varsity athlete, SSMU’s current Indigenous Affairs Commissioner, and a major figure behind the Change the Name Movement. “I think this current manifestation of Indigenous students pushing on the R*dmen name is one of the best shots we’ve taken at changing it in quite a while,” he added. 
The Change the Name movement has received overwhelming support from the McGill community during this academic year. On October 31, hundreds of students supporting the #ChangeTheName campaign participated in a demonstration in front of the James Administration building. During the 2018 SSMU Fall Referendum, 80 per cent of students said they were in favour of renaming the men’s varsity teams. More recently, a large banner that read “Change the Name” was hung from the roof of Leacock before being removed by security in a matter of minutes. 
“The type of support we’ve received really shows how powerful we can be as a community when we stand together,” says Jirousek. The banner drop took place during the voting period for the proposed Athletics Facility Improvement Fee, a fee to which the Indigenous Student Alliance, and other equity groups on campus, are strongly opposed to. 
The Athletics Facility Improvement Fee, included in the Winter 2019 SSMU referendum, asked if students are willing to continue paying ten dollars per semester for Athletics Facility Improvement, justifying the fee by arguing that “athletics and recreation is an integral part of student life on campus.” The “No” campaign pointed out that “the approval of the Athletics Facility Improvement Fee would only enable McGill athletics and further limit Indigenous students from using facilities which are meant to be open and accessible to all McGill students.” Fifty-eight per cent of students voted “No,” 42 “Yes,” and 20.7 per cent abstained. 
“Part of the reason why I pushed so hard for this ‘No’ vote was because I don’t think it’s fair or appropriate that Indigenous students are left out in the cold while the other students move forward without us. If we are going to invest in renovating and fixing the athletics facilities it should be done in a way that’s equitable, in a way that’s open to all students,” explained Jirousek. 
At the March 28 meeting of SSMU Legislative Council, former VP External Conor Spencer read a statement on behalf of Tomas Jirousek, and Christelle Tessono, president of the Black Students’ Network. The statement explains that by letting this question be a part of the winter referendum, SSMU has failed “in its mandate to stand as an ally with Indigenous students at McGill.” By including the question, SSMU failed to realize that “McGill athletics complexes exist as physically hostile environments for Indigenous students […] [the racism of the R*dmen name] is physically manifested in these athletic facilities.” 
“Reconciliation sometimes requires sacrifice,” Spencer concluded. 
While they attribute most of their success to the widespread support they have gathered on campus, Change the Name leaders recognize that the increasing awareness surrounding the need for reconciliation at a larger scale has given them precious momentum. 
“Voices are starting to come out. In recent years, we’ve seen Indigenous voices really coming through in the media. It’s a time when we had the right people in the right place. You had a team of students that were really passionate about it and they saw an opportunity, in this day and age where we can actually talk about these things,” points out co-chair of the Indigenous Students Alliance and varsity athlete Vanessa Racine.

Walkout in Protest of Ford Government Changes
In January 2019, Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government, led by Premier Doug Ford, announced that they were cutting post-secondary tuition by 10 per cent, as well as giving students the option to choose what student fees they pay. The Ford government believes that this is a “historic” move which empowers students through its prioritization of merit and choice. However, to enact these changes the Ford government had to scrap the generous additions to the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) made by the previous Liberal government. There will no longer be a six month grace period for student loans, nor will low-income students be granted free tuition. According to the Ford government, the overhaul of OSAP is necessary because the program is not “financially sustainable.” Student groups and initiatives set to lose funding through these changes include campus papers and other support groups for marginalized students. Many critics point out that these changes will predominantly harm low-income students and families by decreasing the accessibility of postsecondary education and eliminating the funding for student services. 
On March 20, university and college students across Ontario participated in demonstrations protesting Ford’s changes. The walkout was organized by the Ontario branch of the Canadian Federation of Students in conjunction with other student groups and unions. Participants demanded that the government provide more grants than loans to students and protect their right to organize. Many students protesting told various media outlets that Ford’s changes mean that they will not be able to return to school for the following academic year. In March, the Ford government also introduced a variety of changes to kindergarten, primary, and secondary institutions. These changes involved cuts in funding, increased class sizes, revised sexual education and mathematics programs, and the introduction of e-learning in schools. The sexual education policy in particular has been a controversial topic in Ontario. Following the Ford government’s repeal of the Liberal’s progressive curriculum, students were left with material last updated in 1998. Ford’s version delays the introduction of topics pertaining to gender and identity, putting LGBTQ youth at risk. 
The increase in class sizes would result in decreased time spent with each student, and would also further affect the school’s capability to offer specialized courses. Additionally, the government has claimed that schools would receive attrition protection to prevent loss of teacher jobs. However, if the number of expected layoffs exceeds the attrition number, this could result in unemployment throughout the province. The Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association expects the loss of approximately 5,000 teaching positions in Catholic schools. 
On April 4, high school students across Ontario walked out of class to protest these changes. Sarah Cann, a grade 12 student from Welland, Ontario told the Daily, “I protested because I wanted to show the Ford administration that students will not turn a blind eye to his destructive policies. Students are not a group so easily trampled upon, and we will be extremely vocal in our fight against these cuts. Doug Ford deserves to see the faces of those he’s directly affecting.”
