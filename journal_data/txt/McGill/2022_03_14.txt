For the first time, the Black Law Students’ Association of Canada (BLSA) will survey Canadian law schools to compile a ranking of law schools for Black students. As advertised on the BLSA Twitter page, the BLSA will conduct research that looks at law schools across the country. According to Fanta Ly, a supporting committee member of the BLSA at McGill (BLSAM) and BLSA national mentorship representative, this survey will take into account the application processes, scholarships, responses to discrimination, and the experiences of Black students and faculty at each school. Ly says the rankings should be completed by the end of this summer.
In an interview with the Daily, Ly explained that “McGill is really the only educational environment that I’ve been in where anti-Black racism was so intense and so repeated that it impacted my ability to do my studies.” This has prompted her to get involved in initiatives – such as the Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism at McGill, BLSAM, and the national BLSA – aiming to combat anti-Black racism at McGill and at the national level. 
In her role as the BLSA national director of mentorship, Ly focuses on the retention rate of Black law students. She estimates the usual number of Black law students being eight out of 186 students in the faculty. At the University of Calgary in 2020, three of the more than 350 law students were Black.
Increasing Black representation is a goal of many of Canada’s law schools. In 2020, the University of Toronto launched the Black Future Lawyers Program, which gives Black students the opportunity to participate in job shadowing programs, workshops, and a “special application process” for prospective students, among other resources. Many Canadian law schools have established initiatives encouraging Black students to apply to their programs in recent years. Western University’s Faculty of Law now offers $1,000 packages to five Black undergraduate applicants to financially support them in the application process. In June 2021, the University of British Columbia announced that its Faculty of Law would fund the tuition of 15 Black students using $225,000 donated by various lawyers from the province. 
Ly told the Daily, “For scholarships, you’ll notice that a lot of the new ones are only four years [for Black students]. For other scholarships, there is an endowment.” These endowed scholarships exist in perpetuity, providing the scholarship recipient with long-term payment – as opposed to the short-term money received for a four-year scholarship.
These initiatives will be considered as part of the BLSA’s rankings. Ly says, “Right now what we are doing is putting together all of the initiatives that were put forth last year and comparing what [the law schools] are doing. I’m reaching out to an admissions officer right now just to get an idea of what their plan is.” The rankings will serve to facilitate a national conversation to compare the actions of various law schools, according to Ly. She adds, “But [the Canadian law schools] don’t want to have [a conversation] because they’re scared of having a discussion on anything related to anti-Black racism, or they just don’t care.”
At McGill, the BLSAM and the Admissions Office team host a Law School and Diversity Information Session each fall. The goal of the session is to reach out to marginalized student groups at universities and CEGEPs in the Montreal area who might be interested in pursuing a career in law. According to McGill’s diversity and inclusion statement on the Law Faculty website, “We believe that it is essential to our excellence as an institution that our community reflect the diversity of the society our students will serve as jurists after they graduate.”
According to Ly, Black law students have informed McGill about the discrimination they have faced. Ly says, “Last fall, two students – I’m one of them – filed a complaint against McGill at the Quebec Human Rights Commission. It’s actually a common thing. McGill has gotten a lot of complaints through there because the internal process is an incredibly flawed process. I went through it myself as well last year.”
Ly adds, “As part of my complaint I tried to do a systemic argument as well. So, I met with a lot of alumni. I spoke with a lot of people. I documented testimonies. I’ve been getting numbers of the amount of students that were kicked out of the program or that dropped out.” This type of research led her to realize the value of the information she was collecting and the benefit it would serve to Black students applying to law school. This information, when included in the BLSA rankings, would also serve as a form of accountability, according to Ly.
Ly informed the Daily of an incident she faced regarding a motion on anti-Black racism she wanted to put forth as a part of her role on faculty council. Ly said, “I have the right to present a motion. I wanted to put a motion on anti-Black racism, and then the Dean refused. I called him out on it, and he tried to reintroduce it.” Ly then refused in fear of retaliation. She said, “If you call things out, there’s a big price to pay.”
Asked about anti-Black racism incidents she has faced, Ly cited the overturning of student rights as she was applying for a minor. Previously, a law student needed a 2.7 GPA to apply for a minor. However, Ly explained that approving a student’s application for a minor is now “at the discretion of the faculty. So, they changed the website and they changed the minor. But the Student Charter of Rights says that no policy can be changed retroactively [to] the detriment of the student.” This came after Ly had previously filed a complaint with McGill’s Faculty of Law concerning anti-Black racism.
McGill’s Faculty of Law faced controversy in October 2021, when Black students urged the faculty’s dean, Robert Leckey, to take accountability for his discrimination against Black students. The Twitter page @BlackAtMcGill wrote that Leckey was ignoring Black students who have “written to him reporting feeling suicidal due to the unabated harassment and discrimination they experienced at the Faculty of Law.” Leckey also ignored the threats and academic retaliation that Black students were subject to after denouncing Associate Dean Rosalie Jukier’s racist and ableist management, according to the page. The Twitter page states: “It is time for McGill’s Faculty of Law to uphold the equality principles they teach but deny Black students, and for McGill’s Equity Office to break with its usual complicit and oppressive silence and creases replicating through deceptive policy the same prejudice and biases it has been mandated to present and redress McGill-wide.”
Ly told the Daily, “Before, administrators could hide behind the fact that they weren’t aware of what [Black students] were experiencing. I remember I sent an email outlining everything I’ve experienced and then the Dean responded by saying, ‘We gave you a stipend.’” Ly posted on Twitter that Dean Leckey gave her a $13,000 stipend last summer which Leckey wrote was to “support her summer studies.” Ly wrote in her post that she wants to remind all McGill law graduates that “Dean Leckey uses your money to silence Black students. Sorry, my humanity is not for sale and this Faculty needs to stop traumatizing Black students.”
Ly hopes that the BLSA rankings will provide Black students looking to apply to law school with information she wishes she had before applying. As another goal, Ly says, “My idea is to also share [the rankings] with the Canadian Bar Association and other bodies that have some type of relationships with law schools. It could be partners, law firms, donors.”
When asked about how often the rankings will be made, Ly told the Daily, “It’s going to depend on the resources that we have, but I think that every two years would be a more feasible timeline. But at least having on [the BLSA] website something that updates students on what is happening [at each law school].”

Dr. Anne H. Charity Hudley discusses Black language in higher education
On February 11, Dr. Anne Charity Hudley delivered a public lecture as part of the McGill Linguistics Colloquium Series. The event was organized by McGill Linguistics faculty members Jessica Coon, Heather Goad, and Siva Reddy. Anne H. Charity Hudley, a professor of education at Stanford University “and Professor of African-American Studies and Linguistics by courtesy” presented her initiative “Talking College.”
The Talking College Project
Given the field’s history of racial inequality, Charity Hudley highlights the importance of establishing reparations in linguistics while recognizing and celebrating the importance of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In her presentation, Charity Hudley noted that “American quantitative sociolinguistics has, over the past quarter century, drawn substantially on data from African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and the African American speech community for its descriptive, theoretical, and methodological development, but it has given relatively little back to that community in terms of representation or practice application.” Charity Hudley’s project strives to minimize the disparity in academic recognition between Black and white communities by “recognizing the material and intellectual profit from the linguistic value of community knowledge” and by recognizing the systemic “punishment of Black success on [a] national and university level.”
Some of Charity Hudley’s past initiatives to integrate primary and secondary education on Black language usage include published works such as Understanding English Language Variation in U.S. Schools (2011) and We Do Language: English Language Variation in the Secondary English Classroom (2013). The release of Talking College: Making Space for Black Language Practices in Higher Education will advance Charity Hudley’s linguistics-based initiatives.
The Methodology of Talking College
According to the Talking College website, the textbook’s methodology is framed in “real-world examples of Black undergraduates attending colleges and universities in the United States” and regards their experiences of “African American English and Black language practices.” Charity Hudley explains that these “combinations of stories become a new way to reframe the sociolinguistic interview such that the individual narrative is never disembodied – the person and the individual is more fully woven into the collective.” Charity Hudley emphasizes this collective of academic identities as an asset to the project – she shared in her lecture that students involved in the Talking College initiative were “represented across the Black diaspora.”
The research assessed students in the following categories:
The representation of Black students across a spectrum of standardized English and African-American English proficiency allows for widely applicable findings, according to Charity Hudley, and demonstrates the project’s commitment to represent “Black college students everywhere.”
Prioritizing Students
Charity Hudley reminded attendees of her lecture that her work “is for Black college students everywhere.” Her commitment to making the experience of Black Stanford students “better in real time” conveys the importance of “Black experiences” to her work, she explained. Through her research, Charity Hudley has documented an array of Black voices and experiences in various levels of college education – including many who express concern about their use of language. In her presentation, Charity Hudley quoted one graduate from a predominantly white institution (PWI) who expressed that “[she] ha[sn’t] always felt comfortable with [her] voice as [she is] now.” Although this student was categorized as one who speaks standardized English and not African-American English, she shared feelings of “being judged for how [she] looks and how [she] talks”. The acknowledgment of such racialized experiences of “linguistic expectations” in Talking College helps “advanc[e] racial justice, both on college campuses and throughout society,” explained Charity Hudley.  
Through Talking College, Dr. Charity Hudley described the critical roles of race and language “to address racism” of all forms, both in higher education and in society more generally. In response to several questions she was asked following the lecture, Charity Hudley encouraged instructors to consider whether they are prioritizing their own goals or those of their students. She claims that student-centred education is integral to realizing the academic and social goals of Talking College. 
Talking College will be available through Teachers College Press, Amazon, and Barnes and Noble. Though the website specifies that the book is “specifically tailored for African-American students,” it adds that Talking College “also provides crucial information for any reader who seeks to support the educational experiences of African-American students.”

Student Navigators to be paid $5 less per hour
On February 12, students employed at the Humanities and Social Sciences Library through the Work Study Program were notified by email that their contracts were going to end prematurely. Students are normally hired on a semester-by-semester basis, with contracts for Winter terms ending in April. 
Students hired as Safety Ambassadors and Student Navigators were invited to reapply under different contract conditions. Employee A told the Daily that this new contract, set to begin February 13 and end April 30, employs students solely under the title of Student Navigator and reduces the hourly pay and maximum hours students are allowed to work: from $20/hour for 20 hours a week to $15.23/hour for 15 hours a week – a 25 per cent reduction in total salary. As all students working at the library are employed through Work Study, the negative impacts of this sudden wage reduction are far-reaching. Employee A, a student affected by the pay cut, expressed that the simultaneous reduction in hourly rate and maximum weekly hours “was the worst part.” 
The duties of Safety Ambassadors included scanning vaccine passports, checking Fast-Pass stickers on student IDs, and fulfilling the additional library duties of a Student Navigator. Student Navigators shelve returned books, retrieve requested materials, repair books, and ensure that each book in the library has an accurate barcode. In their justification of the pay cut to students, McGill stated that the Student Navigator position is “not as complex as the Safety Ambassador hence the lower classification and rate.” However, Employee A told the Daily that “those who were hired as both Safety Ambassadors and Student Navigators initially did mixed duties, but by the end of November we were all, both new hires and old, doing the job of Student Navigator nearly 100 per cent of the time.” Essentially, the tasks that many students are responsible for remain unchanged under the new contract. 
Having reached out to the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE), Employee A explained that AMUSE has been in conversation with McGill Human Resources since the February 12 notification. In a statement to the Daily, James Newman, President of AMUSE, said that the union considers “the arbitrary and capricious cutting of pay and hours to be absolutely unacceptable, especially during the throes of the pandemic with rising inflation and cost of living expenses making life so much harder for our workers. We will take all measures necessary and appropriate to fight for fair wages for our workers and against these devastating cuts.” AMUSE has yet to receive a response from McGill HR to clarify the situation and “reach a just and equitable solution to these members’ issues.”
The Daily reached out to the Work Study department at McGill University to discuss the matter, to which they commented:
As part of the Work Study Program, the McGill Library hires students to perform various tasks, including digitizing cultural heritage materials, organizing archival collections, and researching artwork to writing Library blog posts and social media posts, and acting as information assistants.
In October 2021, when the vaccine passport became mandatory to physically access library spaces, a number of students who had been hired on as Student Navigators were temporarily reassigned into a different position category (with a different pay grade) to work as Safety Ambassadors and help deal with lines and the Fast-Pass registration during this transitional period. Since that time, McGill has gradually introduced its Fast-Pass program, allowing to bring a number of Safety Ambassadors back into their original hiring position category as Student Navigators.
This statement does not acknowledge that the pre-pandemic hourly rate for Work Study library employees was $5 greater than that stipulated by the current contract. “This is a huge deal for us as far as adding an undue amount of stress,” Employee A said. “We’re already students. We’re focusing on getting a degree so we can get a job that would allow us some sort of financial freedom, and then we have a job on top of that already because we need to pay for living while we are studying.” As of March 9, there have not been any updates to the situation. 
The library “couldn’t function without us, but we sure as hell don’t feel appreciated,” Employee A writes.
A previous version of this article stated that the pre-pandemic hourly rate was greater for Student Navigators than stipulated by the current contract. The article has been updated to encompass the Safety Ambassador position as well. 
The Daily regrets this error.
