Sixth grade students had no idea about genocide, petitioner says
The Montreal-based Foundation for the Compulsory Study of Genocide in Schools is currently fighting for the provincial government to incorporate mandatory genocides studies in Quebec high schools.
Genocide is defined as the purposeful killing of a large group of people, particularly from a specific nation or ethnic group. Heidi Berger, creator of the foundation and an instructor at the Concordia Centre for Continuing Education, argues that too many secondary school students leave school with little to no information about genocides such as the Holocaust or Canada’s residential school system, as Quebec high schools do not integrate these histories enough into their curriculum.
To rectify this, the foundation has collected 1,245 signatures for a petition asking “that the National Assembly and the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Research act to make the study of genocide compulsory in all Quebec high schools as a means to creating a tolerant and peaceful society which is accepting of all cultures and religions.”
The petition also states that “racial and cultural intolerance and discrimination are the preconditions associated with the beginnings to genocide.”
Earlier this month, Liberal Member of the National Assembly David Birnbaum tabled this petition in the Assembly.
In an interview with The Daily, Berger emphasized that “recognition is so important, and not only for high school students. You have all these students in CEGEP and university now who got the education and how important it is, that once they leave the university gates, that they themselves understand the stages that lead to genocide.”
“Recognition is so important, and not only for high school students. You have all these students in CEGEP and university now who got the education and how important it is, that once they leave the university gates, that they themselves understand the stages that lead to genocide.”
Marcy Bruck, communications officer for the foundation, told The Daily, “[Berger] felt what was being taught wasn’t enough. […] She felt that the emphasis on genocide was very sporadic and that some sixth grade students had no idea about these very serious issues.”
The provincial government’s most recent official position on this is that teachers should have control over their curriculum, and that they, not the government, should choose how to incorporate the study of past genocides into their lessons. According to the government, compulsory studies would only serve as an extra layer of government intervention that high school students don’t need.
However, Bruck said, “This is not a difficult change to make. Teachers’ unions have expressed interests in adding genocide studies to their curriculum, and now it just comes to trying to pressure the government to very seriously consider this.”
“This is the time right now, from a social point of view, for these kids to learn about this, and the government should have a part in making that happen,” Berger added.
Berger also argues that Canada’s long history of accepting refugees, including but not limited to Jewish, Rwandan, Congolese, and Armenian people, warrants the province considering the next step and denouncing genocidal practices by opening students’ eyes to the reality of how genocide occurs.
“The only time that we actually expanded on genocide was in our last year of high school in our history class […] when we discussed Rwanda.”
Tiffany Alves-Wallace, a former Dawson College student and current McGill student, told The Daily, “Genocide was not a big part of our curriculum. […] The only time that we actually expanded on genocide was in our last year of high school in our history class […] when we discussed Rwanda.”
“I learned more about the Holocaust in CEGEP during my history classes, [specifically about] Germany due [to] my being in the language program and having mandatory classes for the country,” Alves-Wallace noted.
Alves-Wallace added that “We never really touched upon the impact of European influence on the Indigenous societies in Canada.”
The foundation has said in past interviews that the government has suggested they plead their case to the individual school boards of Quebec, but with seventy school boards in the provinces, that could possibly take years.

Chilean political refugees were crucial in Quebec socialism, say panelists
Approximately 250 people gathered at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) campus on February 11 to attend a panel titled, “Réfugiés et immigrantes au Québec: une longue histoire de solidarité internationale à partir de l’experiénce chilienne” (“Refugees and immigrants in Quebec: a long history of international solidarity based on the Chilean experience”).
The panel was organized by the Comité pour les droits humains en Amérique latine (CDHAL) and various local liaison groups that support human rights, labour activism, and anti-imperialist activism.
Panelists Suzanne-G. Chartrand, José del Pozo, Clotilde Bertrand, Carmen Gloria Quintana, and Mouloud Idir devoted a significant portion of the discussion to ways in which the Chilean immigrant community had become an integral part of social movements within Quebec and elsewhere abroad. The panel also explained the legacy of Quebec socialist movements of the 1970s and 1980s and their equally important roles in removing the Chilean dictatorship.
Chileans began to arrive en masse to Quebec in 1973, following the coup d’état that ousted and killed the democratically elected president Salvador Allende and installed General Augusto Pinochet for a 17-year military rule.
Del Pozo, a Chilean associate professor of history at UQAM, explained to the audience in French that Chileans integrated into Quebec society remarkably fast, indicated by the lack of a “Chilean ghetto” in Montreal, and the fact that “within one generation, Quebec began to see Chilean immigrants running for political office by 1990.”
Chartrand, a founding member of the Comité Québec-Chili (CQC), explained in French that a major part of the CQC’s activism at the time was informing and mobilizing Quebec’s unions and left-leaning political groups to take a stand against Pinochet’s regime by boycotting companies that profited from the disappearances and extrajudicial killings of the military dictatorship.
“Within one generation, Quebec began to see Chilean immigrants running for political office by 1990.”
According to Chartrand, the Quebec political sphere was a space where “the word ‘socialism’ certainly existed in 1973,” with many syndicalist groups working together for “a national liberation in the context of a social, socialist transformation, and this was relatively close to the project of [Allende’s leftist coalition] Popular Unity.”
This, Chartrand argued, explains how Chilean immigrants who supported Allende would have integrated themselves with relative ease into Quebec’s labour movement.
Chartrand also explained, however, that the CQC faced a challenge in terms of explaining to those mobilizing within Quebec that the problem was not just the coup d’état or Pinochet, but rather the complicity of “French, […] Canadian, American, and Japanese multinationals” with “American imperialism.”
The panel also included discussion of the Quebec socialist movement’s involvement in the Chilean struggle after the coup. Bertrand, who was the Québec solidaire candidate for Argenteuil in the 2014 elections and the former coordinator of the Centre internationale de solidarité ouvrière (CISO), spoke on the topic.
Bertrand explained in French that, just as Chilean immigrants to Quebec were willing to get involved with Quebec’s socialist political groups, Quebec socialists that supported “our grand comrade [and former president of the Confédération des syndicats nationale (CSN)] Michel Chartrand were eager to heed his call to help Chileans immediately following the 1973 coup.”
According to a 2002 study by the York University Latin American Research Group, this support took the form of pressuring the Canadian government to consider Chileans fleeing the violence as refugees. The study noted that this sent a powerful message to the rest of the world that Canada, a major trade partner of Pinochet’s Chile, was willing to recognize the crisis and welcome Chileans seeking safety.
The CISO and other Quebec labour groups were grateful for Chilean immigrants’ contributions to their struggles, said Bertrand. “The Chileans who came,” she concluded, “were a gift to Quebec.”

McGill BDS event series sets the stage for SSMU General Assembly
Last week, the McGill BDS Action Network hosted an event series as part of its campaign leading up to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA), which takes place today. The group’s motion at the GA asks SSMU to support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns and to recommend to McGill’s Board of Governors to divest from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
The event series, which ran from February 16 to February 20, included a panel discussion with Montreal-based activists, a talk by Rabbi Cantor Michael Davis called “The Moral Case for BDS,” and the screening of three Palestinian short films. The event series ended on Saturday with a concert and open mic event.
Laura Khoury, an organizer with McGill BDS, told The Daily that the event series was organized “to engage [students] in a discussion about the Palestinian cause and to further discuss the call from Palestinian civil society to carry out boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel until it complies with international law.”
The Montreal-based activists on the panel held on February 16 were Palestinian activist Zahia El-Masri and writer and community organizer Mostafa Henaway. The panelists spoke about the BDS movement as “a critical tool” for showing international solidarity, highlighting its importance to the Palestinian struggle.
El-Masri highlighted the significance of raising awareness, especially given the lack of mainstream knowledge about the Palestinian struggle. “What it means to be Palestinian today is to be negated the right of your identity, it’s to be negated the right of return, it’s to even be negated the right to have the collective imaginary of a Palestinianhood,” El-Masri said.
Henaway also argued that the BDS movement is imperative because “it’s coming from Palestinians themselves, and they’re demanding our solidarity in this way.”
Speaking about supporting BDS at McGill specifically, El-Masri said, “Every move that you make, every action, every time you spread the word about what’s going on, don’t underestimate it. It makes a difference.” Henaway pointed to student campaigns for McGill to divest from South African apartheid as an example, and explained that the call for BDS was initiated in Durban, South Africa at the 2001 World Conference against Racism.
“The South African delegation wanted to highlight Zionism as a form of apartheid, as a form [of] discrimination and racial inequality that the international community has to uphold as a priority in terms of Israel’s acceptance of international law,” Henaway said.
The call for BDS, he explained, was founded on “fundamental principles of universal justice – that Palestinians should have the same rights that Israeli citizens are able to have.”
“What it means to be Palestinian today is to be negated the right of your identity, it’s to be negated the right of return, it’s to even be negated the right to have the collective imaginary of a Palestinianhood.”
McGill did not divest from South African apartheid until 1985, and Henaway said that while “we look back now on history and lots of people think, ‘How could anybody support South African apartheid, one of the ugliest forms of a racist, colonial state.’ […] There was complete mainstream support for it. It was ‘a liberal democracy in a sea of barbarism in Africa,’ and it’s the same logic that many people who support Israeli apartheid use today.”
During the discussion period, a student in the audience asked the panelists to respond to an argument commonly made against BDS, which is that it negatively affects citizens of Israel.
Henaway responded, “It’s the status quo that actually hurts Israeli citizens at the moment. It’s the fact that they’re seen as supporting an occupation, it’s the fact that […] it’s mandatory for all Israelis to serve [in]the military, the fact that their state is imploding, all of this as a result of an ongoing colonial project impacts them negatively.”
“By supporting BDS, you’re only basically supporting international law,” El-Masri concluded.
Yusuf, a U1 Economics student who attended the panel discussion, told The Daily, “I found the panel very informative, and they gave me new insight into real situations […] that happen in Palestine on a daily basis. […] It was very easy [to] relate to the points they were making, especially in the context of North America.”
 
Also listen to the multimedia coverage of the panel, hosted by Anya Sivajothy.

Significant step taken in addressing previous lack of policy
Warning: This article contains discussion of sexual assault.
On February 17, the Sexual Assault Policy (SAP) Working Group released the final draft of the proposed Sexual Assault Policy for McGill, which has been in the works for two years.
Jean Murray, a member of the working group and McGill alumnus, told The Daily that the policy had two aims: “One, make it so that folks who’ve experienced sexual assault don’t have to go to the police, and that doesn’t have to be their only recourse, and two, that there will be institutionalized safety measures in place so that folks can feel safe and comfortable in their community.”
“I’m so happy that they’ve included that survivors should interact only with people who have adequate training on sexual assault,” said Leila*, a student who has experienced sexual assault. “That has definitely not been my experience. The disciplinary officer that I interacted with literally re-traumatized me with her language. I left her office crying.”
“The folks who are disproportionately affected by sexual assault and sexual violence are people of colour, are trans people – specifically trans women of colour – and folks with disabilities.”
The Working Group first convened in 2013 after sexual assault charges against three McGill football players brought attention to the lack of any policy to deal with sexual assault at the university.
Murray explained why the policy took years to develop, saying that the Working Group consulted with numerous student groups in pursuit of a truly intersectional policy.
“We’re largely a working group of mostly white people, almost exclusively able-bodied people,” explained Murray. “The folks who are disproportionately affected by sexual assault and sexual violence are people of colour, are trans people – specifically trans women of colour – and folks with disabilities.”
“We wanted to ensure that the folks who were affected by this most were also the ones who were also having a voice in the creation of the policy, without trying to place too much of the burden of creating this policy on those people,” they added.
Among other suggestions, the SAP proposes creating an office under the Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures & Equity) that would serve as the primary resource for issues regarding sexual assault and be maintained by a full-time Sexual Assault Resource Coordinator.
“I was also never really contacted by the administration about the outcome of my case, so I’m glad the SAP is addressing that,” said Leila.
Though this version of the policy is the final draft, it may still undergo further changes. The policy is currently under review by Dean of Students André Costopoulos and Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures & Equity) Angela Campbell. The Working Group hopes to bring a final version of the policy to Senate later this semester.
“I’m really afraid that the person who sexually assaulted me would harass me after he graduates.”
Leila expressed concern over a perceived disjunction between measures to protect people who have experienced sexual assault, during and after their university career.
“I’m really afraid that the person who sexually assaulted me would harass me after he graduates. There may be a no-contact order on him right now – I actually don’t know because the administration has not been responsive – but what is going to happen after he graduates and he is no longer held up to these measures?” Leila said. “I wish there would be a continuity between the SAP and the police for no-contact measures once perpetrators graduate.”

Cemetery holds remains of 16 internees who died in the camp
It has been just over 100 years since the Spirit Lake internment camp opened in 1915 and 125 years since the beginning of Ukrainian settlement in Canada. The camp was located near Amos, six and a half hours away from Montreal.
This month, the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association is requesting the intervention of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Mélanie Joly, to protect a cemetery containing the remains of 16 people who died at the Spirit Lake camp.
One of three internment camps in Quebec, the Spirit Lake camp was part of a national campaign to register an estimated 80,000 people and imprison 8,579 throughout the country. The majority of those who were interned were of Ukrainian heritage, from a region that was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Spirit Lake camp would become the second largest of Quebec’s internment camps, as a result of the War Measures Act, and prejudice and panic during World War I.
Established by the Government of Canada in 2008, the Endowment Council of the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund “has a formal mandate to secure and restore internee cemeteries.”
The council has done so successfully in Kapuskasing, Ontario and Fernie, British Columbia. According to a press release, “The Council has not, however, been able to acquire, repair, or re-consecrate the Spirit Lake internee cemetery, despite having made repeated inquiries over eight years, during which time the internee cemetery has further deteriorated.”
The land on which the cemetery is located was acquired in 1988 by a farming couple. Efforts made by the Spirit Lake Camp Corporation to incorporate the internee cemetery, or at least restore and secure limited rights of access, have been rebuffed by the owners.
In an email to The Daily, Yurij Luhovy, an award-winning producer and director of Okradena Zemlya (“Stolen Land”), a documentary on the Holodomor 1932-33 famine-genocide in Soviet Ukraine, spoke about the conditions in the camps.
“It was grueling, strenuous hard work. Internees were used for hard labour with little pay. What little wealth some had, was confiscated. Some were bayonetted. Many suffered from accidents while cutting the wood,” he wrote.
“There was a pre-existing prejudice against these people in Canadian society that was exacerbated by war-time [panic].”
“[Internees] were forced not only to maintain the camps but to work for private concerns. Often they were mistreated by the guards. These harsh conditions and forced confinement took not only a physical but a mental toll on the internees,” he continued.
Lubomyr Luciuk, author and professor at the Royal Military College of Canada, told The Daily, “There was a pre-existing prejudice against these people in Canadian society that was exacerbated by war-time [panic].”
James Slobodian, chair of the Spirit Lake Center, told The Daily, “The people arrived on the first of January, 1915, in the cold. […] They left on the 28th of January, 1917, also in the winter.” He mentioned that “some were transferred to Kapuskasing, another camp, others were transferred down the Nova Scotia way.”
Canada’s World War I internment operations started in 1914 and ended in 1920, despite the war ending in 1918.
Luhovy wrote that, “Those that were interned felt humiliated, confused, not understanding why they were labelled ‘enemy aliens.’”
“Most of the people who went through the internment operations didn’t speak about it except perhaps in their own families.”
“As for the other Canadians, some were understanding and sympathetic to what the Ukrainians and others had endured, being unjustly interned,” he added. “Others, held an anti-immigrant feeling toward new immigrants arriving in Canada.”
Luciuk commented that “Most of [those who were interned] that I did get the chance to speak to said they preferred not to refer to or remember, most of the people who went through the internment operations didn’t speak about it except perhaps in their own families.”
In 2005, the Canadian government adopted the Internment of Persons of Ukrainian Origin Recognition Act, followed by the Canada First World War Internment Recognition Fund in 2008.
On the relationship between the Ukrainian Canadian community and the rest of Canada today, Luhovy wrote that it was very positive. He noted, however, that “It is important we know all aspects of Canadian history, and try to avoid making similar mistakes in the future.”

Administration pushes back against request for earlier release of course outlines
McGill’s Senate convened for its second meeting of the year on February 17. Senate met to discuss, among other things, a question regarding course outlines and the state of employment equity at McGill.
On Senate’s agenda was an open discussion regarding employment equity at McGill. A working group had previously been created to prepare a report, which was completed in August 2015.
At Senate, the working group sought feedback on three questions: what milestones McGill should set for itself, whether it is time for McGill’s Employment Equity Policy to be reviewed, and what initiatives should be pursued to improve equity outcomes in recruitment and retention.
According to the working group’s report, “While the Employment Equity Policy has been in place for nearly a decade, [McGill’s] tenure track professoriate has not become noticeably more diverse, despite some improvement in women’s representation.”
Since 2008, the proportion of tenure-track professors who are women has increased from 17.3 per cent to 20.5 per cent, corresponding to a net increase of 16 people. At the same time, the total number of employees self-identifying as Aboriginal has actually gone down from 17 to 16.
“I was hoping for a really cross-McGill, cross-faculty, cross-department sort of discussion. […] I didn’t really see that happen.”
One senator asked if the reason why the numbers haven’t been increasing may be that people from the designated groups were not applying for positions, saying “that could be a major impact in our ability to diversify.”
In response to this question, Science Senator Marina Smailes said, “I think that it would be potentially something of a target to also include recruitment processes, if we are actually going out and specifically targeting people in order to have those relevant number of applicants.”
In an interview with The Daily, Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP University Affairs Chloe Rourke said, “There is certainly a misconception that there aren’t qualified candidates, particularly of colour, but also in general from those designated groups. There are qualified candidates from those designated groups. McGill, just for whatever reason, isn’t recruiting them or hiring them.”
Also speaking to The Daily, Arts Senator Alex Kpeglo-Hennessy said, “I was hoping for a really cross-McGill, cross-faculty, cross-department sort of discussion. […] I didn’t really see that happen.”
“For the most part I would really say that the administration, it seems to be moving in a very positive direction very quickly. But, at the same time, there is a lot of silent resistance from professors and departments. It was really disappointing to not hear from deans or professors as often. […] It was very much all students and the [Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures and Equity)] talking,” Kpeglo-Hennessy continued.
Kpeglo-Hennessy and Arts Senator Erin Sobat submitted a question regarding course outlines, which was answered by Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens.
The question asked whether “methods of course evaluations could be added to course descriptions,” and whether “the University would be willing to ask for tentative course outlines that include basic information such as a breakdown of assignments.”
The preambulatory clauses to the question noted that “the Charter of Student Rights only requires that course outlines be made available to students within the first week of classes in each respective term,” and “the McGill eCalendar contains no information on methods of evaluation within classes.” Further, “MyCourses opens access to course materials on the first day of classes, and only to those registered or on the waitlist of a class.”
“If we are able to pick and choose our semesters to understand the course loads that we’re putting ourselves into, students will be able to prevent some of the stress and inability to complete work that comes in the middle of the semester.”
In his written response, Dyens said, “Asking for definite course syllabi nine to twelve months in advance of the start of the course would not allow most professors to include the most up-to-date research in their courses,” and would also prevent professors from incorporating student feedback from the previous semester into a revised syllabus.
“There may be so many things changing in the course outline, the added value to the students would be much less than the detriment,” Dyens said.
Faculty of Education Senator Alenoush Saroyan added, “As a professor, I don’t think assessments should drive learning. Learning should be for the sake of learning. You also don’t want professors recycling outlines that are ten years old. Syllabi should be refreshed every year – I need to think about who my students are, and I can’t do that nine months in advance.”
In an interview with The Daily, Kpeglo-Hennessy said, “At the moment, students are forced to pick their courses largely based on the name of the course and a two -sentence description. That’s really not sufficient when you’re planning a degree.”
To Kpeglo-Hennessy, this is also a matter of increasing accessibility to courses. “At the end of the day, if we are able to pick and choose our semesters to understand the course loads that we’re putting ourselves into, students will be able to prevent some of the stress and inability to complete work that comes in the middle of the semester,” he explained.

Black history education extends beyond one month, says association president 
This year, the Montreal Black History Month Round Table chose to nominate the Jamaica Association of Montreal as a laureate, one of the 12 associations to receive the honour this year.
The association was founded in November 1962, three months after Jamaica gained its independence. According to its website, the association aims at “the social, political, economic, educational and cultural integration of the Jamaican Community and by extension the Black Community within Montreal, and the Province of Quebec.”
In an interview with The Daily, Michael Smith, president of the association, said that he hopes to encourage people “to be proud to be Jamaican; not to hide [their] heritage.”
The association celebrates contributions of the Jamaican community to Montreal and plans social events. It also offers community support programs.
“For any young mother, it’s challenging. I noticed there have been issues with the parents. Some of them have problems when their young daughters are pregnant.”
The Au Futur program for young mothers is one of these programs. Speaking to The Daily, Susan Hamilton, coordinator of the Au Futur program, cited racism, difficulty in finding jobs, and living in a French-speaking province while not speaking French as some of the most common challenges faced by Jamaicans in Montreal. According to Hamilton, young mothers face further challenges, one of which is isolation.
“Well, for any young mother, it’s challenging. I noticed there have been issues with the parents. Some of them have problems when their young daughters are pregnant. Some are disowned, kicked out of the home. [This] makes it very difficult for the young mother who then becomes somewhat isolated and may end up in even more difficult situations, you know, without family support,” Hamilton said.
The Au Futur program aims to address some of these problems by helping young mothers find jobs or return to school, as well as by offering various activities such as group cooking classes, which teach practical skills in a social setting, and gatherings like reading circles.
Speaking to the importance of Black History Month, Smith said, “The history books need to be rewritten a little bit more truthfully. […] The way Canadian history books will present it, you’d think there was only slavery in the U.S.. […] There needs to be a greater acknowledgement of the Black community or African community through history.”
McGill Law student Brittany Williams also spoke to The Daily about Black History Month as well as about her experiences as a half-Jamaican, half-Trinidadian student at McGill.
Williams told The Daily in an interview that Black History Month is a source of inspiration and pride for her because she learns about new Black role models every year.
“I remember in elementary school and high school seeing those people, and not even the Martin Luther Kings and the Rosa Parkses, but hearing about people here, in the same context as you, who were doing amazing things. If they can do that, so can I,” Williams said.
“I remember in elementary school and high school seeing those people, and not even the Martin Luther Kings and the Rosa Parkses, but hearing about people here, in the same context as you, who were doing amazing things. If they can do that, so can I.”
Smith warned that learning about Black history, however, should not be restricted to a single month. During Black History Month, Smith said, “The focus is really on slavery, but there’s so much more to it than that, and you can’t address it all [in a single month].”
Williams added that Black History Month can be “a great time to start conversations.” While the conversations might be difficult or uncomfortable, Williams maintains that they are always worthwhile.
Speaking to her own experience at McGill, Williams said, “Sometimes [there are] ignorant people, sometimes naive people. I’ve never met anyone outright racist in school, but [it’s] just constantly having to teach people, or help people unlearn.”
Williams noted that intentionally acknowledging privilege can help. “I don’t know if a lot of my classmates who aren’t minorities consider the kind of work minorities have to do to be in a classroom that wasn’t really built for them. […] I’m oftentimes uncomfortable in class because of something someone says or what we’re learning, and I don’t think that’s a reality for everyone.”
Williams gives McGill students this advice to avoid making racialized students uncomfortable: “Recognize the way that you think and how you grew up and how that might shape the way you interact with people” and “be open to difficult conversations.”

McGill maintains investigations should stay confidential
In the fall of 2015, Sean Cory, president of the Association of McGill University Research Employees (AMURE), used McGill’s Policy on Safe Disclosure (“whistleblowing policy”) to bring allegations of improper behaviour against a McGill professor.
According to the administration’s response, there was no evidence of wrongdoing.
In February 2015, students working for the professor in question had begun approaching AMURE with various complaints. The most serious of these concerned hidden cameras allegedly installed in labs under the professor’s management, and allegedly connected to a password-protected digital video recorder (DVR) which could be accessed remotely.
Signage was in place informing the public that the labs in question were under surveillance. But in an email he sent to a departmental administrator in February 2015, Cory said, “While there is indeed a sign, a reasonable person would conclude that they are not being remotely monitored and not being viewed in areas not under overt surveillance.”
In response to his email, however, the administrator wrote “anyone seeing that sign would conclude that they could be observed, whether by conspicuous or hidden cameras.”
Cory filed several access to information requests (ATIs) and received access to certain documents.
“Anyone seeing that sign would conclude that they could be observed, whether by conspicuous or hidden cameras.”
“There was a lot of stuff there, and it was enough that I thought McGill should look into it,” explained Cory.
He began by filing an official grievance report with the department, but this was denied on the grounds that the cameras had been installed for “ethically approved behavioural research purposes.”
But when he filed an ATI asking for the relevant ethics approval forms, Cory said no such documentation was produced.
“Either [the surveillance] was for valid research purposes – well, show me some of that – or it was not, and it was potentially used to monitor students,” said Cory.
Met with the dismissal of his official complaint, Cory decided to report his concerns using McGill’s whistleblowing policy. He filed a report in September 2015 that detailed the various complaints described above, attaching evidence to support some of his allegations.
When asked to comment on the matter, in an email to The Daily, Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures & Equity) Angela Campbell questioned AMURE’s decision not to pursue the official complaint, and “advance [the] case to arbitration if [AMURE] does indeed have the evidence of improper activity which it claims.”
Two months after filing the report, Cory was informed that the University had investigated the matter thoroughly, and that a report of their findings had been filed with Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) Christopher Manfredi. No further information was provided, however, and Cory only found out about the outcome of the investigation – that his allegations had been deemed unfounded – from a Montreal Gazette article about the case, which he had brought to the newspaper’s attention.
“They said they did an investigation, but if you don’t even talk to anybody, […] really, how much effort did they put into it?”
“They didn’t say if I was right, they didn’t say if I was wrong,” he said.
“They never asked me a single question. […] They didn’t interview me, they didn’t ask if I had any proof. They said they did an investigation, but if you don’t even talk to anybody, […] really, how much effort did they put into it?”
The Daily contacted the University to ask why no details of the investigation or ethics approval documentation for the cameras had been released, and to inquire about the possible ramifications of such a lack of transparency.
Campbell replied that she was “not in a position to discuss the specifics of any case,” but that “investigations under [McGill’s Policy on Safe Disclosure] are strictly confidential, with a view to protecting the parties involved (crucially, whistleblowers). Investigations carried out under this Policy follow the letter of the Policy’s terms, and are conducted in a rigorous and impartial manner.”
The professor involved did not reply to a request for comment from The Daily.

Dumpster diving workshop introduces students to anti-capitalism and environmentalism
From February 15 to 19 Concordia held its Anti-Consumerism Week, an event series aimed at “consuming less, […] questioning the economic systems failing us, and inspiring our community to adopt a more self-sufficient lifestyle,” according to the event’s Facebook page.
Events included do-it-yourself (DIY) workshops to teach participants to make everything from kombucha to personal hygiene products, a clothing swap, and a farmer’s market. The dumpster diving workshop attracted hundreds of interested participants to its Facebook page.
The workshop, hosted by the Concordia Food Coalition, sought to teach participants how to dumpster dive safely and ethically, and also offered an excursion to Jean-Talon market where participants could try their hand at finding free food.
Jamie Klinger, Montreal community activist and veteran dumpster diver, told The Daily that he has seen a growing number of students dumpster diving in recent years. “That, I think, is more than just not being able to afford to buy food, but also that the culture of dumpster diving has become larger and more accepted,” Klinger said.
For many students on a budget, dumpster diving makes practical sense. “It could potentially be a really good way to feed myself and save money as a student,” said Melody Kwong, a U2 Environment student who attended the workshop.
“The element of mystery is something that really appeals to me – it’s exciting to not know 100 per cent what you’re going to get,” said Aidan Gilchrist-Blackwood, another workshop attendee and U2 Political Science and History student.
“I wait for the day that dumpster diving is no longer even a possibility because we all have the food that we need and we’re not over-producing.”
Asked whether employees at grocery stores and restaurants felt kindly toward dumpster divers, Klinger said, “You just have to be human with them – it’s really not more than that.”
“Tell them that you’re hungry, and that you’re going to feed a lot of people, and most of them are going to want to help you,” Klinger emphasized. “It might be the upper management that’s going to be reticent if it’s a large corporation, but if we’re talking about a small, local fruit store that’s tossing out some old fruit, they don’t care. There’s not more value to them in throwing it in the trash than giving it to you.”
Dumpster diving not only allows students to save money, but also has deep ideological roots in anti-consumerism and environmentalism. Kwong explained that it was only after seeing the magnitude of food waste up close that she developed an interest in reclaiming some of it.
“I’ve worked three restaurant jobs, and in the restaurant industry you really see food waste at a huge scale. […] I’ve seen so much perfectly good food just go directly into the garbage,” said Kwong.
For Gilchrist-Blackwood, who is also an executive of McGill’s Plate Club, which lends reusable dishware to students to reduce the use of paper and plastic, dumpster diving is both an environmental and an anti-capitalist action.
“An important part of environmentalism is the question of why so much is needlessly produced, and then not used, and why we feel like we have to buy so many things, essentially. There is a direct carbon footprint attached to each and every one of our purchases,” Gilchrist-Blackwood noted.
Klinger described his transition from dumpster diving out of necessity to dumpster diving as part of an ideological framework. “[We] needed food on the table, we went, we got it, we put it on the table. As I did it over a longer period of time, I started to see what we were doing in a larger scale of things,” he explained.
“It’s important to recognize that my ability to be excited about dumpster diving for the first time is at least partly contingent on me having the privilege to pay for food when I need it.”
“We would take more than we needed so we could offer it out to more people so that we would build more of a community of people who would come and eat with us – [so] that we would have a greater number that would be spending less into the capitalist marketplace. […] It became a post-capitalist action.”
Gilchrist-Blackwood warned against forgetting that dumpster diving started as, and remains, a fundamentally practical act for most people.
“I think it’s important to recognize that my ability to be excited about dumpster diving for the first time is at least partly contingent on me having the privilege to pay for food when I need it,” he noted. “Dumpster diving for some folks is a necessity, and I think part of anti-consumerism should also necessarily […] involve recognizing that anti-consumerism isn’t a voluntary choice for everyone.”
“I wait for the day that dumpster diving is no longer even a possibility because we all have the food that we need and we’re not over-producing. That’s going to be a glorious day,” said Klinger.
