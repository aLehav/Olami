EUS reacts to Divest McGill campaign 
The Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) council passed a motion “supporting the social, environmentally responsible, and ethical development of the Canadian Oil Sands, with a continued focus on engineering innovation to improve extractive technologies,” during their meeting on Wednesday.
The motion, signed by five Mining Engineering Co-op students, was moved partly in reaction to another motion passed at SSMU Council on January 24, committing SSMU to lobby the University to divest its holdings in companies connected to fossil fuel production.
The passing of the SSMU motion was “yet another example of how out-of-touch the SSMU is with constituents, including those of the Faculty of Engineering,” the motion read.
The motion also called for the EUS representatives to SSMU, Anna Cybulsky and Farzan Subhani, to work alongside SSMU’s political campaigns coordinator – Christopher Bangs, a spokesperson of Divest McGill, a group that is calling on the university to divest its holdings from companies involved in fossil fuels extraction – to “compel him to reach out to all engineering students to solicit their input and opinions.”
Discussion of the motion followed a presentation given by Bangs, who explained to EUS the impetus for the creation of Divest McGill, and fielded questions from councillors about what divestment would mean, both for the University and engineering students.
“No one has any desire to hurt employment opportunities for engineers,” Bangs told Council. “It’s not the tar sands or nothing, it’s not ‘if we don’t invest in the tar sands, where are the jobs,’ instead, we need a responsible transition from the tar sands to more responsible forms of energy,” he said.
Many councillors expressed concern about the effects that divestment would have on their constituents. Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering Student Society President Dirk Dubois asked Bangs whether Divest McGill was also asking McGill to move away from research in fossil fuels.
“We have no control over, and no desire to hurt anyone’s research opportunities. This is solely focusing on the endowment fund, maybe the pension fund, it is not focused on research,” Bangs replied.
The motion noted that at least 26 of the 60 Mining Engineering Co-op students had been “provided invaluable co-op experience” at tar sands mining companies. Jonathan Aubertin, Co-op Mining Engineering Undergraduate Society president, who has worked in the tar sands in the past, and one of the motion’s signatories, brought a jar full of oil-covered sand to the meeting.
One councillor wanted to add a clause to the motion stating that EUS explicitly would not support Divest McGill’s campaign. However, this motion was voted down by a majority. Dubois also petitioned for the motion to be tabled until next week so councillors would be able to solicit their constituents. This was, he felt, an “inflammatory motion,” with the potential to “piss off a lot of people.”
Councillors were concerned that were they not to pass the motion, they would be “burning bridges,” since the motion passed by SSMU would show McGill engineering students in a poor light in the eyes of many energy companies. Were McGill to divest from these companies, the worry was that they would no longer want to provide research funds to McGill.
“I’d like Council to know that if McGill divests from oil sands companies, no oil sands company would come here for research or for any kind of grants. I don’t see why a company would come here if you take that explicit position that you are not supporting their industry at all,” Subhani told Council.
While the motion passed – meaning that EUS would not be supporting Divest McGill, but would instead be actively supporting the continued extraction of oil from the tar sands – Bangs was still relatively pleased with the outcome.
“The people who voted tonight, feel in some ways like they want to see fossil fuel production done in a more ethical way, which is certainly something we are in favour of,” Bangs told The Daily.
Other items on the agenda included policy changes to Blues Pub, McGill Engineering Competition policies, and a budget review.

ASSÉ mobilizes its members against the summit
The Art History and Communication Studies Graduate Students Association (AHCS GSA) voted at their General Assembly this Tuesday to join the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante’s (ASSÉ) 70,000 members.
The AHCS GSA, which represents 86 graduate students, will be the first student association at McGill to affiliate themselves with ASSÉ, the most progressive of the three major provincial student federations.
All graduate students and post-doctoral fellows at McGill are affiliated with the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) through the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS). The AHCS GSA, whose parent student association is PGSS, will also keep their previous affiliation with FEUQ.
“FEUQ is really good at lobbying, but ASSÉ is much better at educating and mobilizing its members,” said PGSS Communications Studies Councillor Gretchen King, who brought the affiliation motion to the GA.
ASSÉ has threatened to boycott the upcoming summit on higher education, where their main proposal – free education – has effectively been taken off the table. It has also planned a demonstration for the last day of the summit in downtown Montreal, and encouraged its members to vote on a one- or two-day strike during the summit.
As of February 10, ASSÉ reported that five student associations, representing a total of 10,000 students, had already voted for a one-day strike during the summit, which will be held on February 25 and 26.
ASSÉ has warned that its members would again protest and go on strike, should the outcome of the summit be a tuition hike or the indexation of tuition to inflation.
Following suit, the AHCS GSA voted to boycott the summit, and will hold an emergency GA next Tuesday to vote on a two-day strike during the summit in order to “actualize” their boycott, King said during the meeting.
At the upcoming GA, the AHCS GSA will also consider the possibility of an unlimited general strike should the outcome of the summit be either a tuition hike or indexation.
Affiliation to ASSÉ will cost the AHCS GSA $3 per member per year, and the student society will have to make amendments to its constitution to make evident that the GA is its highest governing body, something which King says is “already true in practice.”

Jobs and salaries most likely to be affected
The administration has made it increasingly clear in public presentations – as well as behind closed doors – that jobs and salaries will likely bear the brunt of the provincial government’s budget cuts, though there have been no concrete announcements about where the axe will fall.
In a series of ever-changing directives from the government, the administration received the news last Friday that the University would lose its $32-million conditional grant should it fail to cut at least $9.6 million from its current budget by April.
The government had already told the University that it would be receiving $38 million less in operating grants between this fiscal year and the next, but this latest announcement means the University cannot simply absorb the loss of revenue into its accumulated deficit. Instead, it must show that it has cut spending by the equivalent of 50 per cent of this loss in revenue – roughly $19 million – before April 2014.
The government is waiving certain accounting rules in an attempt to help universities deal with the budget cuts recently imposed, but McGill is emphatic that these measures will not help.
Higher Education Deputy Minister Chrystine Tremblay told university administrators last Friday that universities would now be allowed to shift money from their previously restricted capital budgets to their operating budgets, according to the Journal de Québec.
The reverse has been standard practice across the province – and at McGill – for over a decade. In the 2011-2012 fiscal year alone, universities shifted $275 million from their operating budgets to their capital budgets.
Operating budgets are traditionally earmarked for teaching and day-to-day operations, whereas capital budgets pay for building and infrastructure costs.
VP (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa told The Daily that McGill is not considering shifting money allocated for capital projects back into its operating budget.
“We have so many demands, and such a shortage of capital funds that that really wouldn’t do anything to transfer money. It would just put a deficit on the other side… I don’t think that’s something that’s [suitable] for McGill,” Di Grappa said.
McGill estimated $647 million in urgent maintenance work in its most recent budget.
The province has also temporarily lifted restrictions on conditional grant deficits, and Di Grappa admitted that “there was no question” McGill would in fact  run a deficit this year.
Administration officials told union presidents at a meeting Wednesday morning that “headcount scenarios,” in which staff numbers could be cut, would be released in the upcoming days.
Administrators floated the idea of closing the school, the library, or certain community services such as the dental clinic for a week in a symbolic gesture against the government’s actions, according to people at the meeting who spoke to The Daily.
“There are all kinds of unpleasant scenarios in trying to meet a cut of this size…. Everything has to be on the table, because the University’s long-term survival depends on [it],” Provost Anthony Masi told members of the University community at a Town Hall this Tuesday. “This is unprecedented, it’s an assault on higher education in the province.”
Masi also noted that cuts to Quebec’s three main research councils would hit McGill – a research-intensive university – especially hard. This would remove one possibility for “indirect cost recovery,” since McGill would be unable to obtain additional research grants.
Although Masi did not give his Town Hall presentation “to announce a package of bad measures” he did reiterate several times that 75 per cent of the University’s $590-million operating budget is spent on salaries and benefits.
Masi did not consider in his presentation the list of suggested measures the provincial government had recommended to universities just this Friday, and only made mention of the operating grant.

University budget cuts could affect the fund
As McGill struggles with provincial budget cuts by the Parti Québécois (PQ) government, the future of several programs and departments remains uncertain. Complications in funding are affecting the continuation of programs such as the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF).
The SPF was created in 2009 as a three-year pilot project with the vision of fostering a culture of sustainability at McGill. SPF Administrator Lilith Wyatt told The Daily that the SPF was a unique initiative because of its foundation on collaboration between staff and students.
Half of the SPF’s annual $840,000 budget comes from student member fees of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), and the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS). In the past three years, this money was matched by the administration.
The initial description of the administrative matching was vague, and according to SPF’s website, included: “contributions from internal or external donations; centrally managed capital and operating budgets of the University; and grants from external agencies and non-governmental organizations.”
Wyatt explained that this allows for significant flexibility. In some cases, this administrative matching includes instances where individual departments approach the SPF to help them with funding, developing, and managing specific projects.
“About 16 percent of the administrative matching so far has actually come from departments,” Wyatt said, adding that this by-project basis was part of the original vision of the fund, but was difficult to predict.
Wyatt told The Daily that the SPF has allocated approximately $2.3 million over three years on 94 projects, 90 per cent of which are collaborations between professors and students.
The fund has an impressive track record of success. According to Wyatt, 177 student jobs have been created, three companies have been founded, and around 150 students have been able to get course credits for participating in SPF projects. The most visible projects include McGill Feeding McGill, Campus Crops, Edible Campus, and the Aboriginal Sustainability Project.
Despite this legacy, the cuts the University now faces make it difficult to ascertain how, and if, the SPF will survive when its three years of funding run out in the fall of 2013. Due to the long timeline of many of the projects, there is an almost one-year lag between the allocation of the funds to projects and their use.
The senior administration at McGill and the SPF are in talks to try to find specific alternative solutions to a funding crisis forcing cuts across the board. Wyatt was very positive about the possibility of alternative sources of funding, and clarified that “it’s not as though all of that money needs to be found and put into a pot.”
“It’s just a matter of trying to find, more specifically, where [the money] can come from. The cuts are so profound at this time that every unit is going to feel it, and every priority is going to feel it,” Wyatt said.
SSMU President Josh Redel was also cautiously optimistic about the fund’s renewal. “It looks like we have potential solutions, but it’s just the uncertainty of what next year will look like,” Redel told The Daily.
For reasons of confidentiality, Redel was unable to elaborate on what these potential solutions could be. At present, Redel said, SSMU is working along with the SPF and with McGill’s administration to “[make] sure the fund reflects current financial reality.”
Last week, SSMU’s Legislative Council delayed a motion to approve a question concerning the renewal of the fund’s student support. Redel explained that this delay was due to the wording of the motion, which assumed administrative matching. “The fund wouldn’t be true to its original form if it doesn’t have the match. It’s not that it would disappear, but we might have to look at how it’s composed, who’s able to apply for it, what kind of projects it undertakes, if it isn’t a parity fund.”
Both Wyatt and Redel stated that they would prefer not to proceed with the question until commitment had been secured from the administration.
This kind of financial uncertainty is not unique to the SPF as student groups, programs, and the university administration are scrambling for solutions to cuts Wyatt called “catastrophic.”
“Everything’s kind of just all over the place,” Redel said. “The financial situation is changing day to day, especially over the past two weeks…Everyone is kind of bogged down.”

Council supports Industrial Relations Program, more funding for classroom renovations
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) said on Wednesday that it would lobby for change in the advanced standing credits structure, support the existence of the Industrial Relations program, and ask McGill for more funding for classrooms.
Monday’s Winter General Assembly (GA) was unable to meet the required quorum of 150 members, and thus all motions discussed were non-binding. Motions were subsequently considered for final approval at Council Wednesday night.
Advanced Standing Credit Reform Campaign
One of the motions passed mandates AUS to lobby the Faculty of Arts to allow students to “enter the University as U0 students, with the option of being able to use advanced standing credits to avoid prerequisites.”
Currently, students who complete Advanced Placement (AP) exams, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, or A-Levels receive university credit for their secondary school work. Those who attain 24 or more credits enter the University as U1 students, and are expected to finish their program in three years.
“AUS is taking a stance on an important academic issue; this doesn’t hurt anyone, it just allows added flexibility for students… this is something that the administration is aware of. If they realize that students support it, this could be a big step moving forward,” said VP Internal Justin Fletcher, who moved the motion.
When asked about advanced credits at AUS Council, Provost Anthony Masi said that the administration was “trying to find new ways of addressing ” the issue.
Healthy Teaching and Learning Spaces
AUS was also mandated to support the Faculty of Arts in its efforts to secure more funding from the University to improve the quality of classrooms and buildings. The motion regarding Healthy Teaching and Learning Spaces, which passed at Council, is specifically aimed at room 101 of 3475 Peel.
“Over the last two years we’ve got an application for room 101 on Peel 3475, which falls under the Department of English.  Last year, the committee approved $15,000 in funding for the room; this year, they are applying again for $17,000,”  said Saad Qazi, AUS VP Finance, referring to Faculty of Arts requests made to the Arts Undergraduate Improvement Fund (AUIF) to fund renovations.
The application for the $17,000 was denied, however, on the grounds that the University – and not students – should fund these renovations.
The motion was amended at the GA to ask that the Faculty of Arts make a list of rooms that fail to meet health code requirements publicly available.
Support for the Industrial Relations Program
Another motion asked AUS to assist the McGill Industrial Relations Association (MIRA) in its campaign to support the continued existence of the Faculty Program in Industrial Relations.
The motion suggests that the University is “currently reviewing the Industrial Relations program as part of its regular process of program review, with the possibility of retirement of the program.”
“Right now there are few Arts professors with research interests in Industrial Relations and the program needs funding from the Faculty of Arts,” said Fletcher.
According to AUS VP Academic Tom Zheng, however, Faculty of Arts Dean Manfredi mentioned that the program would not be cancelled next year, but that it would enter a “transitional period.”
MIRA Representative Rebecca Tacoma noted that the Industrial Relations student association has not been informed of any official decisions not to cancel the program.
Fletcher told Council that it was “important to still demonstrate support for this program.”
The motion passed unanimously.
Reform to the VP Finance Position
Qazi and AUS President Devon LaBuik  moved a motion that seeks to reform the VP Finance position by giving AUS Council the power to determine whether or not candidates are eligible for the position.
“When you come into the VP Finance position, it requires a lot more specific skills than going into some other VP positions,” LaBuik told The Daily. “And considering that almost all the other positions rely on the VP Finance to get the money to them, I think we need to make sure that the VP Finance is reliable.”
In an interview with The Daily in September, Qazi said that AUS had significant debt when he took office. This was mainly a result of money being seized by the Quebec government when AUS failed to file taxes several years in a row.
It had also failed to submit audits to the University since 2008 because of a lack of financial reporting from departmental associations within AUS. This prompted the University to withhold student fees from the association.
The motion was tabled.
However, Qazi specified that his intent was to gauge the overall response of the GA.  He is planning on improving the motion with the addition of a list of qualifications and the planning of a training program.

David Milgaard describes justice system’s lack of protection for innocents
Canada’s justice system has long been failing those wrongfully convicted, according to David Milgaard and Peter Edwards at a conference hosted by Innocence McGill on Tuesday.
Imprisoned for 23 years on false charges of rape and murder and exonerated by DNA evidence in 1997, Milgaard described his ordeal and spoke on the pressing need for justice reform in Canada.
Describing Milgaard’s case, Edwards, a longtime journalist specializing in organized crime and justice issues, noted the unusual nature of Milgaard’s exoneration in an oft-inefficient and corrupt criminal justice system.
“As great and inspiring as David’s story is, it’s not a triumph of the system. It’s a triumph despite the system,” he said. “We can’t pretend that the system did anything right in this case whatsoever.”
“The Canadian Justice department is failing, and it is failing miserably,” Milgaard said.
Drawing from his own experience, he described systemic bias against those who maintain their innocence, and who are often denied parole for refusing to admit guilt.
He spoke on the need for an independent review board to investigate potential miscarriages of justice in Canada and to help protect and exonerate the wrongfully convicted.
He also suggested that the Canadian government implement other, non-punitive justice models, like restorative justice.
Restorative justice emphasizes active dialogue between victims and offenders and encourages offenders to take responsibility for their actions.
Julia O’Byrne, of Innocence McGill – an organization dedicated to investigating wrongful conviction claims in Quebec – pointed out systemic problems like prosecutorial power and the widespread use of plea bargains, which can incentivize false confessions from innocent people afraid of harsher sentences imposed by a jury.
“Nobody can ever see what kind of negotiations the Crown is offering, what the plea negotiations are like, yet they wield so much power…. They’re not held accountable,” she told The Daily.
Edwards also spoke about the plight of First Nations peoples within the criminal justice system, who often give false confessions, believing the system will work against them.
Rilla Banks, also of Innocence McGill, noted a disparity between statist understandings of justice and those of First Nations peoples.
“Within Aboriginal communities, many of them have different modes of dealing with people that commit crimes in their community. It’s much less adversarial than the [federal] system,” she told The Daily. “I think that if you’re not informed about the system, and you don’t feel that you’re part of it, you wouldn’t want to cooperate with it.”

Motion alleged to be “administration-sponsored”
Correction appended February 15, 2013.
In a tense council meeting on Wednesday night, McGill’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), a member of the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), voted to adopt a motion saying that there is evidence of massive underfunding in Quebec universities.
Their stance is in line with the argument put forth by the Conférence des Recteurs et des Principaux des Universités du Québec (CREPUQ) – the association representing university administrations across the province – who have long argued that universities in Quebec are underfunded, and who will lobby for increased funding from the Parti Québécois (PQ) government.
On the other hand, FEUQ, one of the province’s biggest student federations, believes that the greater problem is that university administrations are mismanaging the money they already receive. FEUQ argues that this money amounts to an unregulated blank cheque for administrators.
The motion comes at a crucial time, as the PQ-sponsored summit on higher education is less than two weeks away.
The motion to adopt the policy position of underfunding was put forward by the PGSS executive committee after a vote of four to one. PGSS External Affairs Officer Errol Salamon was the lone dissenting voice among the executive, and spoke alongside FEUQ leadership present at Council to oppose the motion.
The motion’s supporters argued that while CREPUQ is one of the strongest proponents of tuition hikes – against the demands of students who were on strike last spring – it would be self-defeating for PGSS not to lobby for greater university funding.
Salamon argued that the motion essentially represented a deal cut with the administration, and claimed that university administrations across the province have been lobbying student associations to adopt their position.
Jonathan Mooney, Secretary-General of PGSS, objected to the characterization of the motion as being sponsored by the administration.
Salamon’s allegations stem from a meeting between Mooney and Olivier Marcil, McGill VP (External Affairs), in September. They discussed the issue of underfunding, at which time Marcil gave Mooney documents and research laying out McGill’s case.
Mooney and Marcil also met at noon on the day of the council meeting, though Mooney said they did not talk about the upcoming motion.
The motion, Mooney said, was the logical outcome of a report prepared by PGSS staff researcher Conor Farrell, and therefore had nothing to do with the administration. During a heated period of debate, Mooney told councillors that opposition to the motion was “absurd.”
Mooney said that Marcil had not asked him to create any specific policies during their meeting in September. However, following the meeting, Farrell undertook what Mooney described as a study of all the existing research on Quebec university funding, from across the political and ideological spectrum. Farrell’s report concluded that there was indeed evidence of underfunding in Quebec universities.
This assertion differed markedly with the argument offered by Justin Marleau, Vice-President of AGSEM-McGill’s Teaching Union. According to Marleau’s analysis of McGill budgets for a period of five years between 2007 and 2012, McGill’s overall operational revenues have increased 30 per cent since 2007, and 43 per cent of the increase has gone into administrative and non-salary expenses.
Leah Freeman, a McGill Social Work graduate student who is also FEUQ’s vice president of graduate student affairs, spoke against the motion, referencing a recent report from a Quebec professors’ federation saying that Quebec’s universities are funnelling money into construction projects that the government intends to be used for teaching.
“The reality is that no needs analysis has been done for Quebec universities. There has been no analysis of how many teachers we’re missing,” said Cameron Monagle, FEUQ’s coordinator of internal affairs.
In a previous version of this article, The Daily incorrectly referred to Justin Marleau as a researcher from AGSEM-McGill’s Teaching Union. In fact, he is their Vice-President. The Daily regrets the error.
