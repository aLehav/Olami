Black History Month at McGill Opening Ceremony
Shanice Yarde, Equity Education Advisor, and Janelle Kasperski, Indigenous Education Advisor, organized the opening of Black History Month at McGill on Monday, February 3, partnering with the Faculty of Law. Yarde, as Master of Ceremony, denoted the three words, that, as a Black woman in Tiohtià:ke motivate her work: “Indigenizing, decolonization, and reparation.”
Kasperski then spoke, reminding us of the importance of the solidarity between Black and Indigenous peoples and the work that still needs to be done.
Jennifer Maccarone, a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec of Westmount–Saint-Louis who is herself white, also made an appearance. “I see you and I hear you,” she claimed. Her repeating “I think of you as my roots” made the audience all glance at each other, simply asking why she would think such a thing.
“You all [the Black people? The Black people in the room? The two women of colour who had just spoken?] make me stronger” she affirmed.
Dean Robert Leckey emphasized the importance of remembering the past and working for a “more just future,” and introduced Dr. Adelle Blackett, a Professor of Law who herself introduced Dr. Wendy Greene, stressing the fact that “part of Black History Month is to value each other and our accomplishments.” It was indeed a heart-warming moment of Black excellence – Black McGill students on the benches, Black professors, Black tenured professors, Black women who are tenured professors, Black activists: an impressive crowd of Black success.
Keynote speaker Dr. Greene’s work revolves around the intersection of hair and civil and human rights advocacy. Not only does she fight for her people in legislature, through the CROWN Act against racial discrimination through hair – but she does so by creating a net accessible to her community. She is the originator of the viral #FREETHEHAIR hashtag that every year brings the Black community together to denounce injustices of hair discrimination, such as the recent cases of Deandre Arnold or Andrew Johnson.
Dr. Wendy Greene evoked her South Carolina childhood as shaping the activist she is today. She reflected on the continuance of the Black struggle through the history of both her parents’ activism and her own.
“The personal can be professional; it can be political,” she said.
Hair discrimination happens in the workplace and in public environments and the law does not truly protect Black people from racial discrimination. Title VII of the US Civil Rights Act, the federal anti-discrimination law protects “hair texture” that is considered to be the afro, but not hair styles that include braids, twists, locks etc. This is because, apparently the constitution only acknowledges immutable characteristics as racial; in Dr. Greene’s own words, a “legal fiction.”
She also denounced the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as unhelpful, since there is no law that recognizes race as a cultural feature, only as a bodily matter, hence the unfortunate nature of race as social construct.
Dr. Greene has been defending a few of the countless victims of racialized and gender-based hair discrimination. Her work encompasses people who were ordered to “fix” their natural hair with chemical relaxers, or to wear wigs as conditions of employment, graduation, promotion, and schooling; people who hear negative comments and bear humiliation daily, along with threats of discipline or even arrest when protesting, whether it is in the States, Canada, Australia, South Africa or elsewhere.
She also deplored the fact that this everlasting stigmatization is internalized by the Black community – how many times have we heard of bad versus good hair. The lingo used by the Black community to define the black body and hair shows this internalized hate of its roots. It reveals a hierarchy that was created in terms of who would have the most potential to have the straightest hair, the fairest skin.
“Before you’re even out of the womb, someone is already thinking about the texture of your hair and the opportunities that go with it.”
Dr. Greene managed to unite the audience in sadly amusing relatable situations such as hair deserts. She ended her speech on the note of health, mentioning the scalp and hair damages (burns, alopecia, increased risks of cancer) that the use of chemical relaxers brings. “Are we losing our livelihood or our lives?” she asked.
Singers Fredericka Petit-Homme, Myrtle Thomas, and Ruben Shaym Brutus, and steel pannist Mr. Pöng blessed the audience’s ears at the end of the ceremony, reminding everyone that Blackness is a constant struggle that is uniting, but is also a diverse and beautiful musical culture.

Seven Constituents Attend Consultative Forum
On February 5, the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) attempted to hold a General Assembly (GA). Given that only seven constituents were present, the GA was not held, as SUS requires a minimum of 100 students present for a meeting to be considered a GA, and the meeting became a consultative forum instead.
One student in the Faculty of Science, Asa Kohn, alleges that the executives did not properly advertise the event to the student body beforehand. The GA was mentioned in a Facebook statement on January 16 regarding Law 21, a controversial provincial law which prohibits public employees from wearing religious symbols and disproportionately impacts marginalized religious groups such as Muslim, Jewish, and Sikh people. However, the location was not included in the Facebook post. The GA was then announced at the General Council (GC) meeting on January 22 at 7 p.m. This gave students less than 24 hours to submit motions, as the deadline was 11:59 p.m. on January 22.
The council had previously published the GA event to Facebook on Monday, January 20, leaving two days for students to collect the requisite 100 signatures for a motion to be submitted to the GC. Per minutes from the GC on January 22, when Kohn objected to this lack of adequate notice during the meeting, SUS VP Finance told him that the council assumed two days was sufficient time to collect signatures, as most science classes have over 100 people.
During the February 5 consultative forum, Kohn continued to express frustration with the council’s lack of communication. Council members cited difficulties in booking a room large enough for a general assembly, as well as mistakes made by the VP Communications (who was not present at the meeting) as reasons for their communicative shortcomings. When Kohn pressed them to hold another GA so students could have a chance to participate in student governance, council members maintained that there would be no interest among the student body for such an event, referencing last year’s similarly low turnout. However, Kohn claims that he spoke with many students who “felt strongly about Bill 21” while collecting signatures to organize a GA, and says he does not believe all science students are uninterested in student governance.
However, the council’s reluctance to hold a GA may not be wholly due to concerns about apathy among the student body, as the SUS executives state. During the January 7 Executive Meeting, the council discussed the possibility of hosting a GA in order to organize a strike against Law 21.
According to the meeting minutes from January 7, SUS executives were concerned that this strike, which would involve blocking access to classrooms, would be a “very direct” approach to expressing opposition to Law 21. Furthermore, a number of executives seemed to believe that science students would not be impacted by the bill, asking what “the real reason [they] would be going on strike” was and stating that, “as a group, we do not [seem to be] in support of the soft picket.”
In addition to Kohn’s concerns about the council’s lack of effort in informing the student body of the GA, Kohn has previously expressed worry over undemocratic procedures within SUS. From December 3, 2019, until January 22, 2020, SUS had no president, so attempts made by the Faculty of Education to contact the SUS council regarding actions against Law 21 failed, according to the January 7 meeting minutes.
SUS has an unfortunate history of violating their constitution; after the resignation of SSMU representative Moses Milchberg, the organization failed to hold a by-election to fill his role in accordance with their constitution. This incident, combined with their failure to post GC meeting minutes online within three days of their meetings, has led Kohn to speculate that SUS is undemocratic. However, the organization has not faced any consequences due to their unconstitutional actions, and insisted to Kohn at both the February 5 and January 22 meetings that they were acting in accordance with their bylaws regarding the organizing of a GA.

Unfit to Print Interviews Professor Gregory Mikkelson
On Tuesday, January 28, Maya Ibbitson from Unfit to Print sat down with former professor Gregory Mikkelson to speak about his recent resignation from McGill over the university’s decision not to divest from fossil fuels. Mikkelson was a tenured professor in the School of the Environment and conducts research on the intersections of philosophy, environmental science, and economics. 
Unfit to Print (UP): Your choice to resign has been one that’s garnered both support and criticism. I know that a lot of students involved in climate change groups regard your resignation as a profound loss. What has the overall reaction from the McGill faculty counterparts and students alike been?
Professor Gregory Mikkelson (GM): It’s been overwhelmingly supportive and I very much appreciate that from my colleagues and students. So I would say in terms of responses that have been conveyed to me, it’s been very supportive and I deeply appreciate that.
UP: The McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, recognizes divestment as an ineffective, “symbolic” gesture. In response to your resignation, she reiterated the same phrase, saying that the university is looking at concrete action. Do you agree with this? And why do you think divestment is more concrete and/or important than Fortier says it is in the case of McGill’s investment portfolio?
GM: I think that kind of statement ignores the tremendous power that symbolic action can have. In the case of divestment, research shows that it does have power and that past divestment campaigns have pushed governments to take stronger action against it. For example, apartheid in South Africa, against tobacco companies for the harms that they were causing, and the same is true of the fossil fuel divestment campaign. So it’s basically the same old arguments that are being used despite having been refuted long ago. It’s very disappointing, I guess.
UP: As you mentioned previously, McGill has some what of an anti-democratic government system. Why do you think the university hasn’t regarded the overwhelming mandate of its numerous environmental student groups when making decisions about divestment?
GM: What is it about divestment that has made them so resistant? What’s different either about the university or about fossil fuels that could explain why McGill did take a position of moral leadership when it came to divesting from South Africa several decades ago? We joined other universities that were divesting from tobacco more recently. So, either something has changed at the university that’s made it more resistant to that kind of thing in general, or there’s something special about fossil fuel. I was just walking into the Leacock Building, and I noticed a plaque outside describing major donors that had contributed to the renovation project that’s happening now. One of them was Suncor, which is the top tar sand company. And it’s also McGill’s top fossil fuel investment. We have over seven million dollars invested in Suncor. So, maybe there’s something there.
UP: I feel like a lot of students have been angered by the McGill Board of Governors’ (BoG) decision regarding divestment, because of the actual decision itself, and because they feel like they don’t have a voice in it. How do you think the McGill Senate can communicate and gain a better relationship with students, faculty, and staff?
GM: I mean, the McGill Senate did overwhelmingly support the divestment motion that came to it in September of 2018. So in that sense, the Senate has kind of followed the general thrust of the community. That was a rare event, though, because the Senate is tightly controlled by the central administration. They did try in many ways to suppress the divestment motion. They happened to have failed in that case. But I think probably with regard to most things, they succeed in steering things the way they want. So I guess in terms of making the Senate more responsive to the will of the McGill community, I think the Senate has to be democratized. For example, we need to be electing the person to chair of the Senate meetings, instead of having it automatically be the principal. We need to be electing all the positions within the Senate. So, in order to divest McGill, we have to democratize McGill.
UP: Climate change activists, new senators, and students have been accusing the BoG of greenwashing, which is providing misleading information about environmental sustainability. Do you think this is true or do you think that the BoG truly believes that their plan is the best alternative?
GM: I think what is clear is that the principal’s use of the word divesting in announcing the BoG’s decision misled thousands of people. In order to see exactly how they were misled, you actually have to dig into the footnotes and then the sources of those footnotes to discover the difference between divestment and decarbonization. So in this context, divestment has meant either a university selling off all of its stock in the top 200 fossil fuel companies; or at the very least, some subset of those companies. Now, what the board is calling decarbonization is based on their definition of a company’s carbon footprint, which does not include anything that happens after a product is sold. So what that means is that fossil fuel companies are off the hook for all of the harm done by burning their product – for all the greenhouse gas emissions that are caused. The whole point of the divestment movement is to keep most of that fossil fuel in the ground. What the decarbonization commitment that McGill has made entails is that we’re only going to hold fossil fuel companies responsible for pulling their product out of the ground more efficiently.
UP: Do you think that your move to resign from McGill will enact change at the school or is it more of a personal decision that’s about staying true to your own beliefs?
GM: For me, it was a matter of conscience – of just growing and glaring conflicts between my belief in trying to make serious progress on the environment and also the importance of democratic governance of organizations, including universities. So, [it was] basically the conflict between my commitments to those things based on my teaching and research and the behaviour of the place where I work became unacceptable. That’s why I did it. Now it so happens that the media took an interest in the story. So in that sense, I hope that my resignation has had some value in basically increasing the pressure for McGill and other universities to do the right thing.
UP: Do you think that the benefits of your moral statement outweigh the loss on students who can no longer have you as a professor?
GM: I guess that’s the bet I’m taking. By leaving this place and moving on to something else, I hope I’ll be able to have a positive impact on the world.
UP: Do you have any plans for the future and how else do you think you can provide influence regarding environmental activism outside of a teaching position at McGill?
GM: I have no plans beyond expanding my role as a father and in the household, in the short term. But in the longer term, I would like to continue applying the skills and research, speaking and writing that I’ve developed as a professor, and I certainly will – in whatever capacity – continue to work for positive changes with regard to the environment.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. It was transcribed from Unfit to Print on CKUT 90.3 FM by Amy Lloyd, Radio Editor with The McGill Daily.

Panelists Speak on Fighting Injustice



Content warning: colonial violence
Continue or go back to the main page

On February 4 at McGill University Faculty of Law, a group of law students, curious undergrads and the socially-concerned – as well as a slew of experienced litigators and law professors alike – gathered together to hear a panel discussing one of the biggest class action cases in the history of Canada. The panel was the inaugural event of the Sotos Lectures, a wide range of talks and panels that will hold more events in the future. One of the panelists, David Sterns of Sotos Class Actions, started off by explaining that he chose this particular topic because it illustrates the potential for a legal career directed at social good. Sterns emphasized that there are other options besides, as he put it, “the zombie walk to Bay Street.”
Content warning: colonial violence
Continue or go back to the main page
The case in question is the class action suit against the federal government for wrongful discrimination against Indigenous children between 1991 and 2019. It is specific to what is sometimes referred to as the “millennial scoop;” the policy for Indigenous children was to separate them from their families, while willfully denying them the same medical care and social services that were afforded to the rest of the country. However, the injustice against Indigenous peoples by the Canadian government extends far beyond this case and is a much broader and long-lasting problem, as the panelists acknowledged. This class action case just happens to be one of the most recent examples of people fighting to speak out against institutional colonial violence against Indigenous communities by the government.
The panel was moderated by McGill Professor Daniel Jutras. McGill Social Work Professor Cindy Blackstock also spoke as a panelist alongside Stern. Professor Blackstock, the Executive Director of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, was one of the driving forces behind the case. The event was opened by Sedalia Kawenno:ta’s Fazio, a Kanien’kehá:ka elder. She welcomed the attendees and organizers alike and shared the Ohén:ton Karihwatékwen prayer, which translates to “the words that come before all others.” Before sharing it in Kanien’kehá, Fazio explained the first few lines in English: “The time has come for us to bring our minds together so our minds become one.”
As she finished the prayer, Fazio stated, “The importance of this prayer is if you look around you, at everything in creation, if we lose just one of those elements […] – all we need to do is lose one element, and on Mother Earth or in Sky World, and we as human beings will not survive. But if every single human being disappeared from Mother Earth tomorrow morning, Mother Earth and Sky World would thrive. So that is the importance of giving thanks each and every day.” She then shared a welcome song, as a way of starting the event.
After a brief background on the case by Professor Jutras, the discussion got under way as Professor Blackstock and David Sterns delved into more detail. “[Canada] create[s] this illusion that they are about reconciliation,” Blackstock stated, adding that the government’s actions tell a different story. She spoke to the tendency for Canadians to pretend their government is fair and equitable, while willfully ignoring the atrocities of their own country.
“It just shows how deeply embedded in the department [of Justice]’s DNA [that] this idea of colonialism still remains,” she commented. For instance, Professor Blackstock brought up the way in which people are quick to criticize the Trump administration for separating families at the US-Mexico border. She agreed that these are certainly condemnable actions. “But we’re doing it too and we’ve been doing it longer,” Professor Blackstock stated, in reference to Canada’s long history of separating Indigenous children from their families. However, she expressed hopefulness that these issues are becoming more known to the public, adding that it’s as necessary as ever to hold the government and its policies accountable.
Professor Blackstock then gave a brief introduction as to how she became involved in the case. She described working as a social worker in British Columbia with both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, and being baffled by the stark inequality. “Basic life-saving things [were] denied to these kids,” she explained, describing how one child was allowed medical equipment only every five years. A couple times, the panel brought up Jordan’s Principle, a law that states no child should have to wait for treatment on account of bureaucracy, but Professor Blackstock emphasized that the law is incredibly narrow and doesn’t cover the extent of medical care denied to Indigenous children, from the smaller, everyday rights to access to life-saving equipment.
She stated that the devastation she witnessed working as a social worker, and the blatant willful callousness of the government, inspired her to seek litigation. Professor Blackstock started by bringing the issue before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, explaining that it seemed more accessible to a non-lawyer, like herself at the time.
The case later changed from a tribunal appeal to a class action case, when Sterns read about it in the news, and realized its potential for a class action suit. The following legal battle – which sought compensation for the staggering number of Indigenous children who were denied basic social services, and/or taken from their families for little to no reason – was made even more clouded by the Department of Justice’s tendency to “play unfairly,” as Blackstock stated.
She summed this up by stating that “it’s never been about the truth. It’s never been about the Charter. It’s always been about procedure.” Professor Blackstock described the “gamesmanship” that the government’s lawyers used, dragging out proceedings and withholding important exhibits. She recalled being stunned by the lengths to which the government would go in order to win, as they were “willing to breach the legal law in order to oppose [the claim],” in the instance of the government purposefully withholding 90,000 records.
As Professor Blackstock often reminded the attendees, the case was about atrocities committed against children, and the government’s tactics in light of this were extremely frustrating. “The Department of Justice is not always just,” she stated, concluding that “the whole system operates like a sociopath.” Though Professor Blackstock was understandably frustrated with these attempts at diversion, in the end she and her team were successful in their efforts in 2016, winning the case, as well as $40,000 in compensation for each of the victims they’d been fighting for.
But “$40,000 doesn’t even hit the bucket,” Professor Blackstock explained, suggesting that monetary compensation can be trivializing in the face of the trauma and loss that has resulted from the denial of basic rights for Indigenous children. Throughout the discussion, she often returned to the fact that this case is a small part of a much larger issue of the Canadian government willfully discriminating against Indigenous peoples. She emphasized that the problem has not only been happening for a very long time, but is ongoing, and that it’s important to remember this fact.
The discussion turned to Sterns, on the topic of the legal angle of the class action suit. Sterns was adamant that there are many possibilities for up and coming lawyers to accomplish social good. He spoke on the flexibility and potential of class action suits, and emphasized that they have the ability to bring real change and accountability. Both he and Professor Blackstock agreed that one of the factors that was key in this particular class action case was getting the attention of the media and the public, especially through television. Through these mechanisms, the panelists emphasized, the Canadian government was not just being held accountable by Blackstock, Sterns, and the rest of their team, but by the Canadian public at large.
The panel was a strong reminder of some of the injustices and systemic atrocities that the Canadian government has committed, but emphasized the work that can and should be done. Professor Blackstock, who at the time had no legal background, brought these issues to light, and won $40,000 in compensation for each of the victims. However, she emphasized that systemic discrimination against Indigenous peoples in Canada is not over. As Professor Blackstock stated, “I want to win the war, not just the battle.”
