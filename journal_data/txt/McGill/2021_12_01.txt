Committee shifts from “grassroots” to “top-down” approach
On September 22, the McGill Senate approved a proposal to alter the terms of the Joint Board Senate Committee on Equity (JBSCE). The changes have significantly altered the structure and function of the committee, notably changing its name to the Equity Diversity and Inclusion Committee (EDIC). 
The JBSCE was the university’s highest body – reporting to the Senate and Board of Governors – concerned with promoting equity and advocating on behalf of marginalized students at McGill. In the 2020-2021 academic year, the committee oversaw the first year of the implementation of the Strategic Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Plan and the Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism (AP-ABR). The JBSCE was also composed of several subcommittees – such as the Subcommittee on Racialized and Ethnic Persons and the Subcommittee on Queer People –  chaired by McGill staff members. These subcommittees oversaw specialized initiatives that served the constituents of the subcommittee. 
According to an email statement sent to the Daily from the university’s Media Relations Office, The Working Group to Review the Terms of Reference of the JBSCE was formed and held meetings over the course of last year. The Group found that “the EDI landscape has shifted dramatically since the Committee’s creation in 1994,” and as such, the JBSCE requires a “new name, structure, and composition that will not only permit it to make policy recommendations but also to hold the university administration to its EDI responsibilities and commitments.” 
The changes to the JBSCE’s Terms of Reference drastically alter the committee’s composition. The proposal removes the Office for Students with Disabilities Director, the Coordinator of the First People’s House, the Social Equity and Diversity Education Associate Director, and all but two Subcommittee Chairs; these members are replaced by one Faculty Dean, three Associate or Assistant Deans, and two additional representatives appointed by the Board of Governors. The changes also discard the mandate to represent Administrative and Support Staff, yet up to three seats for alumni have been added. 
Two anonymous McGill employees involved with EDIC subcommittees spoke with the Daily about their concerns regarding these changes. Previously, all Subcommittee chairs sat on the JBSCE. Employee A* explained that the reduction in Subcommittee chair membership is troubling – there are now only two Subcommittee chairs (appointed by the Board and Senate) in the Committee’s composition and consequently both membership and representation of Subcommittee chairs has been reduced. “Each subcommittee goes into depth in discussion or in bringing up issues that directly affect its members,” they explained, “there is no way that two chairs can […] carry all that and have the time and the bandwidth to bring it to the table in the bigger committee or in the central EDIC itself.” 
Employee B* added that the rationale behind the shift towards a more faculty and dean leadership-heavy committee is not inherently problematic: “if you want institutional change, leaders in the institution need to be on board,” they reasoned. Rarely, however, do these administrative leaders belong to the communities that they are meant to represent and advocate for within the EDIC – Employee B asks, “How many Black leaders are at McGill? How many Indigenous heads of department are there at McGill? We know who these leaders are.” This new majority-administration composition also creates new power dynamics between members within the Committee, exacerbated by the “hand-picked” selection process. Employee B explained that the reasoning for the selection process has to do with “who’s administration, who’s faculty, who’s new, who’s not […] the reasoning has nothing to do with voice and inclusion and actually naming and addressing the power dynamics of the [committee].” For example, while student representation remains unchanged under the new terms of reference, Employee B speculated that student representatives may feel more intimidated to introduce and challenge ideas with more high-ranking, high-profile administrators present. 
The new terms of the EDIC, unlike those of the JBSCE, strip the Committee of its power to recommend new policies or practices of its own accord. The EDIC now only has the power to engage strictly with EDI-related plans or issues that have been recommended by the Board, Senate, a Co-Chair, or Associate Provost. Furthermore, the proposed mandate does not include an imperative for the committee to advocate to the Senate and Board of Directors on behalf of marginalized groups. The mandate of the JBSCE was to “promote fair access to academic and employment opportunities, and full participation in the McGill community, for all individuals, particularly for those from social groups that have historically encountered or continue to face systemic barriers.” The proposed Terms of Reference of the EDIC are devoid of such language, merely mandating that it’s a committee of “McGill’s Senate and the Board of Governors, constituted under the authority of, and accountable to, these two governance bodies,” its principal responsibility being “reviewing the University’s progress in relation to [EDI] and advising on measures required to uphold its EDI commitments.” While Subcommittees’ organizational structures and activities were previously “grassroots and community-oriented” (according to The Working Group’s findings), these new responsibilities outlined in the proposed terms of reference adopt a “top-down” approach, according to Employees A and B. 
The proposed terms of reference also grant the EDIC with the power to “establish a new Subcommittee” or, notably,   “determine that Subcommittee status from an existing Subcommittee should be withdrawn.” The terms state that the creation or dissolution of committees will be determined “based on the needs and best interests of the McGill community, as determined by reference to University EDI policies and plans, and in consultation with members of the equity-seeking group represented by the Subcommittee in issue.” Employees A and B expressed concern that this grants the Committee authority to dissolve Subcommittees without actually consulting said Subcommittees. “The last thing they’ll do is they’ll check with us,” said Employee B, “their idea of consultation is not our idea of inclusion, and that is problematic.”
Those involved with the JBSCE have been concerned with these changes since the beginning of the process. Employee A insinuated that The Working Group, responsible for rewriting the Terms of Reference, excluded the grassroots parties involved with the JBSCE, particularly in the consultation process. “There might have been superficial consultations with the general community that were not widely announced,” they said, “But there was no voice at the table, and this is a major concern.” 
The Working Group held two consultations, on May 3 and May 15 respectively, open to all members of the McGill community. These consultations were advertised by the what’snew@mcgill newsletter, targeted email invitations to current and past JBSCE members, and associations across campus that represent groups facing barriers to equity and inclusion. Brooklyn Frizzle, Administrative Coordinator of Queer McGill and former VP University Affairs, told the Daily that the timing was extremely inconvenient; students were on summer break and student groups were in the process of transitioning leadership. The sessions consequently had low turn out – according to the Working Group report, only 26 members of the McGill community participated in the two consultation sessions. After the consultation sessions, the amendments were written over the summer, and, according to Frizzle, were only shared with a handful of Subcommittee heads. “That, in my mind, reduces a lot of the accountability and the oversight that you should have for such an important process,” they commented, “It’s all kind of done behind closed doors over the summer with very little opportunity given to students who this committee is ostensibly supposed to be defending to actually engage with the amendments.” Employees B also explained that community members were encouraged to write in their feedback, which several members of McGill Association of University Teachers did; they stated, however, that those who wrote in did not receive a response. 
In response to the changes, equity-seeking student groups, including Queer McGill, the Union of Gender Empowerment, McGillOutLaw, and SSMU Student Rights and Accessibility, formed a coalition. Frizzle explained that the coalition’s current objective is to raise awareness of the changes: “The more people I talked to, the more people I asked, I haven’t encountered a single person aside from those who were at the actual Senate meeting who’s been aware of the changes that were made to the JBSCE.” Because the changes were presented as a report, they explained, and not a motion, there wasn’t space afforded for discussion or debate in the Senate meeting. “Personally, I can’t let it sit under the radar,” Frizzle said, “If [McGill is] going to make changes like this, they need to be held accountable by the community.”

McGill has yet to follow suit
On October 27, University of Toronto (UofT) President Meric Gertler announced the university’s commitment to divest from fossil fuel companies within its endowment fund of $4 billion, citing findings from the United Nations and the World Health Organization on the impending climate crisis which “now demands bold actions that have both substantive and symbolic impact.” This divestment includes a pledge to divest from all direct investments in fossil fuel companies within the next 12 months and to divest from indirect investments by 2030 at the latest. These indirect investments are typically made through “pooled and commingled vehicles managed by third-party fund managers.”
This decision follows those of many other universities across Canada and the United States in the past few years, including Concordia University in 2019 and Harvard University this past September. In 2017 Laval University in Quebec became the first Canadian university to commit to full divestment from fossil fuels, but reneged this promise two years later. As of 2021, approximately 220 postsecondary institutions have divested from the fossil fuel industry. 
UofT’s decision was motivated by its perceived role as a leading academic institution to meet the “urgent challenge” of the climate crisis and its responsibility for the detrimental effects that will “disproportionately fall on students and generations of future students and children around the world.” In a letter to the UofT community, President Gertler said that the hope in divesting is to influence other investors and “government actors at home and abroad” to “intensify their efforts to tackle the challenge of climate change.” 
While this decision was celebrated by UofT students and staff as well as climate activists across Canada, many claim that it comes far too late. In an open letter signed by a lengthy list of UofT professors in subjects ranging from astrophysics to environmental science, critics pointed out the university’s failure to divest from fossil fuels when its own expert advisory panel suggested targeted divestment six years ago. Further, they claim that UofT has violated its own policy by continuing to invest in firms that cause “social injury” – that is, harming consumers, employees, and others through company activities – up until its announcement to divest. 
Similarly, members of Divest McGill, an organization that has been fighting for McGill’s divestment in fossil fuels since 2012, claim that McGill violates its restriction of investment in firms “causing social injury” by refusing to fully divest from fossil fuel firms.
In 2015, representatives of Divest presented a 150-page research brief to McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) in hopes of achieving a complete and transparent divestment from the top 200 fossil fuel companies. Their petition was rejected by the Committee to Advise Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), who claimed in their 2016 report that “continuing to explore or refusing to keep unburnable reserves underground does not directly have grave injurious impact on individuals or the natural environment.” This was the second occasion in which the CAMSR was faced with petitions and demands to vote for divestment, the first being in 2013. In both cases, no recommendation was made to the BoG based on this finding, though their reports influenced the  Board’s endorsement of an expanded action plan to address climate issues.
While remaining resistant to calls for full divestment, McGill is pursuing a “responsible investment” charter that considers environmental, social, and governance factors in investment decisions and focuses on reducing the university’s carbon footprint. Their policy includes the long term targets of becoming zero-waste by 2035 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, and affirms a “responsibility as members of the global community [to] do what we can to achieve these goals to reduce our impact on climate change and contribute positively to the sustainability of the planet.” McGill’s commitment to decarbonization comes alongside the COP26, which concluded with global leaders’ commitment to the accelerated decarbonization of cities and industry. 
The university board’s decision to decarbonize its investment portfolio rather than to divest its nearly $50 million invested in fossil fuels has come as a disappointment to many students and professors. In January 2020, philosophy and environment professor Gregory Mikkelson resigned from his tenured position in response to the university’s inaction. McGill’s $9.2 million investment in fossil-fuel-free funds as of December 2020 is “a wholly inadequate, token response to Divest McGill’s remarkable and nearly-decade-long organizing effort,” Mikkelson told the Daily.
Indigenous nations and communities are among those impacted by investments in fossil fuel industries. According to mcgillinvests, McGill’s investment profile includes holdings in fossil fuel companies such as Enbridge Inc., which has operated several large crude-oil pipelines in the US and Canada running over the land and communities of countless Indigenous nations. Notably, Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota has been met with fierce opposition by the Ojibwe tribe, whose waterways, land, and ways of life are threatened by its construction. 
McGill is also invested in TC Energy, the owners of the Coastal Gas Link pipeline which the Wet’suwet’en people of British Columbia have been fighting to stop since 2008 in the face of police brutalization and a 2020 Supreme Court injunction barring members of the Wet’suwet’en nation from obstructing work on the pipeline. As Mikkelson notes, the Canadian government’s failure to move away from fossil fuels mirrors that of McGill: “the same ruling class that stymies ecological progress at the national level does the same at the organizational level, for example through its dominance within the McGill Board of Governors.” Mikkelson refers to the BoG’s composition, consisting of eight elected board members – two on the behalf of the student body – and the rest of the 25 total members coming mainly from “the corporate world.”  Divest notes, for example, that previous CAMSR chair and current board member Cynthia Price-Verrault worked for 20 years in the petroleum industry. 
Divest’s 2015  proposal to the BoG suggested a preliminary strategy from only Enbridge and Shell, citing environmental and social injury caused by both companies. The proposal was denied. 
The movement for divestment is tied to advocacy from students and staff for a more democratic decision-making process from McGill. On Friday, November 19, members of Divest McGill and the broader McGill community gathered in the Arts building for an assembly on the democratization of McGill’s governing board. The assembly concluded in a unanimous vote for the formation of a new coalition to democratize the decision-making body. This new coalition comes after nearly a decade of continuously being blocked by the BoG, leading Divest McGill to “reach a boiling point:” “We are now fighting for a democratic university: a change in the governance structure as the only way to change McGill’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry,” the organization said in a statement prior to the assembly. Lola Milder, a Divest McGill member who attended the assembly, says that McGill’s statements claiming to work towards “a holistic and intersectional understanding of our environment” and to consider equity as a part of its sustainability plan are contradictory: “Statements like that are intended to satisfy and quiet movements of dissent, but we aren’t satisfied or quieted.”
While the focus of many climate activists is on the role of business corporations in fueling the climate crisis, colleges and universities have drawn significant attention and pressure to take action. This is not the first case in which McGill’s board has found itself faced with pressures to divest in order to be “on the right side of history,” as Mikkelson puts it: in 1985, McGill announced its decision to divest from companies with business in apartheid South Africa – only after disruptive student protests and four years of hesitation. Says Mikkelson, “It seems like sheer obstinacy for the university’s bosses to continue holding out at this late hour,” given that so many Canadian universities have announced divestment. 
Regarding the distinct role of educational institutions in this fight and in other social crises, Mikkelson claims that “universities’ investment decisions [hold] greater symbolic power and hence political impact – for good or ill, depending on whether those decisions come down on the right side of history or not, regarding such issues as apartheid, smoking, and fossil fuel.” 
The IPCC Working Group 1 report released in August 2021 stated that climate change is irreversible and that no “safe” threshold for climate change exists; the planet would not cool down again upon reaching net-zero carbon emissions. The “net-zero” target prominent in the media signifies that ongoing emissions released will be “balanced” with emissions reductions by other countries or institutions, as opposed to “gross zero” emissions, which would eliminate carbon emissions altogether. The International Energy Agency has found that “ensuring we add no more CO2 emissions to the atmosphere than we remove is considered to be essential” to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to the study, this is possible, but only with some drastic changes, including no new sales of fossil fuel boilers by 2025 and no new oil and gas fields approved for development by 2021, an immediate demand. 
For advocates of fossil fuel divestment and climate action, these facts make the fight ever more important. “In the case of fossil fuels, divestment has also begun to hinder the industry’s access to funding,” says Mikkelson. The BoG’s decision to withhold from divestment, he says, does not “bode well for [McGill].” 
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Laval University had fully divested from fossil fuels, and that 1,300 postsecondary institutions have divested from fossil fuels. The article has been updated to be more accurate. 
The Daily regrets these errors.

On November 25, SSMU’s Legislative Council convened for their last meeting of the semester. Councillors discussed President Darshan Daryanani’s ongoing absence; later in the evening, Councillors and Executives had a heated exchange regarding a lack of consultation in two of the motions submitted for review.
The Question Period
A number of questions for SSMU executives were submitted by students prior to the meeting. The first question asked for a “complete and unredacted explanation as to the whereabouts of the President and General Manager [GM],” or a citation of the “aspect of confidentiality” which may prevent Executives from providing such an explanation. VP Finance Éric Sader, who said he felt “like a broken record,” explained that the President’s absence is a human resources (HR) issue; because the Legislative Council is a political body which does not concern HR affairs, Daryanani’s absence cannot be discussed publicly with the Council. In response to the request for an explanation of why the reason for Daryanani’s absence is confidential, Sader claimed that “it would absolutely defeat the purpose for me to reveal what part of confidentiality is relevant here […] I refuse to answer that part of the question.” The following question also concerned the absence of Daryanani and the GM, and asked Executives whether the student body and Legislative Council are entitled to know why these crucial members of SSMU have been absent for months. Sader reiterated that HR issues cannot be discussed within the Legislative Council, and claimed that HR issues are “not relevant” to the student body. 
Yet another question regarding Daryanani’s absence was posed to executives: “What has happened to the $10,000 that has been allocated to the salary of the President and the General Manager?” Executives chose not to comment. However, in response to a question asking whether employees of the Society who have not fulfilled their duties should receive a salary, Sader said that “in the situation where there were no extenuating circumstances,” employees who failed to do their job or “suddenly went AWOL” should not receive compensation.  Another question asked why the absences of the President and GM have not been communicated to the student body; Executives did not comment. When asked why the Society has not announced the absence of the current GM even though the resignation of GMs have historically been made public, Sader said this comparison was faulty as the current GM has not resigned. He also claimed that “the Society is functioning better than ever,” despite the fact that the tasks of the GM and the President have been redistributed amongst Executives. 
Later questions asked how the President’s absence may diminish student representation within McGill’s administrative body; VP University Affairs Claire Downie, who has filled Daryanani’s position on the Board of Governors (BoG) and Senate, stated that many SSMU and PGSS representatives also hold a place within the Senate. “There haven’t been any motions or any discussion points where one student vote […] would have really made a huge difference,” she said. Downie also explained why the Society did not have a representative at the university’s October 7 BoG meeting: Executives had been told that they would be able to act as a proxy for Daryanani, only to find out that this claim was incorrect upon being denied admission to the meeting. The issue has been resolved and Downie will continue to attend BoG meetings on behalf of SSMU.
One question asked how the safety of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian students is being ensured by the Society. Sader responded that SSMU is conducting an investigation into the allegations that a blacklist containing the names of pro-Palestinian students has been circulating among Society representatives. Sader continued that this issue is “currently in discussion on [the Board of Directors]” and that a master plan to address anti-Palestinian racism and sentiment on campus is currently being drafted. He also noted that he is troubled by the allegations, as blacklists are produced by “destructive institutions.” 
Finally, executives addressed questions regarding how the Board of Directors (BoD) is meant to be held accountable as well as the nature of reforms recently implemented in SSMU’s HR Committee. Sader encouraged students interested in holding BoD members accountable to read SSMU’s Constitution – in particular, Article 6.8 details how BoD members can be removed from their positions. Later, he explained SSMU’s HR reforms: Executives have been removed from the HR Committee; the Equity Commissioner has been added to the Committee; and SSMU’s HR Manager and HR Director are now present on the Committee as non-voting members. These changes allow the HR Department to hold executives and high-level managers accountable, and reflect how the HR Departments of most non-profit corporations are structured.
Three Motions Put Forward
The first motion to be discussed was the Motion Regarding Amendments to the Internal Regulations of Student Groups, written by 2019-2020 SSMU President Bryan Buraga, moved by Arts Representative Yara Coussa and seconded by Arts Representative Ghania Javed. As Coussa explained, Affiliated Political Campaigns – that is, those campaigns which have received a mandate from the Legislative Council, or by Referendum or General Assembly – are not entitled to free room bookings or tabling in the University Centre, unlike Full Status Clubs. Additionally, the motion stated that “Affiliated Political Campaigns have faced hardships when attempting to receive financial and non-financial support from the Society” because the VP External has failed to approve campaigns’ requests in a timely manner. As such, the motion called for Interim Provisions to be made to SSMU’s Internal Regulations of Governance; these provisions would allow Affiliated Political Campaigns 15 hours of free room booking and eight hours for kiosk/tabling in the University Centre, the same provisions which Full Status Clubs are entitled to.
Sader expressed frustration over the lack of consultation with Executives. “The fact  that the mover and the seconder were completely unable to answer very basic questions is honestly a little bit debilitating […] [the fact that] Bryan Buraga, who was previously President, has such a lack of understanding of governance procedures […] is honestly baffling.” Speaker of Council Alexandre Ashkir interrupted with a call to order and asked Sader to retract his comment; Sader complied, but maintained that the motion was fundamentally unconstitutional. VP External Sacha Delouvrier and VP Student Life Karla Heisele Cubilla echoed Sader’s frustration. Delouvrier characterized  the lack of consultation as “inappropriate” and also expressed disappointment in Buraga – Ashkir again had to remind executives to “watch [their] language.” Coussa later asked Sader to apologize: “there is no need to be rude and impolite to the mover and seconder who wanted to empathize with advocacy groups on campus.” 
Next, Sader presented the Motion Regarding the Fall 2021 Budget Revision; such revisions are conducted every October, but this year’s revision had to be postponed due to “operational difficulties.” The motion passed, with 24 representatives in favour and one abstention.
Finally, Management Representative Nathaniel Saad presented the Motion Regarding the Absence of the SSMU President. Seeing as the President has not attended any Legislative Council or Executive Committee meetings this semester, the motion calls for the President to submit a letter of resignation within 48 hours of the motion’s ratification by the BoD. If Daryanani does not submit this letter within the allotted time, a Special General Assembly will be held during the first week of the Winter 2022 Semester; students may submit a motion to the General Assembly calling for the President’s impeachment. Saad pointed out the ramifications of Daryanani’s absence: not only does the President collect a salary of “around $32,000” – again, Executives have not confirmed whether Daryanani is on paid leave – but his absence has caused extra labour for other Executives, which Saad said “is really not a sustainable situation.”
Neither Councillors nor Executives raised concerns about the motion during its question and debate period, so the motion was put to a vote by roll call immediately. 18 representatives voted in favour of the motion, while nine abstained – all five of the Executives chose to abstain. This year’s BoD includes Executives Éric Sader, Claire Downie, Sarah Paulin, and Karla Heisele Cubilla; Councillors Ghania Javed, Benson Wan, Charlotte Gurung, and Yara Coussa; and while there are four seats available for students who are not part of Legislative Council, these positions have yet to be filled, according to the SSMU website. The Board must reach a two-thirds majority to ratify the motion.
