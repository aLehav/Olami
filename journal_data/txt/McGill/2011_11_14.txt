Discussion centres on how to improve campus discourse
Just over twelve hours after the room was occupied by student protestors, a group of McGill history professors met with Principal Heather Munroe-Blum in her office Friday morning to discuss the tense campus discourse that has emerged from the MUNACA strike this semester.
The professors, who published a letter condemning the administration’s response to the strike in the November 7 issue of The Daily, were offered coffee and sat around a large table in Munroe-Blum’s fifth-floor office in the James Administration building.
“The first issue was what had happened last night,” said Daviken Studnicki-Gizbert, an associate history professor of Latin American history, referring to the Montreal police’s violent dispersal of student protestors on campus Thursday night. At the time of the meeting – 8:30 a.m. – Munroe-Blum had not yet been briefed on Thursday night’s events, and was unable to explain why police had been called to campus.
The topic of the meeting, however, was the administration’s handling of the campus environment since the MUNACA strike began on September 1. In their letter, the professors accused the administration of “presenting a one-sided management view of the conflict at a time when other viewpoints are being suppressed.”
According to interviews with professors who attended the meeting, Munroe-Blum addressed her widely-discussed “We are all McGill” email, in which Munroe-Blum accused picketers of intimidating students and alumni. However, citing the privacy of the meeting, none of the professors interviewed went into detail about the contents of Munroe-Blum’s explanation.
Studnicki-Gizbert said that, more broadly, “She acknowledged that there was a problem with communication, that communication was not this one-way flow of demands coming from the administration.”
According to Studnicki-Gizbert, Munroe-Blum then asked professors what they would do to improve the campus discourse. He suggested a constituent assembly, in which faculty, students, administrators, and support staff would gather to talk about the big issues facing the University.
A number of professors also discussed the strike in the context of labour history, noting that the administration’s use of injunctions was unusually harsh. “We’re all historians, so we gave her a historical perspective,” said Brian Cowan, a professor of British history.
The twenty professors who signed the November 7 letter received an emailed invitation from Munroe-Blum last Tuesday, a day after the letter was published. “I don’t think we expected to get such a prompt response,” said Cowan.
According to professors, around a dozen of them attended the meeting Friday – and those who didn’t attend had teaching commitments or were out of town.
Several of them struck a conciliatory tone in interviews after the meeting on Friday. “We were received very courteously, in the spirit of frank and productive exchange,” said Suzanne Morton, a professor of Canadian social history.
Cowan echoed this, saying he believed Munroe-Blum was acting in good faith: “It really was designed to be an occasion for dialogue.”
“It was heartening to see that our collective cris-de-coeur had been heeded,” he added. “More dialogue will help calm tempers, and possibly help us become a community again.”

Nearly 25 per cent of student body votes in referendum
The results of the referenda questions determining the future of QPIRG-McGill and campus radio station CKUT were announced last Thursday evening. Both organizations won an overwhelming ‘yes’ vote in favour of renewal of their student fees, and a move from online to in-person opt-outs.
According to Elections McGill, 5,245 students – amounting to 24.7 per cent of the student body – voted in the referendum. Of the voters, 72.3 per cent voted ‘yes’ for CKUT. 65.6 per cent of voters, voted ‘yes’ for QPIRG.
CKUT and QPIRG face existence referendums every five years. These results mean that student funding for both organizations will be renewed. They also mean both organizations can begin renegotiating their Memoranda of Agreement with the University.
Adam Wheeler, co-chair of the QPIRG ‘yes’ committee, explained that, “We’re so elated…with the turnout, which is incredible, especially for the fall referendum period.”
“It shows that students value the work that our organization does on campus in terms of providing programming, resources, and linking campus community,” he continued.
Rebecca Dooley, co-chair of the CKUT ‘yes’ committee and a news intern at the radio station, described the positive support of the student community. “I’m not that surprised, I’m just really excited. The last ten days have been an outpouring of support from student groups and students,” she said.
For many members of QPIRG and CKUT, the results are a relief, and proof of recognition of their work.
Anna Malla, internal coordinator for QPIRG, said, “It feels like validation for all that we thought was true and all the work that we’ve been doing for so long.”
A main component of the referendum, in addition to the renewal of funding, was the changing of the student opt-out system from online to in-person, giving the organizations more control over their refund systems.
The opt-out system was conducted in-person until 2007, when the administration moved the system online.
“I think [the results] show that students are saying to McGill administration, ‘Enough is enough, we actually want control of our own organizations and services,’” Malla said.
According to Malla, “We put this question forward because we felt that the current opt-out system as it is doesn’t give students the information to find out about these services.”
However, in the November 7 issue of The Daily, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson wrote in an email that a lack of clarity in a referendum question could lead to it not being implemented.
“Frankly, I find [it] to be put in a convoluted, confusing way,” he wrote. “When questions cannot be implemented because they are not clear, they aren’t implemented.”
SSMU VP Clubs and Services Carol Fraser said, “These organizations are obviously thriving, and students care about them. They’re not going away.”
Jeremy Singer, a U2 International Management student, just started working at CKUT this year. “I’m psyched that [CKUT] will [continue to exist], because I’m excited to keep working there,” he said.
Dooley also expressed her hope for the future of CKUT and QPIRG. “This is what I want to see every five years – students supporting student life.”
Neither Mendelson nor Elections McGill CEO Rebecca Tacoma could be reach for comment at press time.

McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum
The McGill Daily: What are your thoughts on the tuition increases set to begin next September?
Heather Munroe-Blum: I believe these are a necessity for ensuring the quality of higher education in Quebec.
Over the past years, Quebec’s low tuition policy has not improved accessibility or participation in post-secondary education in this province. Indeed, Quebec continues to have low participation rates and low university degree completion rates by Canadian standards, notwithstanding that it has the lowest tuition rates in Canada.
Having the lowest tuition rates has put universities in Quebec – and, hence, Quebeckers – at a comparative disadvantage vis-a-vis our peer institutions in the rest of the country.  Our universities are starved for funds to provide adequate student aid, to improve facilities and patrimonial buildings, and to provide appropriate levels of student services.
Those who lack financial means require better financial support in order to support that cost of participating in the university degree – not low or no tuition fees.  One means to achieve this is to have universities allocate some percentage of their net new tuition revenues to student financial support, as McGill does at the rate of 30 cents on the dollar.
MD: What are your thoughts on the provincial government’s general funding of post-secondary education?
HMB: Considering that Quebec currently ranks 56 of 60 provinces and states in North America in relation to its GDP per capita, one cannot expect that the government will have the capacity, alone, to close the funding gap between us and our peers in the rest of the country to support high quality university programs and university accessibility.
As it is, the current plan, which will see tuition rise by $325 a year, will find Quebec universities charging a tuition fee in 2016-17 that is only two-thirds of the Canadian average tuition fees charged in the last academic year.
MD: What feedback have you received from students about the tuition increases?
HMB: Mixed. I am aware that many students oppose the planned increase and some, in fact, object to the idea of any tuition fees. Free university education sounds good, if one ignores the actual effect of underfunding on both accessibility and quality. There are also many students, and their families, who consider tuition a worthwhile investment, and there are few places in the world where the tuition fees charged yield the value for dollar that these do here.
MD: What action will you be taking on Quebec tuition in the near future?
HMB: McGill has represented a common position with respect to tuition fees over the last many years. It will continue to urge the government to support means to bridge the significant funding gap between Quebec universities and their peers in the rest of the country. This will likely best be accomplished by a combination of increased operating grant support and increased programs of support for competitively allocated awards and grants to universities.

Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) President Roland Nassim
The McGill Daily: What are your thoughts on the tuition increases set to begin next September?
Roland Nassim: It is quite unfortunate that the government is taking such actions. At the PGSS, we believe that Quebec graduate students should not pay any tuition, and we advocate for a freeze on the out-of-province and international tuition. We believe that, with this increase, many graduate students will be forced into a situation where they could be unable to pay for tuition along with their other fees. We do not have adequate graduate funding policies across Quebec universities and our financial aid systems, either through the government or the universities, are not enough.
MD: What are your thoughts on the provincial government’s general funding of post-secondary education?
RN: The provincial government’s general funding of post-secondary education (PSE) is about 10 to 15 years behind. The universities’ operating budgets are increasing with enrollment and growth in general, at a time when the government funding remains stagnant. This government needs to make education a priority again and come up with new models of funding for PSE that are more in line with today’s reality.
MD: What feedback have you received from students about the tuition increases?
RN: Students are worried. Many do not buy the argument that this increase is somehow going to improve their education. They understand that this additional money will simply relieve the government from its funding responsibility, including its responsibility to fund student aid. Graduate students are also very concerned with regards to their ability to survive through graduate schools, especially [since] those students enjoy less parental support, have no guaranteed funding packages to rely on at McGill, and have less opportunity or time for employment during their studies. Their average debts at the end of their studies are also an important factor. Overall, students are not happy.
MD: What action will you be taking on Quebec tuition in the near future?
RN: Our activities throughout the year continue with conducting the proper research on the topic, and disseminating the information to our membership. This should serve as an awareness campaign and a tool to better educate the membership.

SSMU President Maggie Knight
The McGill Daily: What are your thoughts on the tuition increases set to begin next September?
Maggie Knight: The tuition increases for Quebec students won’t pose a barrier to every student, particularly at McGill, where students on average come from relatively affluent backgrounds. However, a 2007 Quebec government report found that 12,000 students would choose not to attend university if tuition was raised to the Canadian average.
Access to a McGill education should be based on merit, not on means. While the University has pledged to use 30 per cent of every net new dollar for increased financial aid, this doesn’t address the issue of students who may not qualify for financial aid, but nevertheless face substantial financial barriers to pursuing their studies at McGill.
MD: What are your thoughts on the provincial government’s general funding of post-secondary education?
MK: Given McGill’s budgeted deficits, it’s clear we either need to re-evaluate spending priorities to reduce costs, or we need to gain additional sources of funds. When it comes to finding more revenue, we would, of course, prefer that the University stood with its students who are demanding the government find ways of financing post-secondary education in Quebec than raising tuition—through additional progressive taxation or through other means that respect the importance of publicly-funded post-secondary education.
MD: What feedback have you received from students about the tuition increases?
MK: There are many students who are very concerned, especially international and out-of-province students who don’t yet know what they can expect. McGill has a large number of students whose parents help pay their tuition and/or their living expenses, as well as a large number of American students who see McGill as a comparatively cheap option; these students obviously aren’t as personally affected by tuition hikes and don’t always think the hikes are a big deal.
MD: What action will you be taking on Quebec tuition in the near future?
MK: I will be continuing to support SSMU VP External Joël Pedneault in representing McGill students’ interests on the tuition issue. The SSMU has a policy in support of accessible education and continues to work with the Quebec Student Roundtable to present our concerns to the Ministry of Education, Leisure, and Sport. It is important that McGill students realize how tuition hikes will affect students across the province, and consider what role we can play in helping improve access to Quebec post-secondary education.
