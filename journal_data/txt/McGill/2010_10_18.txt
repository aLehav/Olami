Provincial and Federal accounts differ by $30 million
The provincial government is withholding $30 million in student aid transferred from the federal government, according to the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ).
In a press release dated October 15, FEUQ and the Fédération étudiante collegiale du Québec pointed to a gap between the amount of money earmarked for student aid in federal transfer payments – $235 million – and the amount the provincial government claims it received – $205 million.
The payments will take effect in January 2011 and will cover expenses for the fiscal year 2009-2010.
“We’ve got the confirmation from the federal government that [they have] written the cheque, that this will transfer $235 million to the Quebec government,” said FEUQ president Louis-Phillips Savoie.
The transfer payments are administered under two federal programs: $120 million will come from the Canada Student Loan Program (CSLP) and $115 million from the newly created Canada Student Grant Program (CSGP). This amounts to a 14.5 per cent increase from last year’s total transfer. The CSGP is replacing the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, from which Quebec received $80 million last year.
A chart posted on the federal Treasury Board’s website says $229 million was transferred to The province, although FEUQ political attaché Mathias Boulianne said that Barbara Glover, Director General of the Canada Student Loans Directorate, pegged the number at $235 million when he met with her.
The province’s significantly lower number appeared in Quebec’s 2010-2011 budget, released March 30.
“The provincial government pretends that the student loans program was cut by an amount of approximately $30 million,” Savoie said. “That’s how they arrived at $205 million.”
Provincial Education minister Line Beauchamp’s office could not be reached for comment as The Daily went to press.
Asked whether he thought the provincial government was being deliberately misleading in the figures they presented, Savoie said, “that’s our best guess.”
“You’ve got confirmation from the federal government that $235 million has been transferred. And you’ve got Quebec on the other side that says 205 [million dollars].”
He said he believed the missing $30 million was “out there somewhere,” and that Quebec might be using it for “building roads, constructing hospitals…anything really.”
“The money comes from the federal government to cover bursaries,” he continued. “It should be used to solve some of the problems that are pressing the student financial aid program in Quebec.”
SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi told The Daily she believes the current student aid regime needs an overhaul.
“The current calculation system is not reflective of today’s realities,” she said.
She said the $30 given to students for internet bills and the seven dollar a day food stipend were unfair to students on financial aid.
She also stated that she would like to “decrease or even remove the loans part” of the system, saying she would prefer a system in which all students in need would receive a bursary that would not have to be paid back.
Zaidi said the issue of the discrepancy in the provincial and federal governments’ figures will be put on the agenda of the meeting of the Quebec Students Roundtable (QSR), the provincial student lobbying group of which SSMU is a founding member. She added that she wanted to speak with other QSR member organizations and other provincial student groups before commenting on the issue.
QSR’s meeting was held on Saturday at 11 a.m. in the Shatner Break-Out room, before The Daily went to press.

Lobby groups come together for panel talk
Representatives of four provincial student lobbying groups met Wednesday to lead a panel discussion about the future of funding for Quebec universities and the unity, or lack of unity, of the student movement in Quebec. The four groups present were the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ), the Quebec Student Roundtable (QSR), the Federation étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), and Free Education Montreal (FEM).
The main issue up for discussion was the upcoming Quebec tuition defreeze, which will take place in 2012. All four groups expressed strong opposition to raising Quebec tuititon, and drew a connection between education and freedom. “Most countries know that education is the basis of their social contract and their society,” said Robert Sonin, the representative from FEM. “The more education you have, the better the country. The more education you have, the lower your crime rates. The better education you have, the higher your incomes. So to put a block in the way of that impedes people’s freedoms.”
Louis-Philippe Savoie, the president of FEUQ, agreed. “Universities are a very smart public investment . … it would be shooting ourselves in the foot, as a society, to reduce access to universities.”
Although all groups were in agreement over key points regarding tuition increases, the discussion also centred around the groups’ differences, and whether Quebec’s student movement is, or even ought to be, united. “If there is a unity to be built, it has to be built on a common basis which has to be either material, ideological, or both,” said ASSÉ representative Martin Robert. “What we can see right now is that that basis is not quite there.”
The issue of a unified student activist movement is particularly relevant for McGill students, as SSMU is affiliated with QSR and PGSS is a member of FEUQ. However, Sonin is confident that, with regards to tuition at least, the groups will be working together in the future. “In times when there isn’t such a big issue, student associations should disagree…when we have to fight a battle like this, it’s time to put those things aside.”
The groups are also confident of the support of the student body in Quebec. QSR vice-secretary general Joël Pedneault drew a parallel between the support he expects for the fight against tuition increases and the support shown recently at McGill for the Architecture Café.
“To me, that shows that people do care about issues related to universities and university settings. It’s just a question of informing people enough that they can link different issues together,” he said.
Moderator Erik Chevrier linked the issues of university funding in Quebec to other situations in Canada. “If we look at the financing of two major events that have happened – the G20 and the Olympics – had close to three billion dollars of security costs,” he said. “So when you talk about not being able to fund public services, maybe we’re just putting it in the wrong place.”
All of the panelists were called upon to explain their organizations’ policy proposals for funding universies without raising tuition; the solutions ranged from philanthropy to payroll taxes but ultimately, said Sonin, the question is one of priorities.
“The question here is not only one of where the money is going to come from. We have the money. Look around you. We are living in a very rich country, and we have the money to fund what we want to fund. So the question is, are you going to fund…things that contribute to an individualization of people…or are you going to fund things that we can do together?”

Local theatre has yet to begin construction
With winter setting in, municipalities across Quebec are rushing to finish numerous construction and renovation projects before funding from a 2009 federal stimulus package expires on March 31, 2011.
The projects are being financed by the federal Economic Action Plan (EAP), a two-year stimulus package launched at the start of Fiscal Year (FY) 2009-2010. Problems have arisen as the funding’s deadline approaches, however, as many projects have only just begun due to extensive provincial and municipal rules that govern their development.
Les Deux Mondes theatre is one such example. The company entered a partnership with the Théâtre Aux Écuries – a cooperative of seven artistic companies – to renovate the theatre’s existing space at 7285 Chabot. The partnership received $970,000 from the federal government and $2.4 million from the provincial government – about ninety per cent of the $4-million project – to bankroll the project, but due to legal requirements construction is yet to begin, with the deadline to use the EAP money just months away. The project will add one studio, three rehearsal rooms, and necessary utilities, as well as developing an existing building renovated in 1996.
“We officially got the support from the Quebec and Canada governments last November, [and] we rushed to be able to respect the deadline call,” wrote David Lavoie, General Administrator for Aux Écuries, in an email to The Daily. “But an architectural project is a complex thing…[with] the backs and forths needed to get the municipal agreements.”
“We finally got ready for the submission calls [from construction companies] three weeks ago. … That’s the fastest track we could make.”
Lavoie explained that many of the municipal rules around construction are designed to protect the public from rapidly approved projects that could affect their neighbourhoods, allowing residents to campaign against projects they may not want to see developed. For example, developers are obligated to inform the public of a given project and get feedback, a process that often takes three months to achieve.
“The information gets to us drop by drop,” said Lavoie.
Lavoie was confident that eighty to ninety per cent of the project could be completed by March 31, but also noted the danger of enforcing such a strict deadline on construction projects.
“We hope that the Canadian government will get conscious of the danger they balance on the companies like us,” he wrote. “But it’s also crazy to maintain that deadline: if we rush the construction companies to that deadline, our project will cost way more than we planned! Who wants it that way?”
The federal Department of Finance said they are working closely with their provincial and municipal counterparts to ensure that all projects are completed by the deadline.
“While some recipients have reported delays in construction starts in progress reports submitted to the Government, the forecasted completion dates provided, and attested to, by the recipients indicate that projects will be completed by the program end date,” wrote a Department of Finance official in an email to The Daily.
“The Minister of Finance [Jim Flaherty] has stated that [the] federal government will be just and reasonable for projects virtually completed by the deadline, but…it is still our expectation that the vast majority of these projects will be completed by the deadline,” said the official.
For FY2010-11 the EAP is funnelling almost $3.2 billion into the Infrastructure Stimulus Fund to develop provincial, territorial, municipal, and community infrastructure. $330 million has been earmarked for “short-term support for key sectors,” which includes the culture and tourism sectors of municipal government.
Lavoie said that if the theatre prvoject is not completed by March 31, and loses its federal funding, it will be shelved indefinitely until the necessary funding could be collected.
“We cannot build a theater venue dedicated to emerging artists without public support. No theatre has been built in Montreal for the past two decades, in the French community at least. And that’s not because there was not a need for it!” said Lavoie.
He also said that the hard deadline could have a significant impact on the Montreal art scene, which relies heavily on public funding for support. The cultural sector is receiving $158 million in EAP funds this year.
“During the last ten years (at least), the new generations of artists have found it harder and harder to get support from the governments, because the public investments are not increasing. Our artists are now producing at an exhilarating rate. So we’d like to facilitate their access to the tools they need to get to the next step,” said Lavoie.
Ottawa giving McGill $81 million
EAP also established the Knowledge Infrastructure Program (KIP) – money intended to improve infrastructure throughout Canadian universities – and are committing $1 billion for FY2010-11.
Provincial governments across the country have collectively matched the $1 billion. According to the Department of Finance, Quebec has received $458.4 million through the KIP, to support 295 projects throughout the province. McGill has received $81 million from the program for FY2010-11.
According to Jim Nicell, Associate VP (University Services), the University’s prioritized projects for the money include renovations to the Macdonald Engineering, McIntyre Medical, and Otto Maass Chemistry buildings.
Every level of EAP is designed to stimulate the economy by providing new jobs for Canadians, who are in turn expected to contribute to the economy as consumers.
“[KIP is] meant to have a rolling effect. Workers get salaries…[and] spend money,” said Nicell. “It stimulates and stimulates.”
The Department of Finance estimates that EAP is expected to create or maintain 220,000 jobs across the country by the end of 2010.
“Since July 2009, nearly 423,000 jobs have been created in Canada. That is more than were lost in the recession,” said the Department of Finance official.

SSMU will pose SACOMSS fee renewal at fall referendum
Thursday’s SSMU Council prepared for the General Assembly (GA) next week, reviewed the success of Homecoming, and voted to create a referendum on the renewal of the fee for the Sexual Assault Centre of McGill Students Society (SACOMSS).
Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, a QPIRG board member and former SSMU VP external, addressed Council as a guest speaker, and urged councillors to remember their responsibility to “be open to dialogue [and] open to meeting with students.”
He expressed disappointment that QPIRG’s Board of Directors had not been included in talks surrounding the motion to reconsider QPIRG’s fee, which was ruled out of order and removed from Council’s agenda before the meeting.
The Board of Directors is looking to be on the agenda at the next Council meeting, and hopes to converse with councillors about the relationship and history between QPIRG and SSMU.
In his executive report, President Zach Newburgh discussed a plan, in conjunction with Mobilization McGill, for a three-day boycott leading up to a rally outside Wednesday’s Senate meeting, where “we want to make as much noise as possible.”
Newburgh also explained that SSMU has been waiting since June for McGill Legal Services to provide the lease for the University Centre (Shatner Building) and SSMU’s Memorandum of Agreement with the University, but that the documents should be available soon.
Arts Councillor Todd Plummer raised the possibility of an equity complaint against one of the proposed GA motions, which calls for the construction of a stripper’s pole in the Gert’s bar renovation plans.
Other GA approved motions called a SSMU-organized fundraiser to help alleviate the Arts Undergraduate Society’s recent financial losses, the institution of a seven-member Board of Directors in order to help SSMU maintain its liquor license, turn down the volume in Gert’s, and mandate that SSMU use Copi-EUS for large batch printing jobs.
In the latest in a long tradition of satirical GA motions, one calls on SSMU to change its name to the “Student’s Society of The Educational Institute Roughly Bounded by Peel, Penfield, University, Sherbrooke, and Mac Campus” for the duration of 2010.
A notice of motion regarding the addition of a Council representative for interfaculty Arts and Science students, after extensive debate, was not approved for the GA.
 A motion regarding the renewal of SACOMSS’s $0.75 fee, endorsed by Anushay Khan, VP Clubs and Services, passed easily, and will be brought forth to students as a referendum question during the fall referendum period.

McGill served with legal notice of Quebec Labour Code violation
Correction appended, Wed, Oct 20
Provost Anthony Masi ordered building directors to tear down posters of the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) from notice boards across campus in late September, The Daily has learned. In response, AGSEM’s parent union has served McGill with a formal legal notice charging that the University violated Quebec’s Labour Code.
The posters in question were part of a drive to add McGill’s course lecturers to AGSEM’s ranks. The campus union recently compiled data that shows McGill’s course lecturers are among the lowest paid in Quebec, although their minimum salaries for three-credit courses were increased by $2,000, to be phased in over two years, as announced on October 6. Course lecturers are currently paid $5,000 per three credit course.
AEGSEM represents McGill’s Teaching Assistants and is seeking to unionize course lecturers, who are without organization.
Stanley Glavac, Space Data Administrator for Campus and Space Planning, sent an email to all building directors September 21, reading: “Please look at the attached PDF file that shows a poster that has recently appeared in several McGill buildings. At the request of the Provost, Prof. T. Masi, this poster must be removed.” The email was also sent to the offices of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson and Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell.
Glavac told The Daily that he was instructed to send the email from someone higher in the administration, though not by Masi. Glavac declinined to identify the source of the directive. He maintained that “lots of posters are removed all the time,” adding that he “didn’t think anything of it at the time.”
Gerald Pollack, Building Director of the Stewart Biology building, said that he was “quite surprised” to see such a request.
“It’s not clear to me what the justification for that request was,” he said. “My attitude is that this is a university, and that there should be free expression of ideas.”
Pollack made clear that there were no AGSEM posters in his building, but if there had been, he would have requested justification from the administration.
Michal Rozworski, AGSEM VP External, said that the directive “is undermining everything from the basic rights of freedom of expression all the way down to the collective agreement that we signed. This is offensive on all levels.”
Lawyers from AGSEM’s parent union, the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), served McGill  with a “formal legal notice that it has violated Article 3 of the Quebec Labour Code” on October 5, according to an AGSEM press release. Article 3 of the Quebec Labour Code states that every employee of an institution has the right to belong to an association of employees of their choice and participate in the “activities and management of such association.”
The next day, Wendy Thomson, director of McGill’s School of Social Work, sent a letter to all course lecturers announcing the $2,000 pay increase. The announcement said that the “University had planned  to  publicize  these  increases  during  the  summer  of  2010  but  a  request  for  union certification  was  filed  in  July  and consequent  to  the  Quebec  Labour Code  the  University  was  prevented  from  announcing substantive changes in working conditions.”
Rozworski said that, despite the pay increase, McGill’s course lecturer salaries remain “far behind other universities in the province, and it still leaves course lecturers without all the other protections that only a collective agreement can guarantee them.”
Posters were said to be disappearing as recently as last week. Derek Nystrom, a professor in the English department, commented on an AGSEM-connected Facebook page that a poster had been removed from the door of his personal office at some point last weekend. Nystrom’s post goes on to say that the removal of the poster from his door  “says something about McGill’s commitment (or lack thereof) to free speech if profs are not allowed to put materials on their office door without clearing it with the administration first.”
While a number of administration officials involved were unavailable for comment due to a senior administration meeting on Friday, Lynne Gervais, the Associate Vice-Principal (Human Resources) acknowledged that posters “were taken down” in an email sent to The Daily through the Media Relations department.
The email went on to say “[t]here are rules that apply to what a union can or cannot do during a certification campaign and putting up these posters was a violation of these rules.” The email failed to specify which rules. Gervais also wrote that a slogan beneath AGSEM’s logo on the poster, referring to the union as “McGill’s teaching union,” was “misleading.”
Rozworski said that the Administration’s description of AGSEM’s slogan as misleading was “hurtful.”
“The message that they’re sending is that we’re not part of the teaching community at McGill.”
Rozworski said that the removal of posters has only strengthened organizers’ resolve.
“It’s sad to see something like this from a university that markets itself as a world class educational institution,” he said.
*Correction: In an earlier version of this article, it was written that course lecturers current salaries are $4,000 per course. They are in fact 5,000. The Daily regrets the error. *

Liberal MP, Habs legend comes to McGill
Ken Dryden, Liberal MP for York Centre in Toronto and a Stanley Cup-winning goalie with the Montreal Canadiens in the 1970s, spoke at Tanna Schulich Hall for McGill’s 2010 Hugh MacLennan Memorial Lecture on Thursday.
During the talk, Dryden spoke about his recently published book Becoming Canada: Our Story, Our Politics, Our Future, which deals with Canadian identity. He argued that Canadians have the wrong idea of themselves, because they feel that the lack of a homogenous national identity is harmful. Dryden argued that Canada’s diversity benefits the country and is ahead of the global curve.
In an interview with The Daily after the talk, Dryden railed against the federal government’s removal of the long-form census this summer.
 “I would have never guessed that we would even have a debate about the census. Power comes from money and information. You don’t limit information; information needs to be there for people to use in lots of different ways. When you start dealing more with rhetoric and less with information, then everybody’s in trouble and that’s what happens when you cut back access to sources of information like the census,” said Dryden.
The former NHL star listed climate change, human rights, and poverty as important political issues, but lamented the lack of Canadian political participation. The root of the problem, according to Dryden, is that many people don’t see the link between issues and politics. Dryden talked about the times he spent speaking to university students, describing how they are concerned by global issues but don’t see politics as a way of tackling them. Dryden blamed this lack of faith on the partisanship and polarization of Canadian politics.
“When I’ve been travelling from campus to campus in different provinces, people are saying the same thing and that’s for good reason, because climate change puts futures in jeopardy and it gets at the fundamental question of how no person has the right to limit the life of anyone else in any fashion whether it’s in conflict or as a result of climate change,” said Dryden.
Dryden also described what the Canadian government could be doing to make post-secondary education more accessible, while also solving the problem of underfunding in universities.
 “I think that the way in which we fund post-secondary education is that it comes out of four or five different pockets,” he said. “It’s out of parents’ pockets, out of students’ pockets through part-time jobs and summer jobs, from schools’ funding through scholarships and bursaries, and from government programs set up mainly by provincial governments, yet sometimes federal in terms of basic support. Chances are, that’s going to continue; I think the question is how you can make it less of a stretch for each party. …I think it’s everybody’s job to do a little bit better in order to decrease the stress for all parties involved.”
