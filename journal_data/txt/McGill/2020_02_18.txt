Gender and Women’s Studies, Development Studies Cut
On February 10, the GSFSSA announced via Facebook that the office of the Dean of Arts would be suspending the Graduate Options in Gender and Women’s Studies and Development Studies, effective fall 2021. The Graduate Option in Gender and Women’s Studies is currently available in 16 Masters programs and 11 Ph.D. programs, and the Development Studies option is available in six Masters programs.
In response to the cancellation, students in both fields of study issued an open letter highlighting the importance of the programs and the impact that this will have on McGill University and its students. The letter reported that “this decision was made without faculty or student consultation,” and that the suspension will impact both current and prospective students. At the time of print, the letter has been signed by more than 170 graduate students and nearly 250 undergraduate students. The letter has been widely disseminated by student groups, including the Gender, Sexuality, Feminist, and Social Justice Studies Student Association (GSFSSA), QPIRG McGill, and the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM).
Both students and faculty oppose the suspension, citing that the Graduate Options are vital to McGill and the wider fields of Gender Studies and International Development Studies. In an interview with the Daily, Dr. Alex Ketchum, a professor in the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies, stated that “in addition to creating communities of research support, the Graduate Option provided valuable professional training [… and] another framework of mentoring and research opportunities. On the academic job market, being able to speak to both disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields has been valued and important.”
She added, “it was through the Graduate Option that I was able to gain mentors who trained me in how to organize events and write grant applications. Now through my grants, I am able to employ and train research assistants who are students at McGill in these skills. The Graduate Option continues to amplify feminist interdisciplinary research and support scholars across the university from undegraduates, graduate students, and professors.”
Emily Douglas, a Ph.D candidate in Philosophy with the Option in Gender and Women’s Studies, told the Daily that one of the things that drew them to McGill was the option to specialize in Gender and Women’s Studies.
“As someone who works interdisciplinarily and will apply to jobs in Gender Studies, Sexuality Studies, and associated departments, it is crucial to have an institutional marking of my competence and skills in order to be recognized as a part of the field,” they said. “The courses I have taken associated with the Graduate Option provided me with space to explore new ideas and methodologies, as well as to find a supportive feminist and generally anti-oppressive group of peers across departments.”
They also emphasized the mentorship they received from the faculty members they worked with, noting that they still correspond with some of them today. They added, “future students who would be eligible for the Option are at a great loss with its suspension, and I sincerely hope that McGill reconsiders its choice: for a program that takes relatively little financial resources, the Option has clear and direct benefits to the intellectual community.”
Clinton Glenn, a Ph.D candidate in Art History with the Option in Gender and Women’s Studies told the Daily that “The graduate option courses are invaluable – often times as grad students we become stuck in our own disciplines, so to have the opportunity to hear different perspectives and share my research has been one of the most rewarding parts of my academic career thus far.”
He also stressed the importance of consulting those most impacted by the changes, saying “I would have hoped that if the university was thinking of evaluating the effectiveness of the programme they would reach out to students in the programme to learn more about our experiences and whether eliminating it would have a potential impact on future cohorts of graduate students. I hope that the outpouring of support from the McGill student body, faculty, and alumni will show the university administration how important and vital the graduate option is to our training and development as graduate students.”
The GSFSSA told the Daily that they are “disheartened and frustrated by the sudden decision to suspend our Graduate Option without any consultation. As passionate undergrad students of GSFS we stand in solidarity with IGSF and the Grad program against the unjust actions taken by the Faculty of Arts. We want to point out that this decision was not made in a vacuum, but within a greater institution that does not value the incredible work of Gender, Sexuality, Feminist and Social Justice Studies.”
The Daily also reached out to representatives from the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID), but at the time of print, they have not responded to request for comment. This article will be updated online when comment is available.

Candidates Talk Controversial Campus Issues
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) held its annual candidates’ debate on Thursday, February 13 at 6 p.m. in Leacock 232. With only a few students in the audience – and an unfilled slate of candidates – the debate finished promptly at 7:55 p.m.
The positions of AUS President and VP Services are uncontested, with Ananya Nair and Samad Fagbohun running, respectively. Two candidates are campaigning for VP Social – Belanna Gans and CJ Pospisil. For the position of VP Academic, there are three candidates – Catherina Musa, Rachel Lawal, and Avni Aghi. There are two open positions for Arts Senator, and two people running – Mary Lynne Loftus and Darshan Daryanani. As for Arts Representative to SSMU, there are three open positions and four people running – Paige Collins, Chip Smith, Jonah Fried, and Alex Karasick. (All available campaign platforms have been linked here.)
No candidates are running for the positions of VP Communications, VP External, VP Finance, and VP Internal. According to an email received by the Daily, these positions will be appointed by the AUS Executive Council at a later date.
To begin the debate, each candidate had two minutes to give their opening statement. They then answered questions from the incumbent and the audience, as well as those submitted via an online form. The candidates were then given one and a half minutes to make their closing arguments.
Questions for Arts Representative candidates were a substantial part of the debate. Due to the nature of the position and its close relationship to SSMU and its Legislative Council – as well as a history of controversy surrounding various Arts Representatives’ decisions and policies – the candidates received a great number of questions regarding how they would handle such controversial topics on campus.
When asked about this, candidate Fried stated, “the [AUS] is a diverse constituency with different ethnic, national populations, and I think there are a lot of international, geopolitical issues that come into play on campus that really have no place […] I think the issues we focus on should be student issues.” The issues Fried is highlighting in his platform include advocacy for student housing; he currently sits on the SSMU Housing Committee.
Other candidates echoed similar sentiments. In a question directly related to the role that Arts Representatives have had in recent years in issues related to the Israeli-Palistinian conflict on campus, candidate Smith stated, “If I’m elected as an Arts Rep, I’m ready to put my biases aside, to hear the arguments from both sides […] I’m not going to let my biases and my own personal beliefs get ahead of me in this scenario.” Smith’s platform stresses “changing the culture” in SSMU, “reduc[ing] drama and discontent.”
Karasick emphasized hearing from constituents in matters like this. “The most important thing, in my opinion […] is that we need to listen to constituents,” Karasick stated. “I want to listen to everyone’s opinion, [to get] most of the constituents I can to tell me what they believe, [to] tell me what they think should be done about an issue like this.” His platform highlights a list of initiatives for addressing equity and governance reforms at SSMU.
As for Collins, she suggested a press-conference-style hearing for students to voice their concerns – a suggestion that Collins recalled came from SSMU VP External Gwiazda-Amsel last November. “That way, academics and experts and representatives from either side of this debate are able to speak, and students are able to go and understand some of these issues,” she stated. “I think that that kind of formal channel would work really well.”
Collins is one of a number of student leaders who, last November, accepted an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel potentially funded by the Maccabee Task Force – an organization founded by conservative billionaire Sheldon Adelson. The case was taken to SSMU Legislative Council but deemed not an apparent conflict of interest by the Board of Directors, of which Collins is a member. Collins’ platform includes advocacy for paid note-takers and accomodations, as well as “establishing a working group to pursue an implementation of a co-op program” for Arts students.

Students Continue to Demand Divestment
On February 13, Divest McGill and other allied groups congregated around the James Administration building, drawing a large crowd of students and faculty, despite harsh weather conditions. Organized as part of ongoing action against McGill University’s $6 million investment in TC Energy – the company behind Coastal GasLink (CGL) – the demonstrators called out McGill’s complicity in the construction of the CGL pipeline on the hereditary land of the Wet’suwet’en Nation. This rally addressed the wider issue of divestment, while also staging an immediate response to illegal raids by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on Wet’suwet’en territory in British Columbia, joining demonstrations across the country in solidarity with the land defenders. Divest McGill sent a clear message, signaling to the administration that the McGill community does not accept its continued investment in the fossil fuel industry. The group demanded that McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) “reflect the consensus of the McGill Senate, SSMU, PGSS, faculties, and McGill unions” by divesting the university’s endowment from fossil fuels, specifically from CGL and Teck Frontier – companies whose plans infringe on the land rights of Indigenous peoples in western Canada.
Divest McGill’s solidarity action aims to hold McGill University and its BoG accountable to its community once again. The BoG’s decision not to divest came up again in early 2020 when Professor Greg Mikkelson resigned in protest due to the University’s failure to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
Christian Favreau from Climate Justice Montreal spoke at the rally, stating, “McGill is funding the RCMP raids on Wet’suwet’en territory. Considering that the McGill BoG’s refusal to divest stemmed in part from their belief that this investment posed ‘no injury,’ it’s pretty sickening to watch them continue to stand by their decision.” Favreau is employed by the Department of Geography at McGill, and spoke to his position as a non-academic staff member within the divestment movement, suggesting that labour union organizing will be a key tool to achieve climate justice going forward, in the absence of the University’s moral leadership.
By the time of this February 13 rally, RCMP tactical units had raided camps and checkpoints on the territory of the Wet’suwet’en Nation. The RCMP is accused of violating both hereditary Wet’suwet’en law as well as the recently implemented United Nations Declaration of Rights for Indigenous Peoples. According to Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, these raids provoke a variety of “serious human rights concerns” and “directly contravene a December 2019 ruling from the UN’s highest anti-racism body, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.” Neve cautions that these circumstances necessitate media scrutiny as an “essential safeguard” to protecting the lives of jailed protestors and those on the front line of this ongoing conflict, including matriarchs forcibly removed from sacred grounds. Despite this, journalists have faced restricted access to the Unist’ot’en camp grounds, resulting in a virtual media blackout. Independent contributions on the ground, and updates from the Unist’ot’en Facebook Page have been providing sustained coverage. The RCMP’s recent ‘crackdown’ on journalists threatens the free press, according to Neve.
Speaking to the Daily, SSMU Indigenous Affairs Commissioner Tomas Jirousek commented on the rally, expressing the Indigenous Student Alliance’s appreciation of “the allyship [they’ve] seen from across different social justice movements.” Jirousek spoke further to the conflict on Wet’suwet’en territory, highlighting that it is “not limited to Indigenous sovereignty, but is interconnected with issues such as climate change, food sovereignty, and pedagogical structures,” which remain “land-based and land-derived” in the context of Indigenous pedagogy. The Indigenous Student Alliance was present at the rally, among Divest McGill and other non-Indigenous allies.
Jirousek added that climate justice does not exist in isolation from issues of Indigenous rights and highlighted the importance of activism on campus that incorporates this intersection, like the work of Divest McGill. “It becomes crucial for us, as Indigenous peoples, to protect the land.”

Demonstration in Solidarity with Wet’suwet’en
On February 7, students from the Indigenous Student Alliance (ISA) at McGill, along with allied students, gathered at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s constituency office in Montreal to stage a sit-in as a show of solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people. The demonstration was organized in response to the violent arrest of six land defenders opposing the construction of a pipeline on unceded Wet’suwet’en land. These arrests took place as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was enforcing a B.C. Supreme Court sanctioned injunction, mandating that the site of the Coastal Gas Link pipeline that was planned to be built, remain unimpeded – violating hereditary Wet’suwet’en law and British Columbia’s implementation of UNDRIP.
One of the organizers of this demonstration – who did not wish to be named – recalled feeling distraught and helpless upon receiving news of the arrests that morning, saying they “want[ed] to tie [themself] to the train tracks like the Mohawk.” As the office is symbolic of the whole Canadian government, they ultimately concluded that a sit-in at Trudeau’s constituency office would be the most effective way to communicate their disappointment and anger with the government’s lack of willingness to listen to Indigenous peoples’ complaints. “Long story short,” they said, “we stand in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en peoples, and […] fuck the RCMP.”
Students characterized the sit-in and the analogous pipeline-opposition efforts in BC not as protests, but rather as means of protecting the Earth. “I don’t protest […] this is like, I don’t want people to die. I don’t want my family, my kin, to die. I love my land,” one student remarked, emphasizing that the goal of the demonstration was to protect the well-being of future generations of Indigenous peoples. Another student added that Indigenous people are protectors who take care to follow the respectful ways of their ancestors while preserving the interests of their posterity. These sentiments were reflected by the later demonstration on February 10, with one attendee asserting, “We are not protesting, we are protecting.”
A considerable number of SPVM officers were present at the February 10 demonstration, amounting to about nine officers to a small group of gathered of demonstrators. However, attendees were not deterred from criticizing the police, with several saying “Fuck Canada and fuck the RCMP” as a rallying cry. Demonstrators maintained their strong stance against the federal government, stating that Canada was failing to meet its claims of reconciliation: “You can’t take our land, our waters and our children. This is not reconciliation. This is not your promise,” one speaker stated.
Catie Galbraith, a member of ISA and one of the demonstration’s principal organizers, encourages McGill students to call their member of parliament, the British Columbia RCMP office, and any government official with influence over the situation. She also suggests that students with the financial means to donate money to the efforts of the Wet’suwet’en people to oppose the pipeline construction do so on the Unist’ot’en Camp website, and recommends that students show solidarity on social media by sharing graphics and posts from the Unist’ot’en Camp. As one student put it, “Everyone should be paying attention and supporting [Indigenous peoples] however they can.”
