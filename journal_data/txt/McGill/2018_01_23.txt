Bill 151 inadequate in addressing student-teacher relationships and protecting marginalized survivors
Content warning: sexual assault
On December 8, 2017, Bill 151, an act aimed to prevent and fight sexual violence in higher education institutions, unanimously passed in the Quebec General Assembly. The bill was developed in consultation with various groups, including the Student’s Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ), and Our Turn, who presented their thoughts on the proposed bill to the Commission on Culture and Education at the National Assembly on November 21. Under the bill, all education institutions in Quebec, including CEGEPs, must propose a policy addressing how to approach cases of sexual assault, including student-teacher relationships. At minimum, the policy requires the dean or another higher authority to be notified of any sexual relation between “students and persons having an influence over their academic progress.” The policies must be put forth by September 1, 2019.
At minimum, the policy requires the dean or another higher authority to be notified of any sexual relation between “students and persons having an influence over their academic progress.”
While the bill was drafted in consultation with various local community groups including organizations representing survivors, not all recommendations were taken to secure the rights of the survivor. This prompted SSMU VP External Connor Spencer, Coordinator of mobilization for AVEQ Kristen Perry, and Co-Founder and National Chair of Our Turn (a national campaign addressing campus sexual violence) Caitlin Salvino, to draft the open-letter criticising the content of the bill. The letter was signed by over 300 students and twenty organizations, including McGill’s sexual assault support group, the Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students Society (SACOMSS). The letter was also signed independently by members of the McGill Daily editorial board. The letter outlines recommendations for the Bill, which include “A Defined Stand-Alone Sexual Violence Policy;” an approach which would discontinue processing sexual assault cases through the Student Code of Conduct.
Additionally, the letter suggests the introduction of “rape shield protections” to protect the privacy of the survivor’s sexual history, student representation of 30% on committees, as well as the students being made aware of sanctions put into place for their case. Measures to ensure reasonable and defined timelines were recommended, such as a complaint process which does not exceed 45 days, and accommodations for survivors to be arranged within 48 hours of sending the complaint.
The letter also goes on to stipulate that the government must create an “independent oversight body,” which would serve to listen to individual complaints put forth on the violation of their safety and/or rights by the institution. “There seems to be a lack of understanding from the commission on how wary students are to trust their administrations to be the one enforcing the standards for the policy, or that they would properly consult their students during the creation of a policy,” said Spencer in an email to The Daily. The letter emphasizes that the process for students coming forward about sexual assault “must include the ability for the Minister to hear the concerns of students and then place requirements and/or sanctions on specific institutions for failing to adequately respond to sexual violence on their campus.”
“There seems to be a lack of understanding from the commission on how wary students are to trust their administrations to be the one enforcing the standards for the policy, or that they would properly consult their students during the creation of a policy.”
In her email, Spencer highlighted the necessity of involving external third parties to review the cases, such as an independent oversight body, especially when dealing with cases involving “faculty or persons in relative positions of power on campus,” a suggestion also found in the letter. As of now, McGill does not forthrightly condemn student-teacher relationships. On McGill’s webpage of Conflicts of Interest under Student Rights and Responsibilities, McGill writes that the “staff member or teaching assistant shall decline or terminate a supervisory or evaluative role with respect to the student,” but that “alternative arrangements for supervision and evaluation shall be made in confidence and shall not prejudice the status of the student, staff member, or teaching assistant.”
Spencer told The Daily that according to Quebec law, the administrators of the sexual assault case are “unable to tell the survivor what the result of an inquiry was or what sanctions if any were put in place for confidentiality reasons”. Spencer mentioned that the survivor ultimately does not know if the “case was treated fairly or if they are safe from this person on campus”.
Bill 151 does not aim to ban these sexual relationships between students and teachers. Instead, it aims to delineate more specific and concrete approaches to processing accounts of sexual assault. Associate provost of McGill, Angela Campbell, wrote in a statement that “the definition of consent in the policy against sexual violence states that consent cannot occur ‘where the sexual activity has been induced by conduct that constitutes an abuse of a relationship of trust, power or authority, such as the relationship between a professor and their student.’” Section 4.1 of Bill 151, which defines the concept of consent, is the only mention of student-professor relationships in the policy. The approach of processing accounts of sexual assault when it involves a student-teacher relationship are only one of the elements Bill 151 fails to address in great depth.
“The definition of consent in the policy against sexual violence states that consent cannot occur ‘where the sexual activity has been induced by conduct that constitutes an abuse of a relationship of trust, power or authority, such as the relationship between a professor and their student.’”
Sophia Sahrane, the Research and Education Coordinator of AVEQ, says that two of AVEQ’s main issues with Bill 151 include the suggestion of police as an external resource under Chapter II, Art. V of Bill 151 as well as the complete disregard for the diversity of sexual assault experiences based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability.
On the issue of police intervention Sahrane stated, “we [AVEQ] believe that police have no place in university” and that the “policing of already marginalized bodies” should indicate the ineffectiveness of using police as an instrument to aid sexual assault survivors. Groups such as Concordia University’s Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) and Le Regroupement Québécois des Centres d’aide (RQCALCS) accompany students to the police; however, although it is important to spread support for sexual assault survivors beyond the scope of their institution, Sahrane reiterates that “not everyone has the privilege of trusting the police.” In a press release by AVEQ, Sophia Sahrane writes that “as long as there is racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and mistreatment of the Quebec population and Indigenous people by the police, AVEQ opposes the active participation of the police force in preventing and fighting sexual violence in our universities.”
Before the passing of the bill, consultations with larger groups such as SSMU and AVEQ were held, yet groups representing the voices of marginalized peoples and minority groups were not included in the discussion.
Another element disadvantaging students, especially those attending educational institutions affiliated with the University of Quebec system, is the lack of adequate funding for sexual assault support groups and programs. For example, at l’ Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, there is only one social worker for the whole university because the administration did not replace the only other staff member on leave. This instance of a gross understaffing of professionals with proper training to fully support survivors is not a rare one in Quebec educational institutions. Sophia Sahrane emphasized that this inadequate level of funding necessitates the existence of a “minimum of resources all across the universities in Quebec that must be offered to students”.
Sahrane told the Daily, “the Bill presented sexual violence as a very singular, non-dimensional issue, which it’s not.”

Services accused of being unable to meet students’ needs
Content warning: mental health, mentions of suicide
It was announced in December that Ollivier Dyens’ will not pursue a second term as McGill University’s Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning. After his now-infamous “hygiene de vie” comments, there has been renewed interest in the state of mental health care on campus, which up until now had seemingly taken a backseat to other controversies on campus.
Of note is the conversation surrounding McGill’s implementation of the “stepped care model,” a “two doors, one service” system wherein students can visit the university’s Counselling and Psychiatric Services after being “processed by a single combined system” meant to appraise their needs.
Many have criticized the reorganization of McGill’s mental health services, amongst them Norman Hoffman, a Montreal-based psychiatrist and former Director of McGill Mental Health Services from 1992 to 2007. In an interview with the Daily, Hoffman talked about recent changes in McGill Mental Health, comparing the “stepped care model” reforms to the way the service was previously organized when he was the Director.
While the stepped care system was created with the aim of eliminating waitlist times, Hoffman says the older system demonstrated a steady and sustained increase in the number of students treated, and the new triage-based system of the stepped care model can fail to do so by referring students to non-clinical resources, such as counselling and online support programmes.
“Between the years of 1998 to [19]99, and 2006 to 2007, McGill Mental Health had a 300 per cent increase in the number of students seen,” Hoffman explained. “We went from 800 students a year to 2,400 students a year over a nine-year period, and during that period […] everybody was seen one to one [and] expert level psychotherapy was the primary treatment. Medication was used only when necessary.”
Hoffman emphasized that 85 per cent of the time, the first psychiatrist a student saw continued the student’s treatment.
“We did not have a triage system, it was direct to care services. You called up, you got an appointment with a psychiatrist. When our waiting list built [to] more than two weeks […] when we had usually more than 25 people on the waiting list, we had a [weekly] team meeting […] where we discussed clinical care, [so] when our waiting list built up to more than 20 to 25 people […] we would cancel our team meeting and have what I called a flying triage. […] If we had 18 people working on staff, we would book in 18 people.”
“When our waiting list built up to more than 20 to 25 people […] we would cancel our team meeting and have what I called a flying triage. […] If we had 18 people working on staff, we would book in 18 people.”
However, not everyone feels the same way Hoffman does. The University has stood by the stepped-care model to this day, believing it to present students with a more straightforward approach to mental health, in which they don’t have to worry about where specifically they have to go to receive treatment.
The Daily spoke with Susan*, one student who has experienced both the stepped care model at McGill and the previous organizational scheme, and asked how she felt about the reorganization.
“My personal experience [with the stepped care model] has been relatively positive and I have found that since having the stepped care program, it’s been easier to get appointments. There’s less of a wait,” she continued, although she admitted that her being in the system prior to the transition might have helped her.
Susan has explained how prior to the stepped care model, the process of booking appointments was rigorous and required students to immediately book an appointment in the same month they had reached out.
“Recently [with the stepped care model, students] didn’t have to book an appointment in a certain month, and then everybody has to kind of quickly call in that first month,” she elaborated. “That actually made me stop calling in and I became very unwell because I would miss an appointment, and I wouldn’t be able to make another one, and there was such a huge waiting list that if I was in crisis, waiting three weeks to a month if not longer, that was just simply too long.”
Susan also praised the supplemental tools that the stepped care model have instituted, including Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) and the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) program, which consists of group sessions led by a staff member of McGill’s CHMS and a student, with eight to ten students in each group. However, she agrees with concerns though that such supplemental resources should be accompanied by more concrete access to counselling.
“I think it’s more effective as a supplemental tool,” she began. “I think if you need to wait for a clinician, as least the TAO can be useful because it goes into why you experience the symptoms the way you do and it allows your clinician to read the responses, and have a really good idea of where you’re coming from, so you’re not starting from base.”
“Definitely individually, it’s not going to solve your crisis,” she clarified, “but pairing that with action-based programs like WRAP or a therapist, I see it as a very useful tool.”
However, the implementation of the stepped-care model still raises question about the extent to which the administration has its hand in access to treatment. “With the creation of the office of the Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning,” said Hoffman, “McGill took away administrative and financial responsibilities from the director of Mental Health.”
“With the creation of the office of the Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning, […] McGill took away administrative and financial responsibilities from the director of Mental Health.”
Touching on how the work environment at McGill Mental Health Services has changed since the reforms, Hoffman mentioned the palpable effects such an atmosphere could have on the quality of treatment: according to Hoffman, a tense working environment at McGill Mental Health promotes a stressful working culture, which undermines the quality of the treatment.
“One person who still works at Mental Health now calls the atmosphere within student services ‘paranoid.’ Everybody is […] frightened to talk,” said Hoffman. “People were told after they fired Nancy Low last year, […] ‘Nobody has the right to object to anything that we do. You object to anything, you’re out.’”
“One person who still works at Mental Health now calls the atmosphere within student services ‘paranoid.’ Everybody is […] frightened to talk,”
Last year, Nancy Low, the former Director of McGill’s CHMS was suspended, apparently for insubordination. A representative for the administration told The Daily then that “the University cannot comment on the personnel dossiers of employment records of any of its staff members,” so much remains unclear about how the reorganization of CHMS has impacted access to treatment.
According to Hoffman, the administration’s involvement in Mental Health services is the initial cause of apparent tension in the department.
McGill however still touts ever-increasing numbers of students seen each year of the program’s effectiveness. Many have pointed to the difference between students seen and students treated as reason for this not being conclusive however.
Many questions remain unanswered regarding the implementation of the stepped care model; Susan feels that the implementation meets the needs of students requiring immediate attention, but might overlook those with ‘less-serious’ need for treatment.
“If you’re having a severe crisis, [the stepped care model] is getting the help that you need quicker, but I think for milder cases, it’s maybe more difficult,” she explained, “especially during crunch times [midterms or finals]. They should remind students who are likely to experience it to get into the system quicker so you don’t have to wait so long.”

On January 19, Elections SSMU announced the results of the recent online vote to ratify the nominations to SSMU’s Board of Directors (BoD): with a turnout of roughly 18 per cent of voting members, 23.5 per cent of whom abstained, the list of nominees was approved with 2524 (84.5 per cent) in favour and 463 (15.5 per cent) against.
The vote marks the conclusion of a months-long controversy over the BoD’s membership, which began at the 2017 Fall General Assembly (GA) on October 23. While BoD nominations are generally presented for ratification as a bloc, three students at the Fall GA, including VP Internal Maya Koparkar, brought forward motions to split the vote. This, they argued, would promote a more democratic process by allowing students a greater of freedom of choice. After consulting the Chief Justice of SSMU’s Judicial Board (JBoard), then-Speaker Jad El Tal allowed the splitting of the vote. All but three of the nominees – Noah Lew, Alex Scheffel, and Josephine Wright O’Manique – were then ratified.
In the aftermath of the GA, Jonathan Glustein, a member of last year’s BoD, brought a petition to the JBoard in which he argued that El Tal and Koparkar had violated the SSMU Constitution by allowing the splitting of the vote. After a public hearing on November 30, and weeks of deliberation, the JBoard announced on December 31 that they agreed with Glustein: “The Judicial Board believes that the Motion Regarding the Nomination of Directors for the Board of Directors should be voted on again at another General Assembly or as a Referendum question — this time, as a whole.”
After ratifying this decision at their first meeting of the year on January 14, the BoD decided to proceed with the latter option. The online ratification vote ran from January 15 to 18, and the new BoD will shortly be taking up office as SSMU’s highest governing body.

“Mental Health 101” facilitates conversation around mental health with professor Agiman 
As part of Mental Health Awareness Week at McGill, SSMU hosted an art therapy workshop entitled “Mental Health Awareness 101” on Thursday January 17. The two-hour workshop, which aimed to foster conversation around mental health on campus, began with an introduction from Denise Agiman, a theater professor at McGill, who introduced participants to Creative Art Therapy (CAT), a practice which allows for therapeutic self expression through visual arts, theater, music, and dance.
Participants took part in various arts-based exercises and drama therapy, during which Agiman explained that, based on Jungian theories, the goal of CAT was to enable freedom of expression through the arts, for traditional psychological therapy may be daunting for people struggling to put words to feelings. CAT thus ostensibly uses the arts as a mediator between patients and therapists. Agiman described a “distance effect,” where participants believe what they do is detached from them, but they are in fact projecting parts of themselves.
Agiman explained how, despite holding a PhD in theater, they enrolled in Concordia’s graduate drama therapy program in 2009 and graduated in 2013 with the will “to do something useful through theater.” Agiman now works at the Institut de Formation à l’Aide Communautaire à l’Enfant et à la Famille (IFACEF), the Community Assistance Institute for Children and Families, and at the Centre d’Art Thérapie Tealtro as an art therapist, drama therapist, and psychodrama therapist.
While some therapists are specialized in one branch of CAT, Agiman explained that they favour a more holistic approach, adapting prescribed exercises to each individual patient’s case. A typical CAT session lasts for about an hour, though the length varies according to the number of participants, and is typically divided into three parts.
Firstly, participants warm up for about 15 minutes, allowing them to “get rid of the outside world,” as Agiman puts it, in order to focus on the present moment. The second part, the main activity, lasts thirty minutes. This is the time during which issues are brought up through the chosen artistic practice.
The third and final part, called the closing, encourages patients to name emotions that came up in order to encourage awareness of what happened during the exercise. According to Agiman, the closing is the most important part of a session, as it enables people to cool down after an emotionally intense experience.
During the warm-up, the five participating students were encouraged to state their name, and an animal that corresponded best to their personality, and then justify their choice. Responses included cats, a giraffe, a dog, and a bird, and Agiman explained how each animal has distinct characteristics, which allows therapists to better understand their patients, supplemented with an insightful justification.
Warm-ups were followed by the “Six Parts Story,” an exercise from the arts branch of CAT: participants were instructed to divide a piece of paper into six parts, similarly to a comic book, and draw a story from their imagination. According to Agiman, such a metaphorical self projection enables a deeper insight, for while participants are in a “distance affect,” each element of the story reveals aspects of the participants’ personality.
Some therapists choose not to interpret the drawings, explained Agiman, but she believes it can accelerate the healing process for patients and increase the quality of her therapy.
Two exercises of drama therapy followed. The first activity paired participants. One of the group members were told to repeat the phrase “I want it”, while the other was instructed to continuously answer “You can’t have it.” Roles were then reversed and repeated, and after the exercise, students were encouraged to share their feelings with one another. The goal of the activity was to understand one’s reaction to a non-evolving argument, both in a position of control and submission, portrayed by the opposite phrases “You can’t have it”, and “I want it,” respectively.
The second exercise was called the “magic box.” Agiman asked participants to put an emotion or a feeling that they wanted to eliminate inside the box. Second, she asked them to take an emotion they wished to bring home. Participants specified various emotions from peace to confidence, which allowed the main activity to conclude on a positive note. The event finished with sharebacks of participants who evoked their experience of the workshop.
“It feels good to be able to discover things about yourself with people who are here for similar reasons.”
Ebby Crowe, SSMU’s Mental Health Commissioner and a participant in the workshop, spoke with The Daily and reported “as a creative person, [she] found it extremely helpful.”
“It feels good to be able to discover things about yourself with people who are here for similar reasons,” she explained.
Crowe hopes that workshops like Mental Health Awareness 101 can assist students who struggle with mental health issues, and who are otherwise unable to find adequate support and resources on campus.
“I hope that [former Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning] Dyens’ successor will be able to connect more with the lives of students and to bridge the gap between the administration and the student body” Crowe elaborated. “I hope that he or she listens to us [students] more. I believe that it is important to have creative outlets for students to express themselves in a non-judgemental manner.”

Demonstrations in Tunisia began on Sunday January after the government announced an increase in value-added tax and social contributions, while also increasing prices of consumer goods to cut their budget deficit. The austerity measures were made in response to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s call to the Tunisian government to take “urgent action and decisive measures” to reduce its deficit late 2016. Tunisia is currently in a four year loan program with the IMF tied to economic and social reforms worth around $2.8 billion. Protesters have taken to the streets to rally in at least 10 different areas.
January 7th was also the seventh anniversary of the the ousting of autocratic President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali, While the protests were started by the 2018 Finance Act, protesters argue that economic and social conditions since since Ben Ali’s deposition have not improved, prompting public discontent
The government accused demonstrators of sabotaging and setting fire to police cars, while other protesters tried to take over stores and blocked roads. Over 800 people had been arrested so far on suspicions of violence and vandalism, including young protesters aged 15 to 20Demonstrators accused police of a violent crackdown. While the Tunisian Interior Ministry mentioned that 97 members of security force members have been injured as of January 14th, the statement failed to include how many protesters had been hurt.
In response to the protests, the Tunisian government is to increase welfare payments and support for poor families by 170 million Tunisian dinars, or $87.3 million CAD. Mohamed Trabelsi, minister of social affairs told reporters, “this will concern about 250,000 families.”
Current President Beji Caid Essebsi visited the Tunis district of Ettadhamen , opening a youth centre in the area. Youth in Ettadhamen have been in clash with the police since the anti-austerity protests. Eddebsi’s speech promised to address youth unemployment, which stands at more than 35% according to the UN International Labour Organization. “We feel for you, these are our families,” he said. “Be modest, your country does not have a lot of means.”
However, meeting adequate living conditions remain a concern as prices of basic goods such as food products are rising by more than 10% annually.

The violence that erupted over five months ago in the western Rakhine state of Myanmar, leading to the migration of over 650,000 ethnic Rohingya to Bangladesh, may finally have an end in sight as the Myanmar and Bangladesh governments have arranged for the return of these refugees to their homes.
Although the Rohingya have been heavily persecuted in Myanmar for decades, the current violence can be traced back to the state of emergency declared in Rakhine in 2012, which allowed military control in the province. Tensions between the military and the Rohingya resulted in Rohingya militants attacking government forces in August of 2017. In response, security forces launched an attack, described by the UN as ethnic cleansing, that killed over 6,000 in the first month alone. Many Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in response to the violence. However, in an agreement on Tuesday, January 15, Myanmar and Bangladesh provided details regarding the repatriation deal signed in November 2017. The repatriation of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh will begin as early as next week, and will be carried out over the next two years.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will be assisting Bangladesh and Myanmar with the repatriation process, but urges the governments to ensure the voluntary return of the Rohingya minority to their homes. International aid organizations such as Amnesty International have raised concerns about the repatriation, claiming that the return of the Rohingya is “premature” due to the “years of entrenched discrimination and abuse.” The organization stressed the importance of international protection for the Rohingya in the process, “the Rohingya have an absolute right to return to and reside in Myanmar, but there must be no rush to return people to a system of apartheid. Any forcible returns would be a violation of international law.”
One of the major challenges to repatriation is the lack of accountability within the Myanmar government. The incumbent State Chancellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has failed to condemn the violence against the Rohingya. Regarding the military-led ethnic cleansing, Suu Kyi has disputed the UN’s characterization of the violence.
In addition to the failure of the Myanmese leaders to address the persecution of the Rohingya people, the repatriation plan will result in them being transferred from refugee camps in Bangladesh to camps in Myanmar, as their homes were burned down when they were forced to flee. As a result, those who opt to return will effectively be living in a limbo state until the Myanmar government develops a concrete plan to relocate them.
At this critical juncture the government will have to develop additional social programs to integrate the Rohingya into Myanmese society to prevent the situation from deteriorating into violence once more.
