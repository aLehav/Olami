Kayle Towsley and Marina Chirchikova of the Indigenous Solidarity Collective discussed the ongoing struggle of the Innu people of the Natassinan, a territory located in Labrador and eastern Quebec, at a workshop Monday at QPIRG Concordia. The Innu have never signed a treaty ceding their lands to the Canadian government, though white settlement, mining companies, and the Canadian air force – which frequently conducts low-level flying exercises in the area – have gradually encroached upon much of their land.
Towsley and Chirchikova focused much of their presentation on the work of Innu elder and activist Elizabeth Penashue, who is currently resisting the construction of the Lower Churchill Dam. In the sixties, the construction of a similar dam – the Churchill Falls hydroelectric project – tremendously diminished the flow of the Churchill River, altered caribou migration patterns, and dramatically increased the levels of mercury found in the river’s fish.
Towsley said the government has coerced the Innu into living in small, sedentary communities in order “to exploit the resources that were found in Natassinan territory.”
Towsley cited the establishment of large-scale mining operations in the sixties, an ongoing process that has only accelerated since the mid-nineties when one of the world’s largest nickel reserves was found in the area.
“The process the government uses to allow settlers to establish mining sites in Natassinan really explains their relationship with the Innu,” said Towsley, adding that tracts of Crown land there can be obtained by prospectors simply by placing a pin on a map, filling out some forms, and paying a refundable $240 deposit.
In the past, said Chirchikova, Innu activists have resorted to such nonviolent strategies of protest as occupying foreign embassies, staging a lock-in at a local school, roadblocks, and forming human blockades on the Canadian air force’s runways.
“I think it’s important for us, as settlers, to approach this from the perspective of solidarity and not charity,” Chirchikova said.

Lack of appeals process, hasty deportations a growing trend in immigration policy
The number of deportations from Canada has increased by an unprecedented 50 per cent in the last decade. Statistics released by the federal government under the Access to Information Act earlier this month show that Canadian Border Services deported 12,732 individuals last year, up from 8,361 removals in 1999.
Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, criticized the federal government’s approach to refugee claimants.
“What we saw and heard was that there was an increase in the budget allocation to respond to the September 11 attacks and demands for new security measures. More money went for more detentions and removals,” said Dench. “They had more money and because of that they do more deportations.”
Dench also criticized the refugee application process, noting the inability of refugee claimants to appeal decisions made by the Immigration Board of Canada. The decision to accept or decline an application is currently made by a single decision-maker – something Dench viewed as a major flaw in the system.
“The problem in the refugee system, its failure, is that it doesn’t have an appeal [process] at the moment…. Canadians get an appeal on all manner of things – even parking tickets. But in the case of refugees, for those whose lives may be at stake, there is no appeal,” said Dench.
Last Thursday, a Montreal family of four was deported to the United States – where they face probable deportation to Bangladesh – after their final bid for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was refused by Immigration Canada late last month.
Ranjit Dey Roy, Ranta Ranni Dey Roy, and their two sons had arrived from Bangladesh in 2004 after fleeing persecution for their religious beliefs, but their application for refugee status was rejected the following year. Members of Parliament Lise Zarac and Thierry St-Cyr met with Minister of Immigration and Citizenhip Jason Kenney on Wednesday to request an emergency stay of deportation for the family but were unsuccessful.
The family received support from the Montreal Immigrant Workers Center and Hindu Association of Montreal during their stay in Quebec. Mostafa Henaway of the Montreal Immigrant Workers Center suggested that the family’s case was one of many that indicate the growing trend of hasty deportations.
“The fact that deportations are up by 50 per cent is very clear that the Conservative government has actually been making enforcement [of deportation] their major policy drive,” Henaway said, stating that the immigration officer who handled the Roy family case had overlooked the dangers the family might face in Bangladesh.
“The problem is that [the system] is so arbitrary…. There was not even a written decision as to why [the Roy family] were refused,” said Henaway.
“It is very clear that Canada is disregarding the actual safety of people’s lives, from 76 Tamil refugees off the coast of Vancouver, to the Mexican women who was killed [after she was deported]. These people are not in the few, they are in the many,” Henaway added.
Though Kenney declined to comment on the increase in the number of deportations, the federal government has suggested that the spike in deportations is a result of a rising number of refugee claims in Canada.
But statistics from the Immigration and Refugee Board suggest that the number of individuals seeking refugee status in Canada has dropped recently: 35,000 claims were received last year, significantly lower than the 44,000 claims in 2001, and the 39,000 claims in 2002.
Obiora Chinedu Okafor, a law professor at Osgoode Hall, commented that the federal government’s practices demonstrate that the enforcement of deportation orders is a growing priority.
Okafor also said that a growing focus on enforcement could easily overlook the risks faced by individual claimants.
“Anytime that you are enforcement-minded, mistakes are bound to happen,” said Okafor.
Individuals facing deportation can apply for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) which allows claimants to present new evidence of risks they may face if sent back to the home country.
Okafor felt, however, that the PRRA process was problematic. “It is not an appeal, just an assessment, done by immigration officers, not by someone who is independent,” he said.
Okafor also took issue with the Canadian government’s willingness to deport individuals to countries with shoddy human rights track records.
Most deported individuals are sent to the U.S. and Mexico, although hundreds have also been sent to countries known to violate human rights, such as China, Pakistan, Haiti, and Zimbabwe.
“It is shocking but in the past we have deported people to places where even immigration officers would not go to. If the place is not safe enough for Canadian officers to go to, then how can we deport people there? Even if they are convicted criminals, convicted criminals have rights,” said Okafor.

Power Shift summit and Fill the Hill rally target Canada’s role at December’s Copenhagen talks
OTTAWA– Over 1,000 young Canadians gathered in Ottawa last weekend to attend the largest youth summit on climate change in the nation’s history. Power Shift Canada was timed to coincide with the International Day of Climate Action, with over 5,200 demonstrations taking place in 181 countries.
The three-day summit featured workshops aimed at equipping students to build a successful climate movement. Participants joined prominent environmental activists to discuss environmental justice and climate policy, and attended a green job symposium. The events led up to a day of lobbying with members of Parliament.
Maggie Knight, a SSMU Environment Commissioner and the National Recruitment Coordinator for Power Shift, explained the need for Canada to adopt a better climate change policy in anticipation of the 15th annual Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15).
“Currently, Canada is an international laggard when it comes to climate change. Our nation is expected to be a major detractor from efforts to come to an agreement on international climate policy at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen this December,” said Knight. “We have yet to see meaningful climate policy that has science-based targets, which leaves Canada in a disgraceful position heading to the negotiations.”
On Saturday, summit participants joined forces with 2000 other environmental activists at the Fill the Hill climate change rally, to demand that the federal government establish more comprehensive climate change legislation. Events included a speech by Green Party leader Elizabeth May and a flash mob dance performed by Power Shift Canada participants. Demonstrators synchronized phone calls to Prime Minister Stephen Harper dialed by hundreds of cell phone-bearing protesters, ultimately disabling his office voicemail.
The conference brought together a diverse group of students from all provinces and territories. Nearly 100 McGill students took part in the event, and SSMU provided buses to transport 50 McGill students to and from Ottawa on the day of the demonstration.
Knight explained that “marginalized communities often bear the brunt of climate change. We worked hard to bring together youth from every province and territory – including many indigenous, northern, rural, and immigrant youth, as well as young workers and young parents.”
COP15 will take place in Copenhagen this December, with a G8 Leaders’ Summit planned for Huntsville, Ontario in July 2010. Both are key intergovernmental gatherings, where countries will have the opportunity to launch strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Canadian environmentalists have demanded the government pass Bill C-311, a bill for climate change accountability that would tie the federal government to science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions. It was hoped that the bill would pass in time for the climate change talks, but was delayed in the House of Commons on October 21.
McGill student Devon Willis, who will represent Canadian youth at the COP15 conference, commented on the importance of the bill.
“What we are asking is for the government to pass Bill C-311, and to be a progressive force at the UN Climate Change Summit to attain a fair, ambitious, and law-binding agreement.”
Last Monday afternoon, protesters disrupted the House of Commons during Question Period, chanting “Pass Bill C-311” and “When I say ‘climate’, you say ‘justice,’” from the public gallery. All 120 individuals in the gallery were removed, with six protesters detained.
Powershift organizers said the summit and rally mark the beginning of a nationwide action  on climate change. Rosa Kouri, the former director of the Sierra Youth Coalition and the founder of Sustainable McGill, said that, “[Power Shift] has catalyzed a powerful social movement to tackle global warming head on. Young people are ready for the clean energy economy. In fact, we are building it already.”
Hosted by the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition, Power Shift Canada is a part of an international youth climate movement that began in the United States in 2007. Since then, youth have participated in the similar summits in Australia and the United Kingdom.

First Filipino-Canadian symposium tries to bridge ivory tower and community activism
TORONTO – Friday, October 23 marked the first-ever national symposium for Filipino-Canadian scholars.
Academics drawn from across the humanities and social sciences came to the University of Toronto’s  (U of T) Ontario Institute for Studies in Education to discuss challenges facing Filipinos in Canada and their underrepresentation in public life despite being Canada’s fourth largest visible minority group.
“As far as I know there are only seven professors of Filipino descent across Canada,” said U of T professor Roland Sintos Coloma, symposium organizer and featured presenter.
The all-day symposium, entitled “Spectres of In/visibility: Filipina/o lives in Canada,” was organized by the Kritikal Kolektibo, a year-old research group of U of T faculty and graduate students. It featured nearly 20 presenters and performers.
As a first conversation for the Fil-Can academic community, the symposium covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, touching on political participation for migrants in Canada, representations of youth violence in the media, queer Filipino issues, and the role of the arts in community activism.  The Daily caught up with a few of the presenters and participants afterwards to further explore some of the points addressed at the symposium.
Filipino migration and Canadian economic interests
The first wave of Filipino migration to Canada began in the sixties.  Valerie Damasco, a U of T PhD student in the Department of Adult Education and Counselling Psychology, discussed the findings of her Masters research on Canadian recruitment of Filipino nurses during that time.  Her findings suggest Canada had a vested interest in recruiting Filipino health care professionals during the nursing shortage in the sixties.
Moreover, Damasco’s research supported the idea, echoed throughout the day’s presentations, that Canada’s economic needs drove Filipino migration to this country, not just the introduction of the point system or the political and economic crises in the Philippines
Yet coexistent with the need for Filipino labour were discriminatory practices that set barriers in their path once they got here – a paradoxical situation that reflects the conditions immigrants face today.
“The Ontario College of Nurses were very reluctant to bring over health care professionals from the Philippines,” Damasco explained. “They were more interested in bringing over nurses from Europe.”
Collective amnesia
There is a collective amnesia about the history of Filipino migration to Canada. When Damasco asked a spokesperson from the Ontario Nurse’s Association for information about the recruitment of health care professionals during the sixties, the representative replied that Filipino nurses didn’t enter the country until the eighties and nineties as domestic workers and personal support workers.
Coloma presented a paper discussing how Filipinos have been written out of Canadian history textbooks, grouped together with other Asian groups in ways that mask the conditions of Filipino life in Canada. He drew parallels between the current experience of Filipino women in the Live-in Caregiver Program and that of Black Caribbean women in the forties, fifties, and sixties, who also occupied domestic work and caregiver roles.
“If we can connect this to increasing numbers of Latinos and Caribbeans coming through temporary agricultural and service sector work, this starts disrupting certain ways we analyze race and multiculturalism in Canada,” Coloma said.
The Live-in Caregiver Program: scrap vs. review
Heated discussion followed the screening of Scrap the Live-in Caregiver Program, a documentary made by members of the Filipino-Canadian Youth Alliance, that shed light on internal divides within the community surrounding the LCP. The film documented the ripple effects that the exploitative nature of the program has for generations of Filipinos coming to Canada, including the periods of family separation involved, which contribute to young people’s difficulties integrating and high high school dropout rates.
Nora Angeles, a professor of Community and Regional Planning and Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of British Columbia, called for review and reform of the program rather than scrapping. “There are only so many doors to immigration into Canada.  If we close this door, will there be other ones open?”
Cecilia Diocson, founder of the Philippine Women’s Centre of Vancouver, countered that the program constitutes a form of modern-day slavery.
“People don’t openly ask: is it worth it?  Is the violence, is the abuse worth being able to send money to the Philippines to save their families… worth it in terms of being overworked and underpaid? … Some would say it isn’t worth it because ultimately it is about dehumanization – and others would say perhaps it’s not completely worth it, but what are the alternatives?” Coloma asked.
Toward engaged scholarship
Audience members at the symposium left thinking about how to bridge the gap between academia and the concerns of their communities.
Jennilee Austria, a school settlement worker in Rexdale-Etobicoke high schools, who focuses on helping Filipino newcomers, encouraged the academics present to support her students in the classroom, and to work with Filipino youth on a more case-specific basis.
Alex Felipe, who works with the Kapisanan Centre for Philippine Arts and Culture, as well as Migrante and Migrante Youth, thought there was a good deal of potential in Filipino-Canadian scholarship. He expressed the need for a stronger community presence at events like these, particularly reaching out to more live-in caregivers. “Academia, when it’s done well, speaks for the people.  It compiles the voices of the people in a manner that’s suitable for academics and scholars, but it’s still the voice of the people,” said Felipe.

Notice of motion submitted to SSMU to revoke club status
A motion to suspend Choose Life’s club status was deferred to the next SSMU Council meeting by Speaker Zach Newburgh when Council convened Wednesday. The motion, tabled by VP External Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan and Arts Senator Sarah Woolf, raised eyebrows at SSMU due to the ambiguous meaning of the word “suspension” in the council by laws.
In an effort to clarify the motion,  Arts rep Joël Pedneault and Woolf tabled a Notice of Motion for next Council which would “revoke” Choose Life’s club status rather than “suspend” it. According to the SSMU by-laws, a club must also be given a 14 day notice period before revocation of club status is considered by Council.
Due to last week’s Four Floors event in the Shatner building, SSMU Council had to bump up their usual Thursday meeting to Wednesday, which created a time conflict with the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS)  Council meeting.
While Pedneault and interim representative Connie Gagliardi caucused with SSMU, AUS VP External Marco Garofalo asked the AUS council to give its four representatives to SSMU – Pedneault, Gagliardi, himself, and the interim representative Jade Calver – a mandate on how to vote on the Choose Life motion in SSMU Council. Without Pedneault and Gagliardi present, and in spite of Calver’s vote against the motion, AUS Council approved a motion asking the four to vote against a suspension of Choose Life’s status.
Pedneault said it was “a little bit troubling” that he did not have a chance to discuss the motion in AUS Council. AUS Council will, however, have the opportunity to amend the motion when they meet on November 11 – one day ahead of the next SSMU Council meeting. Pedneault indicated that he would pursue this option, saying, “I will be in touch with people from AUS to see if we can revise this.”
According to VP Clubs and Services Sarah Olle, if the SSMU Choose Life motion passes, it will be the first time the sentence has been applied to a SSMU club.
After leaving AUS Council for SSMU Council, Garofalo tabled a motion to increase the visibility of the SSMU executive on campus. He pointed out that a similar motion to combat low voter turnout had recently expired, and accused the SSMU executive of being out of touch, “What we have here is a SSMU executive that doesn’t really know what the views of the students are.”
The motion proposed that the SSMU executives spend at least two hours outside of their offices every week, on campus, engaging with “disinterested and apathetic students.” It further stipulated that the executives should wear clothing identifying themselves as executives. An amendment was added later extending the terms to non-executive councillors.
VP Internal Alex Brown, one of the executives opposed to the motion, said, “I think you misunderstand our job: we all spend a lot of time talking to students…and a lot of them don’t care.” Brown added that she felt the measure was a “band-aid solution” to a much larger problem. After an almost hour-long debate, a slim majority voted down the motion.
A motion moved by Ronderos-Morgan was unanimously approved in Council to extend candidacy period during executive elections by two business days if only one candidate runs for a position. If a position remains acclaimed, the candidate’s name will still appear on the ballot to be voted on.
Ronderos-Morgan noted that four out of the six current executives were not even on the ballot of last year’s student elections, and that members of Council were disturbed by this trend.
VP University Affairs Rebecca Dooley and other councillors were critical of President Ivan Neilson for not ensuring that the October 21 SSMU General Assembly (GA) was better publicized, after it lost quorum four motions into debate. Referring to the executive’s three-day advertising blitz prior to the GA, Dooley said, “[This] is to me, and to a lot of students who expressed this to me, an unacceptable amount of time.”
Neilson responded by saying that his intention was to have the event fresh in the minds of students when the day came. He also criticized the councillors’ own attendance record, saying, “I don’t think there was enough of an effort.”
Council also passed a motion put forward by Olle to perform an audit of Shatner’s energy efficiency, following up on a similar motion approved in the GA. Olle suggested the audit be performed by BPR, a company that has done similar work for McGill sports facilities and libraries, including Redpath. The audit will likely target Shatner’s lighting, steam heating, cooling, and ventilation.
Olle projected the cost to SSMU will be $10,819, with Hydro-Québec contributing an additional $6,165 to cover the cost. She said the audit should bring down SSMU’s utility bill, which has been between $400,000 and $600,000 for the past 10 years.

Critics say government overlooks reality in “safe” countries
The Canadian government is preparing important changes to Canada’s refugee policy that critics fear may prevent people suffering persecution from seeking refuge in Canada.
“This is a broken system and it needs to be streamlined,” said the Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Jason Kenney, in a recent statement to the Commons Immigration Committee.
Kenney has repeatedly blamed “false refugees” and “bogus” claimants for overburdening the refugee claimant system, which faces a backlog of 61,000 cases awaiting decision.
Currently, all refugee claimants within Canada have the right to a hearing, presided over by one commissioner from the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). However, refugee claimants wait an average 18 months before their hearing, and some are left in limbo for up to 7 years before knowing their fate.
In order to weed out supposedly “false” refugees, Kenney has proposed favouring UN-approved refugees over refugee claimants in Canada.
In an interview with Embassy Magazine, Kenney alleged that “false” claimants in Canada are “clogging up our asylum system and delaying processing times for real victims of persecution.”
Janet Dench, the executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR), notes an alarming increase in cases of discrimination against refugee claimants within Canada.
“We have heard of many instances where refugees’ access to basic services has been compromised. People, believing that they are bogus claimants, refuse to offer them services,” Dench said.
De Sales Kouassi, a refugee claimant from Cote D’Ivoire, expressed concern about Kenney’s comments.
“The moment when we make such unfounded statements, we push the masses towards rejecting asylum claimants,” Kouassi said.
He added that such comments were irresponsible for a government minister to make.
“Calling people liars when you have no proof is a denouncement.”
Kenney has also speculated about fast-tracking refugee claimants from countries, notably democracies, where citizens are generally thought to be safe from persecution.
Critics charge that this proposal will further undermine Canada’s obligation to protect those fleeing from persecution by rushing these people through the evaluation process.
“We completely oppose any change to the system which will lead to discrimination of claimants based on their country of origin,” Dench said. “Women fleeing gender persecution and those seeking protection based on sexual orientation will be particularly affected by these changes.” Dench noted that such instances of persecution persist in otherwise relatively “safe” countries.
On July 14, the Conservative government imposed visas against citizens of Mexico and the Czech Republic, in an effort to stem refugee claims from countries deemed “safe.” The Harper government has targeted these countries as being major sources of “false” claims, although observers point toward the increasing drug-related violence in Mexico and numerous, well-documented cases of ethnic persecution against the Roma in the Czech Republic.
Sylvain Thibeault, coordinator of Projet Refuge, a temporary residence for refugee claimants in Montreal, fears that the visa requirement has seriously endangered the lives of genuine refugee claimants, who have been pre-emptively denied protection. He argues that IRB commissioners are more qualified to evaluate refugee claims than the minister, who acts on political biases.
“We have to trust those that represent expertise. Kenney represents immigration,” said Thibeault.
Evanivaldo Tinajero, a refugee claimant from Mexico, agreed that Kenney lacks understanding of the situation in Mexico.
“Arriving in Canada one week before the visa, I was one of the last refugee claimants from Mexico. The minister has never lived in Mexico and doesn’t understand the dangers from the government’s association with narco-trafficking,” Tinajero said.
Others point to the lack of staffing in the IRB as the primary source of the backlog. According to the CCR web site, “The current large backlog of claims is caused by the government’s failure to appoint sufficient Board members to make decisions. The government has thus created an incentive for people to make a claim in Canada in order to work here for a few years, even if they expect that their claim will eventually be refused.”
Critics have also expressed concern about another significant policy change implemented July 23. The “Safe Third Country Agreement,” which prohibits potential claimants arriving from the United States from entering Canada, was expanded to previously exempted citizens of countries such as Burundi, Haiti, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Thibeault notes that many of the refugee claimants who have received protection from Canada in the past had passed through the United States first, and that they will no longer be able to seek protection here.
This change has particularly affected francophones who would have sought asylum in Quebec. “Toronto is overflowing with claims, but here we had to close residences,” Thibeault said.
Thibeault explained that although it is often easier to access United States territory, because of language, it is harder for francophones to both make their claim effectively and integrate in the United States.

In a talk entitled “Colonial Canada 101,” members of Defenders of the Land, a cross-Canada network fighting for the rights of indigenous peoples, exposed the audience to the origins and manifestations of the injustice faced by indigenous peoples in Canada today.
Former Daily editor Martin Lukacs and Courtney Kirkby, activists who work in the Barriere Lake community five hours northwest of Montreal, led the workshop. They spoke on the existence of an alternate Canadian history to the one taught in schools, a history of malicious imperial agendas, and of repression of Native people by the Canadian government.
“One of the aims of the workshop is to help people to understand what the government’s role has been in propagating problems and not creating solutions,” explained Lukacs
A pattern brought up by Lukacs and Kirby during the workshop was the Canadian government’s systematic attempts to either repress Natives or assimilate them. They described how the Indian Act of 1876, which remains a part of the Constitution today, was designed to transform individual Natives into “wards of the state” with no Native-specific rights.
Lukacs referred to the Indian Act as “assimilation 2.0” and referred to the reservations it designated for Natives as “little factories for their demise.”
Kirkby and Lukacs explained how these patterns of oppression have continued into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
“Pierre Trudeau is supposed to have been a good prime minister,” said Lukacs, describing Trudeau’s reservations toward the 1969 White Paper that proposed the abolition of the Indian Act. “But he believed that since Natives faced discrimination, they should be assimilated.”
Kirkby brought the discussion back to Montreal when she announced the Barriere Lake community had received that morning notice that it would lose its right to internal governance and would be forced to hold monitored elections.
One of the most striking points during the workshop was that Canada continues to violate Native rights even though they are firmly established under Section 35 of the Constitution.
“The Canadian government is in violation of its own laws,” said Lukacs. “Section 35 is talked about as being a treasure chest or an empty box. The Canadian government wants it to be an empty box.”
Canada remains one of three countries, with the U.S. and New Zealand, which have not signed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Muslim community at centre of contentions over cultural diversity
Bill 16, which has already passed one vote in the Quebec National Assembly, has recently sparked a resurgent debate over reasonable accommodation. The bill is the legislative manifestation of the Bouchard-Taylor commission of 2007, which called on the government to encourage cultural diversity in the province.
Christiane Pelchat, chairperson of the provincial government’s advisory council on the status of women, reopened the debate when she said that in the pursuit of cultural diversity, the new legislation would strengthen religious freedoms but compromise the rights of women.
Pelchat was critical of the pending legislation for ignoring secular values. She suggested that Bill 16 be amended to give equality between men and women precedence over freedom of religion. She charged that Bill 16 would be “creating a hierarchy of rights [where] freedom of religion has priority over all other rights.”
The Parti Québécois, l’Action democratique du Québec (ADQ), and members of the Liberal party, such as provincial Immigration Minister Yolande James, voiced similar concerns.
Gada Mahrouse, of the Simone-de-Bouvoir Institute at Concordia University, is an expert on the topic of reasonable accommodation, and responded to Pelchet’s decision to reopen debate.
“It is obvious that the concern in Quebec is not with all religious practices, but very particularly Muslim practices. What Pelchat and the Conseil have been preoccupied with from the start is the veiled Muslim woman. Yet, if you were to ask women in Quebec who are practicing Muslims about what concerns them most, they would reply things like employment, poverty, violence…and racism that members of their community face.”
It is a “great example of feminism missing the mark…. It is an instance where feminism is inadvertently mobilized in ways that perpetuate racism.”
The French-language media has been vocal in questioning the actions of the Charest government. Moderate voices included Michel David from Le Devoir, who said that the absence of defined “secular values” in Bill 16 enabled the courts to shape the nature of reasonable accommodation.
Richard Martineau from Le Journal de Montréal offered a far more controversial opinion, stating that religious symbols have no place in public space.  He even asked Quebeckers to take matters into their own hands by refusing to be served by public employees wearing a hijab or burqa.
The president of the Muslim Council of Montreal, Salam Elmenyawi, spoke directly to the Journal columnist, saying that “Muslims in Quebec get abused by people like Martineau.”
“We have a serious problem in Quebec. How can you go ahead and vote for something like [Bill 16] when day in and day out people are exposed to anti-Muslim sentiments?” Elmenyawi said.
Elmenyawi said that since 2001, the Muslim community has been faced with “all kinds of problems,” which he thinks were at least partially resolved in the Bouchard-Taylor report.
“Bouchard-Taylor was reasonable for all parties involved, and I thought that was fair, and with all that debate, and now we are back where we started.”
The oft-cited Bouchard-Taylor report (produced by former McGill professor Charles Taylor) was commissioned by the provincial government in February 2007 to understand previous instances of insensitivity towards ethnic minorities, especially against the Islamic populations of Quebec.
In contrast to Elmenyawi’s views was a demand by the Liberal Canadian Muslim Congress, who recently asked the federal government to ban the burqa in Canada. They argue that the Koran does not require women to wear a burqa, and it is a disingenuous evocation of religious freedom.
Mahrouse also responded to Martineau’s column.
“Reports such as these succeed at perpetuating a moral panic about the loss of [Quebec] identity. It is important to bear in mind that the question of secularism that has become such a preoccupation in Quebec is part of a much larger phenomenon in the West since 9/11.”
McGill professor of Christian thought Douglas Farrow was questioned after his lecture at the Religion and the Public Sphere lecture series entitled “Ethics and Religious Cultures: Why the Fuss?”
When asked whether or not Pelchat’s concerns were justified, Darrow responded that “Yes I do actually.  Rights for human beings that are specific have to be rooted in some sense of what is human dignity, justice; the common good…. A certain belief will support a different conception of rights.”
Addressing Islam, Darrow said that “this particular religious view has particular implications for how you treat certain people, including women.”
Mahrouse described the complex nature of the debate, where progressive initiatives are not always what they seem.
“In many ways this debate is reminiscent of old-fashioned patriarchal citizenship projects that were overtly gendered and racialized, yet it is one that is paradoxically supported by feminist calls of equality and progress,” she said.

Members of No One Is Illegal spoke Wednesday afternoon at a session on First Nations solidarity activism, to discuss how the struggle of Native peoples can be supported from a no-borders perspective. In their presentations,  Jaggi Singh, Robyn Maynard, and Sareta Ahooja all discussed aspects of anti-capitalist resistance, decolonization, and anti-racism.
Singh began the presentation by explaining No One Is Illegal’s belief that the institution of national border protection represents an inherent system of violence and racism. He discussed various examples of border protection policies that result in the death or imprisonment of thousands of would-be immigrants all over the world, and asserted that all people deserve the right to migrate, resist displacement, and return to their lands of origin.
“Migration today is not just some arbitrary phenomenon; it’s the result of hundreds of years of colonialism and imperialism,” said Singh.
Maynard then focused the discussion more narrowly on Canada’s history of displacing, subjugating, and disenfranchising First Nations peoples. “It’s important that we see Canada as a settler state that came about as a result of genocide, theft, and warfare,” she said.
Maynard explained that status Indians were barred from voting in federal elections until 1960, and briefly discussed the federal government’s residential schools, which operated under a largely pro-assimilation mandate and were notoriously abusive toward their students.
“Colonialism isn’t over in Canada,” she said. “There’s still land being taken on a day-to-day basis.”
Ahooja expanded upon Maynard’s presentation by discussing the conditions faced by Mohawks living near the Canada-U.S. border, including the loss of their traditional lands, and a history of working as migrant laborers and steelworkers in urban centres across North America. She then launched into a discussion of the border dispute stemming from the arming of customs agents at the Mohawk reserve of Akwesasne.
“We have to get beyond the legalese of these struggles and focus instead on principles of humanity, as a part of the larger point of resisting global apartheid,” Ahooja said.

A conference was held Tuesday at McGill as part of Indigenous Solidarity Week, dealing with “Overcoming Canada’s colonial agenda.” Russell Diabo, a Mohawk policy analyst and editor of the First Nations Strategic Bulletin, spoke along with Kenneth Deer, activist and editor/publisher of the Eastern Door, an independent newspaper serving the Mohawk community of Kahnawake. Deer replaced Arthur Manuel, a spokesperson for the Indigenous Network on Economies and Trade (INET), who couldn’t attend because of a family emergency.
The speakers described the history of indigenous relations with the Canadian government and the international political community.
Reading from his newsletter “Canada’s War on First Nations,” Diabo discussed various legislation concerning indigenous people, amendments, and a list of treaties and agreements broken by the Canadian government.
He described Canadian policies as “a legal, political, and fiscal war on First Nations,” and stated that First Nations need to unite and organize in order to overcome their legal and economic disadvantages.
“First Nations need commitment, organization, and discipline,” said Diabo. “The situation is not new. It has been an ongoing problem.”
Deer opened by describing the history of First Nations in international politics, from Iroqouis relations with the League of Nations in 1923 and 1924 to the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People adopted in 2007. He also described the solidarity and shared difficulties of indigenous communities around the world.
“All indigenous people have been dispossessed,” said Deer. “We [don’t] speak the same language, but we have the same problems.”
Deer then articulated his personal feelings on Cornwall Island, a part of the Mohawk territory of Akwesasne located on the border of the U.S. and Canada, which was recently vacated by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) after residents protested the arming of CBSA agents at the customs checkpoint located on the island.
“In my opinion, Cornwall [Island] should be an independent Mohawk state,” said Deer. “[But Canada] won’t allow a single square inch of land to return back to the original owners.”
The panel briefly digressed as members of the Kahnawake community attending the conference questioned the panelists on whether they would join the community in blocking the passage of the Olympic Torch through Mohawk land.
“I would support the [Olympic] Torch coming through Kahnawake if it was on Mohawk terms, not Canada’s. If it was on Mohawk terms, it would be an exercise of our sovereignty,” Deer said.

Immigrant families relieved to gain greater access to English education
T  he Canadian Supreme Court has declared Quebec’s Bill 104, legislation passed in 2002 restricting students’ access to English-language public schools, as unconstitutional, and has given Quebec’s National Assembly one year to repeal the law. The ruling has been hailed as a victory for thousands of immigrant families in Quebec, who typically opt to have their children educated in English
Since Bill 104’s inception as an amendment to the Charter of the French Language, the legislation has stirred controversy.  The Quebec Court of Appeal first ruled that the law was unconstitutional in 2007. The ruling was then appealed in Canada’s Supreme Court by the Quebec government. The law prevents students who have undergone one year of instruction in private English schools from entering English public schools.
During the appeal, Montreal lawyer Brent Tyler represented 25 families struggling with the law.Despite the widespread description of Bill 104 as closing a “loophole,” Tyler said he did not agree with this perspective.  Instead he viewed the choice of parents to send their children to a public school after attending private school as an issue of constitutional freedom.
“The exercise of a constitutional right should never be considered a loophole,” Tyler said.  “It’s a question of giving proper priority to the constitution.”
Tyler maintained that many francophone parents also choose to send their children to English schools because the quality of bilingual education is better at these schools.  About a quarter of the families represented in his case were francophone, Tyler claimed.
“They want bilingual children, and the French school system is pitiful in teaching English as a second language,” Tyler said.
Enrolment in English schools has dropped in recent years.  Like Tyler, the Quebec English School Boards Association, which intervened in the Supreme Court case, believed that Bill 104 is responsible for this change.
The organization wrote an online press release stating that “Bill 104 eliminates access to English schools for at least 500 students per year – primarily in the greater Montreal region. Those students are essential to our system, and the consequential impact on the French school system would be very modest.”
One of the families represented by Tyler includes Montreal mother Audrey Smith, who moved to Canada from Jamaica around two decades ago. Smith believed that the system can be fixed only if both English and French are taught equally.
“You think you’re coming to Canada, and Canada is bilingual. I figured it would be predominantly French here, but that English would be spoken and learnt by all, so that you could function well in both,” Smith said. “It’s extremely easy to fix the situation…to have French Canadians learning English where they will be able to function in English and have anglophones learning French to a point that they will function.”
While Quebec has been busy debating its language laws, the province’s demographics have also rapidly changed.  Fewer Quebeckers speak English as a native language than French, but the number of allophones, those whose first language is neither French nor English, is rapidly rising.  75 per cent of recent immigrants, those who arrived between 2001 and 2006, are allophones.
Both Smith and President of the Quebec English School Boards Association Debbie Horrocks hope to be included in the process of determining what legislation might replace Bill 104.
“What a year is going to mean, I don’t know,” Horrocks said.  “We don’t have to be included in the process, but we have sent a letter to Premier Charest saying we want to be part of the discussion coming up with the new legislation.”

Group remains in CBSA detention in Vancouver
Seventy-six Sri Lankan Tamils who arrived in the port of Vancouver last month have begun the process of filing for refugee status, though they continue to be detained by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).
The passengers, all of whom are male, were apprehended on October 17 when their ship was seized by the coast guard and the navy. Canada’s Minister of Immigration and Citizenship, Jason Kenney, has stressed the importance of carefully screening the migrants for any connections to the blacklisted minority separatist organization the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE), and has stated that Canada needs to do “a much better job of shutting the back door of immigration for those who seek to abuse [the] asylum system.”
All of the passengers have obtained legal assistance with their refugee claims, often from the lawyers who had represented their relatives now living in Canada, or through Canadian Tamil community groups.
Sue Nathan of the Canadian Tamil Congress said that the men have fled Sri Lanka because of the government’s chronic mistreatment of the country’s Tamil population.
“The target group mainly was based around young men and women, especially young men,” Nathan said. “Living in Sri Lanka is almost like having a death warrant. They will, one way or the other, be persecuted by the Sri Lankan military and Sri Lankan government.”
Nathan cited reports that have emerged from the country that over a quarter of a million Tamils remain trapped in government-run internment camps following last spring’s spate of violence between the LTTE and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
The government’s recent seizure of power in the Tamil-dominated north of the country is widely seen as the peremptory end to a civil conflict that has killed as many as 100,000 people since it began in the seventies.
In recent months, greater numbers of displaced Tamils have attempted to seek asylum outside their native country; another boat of Tamil refugees arrived in Indonesia last month on the way to its intended destination of Australia, but both countries have refused to let the passengers ashore.
Since the arrival of the 76 Tamils in Vancouver, the Sri Lankan government has claimed that one of the passengers is affiliated with the LTTE. The man’s name was subsequently leaked to the press – a development Nathan was extremely displeased with.
“As a refugee you’re seeking asylum in a country because your life is in danger. His life, and also the lives of his family members, have been put in jeopardy, and if he is ever sent back to Sri Lanka I can definitely say that his death warrant has been issued,” Nathan said.
Lee Rankin, a Vancouver-based lawyer who has offered preliminary legal counsel to about 30 of the passengers, said that since the Tamil men have now been identified and their refugee claims are currently being processed, the government should not continue holding them.
“The government’s comments suggest that they are intending to take a hard line on this particular boatload of people,” Rankin said. “The ones that I’ve dealt with do not seem to be any different from any of the thousands of Tamils that come to Canada. They’re ethnic Tamils; they obviously feel vulnerable. I haven’t met any that said that they were in any way associated with the LTTE.”
Processing the refugee claimants before the immigration review board has been a slow process, and only a handful of them were brought before the board within 48 hours of their detention.
“They should be released in the ordinary course once their identities have been established, but we’re learning that the CBSA, on behalf of the Canadian government…are now bringing forward allegations that there’s security concerns with respect to them,” said Rainkin. “There’s no obvious reason to do this, other than the minister’s promise to get tough with this group of people. They’ve established their identity, and now they’re going to go after them on security grounds.”
Another passenger, a minor, was released from detention last week.
Canada has accepted 93 per cent of the Tamils who claimed refugee status in the past nine months,
Officials at the Ministry of Immigration and Citizenship, as well as the CBSA, declined to comment.

Kayle Towsley and Marina Chirchikova of the Indigenous Solidarity Collective discussed the ongoing struggle of the Innu people of the Natassinan, a territory located in Labrador and eastern Quebec, at a workshop Monday at QPIRG Concordia. The Innu have never signed a treaty ceding their lands to the Canadian government, though white settlement, mining companies, and the Canadian air force – which frequently conducts low-level flying exercises in the area – have gradually encroached upon much of their land.
Towsley and Chirchikova focused much of their presentation on the work of Innu elder and activist Elizabeth Penashue, who is currently resisting the construction of the Lower Churchill Dam. In the sixties, the construction of a similar dam – the Churchill Falls hydroelectric project – tremendously diminished the flow of the Churchill River, altered caribou migration patterns, and dramatically increased the levels of mercury found in the river’s fish.
Towsley said the government has coerced the Innu into living in small, sedentary communities in order “to exploit the resources that were found in Natassinan territory.”
Towsley cited the establishment of large-scale mining operations in the sixties, an ongoing process that has only accelerated since the mid-nineties when one of the world’s largest nickel reserves was found in the area.
“The process the government uses to allow settlers to establish mining sites in Natassinan really explains their relationship with the Innu,” said Towsley, adding that tracts of Crown land there can be obtained by prospectors simply by placing a pin on a map, filling out some forms, and paying a refundable $240 deposit.
In the past, said Chirchikova, Innu activists have resorted to such nonviolent strategies of protest as occupying foreign embassies, staging a lock-in at a local school, roadblocks, and forming human blockades on the Canadian air force’s runways.
“I think it’s important for us, as settlers, to approach this from the perspective of solidarity and not charity,” Chirchikova said.
