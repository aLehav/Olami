Services and resources for those in need
Homelessness in Montreal is an ongoing problem that has yet to be solved by either the city or provincial government. The recent news of a temporary change in hospitalization practices for the homeless shines light on this woeful inadequacy, and the need for a structural change in the way that that homelessness is addressed.
Montreal’s mayor, Denis Coderre, campaigned on homelessness, and his suggestions for structural change in treating homelessness show promise. They would include an agency encompassing various levels of government, as well as businesses, community, and health organizations – and an increase in spending on the issue.
At the moment, many community organizations in the city address the immediate and long-term needs of the homeless. Included in this list – which is non-exhaustive and does not include facilities with confidential addresses – are various facilities located in or close to the downtown area. Typical services offered by shelters and day centres, some of the most vital resources available to the homeless, include access to some form of social services, hot meals, clean clothes, and access to showers. Additional resources offered are noted on a case-by-case basis.

Temporary measures implemented in Montreal hospitals
The Montreal Health and Social Services Agency, a government agency overseeing Montreal’s health establishments, has introduced a change in the way homeless people with mental health issues are assigned to hospitals for treatment. Homeless people in Montreal requiring treatment will now be transported to the nearest hospital.
Introduced in early January, the new system replaces the previous rotational program, wherein Montreal hospitals would alternate taking in homeless people on a weekly basis.
According to the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency, the objective of the change is to provide better care for the patients. “We noticed that the homeless tend to always stay in the same sector,” explained Geneviève Bettez, spokesperson of the agency, in French. “So with this change, there is a good chance that they will be directed to the same establishments more frequently.”
“We believe that healthcare professionals will develop a better knowledge of each homeless person and of their file, which will improve the treatment of the patients,” Bettez told The Daily.
The decision, while only temporary, was imposed on the hospitals because of the weather conditions. “With the coming of the cold weather, the measure has been implemented early. […] It’s only in place until February, and then we’ll reevaluate it with our partners,” added Bettez.
The measure has been criticized by hospital officials at the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM). According to a CBC article from January 10, Paul Lespérance, the head of psychiatry at the CHUM, worries that the downtown Notre-Dame Hospital may become overcrowded. Lespérance noted that it will be admitting about 50 per cent of the patients.
The Old Brewery Mission, which provides emergency, transition, and housing services to the homeless population of Montreal, praised the move as a step in the right direction.
“I think, generally speaking, it’s a good move to do what they did. […] I think it’s much better to be able to get services as nearby as possible, because we are dealing with people who are coping with a crisis,” said Matthew Pierce, Director General of the Mission.
Pierce recognized that the concerns of overcrowding at the CHUM are valid. “I don’t think it’s going to be a massive influx of people, but I think if I were at the downtown hospital, I would be concerned,” he said.
The difficulties faced by homeless people in obtaining effective treatment are not limited to transportation. According to Pierce, homelessness carries a social stigma which impedes access to medical care.
“People are not comfortable with homeless people. When they’re in an emergency room in the hospital, they often don’t get the same treatment as other patients. They’re often treated very cursorily, very quickly, and not given the same kind of attention,” said Pierce.
“Often […] the homeless person is seen quickly, they’re given their prescription and pills […] they come to the front door of our shelter and sell [the pills] and then don’t go back next week. So it’s a complete waste of our dollars.”
Pierce pointed to the Old Brewery Mission’s current partnership with the CHUM for treating homeless people with mental health issues as an effective method of providing care. Under this pilot program, a psychiatrist, a psychiatric nurse, and a psychiatric social worker treat the patients at a ward allocated by the Mission.
“We have a partnership with the CHUM hospital system’s department of psychiatry, whereby homeless people with mental health disorders are dealt with inside our pavilions. […] We can make sure they live in a stable, peaceful and secure environment. We expect that the health outcomes, especially mental health outcomes, will be significantly accelerated, and we’re already seeing that, in fact.”
Pierce also highlighted the necessity of transitional measures to get homeless people out of shelter life. “The mission of the Old Brewery Mission is to end homelessness, not to manage homelessness,” he said. “We want to continue to evolve until we get it done.”

System has fewer Hall Directors but will cost around $32,000 extra
Correction appended January 20, 2014
McGill’s announcement that the University will be overhauling the model of Hall Directors at McGill Residences has been met with resistance from the floor fellow community. Currently, each residence has a part-time Hall Director, but the new model will see approximately four full-time Hall Directors hired to oversee McGill’s nine residence halls.
According to documents obtained by The Daily, Janice Johnson, Managing Director, Residence Life and Customer Relations, and the residence staff behind this decision are looking to hire people with degrees in areas such as counselling or social work, and who have professional experience within the residence environment.
Due to its size, New Residence Hall (NRH) has had a full-time Hall Director since the 2012-13 academic year. A current floor fellow at NRH, Allen Scholl, told The Daily in an email, “I sincerely believe that the changes to be made in the new system of Hall Directors are being set in place to improve the job of the Hall Director.”
There will also be new part-time Faculty-Mentors-in-Rez positions in each hall, and according to Johnson, it would be a bonus if current Hall Directors took the position; however, the value of these positions is a point of contention.
“It’s a position created so that the [administration] can say ‘Here’s a job – they can take it if they want it. If they leave then it’s their choice,’” said a Carrefour Sherbrooke floor fellow who wished to remain anonymous to The Daily.
This year, a pilot project saw one full-time Hall Director responsible for three residences: Royal Victoria College (RVC), Carrefour Sherbrooke, and Varcity515. However, floor fellows under this new pilot project told The Daily that the model was implemented permanently without any consultation.
According to the Carrefour Sherbrooke floor fellow, quoted above, who works under the project, floor fellows felt betrayed. “The head of residences announced that [the new model] is what they’re going to do for everyone next year, and we had never been asked how it was going or what it was like.”
These sentiments were echoed by Jessica Coon, current part-time Hall Director of Solin Hall. “I do not think there was much in the way of consultation process, and I know many of the floor fellows are upset about this,” Coon said in an email to The Daily.
In an interview with The Daily, Johnson stated that the idea of installing full-time Directors was common practice at other universities, and had been considered at McGill for a while.
Unlike many decisions made at McGill, the changes to the Hall Director model were not motivated by budget cuts. According to Johnson, the new model will cost around $32,000 more – even though it will cut down on the number of Directors – but that the budget was balanced with savings elsewhere.
Johnson pointed to difficulties with finding applicants for part-time positions as part of the reason behind the shift.
“I don’t think [the current model] is necessarily unsustainable exactly at this moment, but I think we’re at risk of being unsustainable,” said Johnson. “Before things reach a crisis point, or a Hall Director burns out, it seemed like a good idea to be proactive. Coming in as new leadership is a good time to make change.”
Floor fellows criticized the reasoning given by Johnson for the changes. “How does [the administration] know that current faculty members and Hall Directors can’t handle their positions? There’s this talk of impending crisis, which is such a scare tactic,” argued Erin Sobat, former president of Douglas Hall Residence Council.
In an informal floor fellow meeting on January 15, RVC floor fellow Sean Reginio argued that other options should have been considered before replacing the current Directors. “They addressed the issue of hiring Directors by changing the model, instead of changing the recruitment [process].”
“During my time as a floor fellow I dealt with multiple severe crisis situations that required immediate help of a Director, sometimes in the middle of the night. These were literally life and death situations, and if my Director had not lived in the same building, I do not think the situations could have turned out as positively as they did,” said a former floor fellow of three years, who wished to remain anonymous, in an email to The Daily.
Floor fellows also expressed concern that the full-time Directors may be inclined to side with administration. “Whenever we complained about administration stuff this year, [the current Director] defended it to us… because it’s [the Director’s] full-time job, they’re now someone who mediates concern as opposed to someone who brings concerns from the bottom up,” the Carrefour floor fellow told The Daily.
According to Sobat, resistance from floor fellows was expected by administration. “Current Hall Directors were told in a staff meeting in November to deal with resistance from floor fellows, and basically asked to do damage control. They know it’s not going to be popular,” said Sobat.
At the January 15 meeting, a floor fellow – who wished to remain anonymous – said that the relationship between the Hall Director and the floor fellows requires open communication, and that it would be difficult to maintain that with 17 people.
Although some of the floor fellows expressed concern over a shift away from the harm reduction system currently in place – where non-judgemental support is encouraged – Johnson told The Daily that there was no interest in moving away from that model. “I will swear to anyone who wants me to swear – I do not intend to go down the road of writing tickets and busting people all the time.”
According to Johnson, a working group dedicated to deciding the specifics of the new Hall Director model will be calling for input from the McGill community in the next week. For many, this call for feedback is too little, too late.
“A big issue that I’ve had with this is how untransparent this entire process has been and how no floor fellow or Hall Director has been consulted in this decision,” said Courtney Ayukawa, a floor fellow at RVC. “I think that this [will set a precedent], so in the future, if residences want to make other changes as well, they feel less obligated to make things transparent or consultative.”

In an earlier version of the article, The Daily referred to Allen Scholl as Allen School. In addition, The Daily referred to Scholl as a Hall Director; in fact, Scholl is a floor fellow at New Residence Hall. The Daily regrets the errors.

Provost calls graduate supervision “single most important” campus issue
McGill’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its first Council meeting of the new year this past Wednesday, with a visit from the Provost and electoral reform at the top of the agenda.
Provost Anthony Masi – whose position encompasses roles as both chief academic officer and chief budget officer of the University – made a guest appearance, and took the opportunity to take questions from graduate students and outline McGill’s strategic vision for the next few years.
One question aimed to determine if McGill was going to take any action to improve the state of graduate student supervision.
“Supervision is the single most important issue on campus,” said Masi, indicating that the data from anonymous surveys of graduate students signals that improving the quality of graduate supervision is a standout issue.
The University has begun its campaign to improve supervision with a new webpage that states the roles and responsibilities of a supervising professor and provides resources on interaction with supervisees and “recognizing student diversity.”
“This list of skill sets will be later included in staff training days,” said Masi, adding that “most of the time, professors forget that they were once graduate students too.”
His presentation, meanwhile, centred on the University’s actions regarding recent budget cuts and allocations – cuts that have, among other outcomes, closed down libraries and resulted in incentivized retirement programs for staff.
Outlining the finances of the University, Masi said, “Over the last two years, we’ve added $30 million in deficit to our operating budget. But we have to pay that deficit back in five years, which means that we have to balance our books, and $5 million a year has to be used to pay back that deficit.”
Masi also outlined the mentality underlying budget cuts.
“You have to make a decision about allocations based on your academic priorities,” Masi said. “Those priorities come out of Achieving Strategic Academic Priorities (ASAP), the University’s academic white paper.”
Moving on to McGill’s financial situation, the Provost focused on choices about budget allocation.
“What we’re asking all of the units to do is not to try to replicate what they were doing before [the cuts] but to make conscious choices,” Masi said. “Do we have to do everything we’re doing? Can we do the things that we are doing differently? How can we be more efficient in the way we work?”
PGSS also finalized the remainder of the rewriting of some electoral rules. This was part of an effort to resolve contradictions between the society’s practices and their activities manual.
According to PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney, “We wanted everything to be crystal clear so as to make sure that no one was doubting our legitimacy – we don’t want to appear to be an illegitimate students’ society.”
PGSS’ Chief Returning Officer (CRO) Colby Briggs confirmed that, “The intent of these changes was, by and large, to bring the Society’s Activities Manual in line with practical application.”
He added that a mechanism was added for the CRO to enforce electoral regulations by penalizing rule-breaking candidates through “financial or time-based incentives” (in other words, fines or volunteer hours), instead of disqualifying them.

Language issues, instability plague association
Four years after its inception, the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) faces the possibility of dissolution, with two of its key members questioning whether the Quebec student roundtable is still a worthwhile investment.
Sherbrooke’s graduate student association, the Regroupement des étudiants de maîtrise, de diplôme et de doctorat de l’Université de Sherbrooke (REMDUS) will hold a referendum to decide whether to disaffiliate from TaCEQ later this month. With REMDUS gone, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) will lose its main ally within TaCEQ, leaving SSMU VP External Samuel Harris to consider leaving the organization.
“It’s very unfortunate, but this is the way it’s been going,” Harris said. “We are now looking into the possibility of quitting because it looks like the organization is in the midst of falling apart.”
Robin Reid-Fraser, former VP External of SSMU, believes the problem lies in communication and coordination between the associations. “Communication was tricky,” she said. “Having every association clearly understand what’s going on at the other ones and what their interests and capabilities are was an ongoing challenge when I was involved.”
“McGill is an anglophone institution with a lot of students from outside of Quebec,” Reid-Fraser said. “There isn’t necessarily the same level of involvement and interest in provincial issues from our part.”
There have also been disagreements on a number of issues between SSMU and other members of TaCEQ, including a failed attempt by ÆLIÉS, Université Laval’s student association, to bring forward a motion against SSMU for not contributing its share of $40,000 toward a court case that TaCEQ is currently involved in.
“Myself and the rest of SSMU are very disappointed with ÆLIÉS for trying to bring forward a motion on something that never happened,” Harris said.
TaCEQ is presenting a counter-argument in an ongoing court case in Quebec’s Superior Court. The case challenges the Quebec Act of Respecting the Accreditation and Financing of Students’ Associations, which requires that every student in Quebec be a part of a student association.
According to Harris, SSMU has contributed $10,000. In addition, as a contingency measure, SSMU has reallocated unspent money from its TaCEQ budget.
The lack of English translations of the organization’s constitution as well as its website constituted other ongoing issues.
“It took an extremely long time to get an approval from other associations to get an English translation of the organization’s constitution and its website,” Harris said. “This was very frustrating and is mostly why REMDUS wanted to leave.”
However, Guillaume Fortin, TaCEQ’s Deputy Secretary-General for Communications and Internal Affairs, claims that they are in the process of acquiring the translations. “Translation of documents are on their way,” Fortin said, “We are waiting for a financial authorization from our board to proceed.”
Despite the aforementioned issues, Harris believes that TaCEQ hasn’t been a complete failure. “We are feeling good about the court case,” he said. “Assuming that it is successful, we will be protecting the existence of student associations. Furthermore, our relations with the government have improved greatly in the past year and a half.”
“TaCEQ, as a national student organization, has for [its] first mandate to give to SSMU and the other associations a national representation,” Fortin said. “Therefore, following discussions and decisions between the associations, we make sure that their interests are heard and known by the government of Quebec.”
“TaCEQ gives to the associations a decentralized structure that allows each one to have a lot of freedom,” Fortin said.
By leaving TaCEQ, SSMU would no longer be a part of any student association.
“I don’t believe that any of the existing national Quebec student associations suit the needs of SSMU members,” Harris said. “I would advocate building relationships from one individual association to another, as well as creating informal working groups that don’t have any bureaucracy or costs attached to them.”
Harris believes it is important for McGill to maintain relations with other student associations in Montreal.
“McGill is already perceived as a black sheep in the Quebec context,” he said. “That is why we need to make an extra effort to reach out to others.”
“Even if it doesn’t work out in the context of an official organization such as TaCEQ, ASSÉ, or FEUQ doesn’t mean that we can’t get involved in the Quebec higher education scene,” Harris said.
There will be no additional costs for SSMU to leave TaCEQ. However, according to Harris, it can’t be done overnight either. “We can’t just snap our fingers and that’s it,” he said. “There are a lot of bills to pay and legal responsibilities in regards to the board of governors and the TaCEQ corporation.”
There are no official rules regarding the decision making process for leaving TaCEQ. “There are a number of possibilities,” Harris said. “I would recommend a referendum. However, a council decision or a general assembly would do as well.”
“It sure would be a sad thing to have SSMU leave TaCEQ,” Fortin said. “They have been very helpful to our organization. It will be in the hands of the remaining student associations to decide what will happen next to TaCEQ.”
