Principal Heather Munroe-Blum began her tenure at McGill with a $350,000 base salary and a list of perks, along with other compensations, worth tens of thousands of dollars, as her 2002 contract reveals. The document, which details the conditions of Munroe-Blum’s 2003-2008 term, was obtained in full by The Daily last month.
Munroe-Blum’s salary and benefits were previously publicized, but details of the contract were largely kept out of the public eye. Her current salary stands at $369,250.
In Quebec, the salaries and benefits of senior administrators are filed annually with the provincial Ministry, and full contract details are available through Access to Information requests. Based on documents acquired from the National Assembly, both the Journal de Montréal and Maclean’s OnCampus have published figures stating that Munroe-Blum’s benefits are worth more than $229,000 a year.
The contract states that the base salary figure has the potential to increase annually as per review by the Human Resources Committee, a committee of the McGill Board of Governors. Munroe-Blum sits on the Human Resources Committee, except when it is reviewing her own salary – eight other members of the Board compose the remainder of the group. None of the current voting members on the Board began their terms before Munroe-Blum assumed her position in 2003.
In addition to the University’s standard holidays and five weeks of paid vacation, Munroe-Blum is permitted to spend up to 20 per cent of her time engaged in “remunerated professional commitments outside the University.”
Munroe-Blum also accrues the right to administrative leave of one year after she serves a five year term. On administrative leave, she would receive a full salary equal to what she was paid in the final year of her term. Munroe-Blum did not exercise this right at the end of her first term, and the contract states she would discuss “the postponement of the administrative leave and…whether there ought to be any further accrual of administrative leave during the second term.”
Other benefits include a monthly housing allowance of $4,000, annual automobile allowance of $16,000, and annual maximum of $3,000 in personal financial planning services. McGill also foots the bill for travel expenses, club expenses, and expenses related to the hosting of receptions and events at the Principal’s residence.
Joël Pedneault, SSMU VP External, spoke about his surprise at the provision for club memberships, which he pointed to as a “concrete example of where the lines are blurred between Munroe-Blum’s role as the University Principal and her role as a member of the elite in Canada.” He added that Munroe-Blum is on many corporate boards and, that, last June, she was appointed to the Royal Bank of Canada’s Board of Directors.
When Concordia Interim President Frederick Lowy assumed his position in February 2011 following the surprise resignation of his predecessor Judith Woodsworth – who received a highly-publicized $703,500 severance package – the website of the office of the president featured his full contract. The site also posted an update to the document when an amendment was added in April.
Christina Mota, director of media relations at Concordia University, said that this action was a decision on the part of Lowy. “[Lowy] himself said that he wanted to have the details of his contract posted online,” she explained.
“He felt that it was important for the community to know what the contents of his contract were,” she added. Lowy’s contract is the first that Concordia has ever posted in full.
Vaughan Dowie, executive head of public affairs at McGill, explained in an email to The Daily that “different universities take different approaches to the provision of this information, bearing in mind privacy considerations and other factors.” He said that McGill has no plans to change their practices regarding distribution of salary information.
While Munroe-Blum’s salary and benefits are comparable to her counterparts at universities like Concordia and Université de Montréal, Pedneault noted the apparent lack of guidelines in the context for expenses. Lowy’s contract includes specifications, including the fact that his travel is Business Class, and that Concordia will pay for two club memberships. Munroe-Blum’s contract is more loosely worded, allowing for membership at “any clubs in Montreal where membership is related to…your duties at the University,” as well as “appropriate business clubs” outside of Montreal upon approval of Stuart Cobbett, Chair of the Board.
Munroe-Blum began her second term on January 1, 2009. Her 2002 contract states that it was the “mutual expectation of the Chair and you that this appointment will be renewed for a second five year term following a review.”

A longer winter break will debut this January, lasting from December 22, 2011 to January 9, 2012. Evening exams have been added to accommodate the longer break.
The decision for an extension started over two years ago with a proposal by then SSMU VP University Affairs Rebecca Dooley, who suggested a restructuring of the McGill academic calendar.
According to Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), a work group was started, headed by Daniel Juntas, Dean of Law, and Ellen Aitken, Dean of Religious Studies.
The student body wasn’t consulted until it received a survey last winter, which attempted to address problems about where the extra time would come from.
“There would have to be trade-offs in order for this to occur. We asked students about the trade-off, we asked about starting later, ending later, evening exams and exams on weekends,” Mendelson told The Daily.
The study concluded that students most favored a compressed exam schedule.  “The number of exam days will be reduced from twelve to ten, with exams on Monday and Thursday evenings to accommodate religious observances,” said Emily Yee Clare, SSMU VP University Affairs, in an interview with The Daily. “Fall and Winter exams will still end December 22 and April 30 respectively.”
“It was really done so all students could enjoy the extended winter break,” said Clare.
“Both students and professors concluded that an extended winter break would be the best. This way international students would have more time to go home, [and] professors could have more time for grading without having to cut down on the number of hours of teaching,” she continued.
According to Mendelson, it was an unusual move to change the academic calendar at such short notice.
“Typically we set the calendar 2-3 years ahead,” he said.
Both Mendelson and Clare confirmed that the extended winter break is on the academic calendar of dates for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 academic years, and will be a permanent move for the University.

Changes aim to accommodate local community and students
This year’s Frosh, now known to coordinators and the McGill administration as Integrated Orientation Week, has been altered in terms of the organization of the event and its activities. Notable changes include the beer tent charging $2.50 a beer, black Frosh shirts – chosen to render writing on the shirts less visible – and the banning of McGill chants in public places.
Jana Luker, Executive Director of Student Services, said that the idea for the changes began two years ago. Luker collaborated with a student working group last year to get feedback on what students and the Milton-Parc community thought about Frosh. Consultations took the form of focus groups and surveys conducted by the working group.
Luker explained that, through consultations, the local Milton-Parc community expressed concerns about the chants and inappropriate writing on Frosh t-shirts. Luker also pointed to alcohol as a reoccurring concern during consultations. She said that students who were not drinking alcohol at Frosh often expressed worries that they were subsidizing alcohol while others were drinking for free.
“We’ve got about 30 per cent of students who don’t drink or are underage, or both, during Frosh itself,” Luker said. “Then it became more of an equity issue.”
Despite the consultations, Josh Redel, president of the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), said EUS was not included in the process and had yet to see the findings of the working group.
“These changes are not cooperative,” he said. “I would like to see really what people are saying. It would be nice to see and be part of [the consultation process].”
Redel also said the administration didn’t like Frosh “in the sense that it’s an all-drinking event, and that’s how it’s perceived from outside.”
“That’s not part of what they want their image to be,” he said.
Redel noted that the administration is “not necessarily wrong” about being concerned over the external perception of Frosh and the emphasis on drinking, but that “they’re going about it way too late, and they’re doing a pretty bad job at communicating.”
Redel said that Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (of Student Life and Learning) told Frosh coordinators that they needed to charge a fee for beer in August. He also said that Mendelson blocked Frosh coordinators’ ability to book spaces for Frosh on campus until they had signed an agreement to charge for beer.
“We have to bend over backwards to meet the thousand requirements of McGill, but there’s no reverse-accountability,” he said. “Who do we complain to if Morton Mendelson says you have to charge at the beer tent? Who holds him responsible that we can get in contact with who’s not already on his side?”
AUS President Jade Calver said that by the time AUS was alerted that they would have to charge for beer, Frosh tickets had already begun to be sold and it was not possible to adjust pricing. The ticket pricing had been originally set to cover the cost of the previously free beer tent.
“I think after this year it will give us a good idea of what to expect in revenues so that in the future then we can reduce admission prices for Frosh,” she said.
Aside from the changes made to the event itself, Luker explained that there were also efforts made by the Frosh working group to integrate the various faculty Froshes differently, so that all Frosh coordinators were working together. Redel thought that the new structure did not work well.
“The Froshes are different enough that it doesn’t always make sense to be working together,” he explained, citing Arts Frosh and its large size as something that other Froshes simply could not relate to.
Luker said the organizational changes were made so that Frosh would be an event “for students, by students, with the administration’s support.” Redel perceived the increased involvement of the administration differently.
“McGill wants to be organizing Frosh,” he said. “They want to be helping coordinate, making sure that it’s going in the direction that they want it – and there’s nothing wrong with that – but they have no idea how to organize an event like this.”
“It’s four months of organizing that we know how to do, and it’s a shame that they’re not tapping into that,” he continued.
Frosh is the first large event that faculty societies undertake, normally earning revenue from the event and increasing their society’s visibility on campus. Redel pointed to these aspects of Frosh as being important to the faculty societies, adding that potentially losing Frosh to the administration was a real and scary possibility.
“I don’t doubt that they would pull Frosh away from students. We’ve been told it’s serious enough,” he said. “This is the last year we have to show that we can deal with Frosh.”
Luker said eliminating Frosh as a student run event was not the goal of the working group. “How the students want it to be, that’s how we want it to be,” she said.
Redel stated that EUS needing to change its attitude when dealing with the McGill administration, saying that they are going to work on being ‘less complacent.’
‘We’re too concerned to step on people’s feet. We need to be more direct,’ he said. ‘We’re not OK with these changes…and it needs to be a cooperative effort. But we still need to work out what bargaining chips we have.’

FEUQ and FECQ camp out at Ministry of Education
From May 27 to August 12, two of Quebec’s largest student lobby groups pitched tents in front of the Montreal offices of the Quebec Ministry of Education in protest of planned university tuition hikes.
The Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ) and the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) budgeted and organized for the camping in order to continue mobilization and action against tuition hikes throughout the summer.
FEUQ president Martine Desjardins described the camping as a demonstration of the strength of student protesters and of their determination to fight tuition hikes.
Tuition has increased $100 a year since 2007. However, this year’s provincial budget, released last March, shows tuition fees increasing by $325 each year from 2012 to 2016. In total, by this date, tuition fees will have increased by 75 per cent as compared to today’s fees.
A CEGEP student at the Collège Ahuntsic, Marc-Olivier Goulet, said he was at the campsite almost every weekend. He described the experience as “awesome,” and said that he would do it again.
“We were trying something different. We’re not all about manifestations and strikes,” he said.
Goulet described a major event that took place at the beginning of the summer. The student federations rented a bulldozer, dressed a participant as Quebec Premier Jean Charest, and bulldozed over graduation caps. The hats had been filled with paint that stained the driveway outside of the Ministry.
The goal of the action was “to show that [Charest is] pretty much killing education,” Goulet explained.
Camping took place on weekends until the last week in August, when students stayed for the entire week. The weekend schedule was created in order to allow for students to participate in the camping action while maintaining other commitments, such as a summer job, explained Léo Bureau-Blouin, president of FECQ. Students would arrive late Friday mornings to pitch three tents that would house between 5 and 15 people throughout the weekend.
The campers did not receive any message or recognition from the Ministry of Education, and Goulet said that they had heard that employees working in the building had been instructed not to speak to them.
“The Ministry of Education isn’t listening to us,” Goulet said. “We’re really talking to a closed door.”
The Ministry did not respond to a request from The Daily for comment.
Benoit Springuel, an IT employee at the Centre de Services Partagés du Québec, which is housed in the same building as the Ministry of Education, said that for him the camp outside the building did not make an impact.
“You know that’s it’s the least expensive tuition in North America? You know that universities are lacking money? $325 each year…that is really not a difficulty,” he said.
Goulet explained, however, that increased tuition would make university education inaccessible for many students.
“I talked to people [from] Lac-Saint-Jean, and there’s no university there. They have to move, pay their apartment,” he said, “and they realize that if they add $1,625 to their bill as well, they won’t be able to pay it.”
Desjardins said FEUQ has evidence that Quebec student enrollment will decrease with higher tuition fees, saying, “There will be a massive dropout.”
The government outlined increased plans for financial aid in order to assist students with paying for education. However, Desjardins explained that a conditionality within the province’s financial aid system means that effects of tuition hikes are not isolated to students. Quebec’s financial aid program obligates families to make financial contributions towards their children’s education if parents earn over $30,000 a year.
“When you hike tuition fees, of course you will be raising student debt, but also family debt,” she said. “We still have to make a lot of progress to find a way to convince the general population that this is an issue that concerns a lot of people and not only students.”
Though the ultimate goal of the student movement is to freeze tuition fees, Desjardins said that the more immediate aim is to dissuade the government from planning more hikes.
FECQ and FEUQ said that raising awareness of the consequences of tuition hikes was one of the main goals of camping out. Desjardins described their work on public education and awareness as a “long-term process.”
CEGEP classes commenced two weeks ago, and both Goulet and Desjardins say that they have noticed a difference in terms of students’ awareness of the impending tuition increases.
“People are really listening to us; it’s not like last year where most of the [new students] didn’t even know about [tuition hikes]. This year, it seems like everyone knows about it and most of them know how much it will be and they know that it’s something they need to work against,” said Goulet.
Desjardins said that she feels the fight against tuition hikes will be one of the main issues during this academic year.
“A lot of students are well-informed about the tuition fee hike plan and they’re ready to [take] actions,” she said.
FEUQ has begun to plan for a demonstration in Montreal to be held on November 10.  The Facebook event had 2,583 attendees when The Daily went to press.

An alliance of 26 provincial organizations formed last week to lobby for increased government investment in public transit.
The alliance, named Transit, has pointed to the several major roadwork projects taking place over the next few years as making the need for improved public transit infrastructure more urgent.
Karel Mayrand, General Director for Quebec at the David Suzuki Foundation, a Vancouver-based environmental foundation, said public transit at its current capacity would not be able to accommodate the extra commuters seeking to avoid roadwork.
“We want to avoid a situation where transit is supposed to absorb extra pressure because the roads cannot take as many people as they can in a normal situation, and at the same time transit systems collapse too because we haven’t invested enough money to maintain the infrastructure,” said Mayrand.
“If that situation would happen in 2015, then we – definitely Montreal, but also the regions in Quebec – would be paralyzed, and commuters would be hostages of both a transit and a road system that are not reliable anymore,” he added.
Major renovation projects are scheduled to begin soon at the Champlain Bridge, Louis Hippolyte-Lafontaine tunnel and Ville-Marie expressway. The controversial multibillion dollar plan to repair the Turcot interchange is set to begin in 2013, and construction on the Mercier Bridge is already underway.
Caroline Larose, spokesperson for Transport Québec, said the projects were scheduled to minimize traffic disruption.
“We will make sure that work in St. Pierre will start after the completion of the Turcot. So the schedule is there,” she said.
According to Larose, several lanes on the Mercier Bridge are scheduled to open September 6, while other construction continues. She also noted examples of the provincial government investing in public transit infrastructure.
“We’ve got at least seven measures in public transit, and one of them is that we’re buying 50 buses [for Montreal, Longeuil and Laval],” said Larose.
She described improvements to train infrastructure, including more lines, better arrival frequency of trains on some lines, and more parking spaces at train stations.
“I think we’re getting there,” she said. “These are measures put together to reduce the impact of roadwork, so it’s specifically for that. But of course we keep on investing in public transit − that’s one of our priorities.”
Mayrand, however, said more investment in public transit is needed, and needed soon.
“Investments in transit are decreasing compared to what they are now,” he said. “We also know from the Transit Authority that the needs, just to maintain current infrastructures, are quite large. So we need now – not in two years – we need as early as 2012 to reinvest significant resources in transit.”
Mayrand pointed to the fifty year old Montreal metro stations as one example of transit infrastructure in need of investment. For him, the problem is that money is being spent on improving and expanding roads when it should be spent on transit.
“There are some infrastructures that are being refurbished and repaired,” said Mayrand. “Supposedly they are the same infrastructure, but they are increasing capacity, so that’s kind of equivalent to new roads.”
“I guess one way to frame it is just to say that we have a transportation crisis, and the only way to solve it is not to pour more money in concrete. It’s to pour more money and more investment in both roads and transit to strengthen the system as a whole, instead of dealing with each part separately” he continued.
Mayrand said more people have been using transit in recent years as a result of public investment, but also that such investment is planned to decrease in coming years as roads are repaired and expanded.
“Unfortunately there’s not enough money that’s planned for future re-investments as we go towards 2015,” he said.
“Supply drives demand here, and we need to make sure we’re offering the right supply for people to have options to make the most economic choices for them,” Mayrand continued. “But to offer the right choices so we don’t keep people alone in their cars, the way it is right now for most people, because that’s the way to ensure that we’re going to have traffic jams for the next generation.”

MBA tuition set to increase to $34,750
McGill administration reached an agreement with the Quebec Ministry of Education two weeks ago, permitting the university to charge almost $30,000 over the provincial tuition cap for the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program.
Beginning next year, McGill will make several changes to the program, giving it an international business emphasis that qualifies it as a specialized program under Quebec law. Specialized programs are allowed to set their own tuition.
McGill previously charged $2,069 per year for its MBA, the provincial limit for tuition. In September 2010, the university moved the program to a self-funded model and raised tuition to $29,500. Tuition was increased to $32,500 this year, and Peter Todd, Dean of the Faculty of Management, told the Daily in March that McGill intends to continue to raise tuition to the Canadian average of roughly $37,000. Tuition is scheduled to increase to $34,750 by fall of 2012.
Todd was unavailable for comment, but Don Melville, Director of the MBA and Masters programs for the Faculty of Management, said in an email to The Daily the changes were made “to reinforce the program’s strong international focus.”
According to Melville, McGill’s MBA program has already been recognized by the Financial Times as first in Canada in the international makeup of its professorial corps and the international mobility of its graduates.
The changes have ended a two year tête-a-tête with the provincial government that included a $2,011,719 fine in March for violating Quebec’s educational accessibility policy.
In an August 19 press release, Minister of Education Line Beauchamp said the changes to the program “considered the requirements I made known last spring.”
Accessibility still remains a concern for students. The Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), a provincial student lobbying group and the Post Graduate Student Society (PGSS) issued a joint statement denouncing the government’s decision the same day as Beauchamp’s press release.
“By accepting the privatization of the program, [Quebec Premier] Jean Charest set back Quebec fifty years, when it was the size of the portfolio and not the intellectual merits which determined access to university,” said FEUQ president Martine Desjardins. “We will not let him do it.”
Beauchamp said McGill was not an exception, “as other Quebec institutions already offer programs of a similar status.”
PGSS VP External Mariève Isabel said most Quebec universities also offer a public MBA program along with specialized programs.
“I do not know any other example in Quebec of a university offering only private MBAs,” said Isabel.
“[McGill] can have all the specialized MBAs they want,” she continued, “as long as they keep it accessible to students as well as in a public system. McGill is a public university, it’s not a private university, and we want it to stay that way.”
Pat Tenneriello, president of the MBA Student Association (MBASA), said he thinks the majority of MBA students support the tuition increases, and are in favor of the new changes.
“We welcome the fact that there is no longer uncertainty over the program and its fate. So I think on the whole we’re happy with this,” Tenneriello said.
“[McGill administration] are the ones who know what’s best for the program, and we welcome this decision by the government to let them run the program the way that they see fit,” he continued.
Tenneriello was disappointed, however, that the agreement did not resolve MBASA’s dispute with the provincial government, which withdrew financial aid grants from Quebec students in the program when tuition was first raised above provincial levels.
Melville said McGill is increasing its financial aid contribution to MBA students, including internal and external scholarships amounting to more than $12,000 in funding per student. Melville also said that more than 80 per cent of MBA students received a scholarship this past year.
“That’s helping us,” said Tenneriello, “but it doesn’t appear that there are bursaries based on financial merit. They’re mostly academic and experience-based scholarships. So there’s still no bursary to fill the void for financial aid, which is a void that should be filled by the government.”
Tenneriello said MBASA will be working with PGSS this year to help lobby the government to resume supplying grants for Quebec students. PGSS’ tuition policy calls for completely free tuition for all graduate students in all programs, but Isabel said they still plan to meet with MBASA in the coming weeks.
“What we can try to do is to find common ground,” said Isabel. “We want to work together with them.”
However, Isabel pointed out that the changes do not consider prospective students who are deterred from the program because of the self-funded model.
“A lot of [MBASA’s] students are in favor of the changes, so we do not want to oppose that if they are happy with the changes. We are not necessarily opposed to them having a more specialized program if they wish,” Isabel said.
“[But] all the students that have been excluded from registering to the program because of the cost would have something else to say about this raise,” she continued.
Tenneriello said that, from a student perspective, “there won’t be a whole lot of change.” For example, a ten-day international trip that is now mandatory was previously an optional part of the program.
“By being able to say McGill is an exception, [Quebec is] saving face and stopping other programs from doing the same. And McGill is a happy camper because they get to continue moving forward with the self-funded MBA model,” he said.

McGill’s non-academic workers picket for parity on first day of class
The McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) commenced a general strike at 6 a.m. this morning, the first day of classes for McGill students. MUNACA represents more than 1,700 workers, including library staff, lab technicians, and registration staff.
Over 200 McGill staff and students attended a rally outside the James Administration building yesterday. Members of MUNACA as well as the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), SSMU, and the Association of McGill Undergraduate Support Employees (AMUSE) were present.
Some MUNACA members expressed disappointment that there was not a strong faculty presence at the demonstration, as the pension plan cuts against which MUNACA protests affect all employees of McGill.
“[The administration] crossed the line when they started attacking the pension and benefit plans,” said Sean Devlin, a MUNACA member who has worked at the McGill bookstore for 22 years.
Devlin said that he believed the strike would be prolonged because McGill Principal “Heather [Munroe-Blum] is very stubborn…and probably won’t budge an inch.”
McGill and MUNACA have met 23 times since January to negotiate a new collective agreement, but with no progress made on MUNACA’s primary issues, members voted last week to provide their executive with a strike mandate.
MUNACA maintains that the details of their demands are parity with other universities. Currently, McGill’s proposal is an offer of a 1.2 per cent wage increase in reply to a demand for a 3 per cent increase, which MUNACA cites as the rise in cost of living over the past three years.
Another issue for MUNACA workers is the $1 million that McGill University cut from pension plans in January 2010. MUNACA is demanding protection for pensions so the administration cannot unilaterally implement changes to the pension plan, as well as restoration of damages made to pension and benefit plans.
“We just don’t feel we’re being respected,” said Suzanne Larivière, a student affairs coordinator and MUNACA member. Her comment echoed the sentiments of many of the members at the demonstration, some of whom carried faux severed limbs signifying they had sacrificed enough for the University.
In an email sent to McGill students and staff on Tuesday, Michael Di Grappa, VP Administration and Finance, claimed that agreement with MUNACA “can only be achieved within the context of the financial realities that challenge us. As you know, the University is already facing a substantial deficit this year as well as a significant accumulated debt. This financial situation is further aggravated by the recent additional turmoil in economic markets.”
Kevin Whittaker, president of MUNACA, addressed the demonstration and responded to Di Grappa’s argument. “We know that there are financial problems out there,” Whittaker said. “Unfortunately, the administration doesn’t seem to be suffering from them. We’re spending $2.1 million on one floor! If we’re in such dire need, then put that money to better use.”
The $2.1 million figure refers to renovations on the third floor of the James Administration building, a project that includes removal of asbestos and construction of new conference rooms. Slightly over $190,000 was necessary for asbestos tests and removal, according to the budget MUNACA received through an Access to Information request.
Whittaker also addressed the policy of 1 per cent annual automatic progression within respective salary scales. Under this system, it would take 37 years for workers to reach their pay ceiling. “I don’t want to die before I reach my top [salary]. And I don’t want any of you to die before you reach your tops,” Whittaker told the crowd.
Joël Pedneault, SSMU VP External, also spoke to the crowd, telling them that as students fight tuition increases and unions fight for their demands, “Our struggle and your struggle are the same struggle.”
As an affiliate of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), MUNACA has access to the PSAC strike fund, which enables full-time workers to receive compensation of up to $375 per week, provided they participate in strike activities.
According to the Quebec Labour Code, employers are prohibited from utilizing the services of MUNACA members, as well as from utilizing the services of another contractor to discharge the duties of a striking employee. A person or institution that violates this provision “is liable to a fine of not more than $1,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues.”
MUNACA has encouraged members to report to union headquarters if they suspect another worker is completing their duties.
The administration refused to comment further than an email from Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning). Mendelson stressed that academic expectations remain unchanged, and assured students that McGill would try to “minimize the strike’s impact” on them. Regular email and website updates from McGill will inform students of reduced hours or services.
AGSEM, which is also in negotiations with the University, wrote a letter declaring that the union is “in support and solidarity” with MUNACA, and encouraged members to avoid crossing picket lines.
“We’re advising members to absolutely not scab. If they’re asked to do any unusual workload or take over any of the duties of MUNACA members, to refuse, and contact us immediately, so we can take immediate action,” said Jonathan Mooney, a member of AGSEM’s bargaining team.
AGSEM also announced yesterday that they now represent McGill’s 1,300 course lecturers. The announcement came after an 18-month “UDrive,” a unionization drive for course lecturers. The addition of course lecturers means that AGSEM is “a bigger union, much more powerful, so we have greater solidarity,” said Lenora Lewis, AGSEM president.
Likewise, AMUSE informed members that, though the union is not on strike, it is supportive of MUNACA.
“Everything that affects MUNACA affects AMUSE and vice versa, because we’re both negotiating on the same campus with the same entity,” said AMUSE Labour Relations Officer David Howden.
AMUSE workers are advised to go to work and complete only tasks that they normally complete, taking care not to complete duties normally assigned to MUNACA members.
Farid Attar Rifai, president of AMUSE, added that “AMUSE workers have the choice not to cross the picket line at all.”
McGill cancelled a negotiation session with AMUSE on Wednesday, though the parties are scheduled to meet again September 6.

McGill secures two floors at Quality Hotel for 74 students and two floor fellows
Seventy-six McGill students will occupy two floors of the Quality Hotel this year, making it McGill’s newest “residence.”
Numbers have once again exceeded the capacity of the campus residence system, resulting in the university’s acquisition of two floors at the Quality Hotel at Parc and Sherbrooke.
The decision to add the space was made by McGill Housing in late June, when it became clear that residence capacity could not satisfy application demands.
“The first batch of students that found out they were going to the Quality Hotel found out the first week of August,” said Michael Porritt, executive director of Residences and Student Housing.
“[The decision] didn’t make a whole lot of people upset,” Porritt continued, “but it did catch them by surprise, just the same as when people first got assigned to Carrefour Sherbrooke the first year.”
The 74 students and two floor fellows will be living on the third and fourth floors of the hotel, and will be able to utilize resources at both New Residence Hall and Carrefour Sherbrooke.
Although the Quality Hotel is not equipped either with a cafeteria of its own or sizeable common rooms, students are being compensated with benefits exclusive to their residence. These include free wireless internet, a weekly cleaning service, free cable, garbage and recycling pickup, and a commuter meal plan which allows them to eat anywhere on campus.
Katia Fox, a McGill student and resident of the Quality Hotel, explained her initial reaction to finding out about her residence situation three weeks ago.
“First of all, I was thinking it’s kind of far – RVC would have been a lot closer – and the rooms are kind of small. As I’ve stayed here more its really nice though, its cozy, it’s homey, and it’s really not that far,” Fox said.
Hikati Semgoku, another Quality resident, said she “thought [the residence] was small, and it would be difficult to live in a hotel room, but now it feels like home because it’s a small community and people here are so nice.”
When asked if she had a problem living with other hotel guests in the building, Semgoku said, “I don’t think so – we just meet those people in the elevators.”
Residents of the Quality Hotel will be given full access to the facilities at New Residence Hall, and will be using their larger rooms for floor meetings, as well as joining the students there in larger events such as Rez Fest. Brenda Shanahan, the residence director of New Rez, will direct both residences.
The hotel will continue to be monitored by Quality Hotel staff, along with the assistance of McGill floor fellows Basil Kadoura and Erin Schwabe-Fry. Porritt explained that although McGill security is not currently involved with the facility, “that’s already worked into our agreement with the hotel – that we can add security as needed for special events.”
In reference to move-in weekend, Kadoura said that the group “didn’t have very many issues – it was really smooth. The students are all meeting each other and loving how small it is, how close everyone can get.”
Schwabe-Fry explained how students have been adjusting to the new residence community.
“It’s a totally new thing, so they’re very enthusiastic and taking the initiative to make their own community – we’ve been really impressed – but they’re still kind of mingling and reaching out to the larger residence communities that already exist,” Schwabe-Fry said. “They have existing models that they can base things off of, but this is its own space, its own group of kids.”
When asked whether the Quality Hotel facilities would be used again next year, Porritt  did not have a definite answer.
“Next fall, we’ll have about 280 more beds at 410 Sherbrooke, in what used to be the Marriott Hotel. If you take everybody that is on temporary spaces now, plus everybody that’s in the Quality Hotel, plus everybody that cancelled once they were notified they had been assigned to a temporary space, [that] fills the building right there. So it’s not off the table that we could use [the Quality Hotel] again, but its less likely than it was this year, because we’ll have the new building,” Porritt said.

A search for ruefrontenac.com will no longer direct readers to the online French language newspaper, originally started by the locked-out journalists of the Journal de Montréal as a pressure tactic against their employer. The site has been stripped of all content by its own journalists. Only the logo remains, with the words “Bientôt de retour parmis vous …” which translates to “Soon amongst you again …” and four links to promotional websites.
Launched in 2009, the website established a reputation for solid investigative reporting and, in late 2010, began publishing a weekly print edition. The site’s contributors stopped receiving pay cheques, which had been paid by the STIJM’s strike fund, following a resolution in April between Quebecor, owner of the Journal, and the Syndicat des travailleurs de l’information du Journal de Montréal (STIJM), the journalists’ union.
For nearly two months, Rue Frontenac’s team of 45 worked without salary to keep the site running, while trying to find financial backers. In late April, the paper stopped publishing a print edition, citing a lack of advertising revenue. Soon after, the group filed for creditor protection, which gave it thirty days to find a buyer.
A few deals fell through, including one with Transcontinental, the fourth-largest printing media group in Canada. On June 15, management at Rue Frontenac signed a hasty deal with Marcel Boisvert, director general and VP Business Development at EstriePlus.com, a website which unites regional news outlets. Rue Frontenac would have been in charge of feeding a new website with general and national content, to which regional outlets would add their own content.
Jean-François Codère, formerly a Rue Frontenac coordinator, says that the deal proposed with Boisvert was initially interesting because “he had a good plan. This afforded us the chance to tap into new, regional markets.”
Boisvert also promised a lack of editorial infringement, a sticking point at the Journal. “He came to us and said, ‘I don’t know anything about the newsroom, I won’t tell you what to write. I’m just the ad guy,’” Codère stated.
The agreement soured after Boisvert informed the Frontenac workers that many of them might not be hired – or paid – until September if business fared as expected. Only a handful of reporters would have been hired as of August 1.
Boisvert also named Michel Strecko as one of his investors.
“We were actually told the name like 15 minutes before the deal went through,” said Codère. “We looked [into] him, and we didn’t like what we found. …This guy has, like, 80 civil law suits against him.”
In 2002, Strecko was convicted of extortion and fined $1,500.
On July 1, Rue Frontenac contributors announced their decision to abandon the project and stripped the site of its content. Two days later, Boisvert countered with an open letter published on EstriePlus. In the letter, Boisvert maintains that Strecko was only brought on as a legal consultant, and not an investor, and blames miscommunication for the business deal’s failure.
Since leaving Rue Frontenac, most have found jobs elsewhere, said Pascal Filotto, a former editor.
“Some have jumped the fence and started doing PR work, a lot of us are doing freelance work. Others are working for the New Democratic Party,” he said. “There’s a lot of Rue Frontenac scattered around.”
