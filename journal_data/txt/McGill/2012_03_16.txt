Labour Board to decide whether the University acted in bad faith
MUNACA plans to file a complaint before the Quebec Labour Board early next week after failing to come to an understanding with the University regarding the interpretation of an article of the union’s collective agreement.
The parties have been reviewing the wording and interpretation of the union’s collective agreement from December 5, 2011, when it was ratified, to February 17 when the process stalled at Article 23.10.
Under the article any MUNACA employee who is paid over their salary maximum will no longer receive salary increases, but will instead receive lump sum payments amounting to cost of living increases relative to their salary. These lump sum payments will be payable to the employee’s pension.
MUNACA President Kevin Whittaker said the union was presented with the new interpretation of the article on November 26, 2011.
“We specifically told [McGill] that…the modification to the Article 23.10 would be conditional on the number of people it would impact, and we need a list of who those people are,” he said. The union received a list of eighty employees who were already paid higher than their salary maximum.
“After analyzing that list we realized these people were already at their grandfathered max so there was no detrimental impact on them,” said Whittaker.
Union executive VP Finance David Kalant explained the decision. “We’ve accepted that these people should be red-circled [subject to the new Article 23.10] since it doesn’t make sense that salaries already above the maximum of the job scale should keep going up. They will be held constant until the job scale catches up to them,” he wrote in an email to The Daily.
Once the job scale catches up to the employee they will begin receiving salary increases again.
However, on February 17, McGill told the union that 48 employees would be added to the initial list of those affected by Article 23.10. When, three weeks later, the union had not yet received the names of those employees, they held a demonstration on campus.
On the following Monday, McGill presented MUNACA with a list of names. Both parties met on March 15 to discuss the list.
Whittaker said that the union’s team “specifically asked” for a rationale as to why the 48 names were excluded from the original list. The University declined to comment on the March 15 meeting to The Daily.
“And we said, ‘Well, the onus was on you to tell us that this was not a complete list, because we asked for a complete list,’” Whittaker said.
In an interview on March 12, McGill Director of Employee Relations Robert Comeau  said that the union and McGill “never agreed on a number.” According to Comeau, the list was “provided, yes. Agreed to, no.”
“We provided the list of employees as an example of that situation,” he continued.
Whittaker said the additional 48 people had been added to the list for a “number of reasons.” He said that “every single one of the new people are problems,” though he noted that all 48 names are also receiving salaries greater than their position’s salary maximum.
“Our problem [is that] had that complete list been submitted we would never have agreed to it,” said Whittaker. “They were misleading us, giving us information that we would see, that would not truly negatively impact on our members, and withholding that which they knew would have been a deal breaker.”
Whittaker said a common reason for adding some of the 48 names was the abolition of an employee’s position in a higher job class – an occurrence that he stated happens frequently.
When an employee is relocated to a lower job class – if they have job security – they maintain their previous salary, Whittaker explained.
However, with the new interpretation of Article 23.10, Whittaker stated that employees placed in lower job classes would not be able to receive salary increases while occupying the lower position, as their salary would likely exceed the maximum salary for their new position.
Comeau told The Daily on March 12 that the only criteria for adding names to the list is “if they are paid over the maximum of their current salary.”

QPIRG referendum to take place in April
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) issued a statement seeking an apology from the SSMU Executive during last Thursday’s SSMU Legislative Council, following the open letter that SSMU released regarding last Tuesday’s AUS General Assembly (GA).
In the letter, SSMU executives expressed disappointment concerning the “poor communication, organization and attitude,” of the AUS in their handling of the GA.
Isabelle Bi, Arts representative to SSMU, spoke to Council on behalf of AUS President Jade Calver and the other Arts representatives.
“The act of issuing a public letter rather than respectfully meeting in private with the AUS executive is insulting and demonstrates the SSMU executives’ lack of professionalism and sets a dangerous precedent,” said Bi.
“I would like to clarify that the AUS has never been and will never be subordinate to the SSMU,” she added.
The statement also accused SSMU VP Clubs and Services Carol Fraser of “hindering the logistics of the event.”
“She failed to provide details beforehand, she failed to reply to emails, and she worked with third party interest groups instead of the Faculty,” said Bi.
Fraser responded to the accusations by stating she had been in contact with members of the AUS Executive Committee about logistic overflow of rooms prior to and on the day of the event.
“I made it very clear that there were other room bookings already made in the building, and there was no other overflow space available in the building,” said Fraser.
Fraser further explained that part of SSMU’s discontent came “from [the AUS] kicking out groups like the [Muslim Student Association] and Mini Courses out of the space they were going to use without consulting me first…that really crossed the line and it had to be addressed.”
Fraser also clarified that AUS’ Nuit Blanche event – scheduled for March 22 – has not been cancelled.
“We’re not cancelling the event, rather, we just want to make sure it goes smoothly, so we requested a plan of the event, which was already in the works with the security supervisor,” said Fraser.
SSMU President Maggie Knight stated that the letter does not “typify” the type of relation that the SSMU wishes to have with any faculty association, or that it has had this year.
Knight also told Council that the letter seeks to protect the clubs and services that use the building.
“The way TVM was treated was extremely disrespectful, and given that there had been discouragement from TVM livestreaming, and then they were later relied on to provide some sort of connection between the rooms and treated as tech support – it is fundamentally distressing and it is not indicative of the relations students would like to have at all,” said Knight.
Ellie Marshall, president of TVM, told Council that TVM felt “extremely disappointed and taken advantage of” by AUS during the GA.
“We were subject to verbal reprimands of our services and at one point I was actually pushed in Leacock 132 for trying to fix the livestream,” said Marshall.
Marshall also expressed gratitude towards SSMU for addressing the issue.
“Our student services were mistreated for the AUS’ benefit,” she said. “I am a member of the AUS. I went there to vote, so were seven other members of TVM who sacrificed their GA experience to make sure everything worked out.”
Calver also spoke to Council and expressed that AUS and SSMU should continue to have the good relationships they have had this year.
“I wish the SSMU Executive had taken time to reflect before issuing a public statement without consulting the AUS Executive. However, I do not wish to cause further tensions between these two bodies,” said Calver.
Calver also thanked TVM and apologized to them on behalf of AUS.
Following the discussion, a motion was passed to commit the issue to the SSMU Executive Committee, which will meet later next week.
QPIRG
Another motion was passed to run an exceptional referendum period from April 10 to April 16.
This referendum period will be used to put forth a question regarding QPIRG’s opt-out system. QPIRG’s fall referendum question was declared invalid by the administration and a Judicial Board case.
Council also voted to have a referendum question regarding online voting for General Assemblies. This question seeks to implement online ratification of decisions made in SSMU GAs.

McGill professor says network distorted his interview in asbestos documentary
McGill professor Bruce Case has vowed that the CBC will face “consequences” for how he was depicted in a documentary on the University’s ties to the asbestos industry broadcast last month.
Case, a professor in McGill’s Department of Pathology and a leading asbestos researcher, did not say whether he was considering legal action against the CBC.
Case was interviewed about his former colleague, J. Corbett McDonald, who received over a million dollars from an asbestos trade group to conduct research in the sixties and seventies. The documentary spurred McGill to launch a preliminary review of McDonald’s research last month.
In an interview with The Daily, Case accused the CBC of “deliberate misrepresentation and bias.”
“And, believe me, there will be consequences,” he said.
In the documentary, titled “Fatal Deception”, Case appears to give evasive answers in defending McDonald’s record, as well as his own.
Terence McKenna, the CBC reporter, asked Case, “Is it true that your studies have been funded in part by the asbestos industry?”
Case replies, “My personal studies have never been funded by the asbestos industry – not one penny.”
A screen-shot of an academic paper then appears on screen, bearing Case’s name, and a footnote acknowledging funding from the JM Asbestos Company.
Case maintains, however, that the CBC misrepresented his role in the study, saying the paper in question was not one of his “personal studies,” but a student’s work, to which he had contributed research.
In a written response, McKenna and Gil Scochat, the documentary’s producer, said, “There was no bias or misrepresentation…deliberate or otherwise.”
They added that Case claimed the study as his own in a May 2005 court deposition.
In an interview, Case also stated that the CBC had truncated his answer to a request by McKenna to see the raw data from a study Case and McDonald conducted together. The study suggested that certain asbestos mines in the Thetford-Mines area were less contaminated with “tremolite” asbestos, and thus less prone to giving workers mesothelioma, or cancer of the lining of the lung.
In the documentary, McKenna asks of the data, “Will you give it to us?”
Case replies, “No, I won’t give it to you.”
In an interview with The Daily, Case said his full answer was, “‘I love the CBC – I watch the National every night including Saturday and Sunday, but the CBC is not a scientific agency, and therefore I don’t share scientific data with the CBC.’”
Schochat declined to provide The Daily with an unedited tape of the original interview, citing a CBC policy against doing so.
But in their written statement, Schochat and McKenna wrote, “We did not include that portion of Dr. Case’s answer because his testimonial of love for the CBC was irrelevant to the matter under discussion.”
“They edited and distorted my response,” said Case. “And, again, there will be consequences.”
While he declined to say what kind of consequences, Case’s personal website – which features the tagline: “Nobody knows the trouble I seen…” – linked to a letter by the University of Toronto scientist Murray M. Finkelstein calling the CBC documentary “slanderous.”

Municipal government trying to resolve “lack of trust” between police and public
Calls for reform from both the public and the Quebec government have led to a bill amending the Police Act. The bill, which is currently being presented to the Quebec National Assembly, would make civilians more involved with holding police accountable.
The proposal, known as Bill 46, was presented to the National Assembly in December by Security Minister Robert Dutil, and is currently being discussed.
The proposed Bill 46 would establish a “Bureau civil de surveillance des enquêtes indépendantes” (civilian oversight bureau), which would oversee independent investigations in every case “where a person, other than an on-duty police officer, dies, is seriously injured, or is injured by a firearm used by a police officer during a police intervention or while the person is in police custody.”
It is already mandated by Quebec law that an investigation be held if such incidents occur.
However, current investigations are designated to an outside police force – one whose officers were not involved in the incident.
The proposed bureau would work alongside this investigation, and would report back to Dutil with their findings.
Quebec Ombudsperson Raymonde Saint-Germain does not believe these proposals go far enough. In an email to The Daily, Saint-Germain’s Director of Communications Carol-Ann Huot said that, “For the most part, Bill 46 does not change the procedure in place under the current ministerial policy.”
“The fact is that Bill 46 maintains the system of police investigating police that does not provide a sufficient guarantee of impartiality,” Huot continued.
In a February 2010 report on Quebec’s investigative procedures into incidents involving police officers, Saint-Germain estimated the cost of establishing an independent investigation office at around $3 million, representing about 0.2 per cent of the Quebec police services total annual budget. She believes that this funding “can be made possible by reallocating existing resources.”
Huot spoke to a current attitude of mistrust between police and the public.
“The public interest requires a serious and credible solution to the fundamental problem of lack of trust regarding police investigations into incidents where a civilian dies, is seriously injured, or is injured by a firearm or conducted energy device used by a police officer during a police intervention or while the civilian is in police custody,” said Huot.
The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) would not comment on the story, stating that, as the bill is not yet mandated, they cannot issue a comment. Dutil’s office had also not responded to The Daily’s requests for comment at time of press.
Martine Painchaud, press secretary for Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s cabinet, said in an interview with The Daily,  “We believe in the creation of an independent unit, and we believe that the project of the government is the step in the right direction, though it is not exactly what city council asked for.”
During the summer of 2011, the Montreal City Council passed a resolution for the Quebec government to establish an independent investigation committee, following the shootings of two men by police.
“It is important that the population have a lot of confidence in a system of investigations that are impartial and independent,” continued Painchaud.
Huot reiterated that “a credible long-term solution to re-establish public trust in such investigations while respecting police officers and their rights must be put in place.”

Project slated to open in September 2013
The Fireside Café will be the next student-run cafe at McGill, as voted on by students and panel judges at SSMU’s Sustainability Case Competition last Wednesday.
Six teams presented their proposals in the SSMU Ballroom from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., but it was the eco-friendly cafe project that emphasized a homey design and international menu that came out on top.
The team will receive a $4,000 prize for their design, and their business plan will be adopted by SSMU’s sustainability working group, which hopes to open the cafe in September 2013. Although the cafe’s location has yet to be announced, a number of teams speculated that it might take over the space on the first floor of SSMU that is now occupied by La Prep.
According to the SSMU Sustainability website, the members of the teams – all of whom were McGill students – have been working on the project since November, when they were chosen from a pool of applicants for the competition.
The groups then had access to a team of mentors from McGill and the wider community, including experts in organizational behaviour, sustainability and corporate responsibility, architecture and design, and community engagement. These mentors gave recommendations to the teams and made up the panel of judges.

Additional prizes of $2,000 and $1,000 were given out to second-and third-place candidates respectively, Growing Grounds and Thatched Roof Cafe. 
The event was attended by approximately seven hundred students. U1 Arts and Science student Inna Tarabukhina, one of the event’s organizers, called it a “success,” and “a great opportunity for students to get engaged and to have a real say about what goes on on campus.”
SSMU VP Finance Shyam Patel, who has been involved with the project since last summer, also said the event went very well. When asked whether SSMU was ready to take on a management role in food services, Patel admitted that “it’s going to take a lot of work,” but that they had “taken the right preliminary steps.” 
Patel was unsure about the project’s future in the hands of next year’s executive, but said that he would “do [his] damn best to make sure it’s carried forward.”

Many Concordia students still attending class 
Concordia University students officially commenced their strike against the provincial tuition fee increase today. Although picketers provided information and asked for support, they did not prevent students, staff, or faculty from entering campus, and many students continued attending classes.
The motion to strike was passed by a wide margin at the Concordia Student Union (CSU)’s general assembly on March 7, and will end on March 22. According to Lex Gill, CSU President, students may submit a petition to call a second general assembly (GA) and vote to extend the strike.
Some students had began collecting signatures for a petition to call a second GA days after the March 7 assembly, but withdrew it in order to respect the autonomy of departmental student associations holding separate GAs throughout the week.
According to Anthony Garoufalis-Auger, a  second year Political Science and School of Community and Public Affairs student and member of the CSU’s Strike Committee, another petition to extend the strike is already circulating, and has collected between 250 and 350 signatures. Garoufalis-Auger stood in a picket line outside the Hall Building, one of Concordia’s major facilities.
“I think the strike is an effective way of making demands of the government,” said Garoufalis-Auger, who acknowledged that many students had continued attending classes. “If we’d get support of those leaving their classes, maybe they can help disrupt other classes.”
Standing nearby was a fourth year Industrial Engineering student named Joe, who asked that his last name not be printed. Joe said he supports the strike and is against the tuition increase, but that he would still attend classes and write his exams in order to graduate this year.
“I really like that some people are doing this to fight for something that is right.” He added that he has had no problem making it to his classes. “It is very easy to get around. People are smiling.”
Although the CSU, which represents all of Concordia’s approximately 45,000 students, is officially on strike, not all of Concordia’s departments have voted to strike. The Commerce and Administration Students’ Association (CASA) voted overwhelmingly against the strike last night. “CASA voted not to strike, and students are respecting that,” Gill said in an interview with the Daily.
Tanya, a third year Dance student, said that she and others had tried to attend their classes, but were obstructed by a picket line on the seventh floor in the John Molson School of Business, where dance and music studios are located. “We think it’s crazy because we’re trying to finish up. We have a big show, and now we’re just paying for losing our class. We’re with the strikers, but we want to go to class.”
On the seventh floor, other Dance students were picketing, surrounded by tables full of snacks and bulletin boards covered in both pro- and anti-strike messages. “Our idea is if people want to pass, they can pass. It’s a choice you make, and we want people to be conscious of it,” said Ariane Dubé-Lavigne, a Dance student in her first year.
Marches, workshops, and teach-ins took place around campus throughout the day. In the basement of the School of Community and Public Affairs, a group of about 15 students choreographed dances and composed versions of recent pop songs with lyrics relevant to the strike. They planned to broadcast their work on CKUT Radio later in the day.
Concordia’s administration released a statement on March 12 announcing their intention to provide services as normal for the duration of the strike, and some administrators have warned of possible disciplinary or academic consequences. But another statement concerning the strike on the administration webpage reads, “Professors are encouraged not to penalize students who do not attend classes, sit exams, or submit papers on March 16.”

Anti-police brutality march spreads through downtown area
Thursday night’s anti-police brutality protest turned ugly when demonstrators and police clashed in the streets of downtown Montreal. Around 2,000 protesters turned out for the demonstration, gathering at the Berri-UQAM metro station at 5 p.m. before marching through the downtown area.
Some demonstrators wore red squares around their right eyes in solidarity with CEGEP student Francis Grenier, whose right eye was injured last week when hit with a flash grenade thrown by a police officer.
The anti-police brutality demonstration, organized by the Collectif opposé à la brutalité policière (COBP), was marred by small groups of protestors who took part in acts of sporadic violence. Projectiles were hurled at store windows and police vehicles along Ste. Catherine, after riot police stopped the march in front of McGill’s Strathcona Music building and demonstrators diverted to Ste. Catherine.
The violence was widely condemned by other demonstrators, however, who responded to most instances of vandalism by booing. After a masked man unsuccessfully tried to force open an ATM machine with a garbage can, he was surrounded by the crowd.
At 6:30 p.m., riot police scattered the crowd into several smaller groups by detonating flash grenades and repeatedly charging demonstrators. A standoff occurred between a splinter group of demonstrators and police on the corner of Drummond and Ste. Catherine at 7 p.m.
The group, which consisted mostly of bystanders, was later pushed up Ste. Catherine. A parked police car was smashed and overturned along the way by demonstrators wearing masks.
Shortly after 7 p.m., roughly 200 demonstrators, most of them masked, flooded down the McTavish steps on to McGill’s lower campus. The crowd made its way past the Redpath Museum, while one demonstrator stood atop its steps and led a chant, in French, of “Whose streets? Our streets!”
The crowd passed through the Y-intersection, moving towards Burnside Hall. When the group tried to exit campus onto University, police turned them back.
Riot police appeared next to the eastern wall of Burnside. One protestor threw what appeared to be a rock at the officers, who did not respond. Blocked from University, the crowd made for the Roddick Gates and exited campus on Sherbrooke.
Around 200 demonstrators regrouped in Place Émilie-Gamelin. Rows of riot police stood along Ste. Catherine between the metro station and St. Hubert. Police used pepper spray on demonstrators on at least two different occasions in the square to move the crowd away from police lines.
At least four police officers arrested Jake Impellizeri at 7:56 p.m. on Ste. Catherine. As he was handcuffed, Impellizeri claimed that he did “nothing wrong” and was about to head home.
His friend, William Karshaw, stood by and watched the arrest.
“We were just standing, just like everyone else just watching. I guess he didn’t get a chance to get out of the way fast enough, and he was thrown to the ground and arrested,” Karshaw said. “We weren’t doing anything wrong…we were moving out of the way.”
At around 8:15 p.m., more demonstrators arrived at the square, bringing the crowd up to 400 people. The centre of the demonstration – and primary site of interactions with riot police – shifted to the intersection of Berri and Maisonneuve in the northwest corner of the square. Seven officers on horseback held the intersection.
Around twenty minutes later, between 100 and 150 people were kettled and arrested outside the National Archives and Library of Quebec. The demonstrators were encircled after riot police charged the crowd. Lines of police officers, vehicles, and ambulances, blocked off the area so that no one could get in or out.
Riot police charged south down Berri and west on Maisonneuve, further dispersing demonstrators. 100 demonstrators remained in the northwest corner of the square until 9:06 p.m., at which time riot police charged again, pushing demonstrators out of the square. The demonstration dissolved a short time later.
At around 9:30 p.m., the demonstrators arrested outside the National Archives were read their rights in English and French. According to a police officer on the scene, a mass arrest could take up to two hours to process. Each demonstrator was accompanied by two officers to be frisked, their bags searched, and loaded onto STM buses to go to a detention centre.
The officer said that there was no resistance from demonstrators. One demonstrator was led out of the group to an ambulance by two officers. In total, the police reported that over 226 people were arrested, and seven officers injured.
