BRIEF
On January 19, McGill held an open forum to collect community input to help shape the vision for the new McGill bookstore. The bookstore will be relocating in 2016.
when its current location is taken over by the Desautels Faculty of Management. However, the new location, or whether the store will even exist outside of the internet, has yet to be determined.
About twenty people attended the forum, very few of whom were students. Attendees spouted a range of ideas for the new McGill bookstore including a lounge and cafe, or multiple kiosks and pop-­up stores around campus.
Sales at the McGill bookstore have declined by 16.8 per cent since 2008. According to consultant Bianca Barbucci, this is not a McGill-specific problem.
“Across Canada there’s a decline in textbooks and course materials overall. […] There’s more competition, and there are a lot of new digital materials that are available. People find their solutions elsewhere; they copy, or download,” said Barbucci at the forum. “It’s the same situation with music.”
The only sales category that has been increasing since 2008 is “Clothing and Insignia,” though at a rate of only of 2.8 per cent annually. For some students, this did not reflect the purpose of the bookstore that was most relevant to them.
“Some students mentioned that they felt that the store was existing for the sole purpose of tourism,” McGill Senior Campus Planner Paul Guenther said, relaying the opinions of students from an earlier focus group. “There’s definitely different perceptions on who the merchandise is for.”
One student in attendance questioned the ethics behind the apparel sold at the bookstore.
“I know the McGill athletic store allows the suppliers [of branded clothing] to use sweatshops. I was wondering […] about the suppliers at the McGill bookstore, and if they’re the same ones,” the student inquired.
The stores’ merchandise comes from a variety of locations – however, both stores obtain some products from Adidas, which has faced multiple sweatshop controversies over the past few years.
McGill will continue the consultation process on the bookstore move, which has also included focus groups and an online survey, in the coming months.

University insists on name changes for clubs
The Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS) has begun negotiations with the administration regarding its Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the document that defines the MCSS’s legal relationship with the University. The two parties met on January 7 to discuss the MOA, set to expire on May 31.
Last Tuesday, MCSS hosted an open meeting at the Ceilidh Pub in Mac campus’s Centennial Centre in order to discuss the proposed changes facing MCSS and the students they represent.
“Back in 2010 the MOA was not properly negotiated,” MCSS President Mathieu Rouleau said at the meeting. “McGill waited until they transferred the [executive], so the new [executive] came in a couple days later, and McGill said it ‘was already negotiated, you just have to sign it.’ So the document we’re dealing with currently has not been properly negotiated with the student society.”
Following rates negotiated in the 2010 MOA, MCSS was scheduled to pay $14 per square foot of space for the 2015-16 academic year, with a $1 per square foot increase per year. However, the administration’s current draft proposes a jump to $16 per square foot for 2015-16, and maintains the annual fee increase of $1 per year.
“We want to preserve what we have here, and meet our mandate to students.”
MCSS currently pays just under $50,000 annually to the administration for revenue-generating space – such as the kitchen, bookstore, and the campus bar – but the proposed changes will increase fees to over $75,000. McGill has justified these increases by stating that other campus student associations pay this rate, and that the change is adjusting for a lack of fee increases in the past.
“We are so different,” said VP Finance Valérie Toupin-Dubé during the meeting. “[It] is not possible to compare us to the other student societies.”
VP Communication and Student Life Jiawen Zhou highlighted that the distinct Mac environment is what makes the MCSS unique. “[Other] student associations have the same template, [but] it’s different here. [McGill] needs to take that into account. We want to preserve what we have here, and meet our mandate to students.”
MCSS executives who spoke at the meeting consider their responsibilities more extensive than those of other student societies at McGill. For example, they have been running the Mac campus bookstore since the 1990s, when McGill pulled out of the space, judging it unprofitable. MCSS bankrolls other campus initiatives as well, such as the peer helper program, staffing extra library hours during exams periods, and offering financial support to all Mac campus clubs.
The proposed budget increases would significantly disturb the current role of MCSS on campus, and would severely limit its ability to offer services to an expanding population of Mac students.
“We have very limited space for the capacity of students who are on this campus,” Rouleau told The Daily after the open meeting. “We want to be able to provide a space where they can come and feel comfortable and spend numerous hours here, while enjoying the landscape and the environment and everything on this campus.”
“[We] don’t want this campus to be considered a satellite campus,” he added.
In discussions with the MCSS executive, the administration has called the decision “standard” but has not expanded beyond that.
Students present at the meeting also questioned the decision to hike fees.
“Where [are] their standards coming from?” asked Samantha Guillemette, a U3 Life Sciences student.
Vilma Di Renzo-Campbell, Director and Senior Policy Advisor for the Office of the Associate Provost and the University’s representative in these negotiations, did not respond to The Daily’s requests for comment.
In addition to the fee increases, the administration has also proposed changes in nomenclature for all Mac clubs, requesting that “student” now be present in all titles. MCSS has interpreted this as a standardizing measure, and something that jeopardizes the clubs’ established legacies.
VP Internal Eric Brulé-Champagne said that MCSS will fight “to maintain the integrity of all of our clubs on campus.”
“[They] have had a rich past and have been established for a while. We want to make sure they can hold on to their name, and not have to conform to this liability clause.”
Brulé-Champagne continued, “Hopefully [we can] secure more student space [and] make sure the student space that we do have is sustainable in a way that our fees with […] McGill [aren’t] going to cause us to drown.”

Youth outreach project doubles capacity with new hire
Correction appended January 27, 2015.
Last November, Head & Hands hired a second employee for its Street Work program, restoring the program to the capacity it had before budget cuts forced its discontinuation in 2011. The program was partially reinstated in 2013 with the hiring of a single street worker after substantial fundraising.
Head & Hands is an organization that caters to the needs of youth between the ages of 12 to 25 in Montreal who may not have access to certain resources, ranging from counselling to legal services to free condoms to clean needles.
Street Work is the group’s outreach program, whereby street workers move around the Notre- Dame-de-Grâce (NDG) neighbourhood to meet clients and provide services, such as active listening and on-the-spot counselling, while also conducting harm reduction and drug awareness workshops at schools, community centres, and group homes.
“[The program] focuses on supporting marginalized youth using an educational approach that’s rooted in risk reduction,” said Victoria Pilger, Funding and Partnerships Coordinator at Head & Hands.
“We have a team of two street workers and […] they reach youth on their own turf – in bars, parks, metros, group homes, shooting galleries, basically anywhere where youth can be reached.”
Donald*, a past client of Head & Hands, attributed many of his successes to the Street Work program in a video testimonial.
“Without it, people like me would continue to be on the streets. I wouldn’t be where I am today, I wouldn’t have an apartment, I wouldn’t be able to look for work, I wouldn’t be stable, I wouldn’t have my beautiful dog, I wouldn’t have my beautiful wife. You know, it helped me,” Donald said in the testimonial. “The Street Work program got me off the street.”
In 2011, the Street Work program was suspended after budget cuts forced the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Montreal to cease funding for the program. According to Pilger, PHAC faced a near 30 per cent reduction in its budget.
“We’re seeing that government funding for all social programs [is] shrinking, especially for programs that are using a non-judgmental and harm-reduction approach,” said Pilger.
The program was partially reinstated in 2013 after Head & Hands began fundraising in the local community.
“We launched a two-year campaign and we turned to our community for support. Over those two years, we were able to partially re-launch the program in the fall of 2013 – we raised the funds to bring back one street worker full-time,” said Pilger. This fundraising continued until another street worker was hired in the fall of 2014.
“The Street Work program got me off the street.”
Since the program’s initial reinstatement in 2013, street worker Sara* has managed to reach almost 500 youth around the city. According to Sara, the addition of an extra street worker comes as a significant achievement for the program, and will allow Head & Hands to expand its focus while continuing to provide resources for those who currently require them.
“I go into schools, community centres, and group homes for the most part,” said Sara. “There’s always so much to do, and there [are] so many dreams I have for the program, [such as] having a little bit more time to vamp up the drug workshops and spend time [on it]. Thankfully, we got a new street worker, and we sort of shift our schedules so that we’re able to meet with more people.”
“[I also get to] develop deeper relationships with clients because I’m able to spend more time with them, because I know there’s another street worker who can take certain calls or go to certain areas that I haven’t been to in a while,” Sara continued.
“Having our Street Work program back means that now we’re able to listen and hear what’s going in our neighborhood from really important voices – from youth who see NDG from the perspective of homelessness, poverty, social exclusion, from within the youth protection system, and other experiences of marginalization,” said Pilger.
“Our street workers are able to be our eyes and ears on the ground […] and hear the voices of youth that we might not have been able to hear without the program.”
A previous version of this article stated that PHAC faced a near 13 per cent cut to its budget. In fact, it was a near 30 per cent cut. The Daily regrets the error.

Rad Sex Week aims to destigmatize alternative sexual practices
From January 26 to February 5, Queer McGill (QM) will be hosting its seventh annual Rad Sex Week, an event series seeking to explore and destigmatize anti-oppressive, feminist, trans- and queer-positive expressions of sexuality. The two-week-long event will be largely comprised of workshops to provide the McGill community with educational materials on more alternative or stigmatized sexual activities.
“[We are] making an inclusive space for any people or persons who [vary] from what we would normally characterize as ‘vanilla’ sex,” said QM Events Coordinator Erin Strawbridge in an interview with The Daily.
Some of the workshops aim to facilitate discussions on topics like sex and disability, consent, and BDSM, while others offer a more technical, hands-on approach to sexual practices, such as flogging and piercing play.
Speaking to The Daily, QM coordinators noted that, although the week focuses on non-traditional practices, workshops touching on consent and ethics are applicable to any type of sex or sex education.
“We came together and decided which workshops we’d like to see based on diversity purposes but also where there was a need. Workshops that you typically don’t see – those were the workshops we wanted to have,” said Sabine Grutter, QM Resource Coordinator and one of the main organizers of Rad Sex Week.

On January 18, the organizers of the week had to deal with some unexpected backlash on the Rad Sex Week Facebook event page about one of the workshops, which will explore trans and queer people of colour’s (POC) sexual and romantic desires from a decolonization perspective. The event, entitled “Desires: A QT*POC Exploration,” is closed to queer and trans people of colour; some commenters argued that this was exclusionary.
“The QM page started being trolled,” said Grutter. “People who weren’t interested in the event started commenting about the fact that they didn’t agree with it and the politics surrounding it.”
The original comment thread reached about 200 responses. After QM published a response, more hateful and triggering comments were posted, which prompted QM to start deleting comments.
“Everyone whose comments we deleted, we sent [them] a message explaining why,” said Grutter, adding that QM has screenshots of all the comments.
As the comments in question were posted during a QM staff orientation session where most of the QM board was present, QM was able to quickly decide on a collective response.
The response acknowledged the institutionalized oppression of people of colour and the importance of providing a safer space for people who don’t want the voices of white people and the history of white supremacy and colonization weighing into conversations of POC romance and sexuality.
The coordinators also commented on some of the misunderstandings and questions that arose on the events page, one of them being a misinterpretation of the acronym LGBT*QIA.
“It’s a weirdly common mistake of assuming that in the LGBT*QIA, the A stands for ‘ally,’ which it does not – it stands for asexual,” said Strawbridge. “The fact [is] that allyship isn’t a foot in the door for any of these spaces. Allies should be the ones promoting the allowances of these spaces, not intervening on the basis of being an ally.”
Other commenters questioned who can be considered a person of colour.
“We do not want to bring up any instances of shadism or policing race; this event is open to anyone who self-identifies as a person of colour and is queer or trans [who wants] to come to this space and take something away from it,” said Grutter. “If you show up to the space, and you are clearly there to devalue the experience […] you will be asked to leave.”
The entire event page was eventually deleted by Facebook, after the QM coordinators’ account was reported for being “a community organization acting as a person,” according to Grutter.
Regardless of the backlash, the QM coordinators look forward to the events and encourage everyone to attend.
“You don’t have to be kinky per se to come to these events,” said Grutter. “The workshops are great, they’re free and accessible, they’re all bilingual, and in Montreal. ”

Senate passes policy on late withdrawals after lengthy debate
Senate approved a controversial policy on late withdrawals at its January 21 meeting. The policy, which was debated but not voted on at the previous meeting, will allow a student to remove the courses and grades for an entire term from the official transcript if the student withdrew from all classes under exceptional circumstances. In response to students’ questions, members of the administration also clarified the University’s stances on international tuition deregulation.
The proposed policy on late withdrawals, originally brought to Senate at its December 3 meeting as part of the report of the Academic Policy Committee, came to Senate for approval again. It had not been voted on at the last meeting, as Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures & Equity) Lydia White withdrew the motion to approve the policy due to heavy debate and an apparent inability to reach a consensus.
“I think it is good that we managed to find a compromise here […] and I’m definitely happy [that the policy passed].”
Although several faculty senators reiterated concerns about preserving the “integrity” of the transcript, most interventions were in favour of the policy.
Responding to Arts Faculty Senator Catherine Lu, who had said that helping students deal with a difficult time was a poor rationale for altering the transcript, Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning) Ollivier Dyens noted that it is “the responsibility of the University to support [students],” something it already does “all the time” by providing mental health services or making accommodations in class.
Arts Faculty Senator Philip Oxhorn argued that although explanatory notes can accompany the transcript for graduate school or employment applications, those means are often insufficient to ensure fair treatment. “Sometimes too much knowledge is counterproductive,” he said. “We can have all sorts of amendments [to the transcript], but they don’t get read.”
Speaking on behalf of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Senate caucus, SSMU VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan praised the policy as a “significant step” in supporting students. She added that earlier, the SSMU caucus had suggested amending the policy with a three-year mandatory review clause – an amendment that White, the mover, had deemed friendly.
Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Academic Affairs Officer Jennifer Murray, however, was not in support of the policy. She expressed worry that discarding grades of W for some students and not others would weigh more heavily on the students who must keep them on their transcript, and as such have the “opposite effect” of the one intended.
The policy passed, with about two-thirds of senators in favour and two abstentions.
In an interview with The Daily, SSMU Arts Senator Jacob Greenspon expressed satisfaction with the result as a step toward more effective support for students.
“It’s very important to note that this is definitely not the end of the road. The major opposition we had to it last Senate is because we felt this policy didn’t go far enough,” he said. “I think it is good that we managed to find a compromise here […] and I’m definitely happy [that the policy passed].”
In response to a question from SSMU senators asking McGill to clarify its stance on the deregulation of international tuition, Provost Anthony Masi stated that the University has been lobbying the Quebec government for the full deregulation of tuition fees from international students in all programs.
International tuition was deregulated for applied sciences, mathematics, engineering, computer science, management, and law in 2008, meaning that McGill has access to the supplementary fee paid by non-Quebec students that is normally redistributed by the government. The University is pushing for this deregulation in all other programs.
When pressed by SSMU Arts Senator Kareem Ibrahim on whether or not students had been consulted when establishing this position, Masi insisted that the University has openly held this position for some time. “It has been our policy for six years that deregulation is the right road to follow,” said Masi.
However, Stewart-Kanigan told The Daily that the University’s stance on the issue had been unclear to student representatives and was likely not familiar to the student body as a whole.
“We have the information that we need now to conduct our own consultation with international students and disseminate this information,” said Stewart-Kanigan.
“More programs have moved toward deregulation [in the last six years], so international students are now actually paying those significantly higher tuition [fees],” she continued. “Now would be an appropriate time to look critically at that stance again and see what students are thinking, because deregulation is not [just] an idea now, it’s something that students are actually experiencing.”
Greenspon echoed Stewart-Kanigan’s assessment. “There’s definitely been whispers of this, [but] this is probably the first time they’ve come out,” he said. “I really hope that there’s a better way that can be found here to fund the university without putting more of that burden on students’ backs.”

Group to protest social housing cuts, pressure government for subsidies 
The Front d’action populaire en réaménagement urbain (FRAPRU) – an organization that fights for housing rights – will set up an occupation camp in downtown Montreal this May, the organization announced in a statement released on January 8. With the camp, FRAPRU aims to increase pressure on the government in response to cuts to funding for social housing.
“Basically, the goal of the camp is to be right in the face of the government, and say, ‘look, the more you cut back, the more people will live in the street – and here we are, we are not going anywhere,’” Fred Burrill, community organizer at the Projet d’organisation populaire d’information et de regroupement (POPIR), a FRAPRU member organization, told The Daily.
About 140,000 low-income housing units exist in Quebec, with over 40,000 people on waiting lists across the province; however, both the provincial and federal governments have failed to renew expiring government subsidies for social housing. As of this year, 25,000 social housing units in Quebec will lose long-term federal subsidies, which will result in rent increases of up to $300 per month, according to FRAPRU.
“We really want to put the focus back on the issue that everyone deserves things like housing.”
“Right now we are seeing two different levels of cuts. The federal government is cutting the long-term subsidies to co-op and non-profit [housing…] and at the same time, in Quebec, we are seeing that [in] the AccèsLogis program, which is a program the government invests in to actually build the units for social housing, they decided to cut back,” Émilie Joly, community organizer at FRAPRU, told The Daily in an interview.
“For people living in co-ops funded by the federal program, we are actually seeing several people recently lose their subsidies entirely,” added Burrill. “So their rent can go from $200 a month to $600 or $700.”
FRAPRU’s decision to set up an occupation camp aims to give visibility to this issue and push the government to guarantee the right to accessible housing, according to Joly.
“We are going to have different kinds of workshops, whether it be on housing issues, on tenants’ rights, on how to build a co-op, and then the larger portrait: everything regarding the environment, for example, the construction of pipelines and Indigenous land rights. We’re really trying to have a broad perspective,” said Joly. “We really want to put the focus back on the issue that everyone deserves things like housing.”
In 2011, Occupy Montreal protesters occupied Square Victoria for more than a month, before former Montreal mayor Gérald Tremblay ordered that police dismantle the camp.
According to a Montreal Gazette article published on January 13, current mayor Denis Coderre has not indicated whether or not he will allow FRAPRU’s camp to exist.
“We really hope that the city understands we are trying to convince the government to invest in municipal building and development, so the city should see us as an ally in this fight,” said Joly.

BRIEF
At its second meeting of the year on January 21, the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) General Council (GC) voted to support Queer McGill (QM) in its intention to hold a discussion exclusive to people of colour, and discussed the upcoming 2015-16 budget.
As part of its ongoing Rad Sex Week, QM will hold a discussion on sexuality and romance for queer and trans people of colour, excluding white people to provide a safer space and a more open environment for people of colour. After receiving online complaints against this event, QM approached various campus groups to speak in support of such closed events.
According to VP External Emily Boytinck, the GC’s decision to endorse the workshop fits with the SUS Equity Policy, which strives to provide fair treatment and safe space for all McGill students.
“Conversations can be held differently if white people who don’t experience racism aren’t present,” said Boytinck.
McGill Society of Physics Students representative Laurent Lanteigne disagreed, saying, “This is a right step in the wrong direction. […] If the ultimate goal is to have everyone on an equal stance, then everyone should be able to speak equally.”
Microbiology and Immunology Student Association representative Joy Tseng voiced concerns about taking a stance in the first place. “This is a touchy issue for SUS to be involved in this event,” she said. “It should take a neutral stance.”
Boytinck noted that similar discussions closed to people of colour had been used successfully by SUS itself at its equity retreat this month.
The motion passed, with eight votes for, five against, and five abstaining.
VP Finance Eileen Bui presented an overview of the planned budget for 2015-16. Over 64 per cent of funds will be allocated to the departmental associations, she said.
“The rest of the funds are being distributed to committees that have the greatest impact on students,” said Bui.
Such initiatives include student appreciation events, such as free cookies during exam seasons, and the setting up of a laptop lending program to aid students who are in need of laptops on a short notice.

Canadian government dismissive of upsurge of racist violence
A Roma family that has been living in Montreal since 2011 is due to be deported back to Hungary on January 28. Anasztazia Szilagyi, along with her husband Dezso Nemeth and children Mercedesz, 10, and Mark, 21, will be forced to return to Hungary after their application for permanent residence was rejected earlier this month. Szilagyi will be separated from her two older, adult children, Patricia and Dezso Jr., who will remain in Canada after having received asylum under a separate claim in June 2014.
The Roma people make up the largest minority of Hungary, and often face violence in their home country. Members of the Nemeth family were subject to beatings, verbal attacks, vandalism, and death threats in their hometown of Sárhida. “We didn’t want to leave Hungary, but we had to come to Canada. We were afraid of racist violence in Hungary because we are Roma. We were scared for the lives of our children, and for ourselves,” said Szilagyi in a statement.
According to a press release from Solidarity Across Borders (SAB), a Montreal-based migrant justice network that is assisting the Nemeth family, the family’s refugee claim was heard and rejected in May 2013. They have also been denied a pre-removal risk assessment to determine whether they would be under significant threat upon returning to Hungary.
The family’s lawyer Éric Taillefer has submitted an application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, as well as a request for an administrative stay of the deportation. Their case will be brought before the Federal Court on January 27, the day before the scheduled deportation.
Leah Freedman, a member of SAB, spoke to The Daily about the varying difficulties refugees face in seeking asylum in Canada. “It really becomes this case-by-case situation where people are going through this extremely complicated bureaucratic system that is often not explained to them,” said Freedman.
“We were afraid of racist violence in Hungary because we are Roma. We were scared for the lives of our children, and for ourselves.”
In December 2012, former Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney instituted changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act with the passing of Bill C-31, which listed Hungary as one of many “designated countries of origin” (DCOs).
According to the Government of Canada website, the classification of DCOs is meant to prevent the “waste” of resources caused by processing refugee claims made by people from “countries that do not normally produce refugees, but do respect human rights and offer state protection.” However, Hungary has a long history of persecution, segregation, and repression of Roma people, despite its DCO label.
Dafina Savic, founder and executive director of Roma-rights organization Romanipe, speculated that the 2008 economic crisis provoked Hungarian politicians to use the Roma people as a political scapegoat. “There have been various anti-Roma marches organized […] where thousands of people gathered with swastikas, some of them dressed as Hitler, terrorizing Roma villages,” she told The Daily.
Economic negotiations between Canada and Europe in 2007 resulted in Canada removing visa requirements for Eastern European visitors. According to Savic, the subsequent rise in Roma refugees to Canada contributed to the Conservative government’s institution of Bill C-31 to curb the influx.
“Our generous asylum system has been abused by too many people making bogus refugee claims,” Kenney stated at 2012 press conference following the tabling of the bill. The recent rise of extremism in Hungary has led to another influx of unrecognized Roma refugees, most of whom will face the same immigration roadblocks as the Nemeth family.
“The rate of acceptance of Roma asylum seekers in 1998 was about 98 per cent, and since the application of Bill C-31 in 2012, it has gone down to 8 per cent,” said Savic. “We’ve been working with lawyers, and when they have a Roma case, they’re almost sure that it won’t be accepted.”
The Nemeth family’s refugee claim was rejected by Anna Brychcy, an adjudicator on the Immigration and Refugee Board appointed by Kenney. According to the Toronto Star, she granted asylum to just 6.45 per cent of refugee claims in 2010, and has no law or immigration background.
“What Bill C-31 did was to put a lot of power in the hands of the commissioners and so unfortunately [the decision] is, in some sense, arbitrary,” said Savic. “The shocking part of the decision is the fact that half of the family has been granted status, whereas the other half wasn’t.”
“Our whole life is here in Montreal, with our children and grandchildren. If my husband, Mark, Mercedesz, and I have to go back it will break my whole family,” Szilagyi said in her statement.
SAB has requested letters or phone calls be sent to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Chris Alexander asking him to stop the Nemeth family’s deportation.
