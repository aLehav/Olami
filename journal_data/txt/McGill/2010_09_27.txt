Key witness supports accusations of influence peddling in the courts
Already facing record-low poll numbers, accusations of corrupt fundraising, and an unpopular budget, Premier Jean Charest and the Quebec Liberal party are now threatened by new evidence that confirms allegations of influence peddling in the judicial appointment process.
On Monday September 20, former associate deputy minister in the justice department Georges Lalande corroborated claims that former justice minister Marc Bellemare received undue pressure from Liberal fundraisers to select particular judges.
He was called to testify as part of the Bastarache Commission, an investigation into Bellemare’s claims that has prompted a majority of Quebeckers to support the Premier Jean Charest’s resignation, making the likelihood of a Liberal re-election in 2012 appear dim.
Charles Rondeau, one of the fundraisers mired in suspicion because of their lobbying efforts, testified before the commission Tuesday. Rondeau said that he had asked Bellemare to appoint an old schoolfriend Chief Judge of Quebec, but added that his request was casual and that Bellemare was unsurprised to receive it, contrary to Bellemare’s claims.
Franco Fava, another fundraiser implicated in Bellemare’s accusations, denied all of Bellemare’s and Lalande’s claims. He said that he didn’t know any of the three judges who were appointed. “It’s not something that interested me, the nomination of judges,” he told the commission.
In April, Bellemare alleged that while serving as Minister of Justice in 2003 and 2004, he was pressured by Liberal fundraisers to appoint three judges: Michel Simard, Marc Bisson and Line Gosselin-Després. He claimed that he reported these problems to Charest, and was told to do as the fundraisers said.
The government launched the Bastarache Commission on April 14 to look into these accusations, and Bellemare’s cross-examination began on August 30.
Bellemare’s testimony was on shaky grounds through Monday. His former chief of staff and former press aid testified that Bellemare had never told them about facing “undue pressure” from Liberal fundraisers. His description of the timeline of appointments did not hold up under cross-examination, and was shown to be implausible in parts by Globe and Mail reporter Daniel LeBlanc. He also did not convincingly explain why he waited six years to reveal this information.
However, Lalande’s account confirmed many of Bellemare’s claims – especially concerning his meetings with Liberal fundraiser Fava – with notes from his personal agendas.
“Marc Bellemare does not understand that we need to appoint our friends, in justice just like everywhere else,” Lalande quoted Fava as saying. “They’re beating down the doors after nine years in opposition.”
Lalande stated that Fava had recommended Simard as a candidate for Assistant Chief Judge of Quebec Court, and Gosselin-Després for the youth court. Both these candidates were later named to the bench.
Throughout the commission, public opinion has been starkly in favour of the former justice minister. A recent Léger poll revealed that 58 per cent of respondents believed Bellemare, compared to only 14 per cent in support of Charest. In an earlier poll, 57 per cent of Quebeckers supported Charest’s resignation.
“You have to look at those numbers … in the context of the political reality,” said the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, Professor Antonia Maioni. “Jean Charest is a very unpopular premier. His government is not doing so well. So I think many Quebeckers are prepared to think anything negative about Jean Charest. I don’t think it’s an all-out endorsement of Bellemare. I just think that many people are unhappy with Jean Charest’s leadership, and therefore ready to be suspicious in what seems to be choosing between one and the other.”
In addition to this controversy, Charest’s government has been plagued by accusations of corrupt financing in the construction industry. A provincial police investigation – called “Opération Marteau” – is already examining this issue.
“The political context of Quebec was, and still is, very ‘chargé’ because the Liberal party is having a hard time at the polls,” Maioni said. “It’s been suffering from a lot of attacks by the Parti Québécois in the National Assembly. … There’s been a lot of pressure on Charest from journalists and opponents and interest groups to actually have a commission, but a commission on the construction industry, not on this. So when all of these accusations started to come out, what Charest did was appoint a commission, but the commission was not to delve into Liberal fundraising…but rather to make sure that the nomination of judges is still transparent and democratic.”
The Bastarache Commission’s ruling will be announced by October 15. It remains to be seen how high public dissatisfaction will affect Charest’s position within the Liberal caucus, and whether the Liberal party can regain public support before the 2012 provincial elections.
“Barring really unforeseen circumstances, [the Liberals] will probably hold their majority [in the National Assembly]…until the next election,” Maioni said. “Whether Jean Charest will be Premier, that’s a separate question. I’m not sure that Jean Charest will last as leader of the party until the next election. … However, once the election is called, I think there’s a very real possibility that the Parti Québécois will win.”

Conservative McGill led opt-out campaign renewed a day later
An unidentified person or group hacked into the Quebec Public Interest Research Group’s (QPIRG) website last Tuesday, changing the group’s homepage, in what appears to be an escalation of the nearly two year old-campaign on the part of a range of student groups on campus to encourage student opt-outs from QPIRG’s $3.75 a semester student fee.
QPIRG could not confirm that last week’s hack was related to the opt-out campaign, saying they are still in the process of discovering what happened themselves.
Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, a QPIRG board member, told The Daily, “The groups who have been organizing against QPIRG in the past are well known and have been pretty public about it. That is not to suggest that hacking came necessarily from those groups.”
Following the hack, the link on QPIRG’s website titled “Working Groups” sent users to a webpage for Tadamon!, a pro-Palestinian organization affiliated with QPIRG that labels Israel an apartheid state.
Clubs as diverse as Conservative McGill and the McGill Hellenic Students’ Association accuse QPIRG of supporting radical political positions that “mainstream” students would not naturally support.
Fliers encouraging students to opt-out of QPIRG’s student fee have also been left in buildings on campus, including Leacock and Redpath, throughout the past week.
Outgoing Conservative McGill President Jess Weiser did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment.
The opt-out campaign, officially luanched on September 15,  has developed a well organized web infrastructure; the Facebook group “QPIRG: Opt-Out!” features a 50-second video guide to opting out of student fees, including QPIRG and “Vegan” [Midnight] Kitchen, as well as a six-step guide to the opt-out process on Minerva, which the Facebook page says takes “less than three minutes.”
The QPIRG Opt-Out Campaign circulated an open letter addressed to QPIRG last night, signed by Conservative McGill, Free the Children McGill Chapter, and Swiss Club McGill, among others, decrying some of the research group’s political positions as “bigoted.” The letter’s coda reads, “We will no longer contribute to an organization that promotes hate, rejects student input, and neglects its stated aims.”
Ronderos-Morgan said the efforts of the individuals and groups involved in the opt-out campaign are “disingenuous.”
“I find it kind of hilarious [that these groups use the arguments they do] because they receive money from SSMU and faculty associations,” said Ronderos-Morgan.
“Conservative McGill, for example, received $750 of student money last year from SSMU, and students had no option of whether or not they wanted to opt-out of that. A lot of students on campus don’t find conservative politics very appealing and yet their money is going to fund Conservative McGill.  … Students don’t really have the option to opt-out of that because it makes sense for there to be funds available for groups to add to student life without having to do bake sales all the time.”
Echoing Ronderos-Morgan’s chagrin with the groups involved in the campaign, Anna Malla, Internal Coordinator at QPIRG, said “we are not opposed to students knowing how to opt-out, but we are opposed to the fact that there are fliers being distributed all over campus that don’t give any information about who we are.”
“Students are finding out about a way to save money as opposed to finding out about who we are and what we do,” she continued. “It is obviously not a campaign that is trying to inform students. It is a campaign that is trying to suck the money out of our organization.”

Research explores connection between higher tuition and accessibility
A study commissioned by SSMU VP External Myriam Zaidi, released September 10, sheds light on the effects self-funded tuition models have had on the professional schools of two Ontario universities over the past decade.
The report finds that higher tuition at the University of Western Ontario medical school and the University of Toronto law school, on the heels of the deregulation of Ontario tuition for professional schools in 1997, resulted in more wealthy students and fewer poor students enrolling in the programs.
SSMU commissioned the report, written by McGill graduate student Rachel Gotthilf for a $500 fee, as lobbying firepower in the ongoing dispute over the steep hike in tuition for McGill’s MBA program.  This past year, McGill’s Desautels Faculty of Management raised MBA tuition from $1,700 to $32,500 in what Dean Peter Todd has called a “pilot project” of higher tuition models at McGill. Administration officials have consistently rejected claims that higher tuition will negatively affect accessibility.
Still, then Minister of Education Michelle Courchesne threatened to cut over $3 million from McGill’s general funding last April for violating Quebec’s policy of educational accessibility.
At the time Todd denounced the ministry’s plan for funding cuts as punitive. “Their [the provincial government’s] view is that other McGill students should pay for this, and we don’t think that is correct or appropriate,” he told The Daily. “Unfortunately, it is likely that the MBA will continue to be subsidized by other students at McGill, a situation we believe is unjust and needs to be changed.”
When Ontario deregulated professional school tuition, the cost of professional programs (dentistry, medical, law) skyrocketed. At Western, medical school tuition increased by 40 per cent to $14,000. Administration officials there argued that the increase was justified because of “higher earnings expectations,” the report found.
Zaidi pointed to this as evidence of an impulse on the part of the administration to expand the use of self-funded models, in which the cost of a program is paid for by tuition rather than government subsidies, into other faculties at McGill. “The motivation behind the shift to a self-funded tuition model in law, and medicine [in Ontario] are the same with the MBA,” she said. “[The report] tells us it’s not a question of the program, it’s a question of ideology.”
The report goes on to detail the changing economic character of Western students after tuition deregulation. The study claims “as tuition increased over a four year period, the average annual family income of medical students increased from $80,000 to $140,000.” The report also cites studies showing that the proportion of medical students coming from families with incomes of less than $40,000 across Ontario dropped “dramatically,” from 23 to 10 per cent in the years following tuition deregulation.
The percentage of students who were the first from their family to attend a professional school decreased with the tuition hike, the report shows. A 2005 StatisticsCanada study cited in the paper found that after Ontario’s 1997 deregulation, the children of parents with graduate or professional credentials became twice as likely to enroll than before, while the enrollment of students from families without credentials remained relatively unchanged.
Around the same time, the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Law doubled its tuition.  Administrators there sought to offset adverse effects on accessibility through a series of measures, including massive increases in financial aid, the expansion of internship programs, increased student-professor ratios, and a retroactive student aid policy for graduates entering the non-profit sector and earning less than $45,000 a year.
According to the Desautels Faculty Management’s Director of Marketing and Communication Ron Duerkson, the faculty is “currently finalizing funding and scholarship options specific to those in the non-profit sector,” although he declined to provide specific figures, saying that the options would be available starting next fall.
Officials at the Faculty of Management’s career planning service were unable to provide numbers as to how many of McGill’s MBA graduates go into the non-profit sector, but maintained that the number was relatively small. According to employment data from the faculty, the average yearly salary upon graduating from the MBA program is $79,000.
Zaidi insisted that the number of graduates going into the non-profit field was irrelevant. “Without a doubt, some students will not have the freedom to pursue an MBA at McGill because of their household’s income, which goes against the model that Quebeckers opted for, a model focused on accessibility,” she wrote in an email to The Daily.

Students across Canada paying more this school year
Quebec no longer has the lowest graduate tuition in the country, and Quebec undergraduate tuition is rising at a higher rate than the national average, according to a report released by Statistics Canada (StatsCan) last Thursday.
Universities in Quebec still have the lowest undergraduate tuition in Canada, at an average of $2,415 a year. However, undergraduate tuition increased by 4.6 per cent from last year, the fourth highest rate in the country.
Graduate tuition in Quebec, meanwhile, jumped by 6.4 per cent from last year to $2,600 – more than a hundred dollars more than the graduate tuition rate in Newfoundland and Labrador, which now offers the cheapest graduate tuition in Canada. Only Ontario saw a more precipitous increase in tuition rates for graduate students than Quebec.
Quebec universities also raised tuition for international students by 10.3 per cent, the second biggest increase of its kind. Saskatchewan led the way with a hike of 25.2 per cent.
The StatsCan data, compiled from May to June 2010 and covering the 2010-2011 academic year, showed that undergraduate tuition across Canada rose 4 per cent from 2009-2010, while graduate tuition across Canada jumped 6.6 per cent over the same period.
Inflation increased by 1.8 per cent during the period being measured.
More of the report’s findings include:
• Canadian undergrads are also paying more in compulsory fees (e.g., ancillary fees): $702 on average, up from the $656 they paid on average last year.
•   Ontario universities raised tuition on undergraduates and graduates at the highest rates in Canada, 5.4 per cent and 10.6 per cent respectively. Ontario also has the highest undergraduate tuition in the country, at $6,307, more than $750 higher than the next most expensive province.
•  The most expensive undergraduate program Canada-wide is dentistry, coming in at $14,701 for the 2010-2011 year.
• At $2,456, Newfoundland and Labrador charges the least for graduate programs at Memorial University, which is the only university in the province.
•   The Canadian average for MBA programs is $21,118 – more than $11,000 less than McGill’s MBA program.
•   Although it decreased by nearly $350 from last year, Nova Scotia still has the highest graduate tuition in the country, charging $7,350.
