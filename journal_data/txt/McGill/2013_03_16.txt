Motion passes after extended debate
Following a poorly attended General Assembly (GA) at the end of last month, the SSMU Legislative Council met for its bi-weekly meeting this Thursday to debate the motions originally submitted to the GA — declared at the time a consultative body when it failed to meet quorum.
Council first passed both the Motion Regarding Conflict Minerals with 22 for, and four against, and zero abstentions, as well as the Motion Regarding Support for the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office unanimously.
Council lacked active debates until the Motion Regarding Fair Tuition and Fee Charges, submitted on the floor by SSMU Political Campaigns Coordinator Christopher Bangs. Bangs, who was sitting in the gallery at the time, was given special privilege to address the questions raised by the councillors.
The Motion Regarding Fair Tuition and Fee Charges urged SSMU to conduct a comprehensive review of tuition and fees charged by faculties and/or schools to ensure that such practice adheres to internal regulations set by the University’s administrative body, as well as within Quebec and Canada.
The motion, which was passed at the GA with 37 for, two against, and one abstention, urges the VP University Affairs and the student senators to lobby McGill for a formal review of fees through various administrative channels, such as the Senate and the Senate committees.
SSMU VP University Affairs Haley Dinel first asked Bangs to clarify the situation at the University of Toronto (UofT) referenced in his motion, where an ancillary fee research was conducted to identify illegal financial charges that its administration allegedly imposed on the students. “In [UofT], there was an actual law that changed in the provincial level, and [UofT] did not adhere to such law which was what was problematic. Using it as an example is not at all in the spirit of what this motion is about,” she said.
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser stated that the conversations at the recent Free Education Summit also included the topic of university finances in general. “Ancillary fees vary depending on the university…. They depend on their discretion. McGill has the highest ancillary fees [in Quebec]…. Having a clear understanding of McGill [will] be a useful thing to do especially when [the issue of fees] will go up to the provincial level.”
On the usefulness of the motion, Reid-Fraser continued, “If we conduct this research immediately, this will only contribute to the information that TaCEQ can work around with.”
Initially, the Motion Regarding Fair Tuition and Fee Charges failed to pass with four for, seven against, and 12 abstentions. The motion was reconsidered, however; Inter-residential Council Representative Sarah Southey expressed her concern over the high number of abstentions amongst the councillors.
During the extended debate, SSMU VP Clubs and Services Allison Cooper also emphasized that student jobs will also be created as a result of the research. “The point is to get more information about something that we don’t know much about,” she added.
Clubs and Service Representative Geneva Nam requested to table the motion to ensure the possible involvement of faculties to better analyze the fees behind offered courses; this suggestion did not pass with 13 oppositions of the 23 available votes.
The motion ultimately passed with 21 for, 0 against, and 1 abstention.
Without significant opposition, the council also passed: the Notice of Motion Regarding Amendment to Building Committee Terms of Reference, Motion Regarding Endorsement of Student Service Ancillary Fee Referendum Question, Motion Regarding Endorsement of the Equity Fee Referendum Question, and the Motion Regarding Endorsement of the SACOMSS Fee Referendum Question.

Over two thirds of demonstrators arrested
The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) came out in full force on Friday to clamp down on Montreal’s March Against Police Brutality, an annual demonstration organized by the Collective Opposed to Police Brutality (COPB). Police charged, tear gassed, and pepper sprayed protesters throughout the two-hour-long march.
240 people were arrested out of the approximately 300 who attended. Last year’s march saw a similar number of arrests, but the protesters were in the thousands.
On Thursday, SPVM chief of operations Pierre Brochet vowed to strictly enforce P-6, a municipal by-law that prohibits masks and an assembly of more than fifty people unless dates, times, and route are declared to police beforehand. The organizers of COPB have never declared their route to police beforehand, in protest of the restrictive laws surrounding protesting in Montreal.
Several protesters were targeted for violating by-law P-6 before the start of Friday’s march at 5 p.m. Police then charged to disperse the small assembled crowd.
Protesters regrouped on the intersection of Clark and de Montigny before being pushed again toward lines of riot police on Ste. Catherine. The crowd was kettled shortly after.
Other groups of protesters began clashing with police to free their comrades but were eventually pushed away by clouds of tear gas.
Nearly 150 people were arrested in the kettle, including two journalists from The Daily and Concordia’s the Link. Three people were released and taken to an ambulance after they began having a panic attack. Protesters cried out in French that the kettle was “too tight” and that they were not given enough space to breathe.
Two buses from the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) were later brought in to transport the protesters to the police station. Arrestees were detained for several hours before being handed a ticket for violating P-6.
The journalists from The Daily and the Link were eventually released with the threat that criminal charges would be brought against them if they stayed at the demonstration. Journalists from the Montreal Gazette and the Concordian faced a similar situation minutes later.
Police later kettled another group of protesters near the intersection of St. Denis and Ste. Catherine. Targeted arrests were made throughout the demonstration, including the violent arrest of a protester made at Berri and René-Lévesque at 6:45 p.m., in which five police officers pushed one demonstrator to the ground.
The COPB founded the Montreal March Against Police Brutality in 1997 as a day for people to publically pay respect to those who have experienced police brutality, and to draw attention to the systemic targeting of marginalized members of the community by police.

Association waits for Quebec government approval
McGill’s undergraduate Philosophy students voted on Friday in favour of creating an independent, accredited student association.
The Philosophy Students’ Association (PSA), which represents all undergraduate students in the department, currently exists under the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS). The PSA started the process of accreditation in October 2012 to gain more control over its finances.
In February, the PSA finalized the first step of the accreditation process – incorporation – when it created an independent bank account.
Following incorporation, the PSA was required to hold a vote in which Philosophy students would decide whether they wished to accredit the PSA.
After a week of voting, the PSA announced on Friday that it received enough “yes” votes to continue with the process. The provincial government requires student associations to receive a “yes” vote from at least 25 per cent of its constituents; the PSA needed 92 students to vote in favour.
According to PSA President Jonathan Wald, the final vote count was of 107 votes total, with 105 “yes” votes and two “no” votes.
Until the provincial government approves the voting procedure, the results will be unofficial.
“We are not accredited yet; the Quebec government still needs to give its approval on everything, make sure that everything was done in accordance to their students, it will be, of course, official as of that moment,” said Wald.
The votes were counted on Friday at 5 p.m., after which the PSA sent emails to different campus groups to deliver the news.
“We alerted the AUS, SSMU, and the McGill administration that the vote has taken place and the results of that vote just to start that discussion,” said Wald.
AUS VP Internal Justin Fletcher told The Daily that the AUS has yet to discuss the issue, and will wait until the decision is official before they discuss their relationship with the PSA.
However, he did say that, “it is important that we respect that their students voted for it and it’s something they have been working hard on all year.”
The next step for the PSA, if the provincial government approves the vote, is to hold a GA in which students will create a constitution for the organization.
“The next step for us is to be holding a general assembly, which we are tentatively going to say is in two weeks, and that would be setting our fee and approving a constitution,” Wald said.
