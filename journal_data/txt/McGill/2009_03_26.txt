With a deficit of $10-million in the current fiscal year, McGill senators learned yesterday that the University must reduce its operating costs by $12- to $15-million in 2010, given current financial constraints.
McGill Provost Anthony Masi, who announced the need for cuts at yesterday’s Senate meeting, maintained that McGill’s financial plan is cautionary.
“I’d like to emphasize that our revenues are not declining, as they were in the nineties,” he said, “but some expenditures do need to be cut because costs are outpacing revenue.”
As part of an initiative to avoid rising costs, Masi suggested that $1.5-million be cut from teaching assistants and graders.
When Science Senator Andrew Ling asked for clarification on the ramifications of the cuts, Masi stated that greater numbers of students could be assigned to each teaching assistant, and that courses requiring conferences could be scaled down.
Masi also stated that $6-million could be saved by postponing pay-raises to faculty who would otherwise have taken place next year.
“As painful as it may be, we need to look for expenditures that we can cut without compromising our academic quality,” Masi said.
The University is also planning to cut $1-million in information technology spending. and to reduce faculty travel costs.
The Provost’s office hosted town-halls this semester on McGill’s economic  situation, and will also direct an “Economic Uncertainty Task Force,” this fall.

Pakistani human rights lawyer Asma Jilani Jahangir was awarded the Litvack Award for Aboriginal Human Rights Tuesday evening at Chancellor Day Hall for her “distinguished contribution to the defence of the rule of law and the protection of the individual against arbitrary power.” Janangir’s work has focused primarily on women’s rights, making her work a difficult feat in a country which seldom investigates crimes against women, according to Samantha Lamb, a lawyer who spoke about her experience interning with Jahangir.
Jahangir has also served as the UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Freedoms and founded the first law firm established by women in Pakistan.
She could not be present for the ceremony because of extenuating circumstances, but briefly addressed an audience of at least 70 through a pre-recorded video.
“Pakistan is usually associated with violence, Islamic militance, and military rule. On the one hand [we have] lawyers from civil society calling for the rule of law. [But] as we sit here, we have Islamic militants imposing their own interpretation of Sharia. The government just watches,” Jahangir said, describing contemporary Pakistan.
During an emotional discussion of internship with Jahangir, Lamb explained that her name is ubiquitous for Pakistani women, referencing women who risk their lives to come to Lahore seeking Jahangir. Both Jahangir and her clients have been threatened, though Jahangir has been luckier.
“It’s a testament to the rule of law [in Pakistan] that we’ve had clients killed on courthouse steps, and we know nothing’s going to happen,” Lamb said.

First Nation community downstream from tar sands experience abnormally high rates of rare cancers
Hundreds of students, professors, and concerned citizens flocked to Leacock 26 on Friday evening to hear how crude oil extraction in northern Alberta affects Montreal and North America at “Tar Sands: Stopping the flow of destruction.”
The event was headlined by key-note speaker Mike Mercredi, resident of the Cree and Dene community of Fort Chipewyan, Alberta – one of the areas most heavily damaged by the tar sands flow and Albertan oil extraction. It also featured speeches by Clayton Thomas-Muller of the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN), Macdonald Stainsby of Oilsandstruth.org, and Montreal-based journalist and writer Maya Rolbin-Ghanie.
“Tar Sands” began with a short preview of the film H²O, followed by a song by Thomas-Muller before his speech. He first described his work with IEN in Canada and the U.S., and then went into the issue of tar sands from a continental perspective, and the obligation to resist tar sand extraction.
“Tar sands is not just a problem in northern Alberta. It impacts the Arctic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean,” said Thomas-Muller. “People see it as a great monster, with a body and tentacles spreading across the continent.”
The complications associated with tar sand extraction  include the use of four barrels of ground water per production of a single barel of crude oil, and the production of five times more greenhouse gas than the regular extraction process, according to Greenpeace Canada. Extraction will also require cutting through the 4.3 million hectares of Boreal forest, under which the tar sands currently sit in Canada – and Greenpeace doubts that the area will be successfuly rehabilitated afterwards.
Thomas-Muller, a native of a Cree community in northern Manitoba, also noted the social impacts of tar sand extraction when he  raised the issue of “environmental racism.” He noted that First Nations peoples and communities are often the most heavily affected by oil refineries, and their contamination of their surrounding environment.
“The reality is, some of us are carrying a greater burden. Some of us are less privileged,” he said.
Stainsby then followed with a short speech about how the current economic recession was affecting large oil companies. He noted how companies cut costs by laying off local workers and hiring temporary foreign workers, who work for far less than the minimum wage.
“The system is trying desperately to save itself,” said Stainsby, who pointed out, like many of the other speakers, the importance of all North Americans to rally against large oil companies.
“People often see it as 1,200 people versus the most powerful energy corporations in the world, when actually it could be the entire communities of North America versus just a board of white men in suits,” he said.
Rolbin-Ghaine then spoke briefly about the local impact of the tar sands issue, describing how the Enbridge oil company was planning to launch the “Trailbreaker” pipeline project – which entails reversing the flow of oil between Montreal and Sarnia, Ontario, bringing over 230 barrels of oil to Montreal each day.
Mercredi was the last to speak, and began by telling the story of his own tragic and intimate association with tar sands refineries near his community. Mercredi recounted how he initially worked for the Syncrude company in Fort McMurray, Alberta – near Fort Chipweyan and the main site of tar sands oil extraction –  but when his uncle, and later his aunt and close friend died of a rare form of cancer, he quit his job with the company. He  now works to fight the oil companies in his area.
“We were indoctrinated to believe that [oil extraction] was progress, that the world was going to benefit,” said Mercredi. “The whole time, I just sat in my truck and watched them tear up the land.”
Mercredi talked about how the tar sands have contaminated the water around Fort Chipweyan, leading to 47 cases – six in one year – of a rare form of cancer that is usually only contracted by one in 100,000. He also used the term “environmental racism” to describe the impact of tar sands, because while the ratio would be considered an epidemic in Montreal, but it is largely ignored in Fort Chipweyan.
“There is genocide happening right now in our country,” he said. “Our graveyards are getting full.”
Mercredi concluded by calling on help from Montrealers, saying that North America’s future generations will eventually be affected on the same scale as Fort Chipweyan, unless steps are taken to stop the extraction of tar sands oil and develop alternative energy sources.
“The monster is now affecting you. All refineries bring is displacement, death, and destruction. They don’t help the economy or bring good jobs,” he said. “We have to make choices for the people yet to come, if they get here.”

McGill launched the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) on Monday with an inaugural conference focusing on the future of development.  ISID will absorb the existing Centre for Developing Areas Studies (CDAS) into its broader mandate to renew energy for development in a changing global context.
 Like CDAS, ISID will continue to be committed to multidisciplinary research, but with renewed emphasis on accountability and evidenced-based policy-making. It will eventually become home to undergraduate programs in International Development Studies, African Studies, Middle Eastern Studies and Latin American and Caribbean Studies, as well as a new Development Studies option at the Master’s level.
Phillip Oxhorn, the ISID Director, stressed that the energy of youth interested in development figures centrally in the new institute.
“ISID brings under one roof what universities can uniquely do while also capturing the energy and commitment of young people,” he said, explaining that the institute is a response to changes in the global order.
 Among those present was David Malone, President of the International Development Research Centre welcomed the launch of the institute by emphasizing the importance of their goal.
“Development is a dead serious business and should be treated with the seriousness it deserves,” he said, adding that it would be important for the ISID to break from Canadian precedent by sharing its success stories and disseminating its work more widely.
 The evening’s visiting keynote from India, Dr. Pratap Bhanu Mehta, President of the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, pointed to the timeliness of the ISID given the rise of China and India.
“It will not be a shift without conflict,” he said. “Both have a sense of growth and entitlement, they are not negligible.”
Mehta expressed hope that development policy-makers and practitioners to be more critical of the various assumptions held within the field, and called on the development community to be more aware of state actions.
“The most representative and participatory states are not necessarily the most responsive,” he said.
 Other attendees at the Institute launch include McGill President Heather Munro-Blum, McGill Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi, Canadian International Development Agency President Margaret Briggs, and International Development Research Centre President David Malone, the Right Honourable Joe Clark.
Roughly seventy people – mostly academics and practitioners – were present for the opening ceremonies at the Omni Hotel, with more joining in on Tuesday panels offering perspectives from donor agencies, non-state actors in development, various development institutions, and from youth practitioners, lasting throughout the day.
In his keynote address, Save the Children CEO David Morley acknowledged the privilege of speaking about poverty while conference delegates enjoyed a decadent three-course catered lunch.
Adam Matheson, U3 International Development studies commented on the elegance of the lunch.
“I understand the need to have a professional, formal conference to attract important speakers and guests; but a lavish 3 course meal while we listened to statistics on world hunger and squandered aid money seemed a little ironic.”

Shatner 103 renovations begin this June
After several years spent in Shatner 103, Caférama finally closed its doors on March 13 – several months after initially intended – as negotiations wound down between its replacement, Café Supreme, and SSMU.
The vacated Caférama space has been emptied of tables, chairs, and appliances, and awaits renovations set to commence in June. Café Supreme will be fully operational in July if all goes as planned, according to Café Supreme’s Marketing Manager Aisha Khabyyr.
The details of the negotiations between SSMU and Café Supreme, however, are still confidential, in part because not all aspects of the deal have been finalized, Khabyyr added in an email.
Previous commitments will still be honoured, however, including a provision of up to $5,000 in products at student events – such as Frosh – and a donation to improve the adjoining student lounge with their start-up costs. The café has also committed itself to hiring students, provided there is enough interest.
Khabyyr noted that Café Supreme intends to offer a wide variety of affordable products, including grab-n-go lunches and specialty coffees. The company is also committed to socially responsible practices – including the use of recyclable cups, unbleached napkins, and discounts for students who bring their own mugs.
Last April, Café Supreme won the lease to Shatner 103 in a controversial SSMU council decision – 13 to 12 – over a student-run space.
The student initiative didn’t have as detailed and clear a proposal as the corporate entity, according to José Diaz, next year’s VP Finance & Operations.
Last October SSMU President Kay Turner said  that there weren’t adequate resources on campus to give interested students information on operations of student-run food services.
Noting this, Turner said in October that a research group would be started to investigate situations at other universities, and compile a report with their recommendations to the McGill community.
Now, five months later, Turner said the process is just getting started.
“It will be a long-term and ongoing project that could be taken up by future executives. This is more of a planning year,” Turner wrote. “Should a student-run food service be a feasible option, we would more likely be looking at the spaces which will be coming available in the building on the second floor in the coming years, or evaluating other non-occupied spaces in the building.”

Bassem Eid is a Palestinian journalist and Executive Director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) – an independent organization founded in 1996 that provides impartial documentation of human rights violations by Palestinian political factions. PHRMG monitors Hamas, the militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, as well as its rival Fatah, which controls the West Bank and maintains a much closer relationship with Western governments. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both frequently draw information from PHRMG reports. Eid was awarded the Litvack Award by McGill in 1996, and has returned to Montreal to deliver a speech on human rights at the McGill Law Faculty tomorrow. The Daily caught up with Eid to get details on the Hamas-Fatah rivalry, the isolation of Gaza, and honour killings in Palestine.
McGill Daily: In your talk on Friday, the press release said you will discuss human rights violations by Fatah and Hamas. What have the recent trends been?
Bassem Eid:  The human rights record is very disturbing from both sides – Hamas or Fatah. When Hamas starts arresting Fatah people in Gaza, immediately Fatah in the West Bank starts arresting Hamas. When a Fatah prisoner in Gaza dies as a result of torture in Gaza, immediately the security forces in the West Bank start torturing someone to bring them to their death. The quality and quantity of human rights violations is equal on Fatah and Hamas sides. While Israel is bombing, shelling, and killing in Gaza, there are still armed gangsters from Hamas running after Fatah members, to kill them [as] so-called collaborators. Unfortunately the international community today [speaks much more] about Hamas human rights violations rather than Fatah.
MD: The PHRMG has many programs to monitor human rights – but what does the day-to-day fieldwork involve?
BE: For over a year and a half, Hamas has ruled Gaza. We really don’t have access to some information, especially when we are talking about honour killings, which is a very wide phenomenon in the Gaza Strip – even more than in the West Bank. We have another phenomenon: the killing of suspected collaborators in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas police. It becomes very difficult to investigate all these incidents. Sometimes besides the name and age of the person and date of death, we have no information.
MD: What about your experiences in the field? Have they been tedious or draining?
BE: To create human rights under this regime is not so easy…especially [because] the Arab government looks at human rights activists sometimes as spies, or [thinks] that they are in touch with the enemy…. The response is just to defame, to slander the organization rather than to give facts on what the report is talking about. We know about Syrian human rights activists who [have spent] almost over seven years in jail. In January 1996, I was arrested by Arafat’s order, but I was so lucky. I spent only 25 hours in jail.
MD: Why are there more honour killings in Gaza than in the West Bank?
BE: I think the West Bank is much more educated than the Gaza Strip. The West Bankers –  I consider them a multicultural people. A lot of foreigners are in touch with [them]. More West Bankers are travelling for education in Western countries. That’s [reflected] in their mentality, [and their] culture.  The most important thing is that in the West Bank people are less and less religious.
[For instance], a very courageous initiative began recently to put out a report on Palestinian gays and lesbians – which is not an easy step, because these things are completely prohibited by Islam. We started investigating this phenomenon mainly in the West Bank, but we couldn’t speak about it in the Gaza Strip. [Homosexuality] happens completely secretly within Palestinian society, so we are unable right now to [show] examples [of what] gay people or lesbians think about society, the laws.
MD: I read that the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to meet Israeli security demands has led them to illegally detain many of their own people. Can you comment on that?
BE:  The problem is that the international community tries to put more and more pressure on the PA [to increase] security – and security means that anything related to security must be coordinated with the Israelis. Now what does this mean? Sometimes they are much [better than Palestinians] at collecting secret information, that X is committing a suicide in Nablus. Now Israel doesn’t  want to invade Nablus, so they inform the PA, and they bring them to jail. As a human rights activist, I probably can live with that because I don’t want people to commit suicide, but on other side, what I am against is how they keep these people sometimes for months, years, without investigation, a fair trial, or without any judgement. Our problem is the lack of justice which is implemented by PA on the political detainees.
MD: You’ve written about a “one state” solution. Do you support it?
BE: I never supported it because I don’t think Israelis will agree on it. Israel is seeking a Jewish state, so with a one state solution, Israel [would] kill its dream. But Israel also refuses to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders, so what is the solution?…. I don’t believe in [the one state solution], but it looks like [over] the years it [has become] the only solution between Israel and Palestine.
MD: What will you discuss at your talk tomorrow?
BE: The Palestinian judicial system, and how it has to be reformed. Two years ago we received a fund for a proposal [to reform] the Palestinian judicial system from Japan. We conducted 12 different workshops in the West Bank, with law students from different universities, retired judges,  lawyers, and even some people from the security forces. People [are] very angry  [with] the Palestinian judicial system for one reason: this judicial system, which used to be an independent system, hasn’t really [been] independent under the PA. This is a problem, because rule of law will never be implemented without an independent judiciary system.
Bassem Eid will speak tomorrow from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Chancellor Day Hall, 3644 Rue Peel. A light lunch will be served.

Devimco scales down its $1.3- billion plan to demolish  historic neighbourhood
Economic pressures have brought the controversial redevelopment of Montreal’s historic Griffintown neighbourhood to a standstill.
The $1.3-billion redevelopment project, entrusted to Devimco Inc. last year by the municipal government, has already been scaled back 70 per cent due to economic woes. In February, Devimco President Serge Goulet told La Presse that without substantial municipal funding it could not go forward.
“If the City is not involved in one way or another, nothing will be finished before 2013…and the City needs these projects,” Goulet said in French.
The local government has so far steadfastly refused to either publicly accede to Devimco’s demand or announce that the project’s status is anything but full steam ahead. However, City Hall voted in mid-February to cancel over two dozen expropriation orders and land reserves set aside for the development, suggesting that the project has indeed been terminated.
In the two years since its introduction, critics ranging from bloggers to city councillors have decried the development plan – to raze most of the neighbourhood, and replace it with a  cinema complex, shopping centre, and concert venue – as a heartless makeover for a neighbourhood that was one of Montreal’s vibrant industrial hubs barely a century ago.
“What they attempted to do did not respect the historical context of the place,” said Avi Friedman, professor of architecture and cofounder and director of McGill’s Affordable Homes Program. Friedman condemned Devimco’s “big-box” design as yielding a community of blank walls that would not be livable or walkable.
“[The project] was a mix of suburbia and shopping centre that really doesn’t belong in Montreal…or if it does, we have enough of it.”
The city government also drew fire for entrusting an entire neighbourhood’s redevelopment to just one company. In a scathing press release last month, opposition city councillor Benoit Labonté castigated the current administration for relying too heavily on mega-projects.
Professor Raphael Fischler of McGill’s School of Urban Planning, an outspoken critic of the project since its conception in 2007, agreed that putting all of Griffintown’s eggs in one basket was dangerous and unhealthy.
“One single large project like Devimco’s… tends to create homogenous environments, and we know that diversity and spontaneity are what creates great neighbourhoods,” Fischler said.
According to Fischler, a city can redevelop a neighbourhood in one of two ways: from the top down, by entrusting the project to one developer and following one blueprint from the start, or from the bottom up, by allowing individual property owners to pursue their own projects over time. Fischler thought the latter method was neglected with the Griffintown development.
“We went too far to the one pole of single-handed redevelopment and too far from other pole of spontaneous development with more actors and diversity. You always need a little of both,” Fischler said.
He emphasized that while the organic bottom-up approach creates a sturdy blend of residences and activities, the City needs to set developmental guidelines to ensure progress and block undesirable elements like high-rises.
“I’ve seen a lot of small changes in the past three years,” said Mathieu Ouellette, a third-year student at the École de téchnologie supérieure located in Griffintown’s outskirts. While Ouellette expects to finish school before any major changes take place, he commented, “In five years, I think the neighbourhood will look very different.”
Friedman agreed that the neighbourhood’s proximity to downtown makes the land so precious that the City should not have trouble finding more sensible developers.
“It’s better to wait a little bit and get a good project than to get an eyesore that will last for decades.”

Brigadier-General Thompson welcomes a stronger civilian presence
For the past nine months, Brigadier-General Denis Thompson acted as commander of Canadian and NATO military operations in Kandahar province – where Canada’s mission in Afghanistan is primarily focused. With his rotation over, the General took some time with The Daily to reflect on Canadian misperceptions of counter-insurgency and the mission, as it evolves toward a more development-led approach.
The McGill Daily: What are the main myths that Canadians hold about the mission?
Denis Thompson: I’d say there are four myths. The first is that the security situation is in a downward spiral, which it is not. What I’m suggesting is that people’s perceptions have dropped off. The situation isn’t in a downward spiral because [Afghans] aren’t actively supporting the [Taliban].
Number two, the Taiban exist as a shadow government in the province. What they do is they have these travelling mullahs that go around and administer severe judgements, usually hanging somebody from a tree for not following the Taliban’s wishes. My catch-phrase is that a travelling hanging judge is not governance made. Governance is providing some services…and that’s not what the Taliban are about.
The third thing is that air strikes are indiscriminate. I’m responsible for casualties in Kandahar and the units there…and we always used air power in a targeted way and there were no civilian casualties as a result.
The fourth and final myth, is that everyone returning from Afghanistan is an emotional wreck, [because] 40 per cent of people, according to the papers, have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). But what they fail to make a precision on is that PTSD comes in certain grades [like obesity]. What’s changed in the Canadian Forces is that we make sure [mental health] services are now provided.
MD: In the past year, civilian presence in Kandahar – like diplomats and development workers – has doubled. Is it difficult to integrate civilians into military operation?
DT: They’ve more than doubled, and they were integrated when they arrived in August [2008]. There’s no plan to reduce [their presence. They’re important] because [they’re] the piece that delivers services to people that can change the quality of their lives. When you do this, you’re doing your part to win the mission.
MD: Does the military have a development role aside from creating a security parameter within which development and diplomacy workers can operate?
DT: In environments where the security situation is sufficiently tenuous, you really have to engage the military to make anything happen, or at least to supervise the work of locals doing development work. The important thing to take away is that while [a project] may be supervised by the military, it’s synchronized with the overall plan that is developed with civilians integrated into the mission.
