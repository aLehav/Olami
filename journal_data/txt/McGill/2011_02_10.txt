Only 84 students responded to the survey, the majority of whom were from the Faculty of Arts. Dallas Bentley, SSMU communications and publications manager, said SSMU has yet to formally organize the data
Several weeks ago, SSMU released a survey to the McGill student body asking their thoughts on the effectiveness of the General Assembly (GA). The results were posted on the SSMU website February 3.
Only 84 students responded to the survey, the majority of whom were from the Faculty of Arts. Dallas Bentley, SSMU communications and publications manager, said SSMU has yet to formally organize the data.
“I haven’t received any indication that a summary is the in works, but I’d imagine some type of synthesis would be created at some point,” said Bentley.
The survey asked students if they had ever attended a GA and, if yes, to give a description of their experience. The survey also asked students about the strengths and weaknesses of the GA, how well the GA fulfills its purpose, and the necessity of GA reform.
Responses varied. One student replied that the purpose of the GA was to “waste my time” and that they “[didn’t] even care enough to fill out the rest” of the survey. Another student wrote that, “although chaotic, I felt that it was an important place to hear my fellow students’ perspectives and become directly involved in student politics.”
Of the 84 respondents, only 35 had ever attended a GA.

Overreactions attributed to charged atmosphere surrounding SSMU politics
A general feeling of concern and distrust lingered amongst SSMU councillors after the interpretation of a General Assembly (GA) resolution authored by SSMU VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew ignited concern early this week. The controversy around the “Resolution Regarding the Society’s Investments” was sparked after poor wording caused some councillors to misinterpret the resolution as a motion to allow the VP finance and operations to circumvent SSMU regulatory bodies and invest funds unilaterally.
In actuality the resolution, moves to amend SSMU’s Lettre de patente – the  by-laws recognized by the provincial government – to include a clause stating that SSMU invests in corporations and the government.
“It just outlines our activities, and this is one of them – that we own shares, that we can own shares – and this is something that our lawyer told us to do,” said Drew.
“It doesn’t really change anything with our internal by-laws. Everything remains the same. It’s just to legitimize the investment portfolio,” he added.
SSMU councillor Maggie Knight attributed the misinterpretation to a phrase in the resolution describing how the VP Finance and Operations would manage the SSMU investment portfolio “in consultation with the Comptroller and the Corporation’s investment advisers.”
The resolution makes no explicit mention of the Financial Ethics Review Committee (FERC) – the only committee that currently exists to review SSMU investments.
From Knight’s perspective, the recent creation of a SSMU Board of Directors – which can technically override any decision SSMU Council makes – in addition to the censureship of SSMU President Zach Newburgh last week, contributed to the misunderstanding and the atmosphere of mistrust.
“I first read the resolutions on Friday, so I’d been up all night at Council, and obviously there had been some trauma associated with issues of lack of trust and so on and so forth,” she said. “So in that context this motion does look like trying to get rid of oversight, and trying to make it possible for the VP finance – in concert with whatever other executives he or she wants – to just make investments wherever they decide, without any oversight.”
Drew said he plans to amend the resolution at the GA today to change the resolution’s wording to include FERC, and any other committees that may be formed in the future, as bodies the VP finance and operations consults with regards to the management of SSMU’s investment portfolio.
“It just kind of adds clarity to [the by-laws]. I don’t want people confused that this is some kind of sketchy maneuver,” said Drew. “In no way is it intended to be.”
Drew said SSMU’s lawyer informed him of the need to add the clause in their by-laws three weeks ago, and therefore Council did not have a chance to look at the resolution closely before today’s GA.
Knight cited the lack of consultation and notice as another cause of overreaction.
“I don’t know the ‘why,’ so when you don’t know the intentions, and there’s this sort of general – paranoia is too strong a word – but a general defensiveness and lack of trust, then of course people are more alarmed by things,” she said.
Knight cited the need for improved communications be-tween Council and students as a way to avoid future misunderstandings of motions and SSMU legislation. “We need to be doing consultation. We need to be warning people of what’s happening so that people don’t freak out at things if the wording is alarming to them,” she continued.

Engineering Career Centre subsidized student networking trips to Calgary
Last September, Total E&P Canada Ltd (TEP), a division of the multinational oil company Total SA, gave a gift of $100,000 to the newly founded McGill Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (ISEAD).
ISEAD hasn’t officially launched, but has been sponsoring speakers and has provided a few undergraduate scholarships and fellowships. According to McGill Electrical and Computer Engineering professor Geza Joos, the newly appointed director of ISEAD, the institute will attempt to “make students sensitive to the whole issue of sustainability in engineering and design.”
The gift was donated after Jean-Michel Gires, CEO of TEP, gave an ISEAD-sponsored presentation in September titled “The Sustainability of the Tar Sands.” TEP has recently been the target of scrutiny by environmental groups including Sierra Club Canada after being approved to build Alberta’s ninth oil sands mine in Joslyn North.
Andrew Kirk, associate dean of Research and Graduate Education in the Faculty of Engineering, said that the money will be used to “support graduate and undergraduate fellowships and scholarships for projects of ‘general sustainability.’”
Kirk, the previous head of ISEAD, continued, saying, “The rest of money is going in to support the speaker series.”
Alex Briggs, an activist with Climate Justice Montreal and U2 Mechanical Engineering student, reflected on Gires’s presentation.
“The tar sands are the only thing that are sustainable to our society, because they are the only source of oil that is acceptable to the current world order. But that’s not the definition of sustainability that most people would identify with,” said Briggs.
“Anything that makes people more self-sufficient loses Total business, so they have a conflict of interest in making the world a more sustainable place,” he added.
When asked how Gires’s presentation fit into ISEAD’s sustainability mandate, Joos replied: “I don’t want to comment on Total’s commitment to sustainability, because it is not our purpose as an institute to make any comments either way.”
Briggs defined a sustainable system as one “where all negative effects that your life imposes on the world are balanced by positive effects at the same time.”
ISEAD, however, is keeping its definition of sustainability more fluid.
“We will accept the notion of sustainability that is offered to us, to the extent that there is an effort made to make it ‘sustainable,’ not necessarily sustainable indefinitely, but more sustainable, less destructive,” Joos said.
The institute will focus purely on the engineering and design aspects of sustainability, without providing a forum for talking about the societal aspects of sustainability.
“We are just focused on anything that is associated with engineering, urban planning, and architecture. We try to stay away from environmental issues that are covered by the McGill School of Environment, Law, Social Work, Psychology. These are essentially secondary issues,” said Joos.
“The institute itself will not take a position related to First Nations, Hydro-Québec, dams, et cetera. Those are more environmental type issues, social justice type issues,” he added.
As a new institute, ISEAD is still searching for a consistent mandate. Joos replaced Kirk as director on June 1, 2010.
ISEAD is currently focusing on seven key research and teaching themes, including sustainable manufacturing, design and construction of the built environment, and greenhouse gas capture and storage.
Joos explained one of the rationales behind researching greenhouse gas capturing.
“It is one of the solutions to keep on using coal. …At the moment, coal is by far the cheapest energy resource,” he said.
Kirk differed with Joos on this research direction: “Just because someone is doing research on something, it doesn’t mean that it is necessarily a good idea. There is an argument against this, in that if we build carbon sequestration systems, are we just giving high carbon fuels just a bit longer to run?”
Joos also confirmed that the research would not look at the effects of carbon capturing on the environment.
“The research at the moment is how to do it using the minimum amount of energy, how to extract the carbon dioxide,” he said.
Kirk questioned the commitment to making carbon fuels more sustainable, given rapidly depleting carbon fuel resources.
“I’m afraid that if we look at the Chinese economy and the Indian economy and look at how much coal they have available to them, I’m pretty convinced all that coal is going to get burned at some point. I think we need technology to capture it, unless we come up with a sufficiently low-cost form of energy. There isn’t really anything in the next ten years, as far as I see it, that’s going to cut it,” said Kirk.
Gires first came to McGill in March, when he gave a similar presentation at the “Engineers in Action” speakers series, put on by McGill’s Engineering Student Centre.
Engineering student services have a history of promoting oil and gas companies who operate in the tar sands. Last month, the Engineering Career Centre subsidized a group of students to visit Calgary to network with a number of these companies, including Imperial Oil, Shell, Syncrude, Suncor, and Total SA.
Darlene Hnatchuck, industry liaison for the Engineering Career Centre and organizer of this subsidized trip – named “Energy Tour” – was asked whether she vetted the companies that were asking students to come work for them.
“If we were to vet all of the companies, it would take us down a very slippery slope in terms of making decisions for adults,” she said. “So we don’t vet companies.”
Hnatchuck added, “we don’t have one focus, we are not tied to any one particular industry, because it is important to get McGill Engineering graduates to all industries if we want them to make a difference.”
The next speaker in the ISEAD speaker series is Pierre Duhaime, CEO of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, one of the ten largest engineering firms in the world. SNC-Lavalin has also recently been the subject of activist scrutiny, after engineering the G20 security fences in downtown Toronto, and providing 300 to 500  million bullets for the U.S. military after the ‘shock and awe’ attacks on Iraq in 2004. Duhaime will be at McGill on February 14.

FEUQ worried misallocation of funds could hurt students
Corrections appended Feb. 10
On February 4, Christian Paradis, minister of Natural Resources and Conservative MP for Mégantic-L’Érable, and Josée Verner, minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Conservative MP for Louis-St-Laurent, officially announced that the federal government will transfer $275 million to the Quebec government to compensate for its spending on the student loans program in the 2009-2010 school year.
In the government press release, Verner said that the “ announcement clearly demonstrates that our government and our provinces are working together in the spirit of co-operation to achieve concrete results for youth in the Greater Quebec region.”
Currently, the Quebec Student Financial Assistance Program and student aid programs in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories operate independently from the Canada Student Loans Program used by all other provinces. For Quebec and the Territories, the federal government provides alternative payments for their student aid programs. Friday’s announcement represents an increase of $150 million to these payments compared to the 2008-2009 school year.
Payments of $1.6 million to Nunavut and $2 million to the Northwest Territories indicate an increase of over 100 per cent. These recent increases to alternative payments correspond to ten per cent increases in student loans for provinces involved in the Canada Student Loans Program.
VP External Affairs Myriam Zaidi explained that when the federal government abolished the Millennium Bursaries scholarship two years ago, it decided to replace it with provincial transfers – money that would be directed at provincial student loans programs.
“The issue is that although the amounts were increased also last year, the provincial government didn’t reform the student loans and bursaries program in order to reflect the incoming money,” she said.
The allocation of these funds for post-secondary education ultimately fall within the purview of the Quebec government. Esther Chouinard, a spokesperson for Line Beauchamp, minister for Education, Leisure, and Sports (MELS) in Quebec stated that “it is up to the finance ministry to decide where the funds are sent.”
This allocation scheme has left many Quebec post-secondary organizations concerned that the funding may not reach students. These groups include the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) and the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ).
FECQ president, Léo Bureau-Blouin, applauded the federal government for increasing funding for loans and bursaries, but expressed reservations.
“We believe that students will never receive the entirety of the transferred [funds]…[Quebec Finance Minister] Monsieur Bachand said that the whole amount will not be given to Quebec students and we think it is only acceptable that the finance ministry use all these amounts to improve the loans and bursaries program because the needs are chronic…thus we want action taken now,” he said.
Bureau-Blouin was referring to an article published December 3, 2010 in the Journal de Québec. The article explained that the cheque from Ottawa will be in the hands of the Quebec Finance minister, who, according to a spokesperson speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Finance and MELS, “could decide to allocate a portion of that money for other purposes.”
Zaidi claims that “the onus is not only on minister Bachand but also on Beauchamp,” adding that,  “Last year, Minister Courchesne said that she would look into reform but didn’t do anything.”
Bureau-Blouin elaborated on the pressing needs facing Quebec students. “Tuition fees have been increasing for three years now… for example with the McGill MBA; we’re talking about a $40,000 Master’s degree… The Quebec government may announce another tuition increase that could bring our tuition fees to the national average,” he said. “The costs are increasing each year while the [funding towards] loans and bursaries programs is not being increased.”
Bernard Drainville, spokesperson for Intergovernmental affairs, indicated that federal transfers for post-secondary education are still far below former levels of investment.
“Before the cuts of…the Chrétien government in the early 1990s, Quebec would get $800 million more every year. Unfortunately, while Charest said the government would make this issue a priority in 2005, he got nothing, and, worse, now he has totally given up on this issue as yet the issue of funding universities is a major challenge,” Drainville said in a Quebec government press release.
Zaidi expressed that she has “little faith” in the current provincial government.
“This is the same government that cut 103 million dollars from student loans and bursaries system in 2005 … it took 100 thousand students in the street and millions [sic] on strike to put it back,” she said. “I don’t think their priority is accessibility at all… they want to increase tuition as well so we have to keep a close eye on them.”
Due to an editorial error, the Daily failed to obtain an interview from VP External Myriam Zaidi at press time. Her comments are therefore included in this web version only. An earlier version of this story also incorrectly printed that it took millions of students on the street to put back the 2005 students loans and bursaries cuts, in fact it took millions of students on strike.
Esther Chouinard was originally cited as the spokesperson for the Minister of Finance and MELS referred to in the Journal de Québec article. She is in fact the spokesperson quoted on behalf of MELS only.
Bureau-Blouin was originally attributed as the FEUQ president. He is in fact the FECQ president.
The Daily regrets the errors.

Controversy arises over possible favoritism in the CRTC
Last Friday, Minister of Canadian Heritage James Moore announced that Athanasios “Tom” Pentefountas would replace Michel Arpin as the new vice-chair of broadcasting on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
Pentefountas’s appointment has come under criticism, as he does not hold any of the qualifications listed in the job description for the position, including experience in the field of telecommunications. He is also friends with several high-ranking members in the Conservative party. The CRTC is an independent regulatory and supervisory body dealing with Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications systems.
The CRTC states on its website that it aims to serve the Canadian public to ensure access to “high-quality Canadian programming” and are mandated to “reflect Canadian creativity and talent, our bilingual nature, our multicultural diversity, and the special place of aboriginal peoples in our society.” The CRTC makes its policy decisions based on the 1991 Broadcasting Act and the 1993 Telecommunications Act, and is accountable to Parliament via the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
Pentefountas is a criminal lawyer and a partner in the Montreal law firm Silver Sandiford. Most of his work has been predominantly in the public sphere with his involvement in the Montreal Hellenic Chamber of Commerce and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association.
Pentefountas was also the president of conservative provincial political party Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) between 2007 and 2008, and ran twice as a candidate. Pentefountas is acquainted with Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s director of communications, Dimitri Soudas, and Conservative senator Leo Housakos. A press release distributed by Moore’s office on Friday did not mention Pentefountas’ prior political activity or any experience in the broadcasting industry.
Groups such as Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a non-partisan national volunteer organization, criticized Pentefountas’ appointment. Jim Thompson, spokesperson for the group, said that “nobody would want to see a political agenda at work in deciding which companies [or] points of view get a broadcasting license and which don’t.”
Moore also announced on Friday that Pierre Gingras, ADQ member and former MNA from the Blainville, Quebec electoral district, was appointed to the board of CBC/Radio-Canada.
“This particular government has seen fit to exercise its legal right to give the CRTC direction, and, on occasion, to overturn its decisions, on a frequency that is extraordinary and I would say unprecedented,” said Thompson. “I would also point out that [CRTC Chairman Konrad von Finckenstein’s] appointment expires in less than a year, and it has been reported in other media publications that there is pressure on von Finckenstein to vacate his position early in order to permit someone that is more friendly to the government to be appointed to that position.”
In early August 2010, a panel of individuals from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the Privy Council Office (PCO) and Heritage Canada interviewed eight short-listed candidates for the Vice-Chair of Broadcasting position. Three of these candidates were current commissioners on the CRTC.
Pentefountas was not among these candidates. Jean-Luc Benoît, spokesperson for Moore, told the Globe and Mail that Pentefountas went through a selection process conducted by the PCO and Department of Canadian Heritage.
During Question Period in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Libby Davies, NDP MP for Vancouver East, said, “Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives raised hell about patronage every time a Liberal was appointed by [Liberal Prime Minister’s] Paul Martin or Jean Chrétien, but now that they are in power all the outrage is gone. Connected Conservatives are appointed left and right, mostly right, to the Senate, to the Immigration and Refugee Board, to the CRTC, and now to the CBC. … [Harper] was very clear when he said: This has got to stop, and when we become government, it will stop. … Why was Liberal patronage a bad thing but Conservative patronage a good thing?”
In the same sitting Charlie Angus, NDP MP for Timmins-James Bay, accused the PMO of nepotism, asking, “How can [Harper] claim that Canadians whose only qualification is being a friend of the government are not in a conflict of interest situation?”
The office of James Moore has rebuffed accusations that the appointment was politically motivated. A staff member from Moore’s office told The Daily that he would not be available for comment.
Arpin’s five-year mandate as Vice-Chair of Broadcasting expired on August 31, 2010, and Moore informed Arpin, who has worked in the Canadian broadcasting industry for 47 years, that his mandate would not be renewed. In an interview with Le Devoir, Arpin said he was “disappointed” that the government did not consider the renewal of his mandate in spite of his interest in continuing the post. Since the end of Arpin’s mandate, he has agreed to join the Université de Montréal’s department of communication as a visiting professor.

Canadian university students mobilize against November “Too Asian?” article
T oronto, ON (CUP) —Criticism continues three months after Maclean’s published a controversial article claiming that white students find it difficult to get into preferred schools because Canadian universities are overpopulated by Asian students.
Brad Lee, a Toronto-based activist who spent twenty years as a journalist with the Toronto Star, got involved by creating a Facebook page entitled “‘Too Asian’? TALK BACK.”
“I’m against the way they portrayed my community,” Lee said. “It fails to recognize the diversity within our community. I’m a fourth-generation Chinese-Canadian. I’m Canadian through and through. What the fuck am I even doing in this conversation?”
The article was published in Maclean’s annual university rankings issue November 10, 2010. It agreed that for white students, going to a university highly populated by Asian students means higher levels of competition and “requires a sacrifice of time and freedom [white students are] not willing to make.”
The magazine has since changed the online title of the piece from “Too Asian?” to “The enrolment controversy.” However it has yet to issue a public apologize for the article.
Lee believes that the article is but another link to Canada’s silent but dark history of racism.
“There’s a veneer of multiculturalism and diversity,” he said. “Racism and discrimination is very much a part of Canada’s past.”
Following widespread criticism from student unions, readers and politicians, Toronto’s city council voted to request an apology from the magazine on December 16. Toronto was the third city to make such a request, following Victoria and Vancouver.
Florence Li, project coordinator at the Toronto chapter of the Chinese Canadian National Council, helped start a youth coalition against Maclean’s after the “Too Asian?” article was published.
“When I read it, I couldn’t believe that something like this could be printed,” she said.
Li helped organize the first meeting of the youth coalition in November through email and Facebook. Around 100 people showed up to the event.
“I have no doubt that there are some people that might think the same way,” said Li about the racial stereotypes articulated by students in the article. “For a national magazine to be asking that question is different from a few students thinking that classes are too competitive now.”
Though the article claimed that a predominantly Asian population in universities is a problem that most schools avoid discussing, universities across the country are holding rallies against Maclean’s.
Students atRyerson University held a rally titled: “‘Too Asian? Talk Back: Calling Media to Account” in January to discuss the media’s responsibility in perpetuating stereotypes.
Universities like McMaster, the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia have also held organized talks. The University of Victoria’s students’ society also passed a motion in late November to ban sale of the magazine if an apology was not issued.
Lee doesn’t have faith that Maclean’s will apologize any time soon.
“Maclean’s has issued a clarification and I don’t think they’re going to go any further than that,” he said. “I would like them to apologize, but I don’t think they’re going to.”
However, Li doesn’t believe the apology, is the main issue.
“Even if we don’t get it, we still consider this a victory,” she said. “The general idea is to raise awareness about this issue.”

Students looking to stay in Quebec for university could have alternative to CEGEP
The Lester B. Pearson School Board (LBPSB) – the largest English school board in Quebec – is considering the option of extending Grade 12 to Montreal students. Last September the LBPSB began offering Grade 12 to international students, mostly from Asia.
Traditionally, a student in Quebec takes five years of high school, then a two year program at a CEGEP, after which they qualify to apply to a three-year university program.
Over the past few years, graduates from English high schools have found it increasingly difficult to get into English CEGEPs because of the rising number of applicants and subsequent overcrowding in the schools.
We are addressing an immediate need,” said Marcus Tabachnick, LBPSB chair. “They don’t really have a place to go,” he added, speaking of students who find themselves stranded when they do not get into an English CEGEP.
According to Tabachnick, the program will be modeled on the curriculum of several Ontario school boards so that the LBPSB will not have to invent a curriculum.The program will also be self-financed through either the government, by a tuition fee, or by a combination of the two.
“We will not redirect funds from our Kindergarten-Secondary [Five] grants to cover the costs of this program,” Tabachnick explained.
Currently the Quebec school system dictates that Quebec students must complete CEGEP before applying to university. However, Tabachnick hopes that Quebec universities will agree to accept Quebec Grade 12 students, just as they accept Grade 12 students from other provinces once the program is up and running.
“I am not sure it would be right or fair to deny the same to Quebec students, as long as the course of study being offered is of university-entrance calibre,” said Tabachnick.
Sabrina Nicholson, a U1 Education student who attended Dawson College in Montreal for CEGEP, was skeptical about the Grade 12 option.
“High school was a joke. It was really easy, but CEGEP was so hard. I had so much reading to do and so much homework, and it was a really big switch. But to think if I went from Grade 12 to university, it would have been too much,” said Nicholson. “CEGEP is a good middle ground between high school and university.”
The LBPSB has yet to develop or write an exact proposal for the Grade 12 program. However, there has been a lot of interest from the local community since the program’s public announcement last week, according to Robert Mills, the director general for the LBPSB.
“It’s a collaborative effort here,” he said. “Everybody has been really supportive in making [Grade 12] available to international students and now making it available to local students,” confirmed Tabachnick.
He added that the program went public a little before the board was ready.
Regardless, he is hopeful that the LBPSB will make an official announcement about the program in four to five weeks.
