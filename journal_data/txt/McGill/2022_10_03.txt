The McGill community celebrates Indigenous peoples
On September 22, McGill hosted its 21st annual Pow Wow on campus – a resumption of the in-person gathering after it was held virtually for two years. A Pow Wow (sometimes written as powwow) is an Indigenous gathering where people can sing, play instruments, and dance. For Indigenous peoples, it is also an opportunity to honour their histories, reconnect with friends and family, and heal as a community. Many see this as a way of reasserting their identity; celebrations like Pow Wows were banned by the Indian Act in 1876, and they did not become officially legalized until 1951. McGill’s annual Pow Wow is the largest event organized by the First Peoples’ House. Since 2001, children, students, community members, and more have come together annually to celebrate Indigenous cultures. 
The event began with speeches from the organizers, dancers, and the two masters of ceremony. Their words honoured and thanked the Creator for all things given to us, ending with a message of love and understanding: “I wish you all a good day, and peace and love in your hearts.” 
After the speeches, the Grand Entry began, where all the dancers entered the circle while the host drum and singers performed a song. During the Grand Entry, the audience was asked to stand as a sign of respect and to refrain from taking any photos. Elders – along with veterans and retired police officers – were honoured throughout the day. Children were also supported throughout the dances and encouraged to participate in any way they could. 
A highlight for many attendees was the inter-tribal dance. During this dance, everyone was invited to enter the circle regardless of nation and whether or not they were adorned in regalia. Many young people happily participated in the dance and shared in Indigenous culture. The event concluded with a gift giveaway and the retiring of the flags. 
The Pow Wow was part of the Indigenous Awareness Weeks activities taking place at McGill from September 19 until Truth and Reconciliation Day on September 30. The goal of Indigenous Awareness Weeks is to “provide a space to amplify Indigenous voices and perspectives on campus.” Events included speeches, seminars, movie screenings, and more. 
Many McGill groups who work with Indigenous students were at the event, including the Indigenous Students Alliance. Leah Louttit-Bunker from the ISA explained that the club is necessary at McGill to show Indigenous students they are supported and welcomed. The Indigenous Students Alliance has the goal of bringing forward “a sense of community and to act as a home away from home.” It also offers “a welcoming and inclusive community for Indigenous students and allies.” Louttit-Bunker noted that Indigenous students and allies alike are always welcome to join the ISA or participate in any of their events. 
The McGill men’s lacrosse team attended the event to show support and honour the creators of lacrosse. The McGill radio station CKUT was also tabling at the Pow Wow, and its representatives highlighted their two radio shows specifically focused on Indigenous peoples. The All Kanien’kéha Show, rebroadcasted from Reviving Kanehsatà:ke Radio 101.7FM, is entirely in Kanien’kéha, the Mohawk language. The station also has a show broadcasted partially in Inuktitut and partially in English. Representatives of the station emphasized the importance of uplifting voices that have been historically underrepresented. 
McGill University has a long history of injustice towards Indigenous peoples. James McGill enslaved Indigenous and Black people, and his fortune was made through the colonial system, which inherently oppresses Indigenous peoples. This history continues to impact all aspects of education at McGill University. Members of the McGill community have called for McGill to take further action.  
After the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published its final report in 2015, McGill’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education created 52 calls to action. To date, only seven of the initiatives have been completed. The completed actions, among others, include changing the varsity sports team name, implementing a school-wide land acknowledgement, and creating an Indigenous Studies minor program.
Delbert Sampson, a member of Secwepemc First Nation, was one of the dancers at the Pow Wow. He spoke of his love for Pow Wows and dancing: “I come to all the Pow Wows I can.” However, he noted that it’s not all about enjoyment: “I dance for the residential school survivors and all the babies they have found.” The discovery of the remains of 215 children at Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia is particularly close to Sampson, as he attended that school for seven years. He now focuses on using his knowledge of his culture to help others, as, he says, “our people need to come back to our ceremonies.” Sampson also reflected on how nice it is to see younger people coming and sharing the culture. He said it makes him so happy to hear “grandpa, I want to dance.” 
Sampson explained that, while events like the Pow Wow are great for the community, they do not take the place of real systemic change. When asked if McGill was taking the right steps forward, Sampson answered “it is important to see action instead of just words.”

Thousands of students have been skipping school in a globally coordinated movement
Interviews conducted with the help of Titouan Le Ster
September 23 marked another Friday of international mobilization for global climate action, as part of the The Fridays for Future youth movement. Thousands of  protesters took the streets in a united call for climate and social reparations in over 450 locations across the world, including in Montreal.
This strike took place six weeks before COP27, and two weeks before Quebec’s general election. The protest is emblematic of the high stakes faced by political parties. Whereas Benoit Charette and CAQ representatives were escorted by the police to leave the march after being booed, some parties were absent, and others were actively engaging with their supporters. In a conversation with the Daily, Green Party leader Alex Tyrrel affirmed the need for drastic changes in government policies: “we have a government that is making long-term environmental sacrifices for some short-term economic gains. This shows a lack of consideration for the future, for young people, for the protection of biodiversity and for the fight against global warming.” He further emphasized the political urgency that led his party to develop an extensive agenda for social and political justice, expressing that “we must take systemic actions and implement societal changes through the initiative of the government. People are more likely to take individual actions if they know it is a group effort.”
Marie-Eve Leclerc, the mobilization manager at Equiterre, was also at the strike. Equiterre is a non-governmental organization that seeks to motivate citizens, organizations and governments to take action towards an ecological transition. Leclerc agreed on this need for political change: “climate change is happening now and it affects our daily lives, our health, our safety, and the economy as well, with all of the climatic disasters that will befall us. Vote for politicians and political parties who care about the environment and who will address the climate crisis in an ambitious, serious way.” Moreover, she highlighted the importance of political participation, and the role that Equiterre plays in this global cause: “we are asking the government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt Quebec to climate change now, because we cannot stop it, but we can slow down the pace. There are 48 proposals on seven different subjects that our Green Coalition suggests and sends to politicians.”
For Shirley Barnea, CEGEP student and part of Pour le Futur Montreal, the climate urgency is strongly intertwined with social justice. The most pressing demands behind these movements are a mandate to end fossil fuel emissions by 2030 in Quebec and a wealth tax to invest in a social safety net. She explained how those measures show the proximity between social and climate justice: “First, a lot of the oppression that many people are facing is caused by the same kind of mindset that’s causing the destruction of nature. For example, the mindset of domination – just like during colonialism. Then, wealthy countries are the ones that are greatly responsible for climate change. The global north has historically emitted 92 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but the global south is suffering 90 per cent of the effect. That’s an injustice.” As the march began, she stressed the social nature of the movement by asking all present political parties to remain at the end of the group.
Leading the way were an Innu family, coming all the way from the Matimekush-Lac John community to denounce the effect of climate change on their community, and the consequences of pollution on their lakes. In the front were students and young adults. Most shared a common dissatisfaction with the lack of initiative from the government and from big corporations. But, what brought them to the streets was also a strong hope in the future and the belief that individual actions matter: “I think we will be able to change things through protests and the mass effect, by putting pressure on the government and showing that the majority of people want political change,” said Alexia, a CEGEP biology teacher. Mathilde and Chloé, two CEGEP students, also decided to skip class and come to the strike to demonstrate their will to take action, for the current and for future generations. Despite being 17 years old, they emphasized the importance of going to the polls on October 3: “I think it’s good for eligible voters to go and vote intelligently for people who will take this matter in hand and consider the environment.” McGill students were also strongly present. The Daily met Aglae, a student in environmental science, who encouraged McGill University to further diversify its investments in environmental-friendly causes, while us students should ensure that we act as we can at our level. “I think this strike is important to show how we can act and that we can act for the climate,” she said.

Providing an affordable food option for the McGill community
On September 15, Midnight Kitchen held its first in-person free lunch service since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The program distributes 50 vegan and nut-free meals every other Thursday at 1:00 PM in the second-floor cafeteria of the University Centre.
Midnight Kitchen is a worker- and volunteer-run collective that strives to combat food insecurity and provide food aid on McGill campus and beyond. Their larger goal is to serve as an alternative to oppressive, profit-driven systems of food production and work toward social and environmental justice, according to its mandate. 
Midnight Kitchen has been forced to scale back their operations since March 2018, when renovations on the University Centre building began. As a SSMU service funded by student fees, the organization operates for free out of a kitchen in the SSMU building, but it had to pay to relocate to a smaller kitchen in St. Henri until the building reopened in September 2021. According to an article from 2019 in the Daily titled “Banking on Our Bellies,” Midnight Kitchen shifted from serving about 200 to 300 meals Monday through Thursday to serving about 300 meals for pickup weekly. 
The free meal program was only further reduced by the pandemic. In an interview with the Daily, Midnight Kitchen staff member Delali described their early pandemic programming: “When the pandemic started, we paused for a bit and started a food bank instead as an emergency response to COVID alongside a different meal delivery service in partnership with several different groups.” Midnight Kitchen also received a grant to create a temporary emergency gift card program, which provided some students with one-time gift cards to grocery stores. 
Midnight Kitchen’s free meal pickups were reinstated in the Fall 2021 semester with about 30 meals bi-weeekly, but these ended in the Winter 2022 semester.
There has been great demand since the return of the service in the Fall 2022 semester. Alina Shimizu, U1 Science, told the Daily about her experience at the free lunch service on September 29. She said that “there was a big lineup before it was even 1:00, so the people who actually got there on time didn’t even get meals […] even though I arrived five minutes early, by the time I got to the front, they just had one side left.”
When asked about increasing the number of meals they serve, Delali explained that Midnight Kitchen is “looking to expand but in a sustainable way. We pre-package our meals and try and make it so our staff don’t feel overworked and people don’t burn out.” In the case that staff members get sick, they “want to make it so that it’s still possible to meet the minimum that we said we’d serve, but we’re looking to slowly scale up a little bit through the semester.”
Delali noted that the free lunch services were “as busy as we expected considering there’s not a lot of great affordable food options on campus.” Another Midnight Kitchen staff member, Aishwarya, explained that, “the need is always greater than we can provide […] as there are other obstacles to getting affordable meals near or on campus.”
Shimizu agreed that “food options on campus in general are overpriced, and now that I don’t have a meal plan, I don’t eat on campus because it’s financially smarter to make my own meals […] More services like free lunches would be awesome.” She also added that “the fact the service was vegan was definitely really impressive because some of the on-campus meal options don’t even have a vegan option, just vegetarian.”
These sentiments echo those described in “Banking on Our Bellies” three years ago. The authors pointed out the lack of affordable or diverse food options on campus, citing the 2014–2015 SSMU Student Experience Study that revealed that about 80 per cent of McGill students felt food options on campus were unaffordable. However, they argued that this hasn’t always been the case. In 2001, “nearly every faculty had their own student-run cafeteria or convenience store, the profits of which would help fund the faculty student association” that would serve food at a lower cost until 2000, when “McGill made moves to consolidate food services under the control of the university administration.” This privatization culminated in McGill’s 2004 exclusivity agreement with the Chartwells brand, which switched to Aramark and then back to the Compass Group, the company that operated Chartwells. The authors claimed that this privatization led to the decrease in diverse, affordable food options.
Midnight Kitchen has sought to fill the need for food security initiatives on campus since its inception in 2002, but, as Delali put it, “as a single organization of five staff members, we’re not going to solve food insecurity on McGill campus and McGill does nothing to address it.” Aishwarya clarified that “McGill should make campus more accessible for people, but technically our formal relationship isn’t with McGill but the SSMU … there’s maybe something to be said about food security being a greater goal in their agenda if students feel like that’s a particular issue they want addressed.” 
Midnight Kitchen is running a fee levy referendum in the winter in order to continue providing food aid to McGill students –  and to potentially obtain more funding to expand their services to run more programming or hire another staff member. 
They currently offer three other kinds of programming McGill students can take advantage of: discretionary funding for initiatives whose goals they support, solidarity servings (free catering for community organizations), and a garden to grow their own ingredients. Their community garden on the east side of Burnside Hall operates from May to October, and students are welcome to volunteer Mondays 3:30-4:30 PM, weather permitting.
When the garden closes at the end of October, Midnight Kitchen will begin serving meals weekly, depending on how busy their other programming is. The free packaged meal service schedule is posted on their website: https://midnightkitchen.org/calendar. 
If you are interested in seeing what Midnight Kitchen has to offer, their next free meal service will be held on October 13 at 1:00 PM. They ask students to wear a mask to keep the community healthy and the service running.

New provisions for French language use will impact anglophone access to justice.
This past month, Doug Mitchell, along with a team of lawyers, challenged Bill 96 as being unconstitutional. Justice Chantal Corriveau heard their arguments and granted a stay on two sections of Bill 96. The stay, which is a legal pause, applies to two sections of the Bill: Section 9 and Section 208.6. 
Adopted in May 2022 by Quebec’s National Assembly, Bill 96 is the province’s legislative effort to affirm French as the only official language of Quebec. It sets new requirements for the use of the French language in court proceedings, education, healthcare, and other sectors. 
Éric Bélanger, a Professor of Political Science at McGill University, explained the logic behind the Bill in an interview with the Daily. “In general terms, there is the need to reinforce the language legislation in place due to the changing social fabric of Quebec. As the latest data from the Canadian Census revealed last month, the prominence of French in Quebec has been slowly but surely eroding over the past two decades.” He described that the government of Quebec could not just stand by as the French language declined. Bélanger also explained the potential impacts that the Bill could have on anglophones and allophones. “Most non-francophone communities are likely to face greater constraints integrating into Quebec society, especially given the relatively short amount of time imposed by the government to comply with the Bill’s provisions,” he said.
While the Bill still allows pleas in English, Section 9 outlines that those attending court must attach a French translation prepared by a certified translator. In the application for judicial review, Mitchell argues that this places an even higher cost for those in court, causing the expenses to outweigh potential benefits and deterring people from seeking justice. The lawyers also argued that it was unconstitutional to be forced to access the court using both English and French, instead of either of the official languages. 
The lawyers  cited further concerns in Section 54.c over many regions of Quebec having a lack of certified legal translators, something which they argued will cause unfair legal delays. In cases that require urgency, French must be used to avoid these delays, therefore removing the option to litigate in English. The lawyers thus argued that these provisions severely limit the ability of anglophone people in Quebec from accessing justice. Citing  Section 133 of the Constitution Act  (1867) – which guarantees access to courts in English and French –they concluded that the provision which effectively requires legal procedures to be entirely in French is unconstitutional and violates the rights of Canadians. Justice Corriveau agreed that the conditions were met, and chose to suspend the aforementioned sections of the bill until the case could be heard by the Superior Court in November. 
In an official press release, the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke stated that “it is pleased with a Quebec Superior Court Judge’s decision to suspend two provisions of Bill 96.” As a primarily English speaking community, the Kahnawà:ke would be negatively impacted by these regulations. Indigenous people are already overrepresented in the Canadian penal system, so a law limiting language use would potentially pose more barriers to justice.
Human rights lawyer  Julius Grey, has identified several other concerns with the Bill. In order to ensure that documents are actually in French, the Office Québécois de la Langue Française potentially has the right to search private documents that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. Grey highlighted this idea in his upcoming legal challenge to the Bill, arguing that these new regulations disadvantage people who have been charged criminally. Grey further describes that without the requirement for judges to be bilingual, anglophone participants may not be able to participate fully in the trial, as they may not be able to understand the general court proceedings nor be able to defend themselves adequately. 
When asked about the approximately 150 business leaders who have requested for the application of the Bill to be suspended, Quebec Premier Francois Legault explained in a press conference that there is a three year transition period built-in to the bill. He also highlighted the importance of maintaining French in Quebec businesses: “We have to be careful about the language of the people working.”
In the same press conference, a reporter questioned the necessity of “asking immigrants to learn French within six months.” Legault explained that the system doesn’t force citizens to learn French, it merely makes them access government services in the official language. He stated “most of the governments in the world, they start sending information in the language of the country. What we say is that we will make an exception for six months.” 
However, future challenges to the Bill may be difficult, as Bill 96 proactively includes the notwithstanding clause to guard against arguments saying it does not follow the constitution. Dr. Dave Guénette, of the McGill Faculty of Law, explained in a Q&A session with the Centre for Constitutional Studies: “It is widely known that the notwithstanding clause can be used preemptively and that doing so does not require any form of justification.” “It is important to recall that the notwithstanding clause, in its current form, was part of the compromise that made possible the constitutional agreement of November 1981.” However, Guénette cautioned against a potential political price to pay: “Overriding fundamental rights and freedoms is a major political decision and should be done only when it is an absolute necessity.”
