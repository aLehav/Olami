Annual Take Back the Night rally highlights sexism, rape culture
On Friday around 80 people marched from Bethune Square near Concordia University to the front of the SSMU building to rally against gendered violence. Take Back The Night was organized by the Centre for Gender Advocacy’s A Safer Concordia Campaign. The demonstration is part of a series of events that have taken place internationally since 1975.
“When I came to Canada I thought I found a safer space, but I found that the violence was just more subtle,” said Sophia Starosta, originally from Brazil, and a member of Action Santé Transvesti(e)s et Transsexue(le)s du Québec (ASTT(e)Q). “As a woman, as a trans* person, as an ex-sex worker, I encounter violence made by men against all kinds of people who are not men and that’s why I’m here to try to bring awareness to that.”
The Reproductive Justice League Choir opened the demonstration with songs on rape culture. Families of Sisters in Spirit, ASTT(e)Q, Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS), and Women in Cities continued with speeches on gendered violence.
“We spend so much energy answering what rape culture is that we often miss out on opportunities to ask what would a world free of rape culture look like.”
“About one in four students experience sexual assault during the course of their post-secondary experience. About 80 per cent of these are women and so we realized that there was this epidemic of sexual violence,” said Bianca Mugyenyi, Programming and Campaigns Coordinator for the Centre for Gender Advocacy.
Rape culture was a highlighted topic at the demonstration. “I think rape culture is the culture of disbelief of the survivors, victim blaming, and systemic sexism,” said Julia Nadeau, an advocate for the Safer Concordia Campaign.
“The more widespread these marches and other awareness campaigns become, the greater the challenge there is to rape culture,” said Mugyenyi. “People are talking more about rape culture, and realize that it’s not acceptable to normalize, minimize, excuse, and condone sexual assault.”

Aurélie Lanctôt, a member of the McGill Law Feminist Collective, also felt the demonstration was an important step towards combatting gendered violence. “It’s important to manifest in public spaces, to remind people of issues that might not be apparent but still exist.”
Aimee Louw, another demonstrator at the event, also brought up the issue of gendered violence towards women with physical disabilities. “Over 60 per cent of women who have disabilities will experience some form of gendered violence. […] There is often a feeling that women with disabilities will take any form of sexual attention they can get and that is […] a stereotype that is damaging to a lot of women.” Louw told The Daily.
The controversy regarding McGill’s silence over the sexual assault scandal involving three football players was a topic of interest to several of the demonstrators. “Obviously gender violence is a huge issue and it’s largely ignored by the McGill administration. […] Misogyny manifests itself in so many ways and there’s a need to keep discussing that,” said Kai O’Doherty, member of the Union for Gender Empowerment.
“People are talking more about rape culture, and realize that it’s not acceptable to normalize, minimize, excuse, and condone sexual assault.”
Another demonstrator, Sabrina, felt the University could play a larger role in addressing gendered violence. “I think [universities] should have rigid rules in place where there is zero tolerance for assault at any time. In order for people to feel safe, they have to know that if something [happened] to them it would be dealt with.”
Jordana, a representative of SACOMSS, told The Daily, “We spend so much energy answering what rape culture is that we often miss out on opportunities to ask what would a world free of rape culture look like. […] We come together and march for a world free of fear, where the world belongs to everyone.”

SSMU-led forum seeks students’ opinions on cultural appropriation
This fall the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) implemented a Costume Campaign to eliminate costumes deemed “explicitly problematic” from SSMU’s 4Floors event, according to a report by the SSMU Equity Commissioners, after an incident involving an attendee in blackface at last year’s event.
However, the Campaign itself was controversial as it depicted students in the offensive costumes it was trying to ban. Concerns were also raised on the process of approval for costumes. On November 19, SSMU held a public forum to discuss the Campaign and the issues associated with its implementation.
While students at the forum generally agreed that the goal of the Campaign was to prevent cultural appropriation, students had difficulty agreeing on what cultural appropriation entailed.
SSMU’s Costume Campaign laid out several questions to consider when dressing up, including, “Does your costume mock or condescend historically oppressed people and/or cultures? Does your costume caricature oppressive, historical, and/or current conditions of marginalized groups or persons in a way that may serve to trivialize them?”
Some of the examples provided by SSMU included popular Disney characters such as Pocahontas and Jasmine.
SSMU Equity Commissioner Justin Koh gave more criteria. “One of the questions [asked by volunteers] was does your costume require you to paint your skin colour to match the skin colour of a different race?”
Some of the attendees at the forum claimed that the application of face paint was an inadequate definition of cultural appropriation. Despite discussion, the attendees did not agree on where cross-cultural exchange transitioned into cultural appropriation.
One attendee asked the question of whether cultural appropriation could be perpetrated by people of colour. While attendees believed this was possible, SSMU forum facilitator Annie Chen disagreed.
“Cultural appropriation stems from very problematic ideas due to privilege, the privilege that white people have,” Chen told The Daily in an email.
Students at the forum voiced concerns on what they saw as the relative subjectivity of the volunteers in deciding which costumes were culturally appropriative and which were not. SSMU volunteers at the forum mentioned that they received as little as 20 minutes of training before being asked to judge costumes at the door.
Koh told The Daily in an interview that it was a matter of judgment. “We really left it to the conversation between the individual coming in that costume and the volunteers.”
An issue discussed at the forum was the possibility of censoring individuals who identified with the culture portrayed in their costume. This issue became especially problematic when such cultural associations were not immediately known to volunteers. Students at the forum were undecided on the issue.
“You have cases where an Indigenous person came in a costume that was part of their culture, and they felt they had the right to wear it that night. Who are we as someone who didn’t identify as Indigenous to say that that’s appropriative?” Koh said, referring to an incident that occurred at this year’s 4Floors.
Opinions at the forum were varied as to whether the Campaign was a success, especially the targeting of costumed people at the door. One participant alleged that attempting to discuss the issues of cultural appropriation with intoxicated party-goers was unlikely to succeed.
The Equity Commissioner doubted the campaign’s effectiveness, and hoped it would prove unnecessary in future years.
“We don’t think that this is necessarily the right way to go, this is [only] a pilot project,” Koh told The Daily, later adding, “Maybe with a more educated student body we wouldn’t have to check costumes at the door.”

Centre for Gender Advocacy resists discriminatory law 
The Centre for Gender Advocacy announced Wednesday that they will be challenging the Quebec Civil Code in Quebec’s Superior Court. Article 71 of the Code stipulates that a trans* person must be over the age of 18, a Canadian citizen, and have undergone a sex reassignment surgery in order to change their gender on official government identification. The Centre is calling for these three stipulations to be abolished.
“The Quebec Civil Code attaches sexual organs to gender, which in turn attaches certain stereotypes,” said Marc-Antoine Cloutier, executive director of the legal clinic Juripop, in French.
“These laws cause deaths, we should not forget that. When you impose a law like this, you force trans* people to out themselves to everyone.”
The Centre asserts that the law is discriminatory against trans* people. According to Gabrielle Bouchard, Peer Support and Trans* Advocacy Coordinator at the Centre, the law sends the wrong message to trans* youth.
“It asks young people to live out their adolescence at school with a gender dichotomy and legal identity, [only] in order to reach the age of 18 and get a sex change,” said Bouchard. “Currently the rate of suicide among trans* people is 40 per cent, and this is largely due to the fact that they cannot live their lives like everybody else.”
The Centre also challenges the law’s enforcement of sex reassignment surgery in order to change one’s gender on legal documents.
“When we talk to young trans* people, we promise them that when they reach the age of 18, if you want to stop being discriminated against, you have to have a sex change,” said Bouchard, “We are talking about mandatory sex changes. These include a complete hysterectomy or vaginoplasty. Right now they don’t have a choice.”
Bouchard explained that both these surgical procedures lead to sterilization. “Right now we don’t talk about the people who refuse to go under the knife to biologically alter their bodies. They only exist in the background.”
According to Bouchard, the decision to take this issue to courts is a preliminary step to making Canada a safer place for trans* people. “Our society is gendered and there is no way on earth that [we] will change that. […] We have to work within a binary society, where there is either male or female,” Bouchard said. “What we’re hoping to achieve with this is at least giving somebody the possibility to choose which one they’re more comfortable with or the least uncomfortable with.”
The Centre initially filed a complaint with the Quebec Commission of Human Rights and Youth Rights in August of this year. According to Bouchard, the Commission confirmed that the current law is discriminatory. However, the Commission was unable to take the case without a clear victim.
“We’re taking it to court [because] the process of modifying the law has been dragging on forever. If the [members of Quebec’s National Assembly] cannot come to a conclusion on this, then we have to use the tools that have been known throughout the years to be working,” said Bouchard.
“We are talking about mandatory sex changes. These include a complete hysterectomy or vaginoplasty.”
“Today we have in our hands all the elements in order to pursue a judicial case which will happen in the coming weeks,” Cloutier added. “Because we cannot accept the discrimination of these people, they have to integrate and live peacefully in society the way they are.”
On November 25 and 26, Quebec’s National Assembly will debate potentially striking down some of the articles. Even if they make changes to some parts of Article 71, Bouchard stated that the Centre would still go ahead with its legal challenge to the other parts as well.
“The Minister of Justice knows the law is discriminatory,” said Cloutier. “If the Minister of Justice does not take responsibility for this case next week then that will cause a great delay.”
“These laws cause deaths, we should not forget that,” he added. “When you impose a law like this, you force trans* people to out themselves to everyone.”

School was “accredited with conditions” last fall  
The McGill School of Social Work seeks to have “a focus on social justice on issues facing vulnerable and disadvantaged people,” as their website states. However, after a human rights complaint was filed by a student of the School, reports written by several groups of students urging structural change at the School have been obtained by The Daily.
Schools of social work across Canada are reaccredited every seven or eight years, unless they receive an “accreditation with conditions.” “By having the program accredited, a social work degree in one part of Canada is the same in another part of Canada,” said Ross Klein, Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE) Anglophone Co-Chair of the Commission on Accreditation (COA).
McGill’s School of Social Work received an accreditation with conditions in 2012 due to concerns raised by students to representatives from CASWE. This means that the School will have to go through the reaccreditation process again in 2016. The School has operated under accreditation with conditions since 2005. Before that, it was accredited for the full seven-year term for at least four terms.
The three conditions outlined by the COA include developing mechanisms for clear channels of meaningful participation from community members and students, providing support for students in their field placements, and ensuring that “concepts of social justice and anti-oppressive practice are clearly and effectively taught in both the [Bachelor] and [Masters] curricula.”
“We need to make [our criticisms] public because we are not being heard.”
Four reports compiled by various students at the School were submitted to CASWE during their site visit in the 2012 fall semester. The site visit from CASWE was a follow-up to a self-study report that the School is required to write and send to the Association. “The reason [for the site visit] is to see if what [the School] wrote in their self-study is actually implemented on the ground,” Klein explained.
According to a letter from Klein addressed to then-Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum, which was received on March 11, 2013, “While students spoke favourably of their contacts with faculty members and provided high ratings in evaluations and surveys, they were strongly critical of communications within the School, particularly about their ability to have input and influence.”
The letter also urged for the “incorporation of concepts of social justice and anti-oppression into the curriculum.”
“A lot of schools struggle with issues of teaching anti-oppressive practice, a lot of schools struggle with issues of diversity,” said Klein.
According to Klein, “as part of the self-study, the School is expected to consult with students.” Wendy Thomson, Director of the McGill School of Social Work told The Daily that there were difficulties assembling with faculty and students when preparing the self-study during the student strike, but still claimed that all identified stakeholders in the School were consulted during the process of writing the self-study.
A member of the Racialized Students Network (RSN) – a group that was identified as a major stakeholder by the School in its self-study – argued the contrary. “The RSN has never been included on a systemic or structural level in the School’s decision making. It has not been invited to any administrative bodies [or] any student council bodies. It [was] not consulted during the creation of the self-study report.”
“It’s almost laughable how intensely skin colour is felt by students of colour. There is a very large group of racialized students in the School of Social Work and I would go as far as to say that all of us feel racism in the School in some way.”
The RSN submitted one of the four reports to the CASWE accreditation site visitors in response to what they called “a deeply felt need for change around race relations in the School.” The report was compiled by two or three students, and contained the work of many more contributors, in January 2012.
Megann Ayotte, a contributor to McGill Social Work Students Strike Report, one of the four reports, also said, “The problem that people had with the self-study was that no one was consulted.”
“It’s almost laughable how intensely skin colour is felt by students of colour. There is a very large group of racialized students in the School of Social Work and I would go as far as to say that all of us feel racism in the School in some way. That may not be intentional on [the]part of the faculty but it is certainly tangible in the classroom experiences [and] the field experiences,” said the member of the RSN.
The RSN report sought to make recommendations to the School on how it could implement certain equity policies to “foster dialogue” at the School, “develop and advocate for policies and programs that support the retention and successful graduation of racialized students,” and so forth.
A similar report was submitted to CASWE at the time of the site visit as well. Called “Towards a More Social Justice and Human Rights Oriented School of Social Work,” it was written as a “response to the McGill Self-Study Report for the CASWE-ACTFS Accreditation Standards,” as indicated on the report.
Three of the nine recommendations made by this report call for the School to integrate anti-oppressive practice more clearly in the School. A contributor to the report and undergraduate student in the School at the time the report was written said it was prompted by a “group of students who wanted to see an ideological shift in the School.”
Presented by a collective of former and present McGill School of Social Work students, and written by around 15 to 20 students, this report was endorsed – though not created – by the undergraduate Social Work Students’ Association (SWSA) and the Social Work Association of Graduate Students (SWAGS). In total, over 60 students and alumni endorsed the contents of the Social Justice report, according to a presentation on November 7 organized by SWAGS.
No palpable policy change has been made in the School since these reports were submitted last year, according to the RSN member who spoke to The Daily. The School is required to submit a progress report no later than November 1, 2015 to the COA, showing how the conditions, mentioned earlier in the article, were met.
Lucyna Lach, Associate Professor in the McGill School of Social Work and Associate Dean (Student Affairs), told The Daily, “We’ve been working on an ongoing basis on infusing those principles throughout the curriculum. They’re not labelled as [anti-oppressive practices]. I think they aren’t as visible because they perhaps are not called [anti-oppressive practices]. But they are there, I can assure you that.”
“We did get a lot of good things from the students who talked to us,” Thomson added. “Some students, for reasons they can tell you better than me, felt they would prefer to deal with a third party than talk with us. That’s disappointing for us. We like to talk to the students directly.”
However, Ayotte said, “There are these empty opportunities for communication to happen but there’s no effort to really involve people.”
In the Social Justice report, a contributor echoed this sentiment, stating, “We need to make [our criticisms] public because we are not being heard.”

Student feedback key to defining the future space
The start of the 2014 Winter semester in January will mark the opening of the new Student-Run Café (SRC), which will be located on the second floor of the Shatner building. The potential development of the second floor as a student space depends on the success of the SRC, as well as the ability of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) and the student body to define their vision for the space.
On November 21, SRC manager Josh Redel and head chef Kathleen Bradley hosted an open discussion meant for “[students] to talk about quite literally everything that makes up this student-run cafe.” However, there was one thing missing: students. Redel talked to The Daily instead about the SRC’s plans for student input.
“I think feedback loops are the most important thing [about student space],” said Redel. “A lot of space at McGill is designed and built once – they do have a lot of interesting mechanisms to talk with students and faculty about what it will be, but then it’s built and done. It is really important for [the space] to be able to constantly transform to meet each year’s new needs.”
There will be a second open discussion event on November 26, where Redel hopes the SRC’s plans for developing the café past a counter into a student space will be discussed. At this event, the SRC Mission and Vision Statement will be open to student development.
There are many steps involved in turning the café into a larger student space. As outlined in a recent report from the SSMU Operations Management Committee, SSMU VP Finance and Operations Tyler Hofmeister maintained that the SRC is not at a stage where it can expand immediately.
The report stated that rushed expansion would be risky for several factors: for one, the SRC is not comparable to other second floor vendors in terms of revenue forecast. There is also low traffic on the second floor. According to the report, the SRC’s success cannot be reliably determined in the three months it would be operational before other second floor tenants have the chance to renew their leases.
In an email to The Daily, Hofmeister elaborated, “It is too early to predict the costs associated with a much larger project because SSMU has not defined what that larger project will look like.”
The report also stated that the SRC would have to open a large-scale McGill Facilities project in order to make changes to the second floor space. In an email to The Daily, the SSMU General Manager Pauline Gervais elaborated on what opening this process would entail.
“McGill will ask us to open a ‘project’ with Facilities […] A project manager is assigned […] and [will] communicate with me to get an overview or the scope of work to be done. The project manager will contact an engineer and an architect to get drawing plans when ventilation, air conditioning, heating, [and] lighting are involved with the project. McGill Facilities will also provide a budget to be approved by us before moving on.”
A Facilities project is also a cost in itself, according to Hofmeister. In an email to The Daily, Hofmeister added, “McGill Facilities charges SSMU an 8 per cent administration fee on all McGill facilities projects, which increases the cost of many building improvements substantially.”
The SRC will address the expansion process, according to Redel. “We do intend to expand [… in] the phase next semester, we’re going to start really big conversations about the space and what it should look like, hopefully with more attended sessions, doing high-level conceptualization down to floor plans, and then we’ll pass that along to McGill and open a project.”
