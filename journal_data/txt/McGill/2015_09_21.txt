Divest’s action to continue until Board of Governors freezes fossil fuel investment
This story is in development. The article will be updated to reflect any changes that may occur. Latest update was on September 21, 12:31 p.m..
On September 21, Divest McGill, a campus environmental justice group, set up camp at Community Square in front of the James Administration building to ask the University to freeze all its investments in the fossil fuel industry.
Julianna Duholke, Divest McGill organizer, explained that Divest McGill’s camp will stay in place until Stuart “Kip” Cobbett, Chair of the Board of Governors (BoG), recommends a freeze on fossil fuel industry investments to the BoG.
“For the last two and a half years, we’ve been working with Kip and the Board to ask them to completely divest from fossil fuel industries, and on their part we’ve really seen little concrete action,” Duholke told The Daily.
Duholke said, “This is really quite atrocious on behalf of McGill that they continue to invest in fossil fuel industries. They like to claim that they are a sustainability leader, and I think that’s the face that a lot of McGill students see, but, really, they have over $70 million invested in these fossil fuel industries.”
Chloé Laflamme, another Divest McGill organizer, also expressed her disappointment with the University’s lack of concrete action with regards to divestment.
“The climate crisis is a very, very serious issue that we have not been taking urgent enough action [on]. We should’ve been taking action a long time ago. Even now, the fact that we’re doing this now is late. Our administration is not responding to our calls for action,” Laflamme told The Daily.
Laflamme continued, “We’ve been giving them petitions, giving them over 150 pages of research. But still, we have seen no concrete action, or no concrete steps toward divestment on their part. So we’re camping in to show that this issue is very meaningful to us. Not only is this a show of how seriously we take the issue, but it’s also to put pressure on them.”
Dean of Students André Costopoulos explained that freedom of expression and demonstration are protected under the Charter of Students’ Rights.
In an email to The Daily, Costopoulos said, “We’ve had positive interactions with Divest so far over their current action and everyone has been very cooperative. The BoG, [its] CAMSR [Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility] committee, and many other stakeholders in the community, including student groups, are continuing the conversation about divestment from fossil fuels.”
Over the past two and a half years, Divest McGill has been trying to convince CAMSR to accept environmental degradation as social injury. To this end, members of Divest McGill have handed the BoG two petitions and a 150-page research brief on the issue of climate change.
Since then, CAMSR has updated its terms of reference to include grave environmental damage in its definition of social injury; however, a clear decision on divestment has not been made.
In June 2015, the BoG decided to involve the Royal Society of Canada, a national research council composed of distinguished scholars, to research the potential implications and consequences of divestment.
However, according to Duholke, the BoG has changed its mind once again.
“They were going to do a study into climate change and whether there was a causal relationship with social injury. They decided to scrap that study after realizing there was already mounds of research on it, which we had presented to them. And now they are just back to simply deliberating,” Duholke told The Daily.

Skillshare workshops aim to mobilize and organize
Between September 21 and 24, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) organized an anti-austerity week, holding various workshops and skillsharing events. In addition to the ones covered here, the events included various discussions on the history of mobilization in Quebec, a bike-powered film screening, and a presentation by CKUT on the importance of community radios.
“So You Want to Go on Strike: A Skillshare for Departmental Student Strikes at McGill,” was held on September 16. The workshop discussed the different skills required to stage a successful departmental strike, covering a variety of topics from organizing a general assembly, to dealing with unsympathetic professors.
In order to have a successful departmental strike, the facilitators explained, organizers must set up accessible general assemblies, deal with possible opposition from student executives or faculty, and effectively communicate with other students in the department. This means coordinating the distribution of flyers, posters, and other forms of communication to reach as many sympathetic students as possible.
The facilitators stressed the importance of solidarity throughout a strike, which includes having well-defined roles for every student during the strike, so no one feels overwhelmed. For instance, if planning to picket, organizers should know which students are comfortable with physical aggression when confronting other students or police officers.
The facilitators also pointed out that a successful strike needs to provide material and emotional support to the protesters. For example, during the Women’s and Sexual Diversity Studies Student Association (WSSA) strike in April of 2015, this meant booking a room with food and couches, where students could go to recover, calm down, and talk to a counsellor if necessary.
At the end of the discussion, the facilitators noted that ultimately the only way to gain these skills is to take part in a strike.

“Intro to Street Medic Training,” a first-aid workshop on medic training for demo safety, took place on September 16. The workshop gave an introduction to the basic skills necessary for dealing with first-aid situations specific to the context of demonstrations, such as washing out pepper spray from eyes, minimizing damage from tear gas, and treating shock and panic.
This workshop targeted those involved in demonstrations, but many of the skills and much of the information presented were broadly applicable to anybody who lives in downtown Montreal, where many politically charged events take place and where police employ tear gas to control demonstrations. For example, as tear gas is a volatile chemical weapon that does not discriminate between demonstrator, journalist, police, or civilian, it could be useful for all residents to know to wash themselves thoroughly after exposure, as oils in the skin can make the burning sensation worse.
The workshop also highlighted the distinctions in dealing with different chemical compounds. Pepper spray, unlike tear gas, is an oil – water will cause the chemical to spread and lead to intense pain. According to the workshop, the most effective way to treat pepper spray is to immediately rinse with Maalox (milk of magnesia, available in pharmacies), especially if eyes were exposed.
A central theme was the idea of consent in a medical context. The workshop emphasized that many of those needing medical attention at a demonstration may find themselves unable to receive help at hospitals for legal reasons, making it critical for street medics to respect the decision of a wounded person if they do not wish to seek medical attention at a hospital.
The workshop also discussed post-demonstration care, especially after a traumatic or violent incident, and stressed the long-term commitment involved. It was emphasized that many of those involved in demonstrations are from marginalized communities, often unable to seek formal health services for legal reasons. As such, it was said that giving protesters access to the care and support networks they need from their peers remains crucial.

“Working from the Roots: Student/Worker Solidarity Against Casualization on Campus,” was held on September 15 and was facilitated by Molly Swain, president of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE), and Tyler Lawson, Collective Agreement Coordinator of the Association of McGill University Research Employees (AMURE).
Lawson defined casualization as “the process wherein full-time workers” – those who receive benefits such as long-term contracts with higher wages, healthcare, and pension – “are replaced by part-time, casual workers who do the same work for less.” As a result, Lawson said, “constant anxiety [over job security] induces passivity.”
Swain argued that casualization is driven largely by austerity, saying that “all of the proponents of austerity are profiting from the confusion of household debt with governmental debt.” Swain also depicted government debt as an “entirely necessary” aspect of capitalist economy, unlike household debt, arguing that “the emphasis on paying back [government debt] is purely ideological.”
“Capitalism binds people through indebtedness,” Swain said, especially students who, as job opportunities appear more scarce, go into thousands of dollars of debt, working unpaid internships. Through strikes and organized movements, students attempt to resist austerity and the debt it incurs. However, students are not considered workers under Quebec law, and are therefore excluded from unions. Groups who may refer to themselves as unions representing the interests of students – like SSMU – are not, in fact, classified as such, and have little to no collective agreement or bargaining power. Lawson proposed that “undergraduate work should be valorized in the economy,” and that students are workers and deserve pay and unionizing power as such.
“Not only are [undergraduates] crucial to the university just by being here, [they] are also actively producing labour in [the] classrooms,” stated Lawson. The workshop also explored the intersectional history of unionization. Both Swain and Lawson proposed that it is and has always been in the best interest of the capitalist state to exclude certain groups in the history of labour and unionization. Although pivotal to the history of labour in Canada, Black and Indigenous people are often discounted and ignored in history as the first unionizing labour forces. Swain said, “Discounting the work of oppressed peoples perpetuates a white supremacist and patriarchal society.”
As the workshop drew to a close, facilitators and participants discussed ways to disengage from such a system, suggesting potential alternatives where both the exploitation of workers and the resulting labour unions would be non-existent. Swain emphasized that “collective mobilizing is the most powerful source of social change.” In a direct challenge to the assumption that millennials cannot stand up against the rise of austerity and casualization, she stated, “We are told precarious work is the work of the future. I am not saying we should be looking to the [pre-industrial] past. […] I am suggesting this rhetoric is a lie.”

Council adopts traditional territory acknowledgment, rejects bee party funding
The Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Council held its first meeting of the academic year on September 16. Council discussed ten motions, including the adoption of an Indigenous territory acknowledgement statement and the approval of two referendum questions asking for fee increases.
Other motions passed included bylaw changes, equity amendments to the Society Activities Manual, and the establishment of an intellectual property working group.
Council discussed two motions, both of which passed, regarding the acknowledgement of McGill’s location on unceded Kanien’kehá:ka territory. One of the motions mandated PGSS to support “the efforts of students and groups at McGill University seeking the adoption of a traditional territory acknowledgement by the university administration,” and the other concerned the adoption of such an acknowledgment by PGSS itself.
Explaining the motion, External Affairs Officer Bradley Por said, “For quite some time, Indigenous students on campus have been working to get the University to acknowledge that it is on traditional territories and [they] have received quite a bit of resistance.”
Por said that one of the reasons why the University was hesitant to adopt an acknowledgment was due to a fear of land claims. The acknowledgment has been edited over time to mitigate these concerns.
“There’s not a chance of that happening. There are two legal memos that the First Peoples’ House has got written saying that there isn’t a real fear of that,” Por said.
The two motions were adopted without debate.
Council passed a set of motions regarding two questions to be asked in the upcoming PGSS referendum, which will take place from October 19 to 23. One is to increase PGSS’s membership fee from $32.59 per term to $35.85 per term, and one is to increase the Special Projects Fund (SPF) fee from $4.60 per term to $6.60 per term.
According to Financial Affairs Officer Behrang Sharif, PGSS is facing a deficit of around $611,000.
He explained that in May 2012, PGSS decreased its membership fee by nearly $20 as part of an overall budget restructuring aimed at making the budget less complex. Speaking to The Daily, Sharif said, “I think that they [had] good intentions, and they did good for the Society in the long run. There [were] just [a] few miscalculations.”
However, a subsequent long-winded disaffiliation battle with the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) led to substantial legal expenses and the payment of around $300,000 in membership fees to CFS under protest. PGSS is currently trying to reclaim these fees in court.
The SPF was created in 2013 as an additional funding source for special projects that could not otherwise get funding under the PGSS budget constraints.
Both referendum questions were approved by Council. If the referendum questions pass, Sharif expects the deficit to be recuperated in five or six years. If the questions fail, it could take PGSS approximately 15 years to overcome the deficit if the association’s expenditure rates stay the same.
One motion requested that “$600 be allocated from the Events category of the 2015-16 budget to be spent on providing food for Green Drinks events and a housewarming party for the Thomson House bees during the Fall 2015 academic term.” PGSS introduced a bee hive last year as part of its sustainability mandate.
Explaining the motion, PGSS Environment Commissioner Amir Nosrat said, “As you know, we’ve been having a lot of budget cutbacks. […] Discussing this with other commissioners and execs, I think there is a consensus that there is a problem with the way the budget is created, which does not reflect the mandate that is given to the commissioner.” Nosrat also pointed out the difficulties of maneuvering through the budget for people who may not be familiar with it.
In response, Sharif brought up the fact that commissioners have access to a fund for discretionary spending, and that the $600 could be procured from it.
“The discretionary fund is something less than $3,000 that, somehow, has to be jointly negotiated between the execs and commissioners – that’s a lot of people. Whereas, the events category, from what I can see, is about $115,000, and I don’t have a lot of [understanding] as to how that money gets allocated,” Nosrat responded.
Sharif, however, said that the funds mentioned in the budget had already been allocated, and procuring the $600 would mean re-allocating a portion of the budget. In the end, Council voted against the motion.

Student mental health, finances discussed
On September 17, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council held its first meeting of the academic year. Executive members, committees, and senators updated Council on their work over the summer and their involvement in upcoming projects, including anti-austerity mobilization, student mental health, finances, and provincial student federation affiliation.
Council also adopted the interim provisions for committee membership and the standing rules for the 2015-16 Legislative Council. A motion regarding the creation of ad-hoc committees was also adopted after the nominations for the Board of Directors.
Council discussed the anti-austerity week that took place last week. “Anti austerity is going to be huge […] this fall,” said VP External Affairs Emily Boytinck at Council.
Speaking to The Daily, Boytinck said, “Anti-austerity week is incredibly important because of the momentum that the anti-austerity movement is gaining in Quebec.”
“This fall, public sector unions are entering negotiations and some are mobilizing toward a strike. Other student associations, notably those who are members of [Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ)], are also mobilizing toward an unlimited general strike,” she continued.
Boytinck also emphasized the importance of McGill students’ involvement. “Countless demonstrations have already been called and more are anticipated to be coming. McGill students have historically participated less in Quebec social movements, so it is essential that our students are given the opportunities to learn and resources to better develop campaigns so that we can more fully participate in the anti-austerity movement this fall.”
In her report, VP University Affairs Chloe Rourke reported on SSMU’s progress on creating a student mental health and wellbeing program.
Rourke proposed to develop and implement a cohesive model among support services and student groups. Speaking to Council, she said, “There has been a lot of changes […] in terms of student services and student provisions to meet increasing demands.”
Rourke also commented that in order to have an efficient system, Council must “ensure that [mental health and well-being programs] are student driven, and focus on the students.”
“We can focus on more proactive preventative health promotion to the number of students that have to go seeking interventions that are highly intensive because they are in crisis mode,” said Rourke.
Rourke also talked about the Mental Health Awareness Week, which will take place between October 15 and 25, and is organized by the SSMU Mental Health Committee. It will concentrate on raising awareness about mental health and illnesses and on advocating student consultation to propose changes to existing McGill policies and practices.
According to VP Finance & Operations Zacheriah Houston, SSMU’s current financial outlook is optimistic, as Frosh registration numbers are estimated to give approximately $2,000 above the projected revenues. In addition, Houston stated that SSMU is “on track” to meet its target of $21,000 in profit from mini-courses, and is satisfied with SSMU’s revenues from its investment portfolio for the 2014-15 academic year, with the entire portfolio now worth approximately $3.5 million.

New minor to span departments, geographical regions
Fall 2015 marks the first semester that McGill is offering an interdisciplinary Medieval Studies minor. This new minor concentration consolidates courses pertaining to the medieval millennium (approximately 500 to 1500 C.E.), including history, literature, art history, religion, philosophy, Islamic studies, and Jewish studies.
About two years ago, associate professor of English Literature Michael Van Dussen, associate professor of Art History Cecily Hilsdale, and Faith Wallis, a history professor, began the discussion of creating a minor in Medieval Studies. According to Hilsdale, this “brain child” was conceived from the pre-existing abundance of resources and interest in medieval studies at McGill. She said, “All of our classes are always full and we just thought we should combine forces and make a minor program that would be comparable to some programs in places like [the University of Toronto].”
Hilsdale added, “Because [Wallis] and [Van Dussen] and I work with manuscripts themselves very closely, we were envisioning the minor as a way of really kind of building the specialization and teaching students how to work with manuscripts, because it’s really specialized language to describe and read manuscripts. [It’s] not just something you pick up on.”
One such student is Kyung-Seo Min, a U3 English Literature and Art History student who intends to study medieval art in graduate school. In an interview with The Daily, Min said, “I would have loved to have seen the Medieval Studies minor when I was in my first year here.”
Unfortunately, this minor is materializing too late for Min. “[The development of the minor] is important to me because I’d [have liked] to have that background in medieval studies in my undergraduate career, […] have that foundation at least as a minor before I go on to pursue either a masters or PhD,” Min continued.
Indeed, according to Hilsdale, the minor concentration is “a way of lending an official status” to the transcripts of students who pursue an interest in the medieval period during their undergraduate degrees.
“You just have to explain yourself a lot more and do a lot of justification if you’re going to try to get a program – passed through the channels – that doesn’t make money, that doesn’t have a very clear through line to a profession, and that doesn’t align obviously with wider public interest.”
Van Dussen added, “One of the things we’re also hoping this minor will do is give students who do want to go on to graduate school –which isn’t everyone – in this area, a credential on their transcript. […] And that can be a real asset for students who do want to go to medieval studies on the graduate level.”
For Van Dussen, who is also the director of the program, the interdisciplinary aspect of the new minor is vital, particularly due to the temporal distance of the medieval period from the modern perspective. “To even get your bearings [in the medieval period] you have to have an interdisciplinary approach. […] That becomes less crucial the more recent you get,” he said.
Min, whose passion for medieval studies stems from its unique mixture of work with manuscripts, architecture, and art, also spoke highly of the program’s interdisciplinary nature. “I think it’s really awesome [because] you don’t have to be an English [Literature] major to fill all of the requirements or anything. So it’s very inclusive.”
“I think the most exciting thing about the minor is that it’s global,” said Hilsdale. “[When] a lot of people think about medieval studies, at least art historically, […] they think Gothic cathedrals,” she said, adding, “It is not that. It is classes in Islamic studies [as well]. I teach a class on Constantinople right now. It is Jewish studies. It really is […] the global Middle Ages.”
Throughout the process of getting the minor approved, Van Dussen found that as with many humanities concentrations, there was skepticism as to whether a Medieval Studies program was warranted. “You just have to explain yourself a lot more and do a lot of justification if you’re going to try to get a program – passed through the channels – that doesn’t make money, that doesn’t have a very clear through line to a profession, and that doesn’t align obviously with wider public interest. That’s disappointing,” said Van Dussen.
According to Van Dussen, the minor simply synthesizes pre-existing courses, with only the addition of one new capstone course, Interdisciplinary Seminar in Medieval Studies (MDST 400). This means no additional resources had to be budgeted for the minor, eliminating at least one roadblock from the path of these medievalists.
The minor isn’t the end of the path, however. “I would like [the minor] to mature over many years, and then we’ll start the long process of establishing a major,” Van Dussen said.

Students complain about unsatisfactory renovation efforts
When its doors opened in August 2012, La Citadelle was McGill’s priciest residence, and remains so – over the past three years, the rent costs have increased by almost $200, reaching an all time high. Documents acquired through an access to information (ATI) request by former McGill student Christopher Bangs, who delegated the rights to review the documents to The Daily, show that the hotel-turned-residence cost McGill over $20 million more than anticipated, and it is alleged that students are bearing the brunt of the cost.
The steady increase in the size of the undergraduate class has left McGill scrambling to fulfill its guarantee to provide housing for all first-year students under the age of 22. For instance, in 2008, a shortage of residence space forced McGill to rent an entire apartment building for students lacking housing.
Between 2003 and 2010, in order to address these pressing housing issues, McGill bought three hotel properties and converted them into Carrefour Sherbrooke, New Residence Hall, and La Citadelle.
“McGill was not the first university that bought hotels – a great example is the University of Toronto, they have also hotels at the downtown campus,” said Mathieu Laperle, Senior Director of Student Housing and Hospitality Services.
“Living in that sort of a residence is not the same as living in a first year dorm at any other university.”
In 2009, the Globe and Mail reported that the prices of hotel properties had hit an all-time low since the 1990s, and that it had become commonplace in Canada for universities and colleges to convert hotels into residences to alleviate housing shortages.
“We’ve been able, with the three hotels, to add more than a thousand beds,” Laperle continued. “The occupancies have been close to 100 per cent, so the fact that we have the hotels is an asset for McGill University.”
But some students feel that there is a steep price to pay for McGill’s adherence to its housing mandate. “Living in that sort of a residence is not the same as living in a first year dorm at any other university,” said Olivia Cantwell, who lived in La Citadelle during the residence’s first year of occupancy. Cantwell said that living in a converted hotel meant students sacrificed the sense of community with the “classic dorm experience.”
In addition, the actual costs of living in residence is quite high. In August 2012, at the time of its opening, a double room at La Citadelle cost students $1,059 per month, and a single room cost $1,194 per month. In 2015, the rent costs have increased to $1,260 per month for a double room, and $1,442 per month for a single room.
“[This] just means so many people can’t afford to do the residence experience,” said Cantwell.
The only reason Rez rents should be raised, in my opinion, would be inflation, or the Rez is getting significantly better or nicer – not because the building is falling apart because McGill messed up.
Emily Stanford, a U3 student who also lived in La Citadelle in 2012, argued that the increase in rent costs might have to do with the unexpected costs associated with the renovation of the building.
“The only reason Rez rents should be raised, in my opinion, would be inflation, or the Rez is getting significantly better or nicer – not because the building is falling apart because McGill messed up. That’s not fair,” Stanford said.
Stanford also pointed out that it is possible that students may find La Citadelle prohibitively expensive, which may lead to a stratification among residences, based on students’ financial situations.
“People with more money would obviously go to Citadelle over Upper Rez, and for that reason, you kind of just get a completely different feeling,” said Stanford.
According to an estimation document dated October 28, 2010, the initial total cost of transforming the hotel into a residence was estimated at $16,717,000. By the completion of the project in March 2013, as stated in another accounting document, the final cost was $37,166,125 – more than double the initial estimation.
A memorandum to the McGill Board of Governors, dated March 11, 2013, justified overshooting the estimate, stating that “this was to cover the cost of additional work associated with site conditions which, as the work progressed, were revealed to be worse than anticipated.”
In the environmental evaluation of the building preceding its acquisition, traces of asbestos were found in the mechanical insulation, drywall compound, textured finish, plaster, and vinyl floor tiles. The evaluation also noted the presence of mercury vapour in lamps, lead in some paint and wiring connectors, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) – a carcinogen linked to developmental issues – in light ballasts. Moreover, “heavy growths” of mould and concrete “deteriorated to the point that one could crumble it with the fingers” were found.
Robert Couvrette, Associate Vice-Principal of University Services, assured The Daily in an email that the hazardous materials have since been removed, the building is currently up to code, and “all materials are safe and actually have a very low VOC [volatile organic compound] content.”
Laperle asserted that the building was a “good investment,” in part due to the difficulty of finding reasonably-priced land to purchase close to the downtown campus. “It’s not a new property, it’s not a new building; but for today, for us, it’s like we were able to build from scratch,” he said.
Students who lived in La Citadelle in the first year following the renovation tell a different story.
“They hadn’t finished construction for the first six months that I was in there,” said Stanford. “Floors two and three also were definitely not done […] the [cafeteria] wasn’t done, also the first floor little sitting area was not done. The only thing that was done was the rooms.”
Stanford also stated that work on the parking level hadn’t even started. In the due diligence final report acquired through the ATI request, structural consultants noted that “the underground parking garage levels require the most immediate and important structural attention,” noting extensive concrete damages, leaks, and presence of lead-based paint.
Cantwell explained that the La Citadelle Residence Council, of which she was VP Finance, had applied for compensation for students in late September 2012 on the grounds that study areas and the kitchen were still under construction.
“It just took a really long time to get any compensation and [the University was] really not very helpful, nor did they want to give us anything – it was like, ‘here, here’s some money, be quiet,’” Cantwell said.
Laperle dismissed the six months of overlap between renovation and student habitation, saying “it’s normal to see some repairs maintenance, but [that’s] not something major to impact the student life or to impact the safety or security of the students.”
“One time I was taking a shower […] and the spout that the water comes out of when you take a bath flew off the wall and just hit me in the shin. And then it took them, like, two weeks to fix that.”
Relating another story, Stanford said, “One time I was taking a shower […] and the spout that the water comes out of when you take a bath flew off the wall and just hit me in the shin. And then it took them, like, two weeks to fix that.”
The administration insists that La Citadelle was worth the renovation costs and is one of the most popular residence choices. “The students appear to be voting with the occupancy rates, and they’re voting in favour of the hotel experience,” said Doug Sweet, McGill’s Director of Internal Communications.
While some students may not mind the expense, others think that the prospect of maintenance construction, rising rents, and the lack of community-feel in hotel-style living makes La Citadelle unattractive.
“I know it’s very poorly constructed. […] I’d say it’s pretty common knowledge,” said Stanford. “I would definitely not live there if it was $1,200 a month.”
