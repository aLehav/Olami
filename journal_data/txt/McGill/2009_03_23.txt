Current system separates families and deports individuals back to dangerous situations
Canada’s Immigration Policy makes it difficult for those fleeing oppressive regimes or civil war to gain refugee status, Stewart Istvanffy said, Montreal refugee lawyer, at a lecture held by the McGill Refugee Research Project (RPR) on Wednesday.
“There is a growing tendency to defend the system rather than the fundamental rights of refugee claimants,” said Istvanffy of those who apply for refugee status in Canada. Claimants who gain refugee status can legally work in Canada or apply for welfare, but are not considered citizens or even permanent residents.
Istvanffy – who has represented refugees in Canada for 20 years – challenged the government’s assertion that, as a sovereign state, it reserves the right to choose who crosses its borders and who gets to stay.
He recounted representing Enrique Falcon-Rios, a man working in Canada for over a decade, who was tortured by the Mexican army in Chiapas at age 17 in December 1998 – with 16 visible cigarette burns on his arm.
Though Falcon-Rios would be in danger of torture upon returning to his country, Canadian immigration refused him a risk assessment. His subsequent plea for citizenship for humanitarian reasons – an expensive and time-consuming process – was also rejected.
“A general rule of international law is – you don’t deport law-abiding people who are raising children in your country.”
Under  the current refugee system in Canada, claimants are not guaranteed their right to a lawyer, a court of law, or the protection of family rights. Claimants are also not legally protected from arbitrary detention or deportation to a country where they risk torture or execution.
“People are being put in extreme danger,” Istvanffy commented.
Officers of Citizenship and Immigration rule on refugee claims made at the border by new arrivals, but it often takes months for those claims that are deemed eligible to be processed by the Immigration and Refugee Board.  Successful applicants are declared “Protected Persons.”
However, refugees cannot always produce evidence necessary to prove to the Canadian government that they are in danger in their home country. The government is supposed to conduct a pre-removal risk assessment for claimants whose case is rejected, but Istvanffy has often seen the government forgo this step prior to deportation.
“Refugees make great efforts to then get proof, but when presented at the pre-removal risk assessment, this evidence is immediately dismissed as evidence which could have been presented at the refugee border,” Istvanffy said, shaking his head in frustration. “The Court often comes out and says [to me] ‘We don’t want to hear these arguments,’ and they don’t.”
Sarah Hausman, U3 psychology and international development studies major, was struck by the story Istvanffy recounted during the talk of a Nigerian man who was separated from his wife and Canadian-born children when the government refused him refugee status.
“Separating families like this undermines notions of what it means to be Canadian – on what grounds does Canada justify such blatant violations of human rights?”

North America’s smallest dinosaur uncovered
EDMONTON – It was an adventure that began back in 1982, but 27 years later, Philip Currie, a paleontologist and biological sciences professor at the University of Alberta (UofA), is able to confirm that he and his colleague have identified the smallest dinosaur known to have roamed North America.
The discovery and identification of the carnivorous Hesperonychus elizabethae – a species so small it would fit in the palm of one’s hand – will be published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this month.
Originally thought to be a bone fragment from a lizard, the piece was found by a University of Calgary student hired by the UofA to work in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park.
“She was looking mostly for smaller animals, and the small fossils she found, she thought probably belonged to a lizard,” said Currie, explaining that it wasn’t until the late nineties, when a feathered skeleton named Microraptor was uncovered in China, that a connection was made.
“He realized that [the bone] is almost identical to the one in China in terms of hip structure,” Currie said.
Despite missing a complete skeleton, the ability to compare their fragment to the specimen in China allowed for a concise comparison of each structure.
While paleontologists have discovered many skeletons in Alberta over the years, Currie explained that many of the smaller specimens remain incomplete, which limited the field of study.
“[Big skeletons] only give you one side of the story. [They] preserve a lot more easily than small things because you don’t have things eating them, you don’t have slivers that are ripping the pieces apart.”
Currie’s discovery proves that there is still a lot to be learned.
“We want to know what’s going on with the other side of the ecosystem; all the small animals and that includes not just dinosaurs, but all the things living with the dinosaurs.” he said.
For Currie, Hesperonychus elizabethae is the first of many skeletons that will eventually reach the surface.
“I’m willing to bet that in a couple years, we’re going to have more small dinosaur species than big dinosaurs species.”

SFU to privatize residences
BURNABY – B.C.’s Simon Fraser University (SFU) is looking to contract a private company to fund, manage, and maintain on-campus student residences.
Citing a lack of capital available for major repairs to residence buildings and a desire to increase capacity, the university wants to avoid taking a loan out to complete these projects.
“We’re just looking for creative ways to try and deal with residences, “said Pat Hibbits, SFU’s VP Finance.
Currently, SFU on-campus residences house about nine per cent of students, a figure SFU hopes to see hit 15 per cent while doubling on-campus housing space over the next five years.
Thompson Rivers University (TRU) in Kamloops, B.C., and the University of Ottawa already have privatized residences.
“Universities are turning the housing around to the private sector due to the fact that the price to operate is definitely high,” said Mark Woloski, TRU’s residence manager.
“We can control the prices we offer the students because we’re not paying a hefty wage to all our staff, so that’s probably why a lot of universities are changing to private sectors – because the cost of operations are skyrocketing, being a union-run facility.”
In terms of cost to students, Woloski claimed it is “virtually the same” as off-campus housing.
“We follow everyone else’s lead. We keep in regular communication with all the other on-campus housing units throughout B.C., and we don’t like pricing ourselves out of the market or wanting to gouge,” he said.
Nichole DeMichelis, a second-year political science student living in the McTaggart-Cowan residence, was optimistic about what privatization could bring to the residences.
“SFU is lacking a lot of funding, and one of the big priorities is to build more residences to secure that sense of community,” DeMichelis said. “I would be all for having new buildings with proper kitchens. I think it sounds like a great idea.”

Student finds tuition in her Tim’s cup
TORONTO – At best, Khalin Elliott was hoping for a free snack when she checked under the rim of her Tim Horton’s coffee cup last Wednesday. But instead of a free pastry, the first-year media student found a tiny dollar sign followed by a big number under the rim of her medium hot chocolate – $10,000, courtesy of the Tim Hortons Roll Up The Rim contest.
The oldest of four girls, Elliot has relied on government funding and a competitive entrance scholarship to cover her tuition and residence fees this year.
“There’s six of us [in my family] so we go through struggles and stuff like that. We’re kind of in the middle in a way, like most big families are, so getting this is definitely going to help with school,” Elliott said.
She plans to spend her money on a new computer because her current MacBook runs slowly, and she wants something to handle advanced graphics work.
“Everything’s computer-based in our classes,” she explained.
The leftover cash will pay her tuition for second year.
Elliott recalled her surprise when she uncovered her prize.
“I had to get them to read it over to make sure I wasn’t going crazy,” she said, claiming that she never wins anything.
Elliott explained that she and her friends always take a break during their three-hour visual studies class, usually opting for a quick trip to the nearby Tim Hortons. All three of them ordered hot chocolate.
Her two friends said they were thrilled she won – even though they could have won if they had lined up in a different order.
According to Lucy Rocque, the employee at Tim Horton’s who handed Elliot the winning cup, more customers have been getting their coffee fix at her Tim’s since the $10,000 win, hoping to get lucky. Last Friday, someone stopped by to tell them they had won a $100 Tim Card from that location.

Alberta college launches free nursing program
EDMONTON – Bow Valley College, an Albertan institution focusing on English as a second language (ESL) training, is introducing a free 20-month pilot program designed to help immigrants with a nursing degree upgrade their skills and find employment in Canada.
“It’s designed to take people who have nursing from their own country and give them the language and Canadian health cultural knowledge that they need to be able to practice in the Canadian health system,” said Isabel Gibbins, Dean of ESL and Languages at the college, explaining that many candidates’ English levels proved to be a barrier during the qualifying exam.
The program was first introduced at NorQuest College in Edmonton, but once the provincial government was aware of its success, they introduced it to other institutions. It resembles the usual training for nurses, though it is shorter because many of the nurses already have background knowledge.
Gibbins said the program intends to create a link between those who have ventured to Canada in search of employment, and the Canadian services that are seeking that very expertise.
“We really feel that there are a lot of people who have skills from their country that they aren’t able to use in Canada,” she said. “One of the things that’s important to us is to be able to work on providing some of those transition courses.”
Initial funding for the Bow College program will come from Alberta Employment and Immigration, but once the pilot period ends, Gibbins hopes to sustain it through enrolment fees. They intend to advertise it at current ESL classes, health-care facilities, and the college’s open house.

Undergrad-made iPhone app aimed at students
FREDERICTON – While many students are wondering what they’re going to do with their degrees after they get out of school, third-year computer science student Jason Brennan has already put his education to good use.
Brennan, a 20-year-old student at the University of New Brunswick, designed an application called Keener for the Apple iPhone to help students keep track of their grades and organize their school work.
“You put in your courses when you start the semester,” said Brennan. “You put in your homework assignments, your quizzes, and the labs that are coming up. You put in the due dates, and it gives you a list of what’s due, what’s overdue, and what’s due next week. And when you get your tests and assignments back you just punch in your marks and it keeps track of your overall grades for the semester.”
Keener can also calculate weighted grades as classes progress.
Brennan, who owns an iPhone, developed Keener between November and January, and cited his own university experience as his inspiration.
“I came up with this because I am not a keener at all,” laughed Brennan. “I’m not very studious and I find that I’m a lot more organized if I have a way to record everything.”
Brennan found traditional agendas problematic, but wanted an organizer that he could keep with him at all times. Developing Keener allowed him to resolve this problem, and learn more about computer programming, one of his interests outside of school.
Keener went on sale January 25 for $4.99. Brennan gets 70 per cent, or $3.50, from each sale. The other 30 per cent goes to Apple and the company handles all the billing and shipping.

UniversityJunction aims to link students from 56 campuses
With exam season approaching, a new note-sharing web site, UniversityJunction.com, is hoping to create an online academic community that will provide students with accurate information on courses, exam notes, and tutoring services.
According to Liz Mitchell, Communications Director of UniversityJunction.com, the free site was created by a group of recent McGill graduates who were frustrated by their undergraduate learning environment.
“[We] found that the professor didn’t explain the concepts as well as they could or [students] just didn’t have enough information to learn the material,” Mitchell wrote in an email.
With over 1,200 users and more than 1.1 million pieces of class resources uploaded from top schools in both the U.S. and Canada, the site also features a forum-based tutoring service for students who felt intimidated by asking questions in large classes or speaking to professors in their office hours.
“We’ll commit to answering McGill students’ questions within a day, from now until exams,” Mitchell stated.
According to their web site, their growth plan is to provide material for 160,000 courses on 56 campuses by March, and to eventually reach 160 universities by the end of 2009.
“[We hope] to establish UniversityJunction.com as the leading academic resource for university students,” Mitchell wrote.
The idea is similar to a different McGill-based program, nerdnotes.ca, launched in September 2007, which focused on providing notes for students, typically in Arts courses, who didn’t have access to note taking classes.
According to Stefan Dimitriadis, one of the creators of nerdnotes.ca, their biggest challenge was developing the time and money to exert in such an operation, explaining that is was eventually shut down due to financial costs.
“[Nerdnotes.ca was] an experiment, and the response by students was proportionate to the amount of effort [students] put into it,” Dimitriadis said. “Considering the amount of time [we] put into advertising and making the system user-friendly, the response was quite good.”
While Nerdnotes.ca charged users $2.50 a lecture, UniversityJunction is trying to become an ethical alternative to note-buying sites, and wants to avoid legal infringements or violations of professors’ intellectual property rights.
“[We’re providing] a greater understanding of course material without compromising ethics code,” Mitchell wrote.

Electoral office chastises SSMU for public bickering
All four staff members of Elections McGill simultaneously resigned after announcing the official results of the SSMU elections to Council last Thursday, making this the second time in three years that the body has walked off the job.
The Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Nicole Gileadi, presented her report, chastised Council for its March 5 censure of SSMU’s independent electoral agency, and then resigned to Council’s surprise.
 “Elections McGill is hereby tendering its resignation immediately,” announced Gileadi as she handed over the office keys and computer passwords, and left the room immediately.
The March 5 censure stated that Elections failed to sufficiently meet SSMU standards on bilingualism, that they undertook insufficient promotional activities, printed inaccurate materials, were inaccessible to election candidates and referendum committee members.
 “I think [the censure] was unfortunate. Council had some legitimate concerns, but they went about it the wrong way, and they compromised the way we functioned,” said Gileadi later. “Very counterproductive, very unprofessional.”
According to Gileadi, Elections McGill often takes the brunt of complaints for a phenomenon that they have trouble controlling.
“Elections McGill is a very easy scapegoat for student apathy,” Gileadi said. “I am proud of the way that we conducted ourselves.”
SSMU councillors, who had questions prepared for the CEO, took a few minutes to regain their composure and were then required to formally adopt the election results.
Councillors then decided to remove the strengths Elections McGill had included in their report analysis.
“Can we remove a section [immaterial to the results], like, say, ‘Significant Achievements’?” Law Senator Alexandre Shee asked the Speaker, to much laughter from other councillors.
Hours later, Council passed a motion partially aimed at reconciliation, mandating the SSMU Executive to release a statement saying that they “regret to have contributed to the deterioration of the relationship between SSMU and Elections McGill” but “continue to stand by our criticisms of Elections McGill that led to our censure, and do not support their resignation.”
Councillors had considered not accepting the Elections McGill staff’s resignation, and encouraged them to come back and talk to them.
Gileadi said she would be willing to talk to Council if they had any professional questions.
 “If there are concerns about the electoral period itself, I’d be happy to talk about it with them,” said Gileadi. “It felt a little strange to stick around [after resigning].”
The bylaws were also a problem, Gileadi said, who believed that they needed updating in order to actually be enforced.
 “The bylaws are in certain cases very difficult, especially with the Internet,” she said. “It’s very difficult to apply bylaws that were written in a different time for the ‘modern era’.”
Two years ago, Elections McGill CEO Bryan Badali and his staff resigned when the Judicial Board overturned the extremely close presidential election because Badali had not, according to the Board, publicly reprimanded one candidate when his opponent’s campaign posters were torn down. Badali called the decision a travesty.

Some questions for the provoking profs
Re: “Boycotting profs have it all wrong” | Commentary | March 9
We initially hesitated to reply to the provocation issued by Professors Van den Berg, Waller, and Weinfeld because their reference to those who disagree with them as “the BDS gang” or “BDS crew” seems not only disingenuous and disrespectful, but also calculated to foreclose on genuine dialogue and honest intellectual exchange. In fact, it is difficult to understand why those of us who support non-violent resistance would be characterized as a “PR branch of Hamas, Hezbollah and their patron Iran.” Such a characterization of our position short-circuits a rational discussion and would appear to be an attempt to obfuscate the basic issues.
However, we do want briefly to clarify a few major points.
We support an academic boycott of Israeli universities because these institutions are integral to establishing and maintaining systemic and institutionalized violations of basic human rights as spelled out in international laws, protocols, and conventions. We support an academic boycott because it is a non-violent form of resistance to ongoing institutionalized violations of human rights and offers a powerful alternative to violent resistance.
To open a genuine dialogue, and because we would like a clearer understanding of the position of Professors Van den Berg, Waller, and Weinfeld – which can be seen as laying the blame for oppression on the oppressed – we would like to pose a series of questions for their response. Do they believe that an entire people forfeits its basic human rights if some of its members engage in violent resistance to military occupation and exploitation?  Do they argue that Palestinians cannot be treated as legally human until violence ceases?  Do they propose an unconditional surrender of Palestinians to Israel as a precondition for Palestinians to enjoy basic human rights?
We look forward to reading their answers.

Re: “Right our wrong over Iraq” | Commentary | February 16
I found your article well-researched and an excellent analysis of the current situation. I have often found myself deluged by the “hacks” you describe who offer their half-wit opinions on Iraq. Many of these so-called “experts” often state that the Iraq adventure was a foolhardy endeavour, where the chance for any sort of success has long since passed. Furthermore, the evidence  to back up their quackery and opinions are often only based on what they have seen on the ground (or endured while fighting, in the case of soldiers), and lack the insight and understanding that is available to you as a McGill U1 Arts student.
Now I am the first to admit that I was one of those who opposed the Iraq war on the grounds that there was no reason to invade a sovereign state that had not directly threatened the U.S. However, now I realize the error of my ways and must concede that you are correct: the war is well on its way to being a success.  I now realize that I failed to consider the following markers of success:
(1) Over 4,000 U.S. military deaths since the war began (the majority of which have come after President Bush declared an end to combat operations), and thousands more injured.
(2) Over 100,000 Iraqi citizens killed (according to The Lancet).
(3) An estimated cost of $100 million a day (money far better spent on a war than on alleviating the current financial crisis, fighting diseases, developing clean energy, or aiding the world’s poor).
So, with all this in mind I urge you to keep up the good work, and I wish you the same level success in journalism as those we are currently seeing in Iraq.

Sorry for using you
Re: “I understand why AUS needs French translation” | Letters | March 16
Maya Frieser:
For having mentioned you and Mr. Louis-Michel Gauthier without reflecting on how you would react, I apologize. I should have thought of the people I was using as a pretext.
In response to your three points:
The article was in fact directed not at you and Mr. Gauthier, but rather at the general public, in order to raise the profile of translation, for I believe that it is a widely misunderstood practice, especially in the anglophone community. You did indeed ask me for directions on where to obtain a good translator; for writing as though you had not, I apologize once again. I ought not to have used you and Mr. Gauthier as an excuse to write my little FAQ; you both clearly know the value of translation.
However, though it’s true that francophones generally have a more acute linguistic consciousness than anglophones, I must draw your attention to the very low profile of the French language and literature department, not only at McGill, but in the entire province. The department’s low visibility is a frequent topic of discussion at departmental meetings. An illustrative anecdote: some of my colleagues at the Commission des affaires francophones (CAF) did not know of the department, nor of its translation program, until I joined the CAF in January. (That was my impression, at least.) Merely speaking French as one’s mother tongue does not guarantee knowledge of a French department at a prestigious anglo institution.
As for your third point: touché. Well played, Ms Frieser, well played indeed. And merci à vous, for having called me to order.

Dead votes don’t count
Re: “I demand that you take a stand” | Letters | March 12
In a recent letter to the editor, Daily columnist Ricky Kreitner asked me to clarify whether or not I think the Iraqis and Kurds are worse off due to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
Kreitner may be aware of the results of a public opinion poll released by the British company ORB last March, which indicated that more than half of Iraqis (51 per cent) prefer their life today over life under Saddam Hussein (22 per cent).
But even if the following point is obvious, it deserves emphasis: dead people cannot respond to opinion polls. A callous observer may dismiss the astronomical civilian death tolls in Iraq by adapting the Cold War slogan “Better dead than red” to the 21st century under Saddam Hussein. However, I maintain that the human cost of this war has been unacceptable.
We should not ignore those who see a better life beyond the rubble. These survivors may be better off for the invasion. But neither should we ignore the chance that a better life could be achieved without following some “decider” headlong into carnage.

Ghetto kids are little shits
Posted on mcgilldaily.com
I lived in the McGill Ghetto for 12 years and endured ongoing disturbances and vandalism from McGill students every weekend and more. My old car was vandalized about seven times over the course of three to four years, to the point where this driver, with 30 years’ experience and no responsibility for any accident, is now uninsurable. I recently moved to the other side of the campus, at Sherbrooke and Drummond. I picked up my new car yesterday and am writing to thank the screaming McGill shits who ripped off my side-view mirror last night, less than 24 hours after I took possession of my new car. I studied at McGill and earned an MBA (I didn’t trash anyone’s things back then). I make enough money to make generous donations to the school, but you know what? I’ll fix my car instead and keep the rest for a worthy group. It is depressing to think that McGill is educating the leaders of tomorrow. McGill’s tolerance for the disturbances caused around its campus is incredibly hypocritical, as if nothing could be done to control the vandals. I can hear the counter argument now: how do you know it was McGill? Gna gna gna… Let’s not act too surprised when these self-entitled little people continue to cheat and steal once they reach the job market; we will have given them the license to do it all.

And when you get your tests and assignments back you just punch in your marks and it keeps track of your overall grades for the semester.”
Keener can also calculate weighted grades as classes progress.
Brennan, who owns an iPhone, developed Keener between November and January, and cited his own university experience as his inspiration.
“I came up with this because I am not a keener at all,” laughed Brennan. “I’m not very studious and I find that I’m a lot more organized if I have a way to record everything.”
Brennan found traditional agendas problematic, but wanted an organizer that he could keep with him at all times. Developing Keener allowed him to resolve this problem, and learn more about computer programming, one of his interests outside of school.
Keener went on sale January 25 for $4.99. Brennan gets 70 per cent, or $3.50, from each sale. The other 30 per cent goes to Apple and the company handles all the billing and shipping.

UniversityJunction aims to link students from 56 campuses
With exam season approaching, a new note-sharing web site, UniversityJunction.com, is hoping to create an online academic community that will provide students with accurate information on courses, exam notes, and tutoring services.
According to Liz Mitchell, Communications Director of UniversityJunction.com, the free site was created by a group of recent McGill graduates who were frustrated by their undergraduate learning environment.
“[We] found that the professor didn’t explain the concepts as well as they could or [students] just didn’t have enough information to learn the material,” Mitchell wrote in an email.
With over 1,200 users and more than 1.1 million pieces of class resources uploaded from top schools in both the U.S. and Canada, the site also features a forum-based tutoring service for students who felt intimidated by asking questions in large classes or speaking to professors in their office hours.
“We’ll commit to answering McGill students’ questions within a day, from now until exams,” Mitchell stated.
According to their web site, their growth plan is to provide material for 160,000 courses on 56 campuses by March, and to eventually reach 160 universities by the end of 2009.
“[We hope] to establish UniversityJunction.com as the leading academic resource for university students,” Mitchell wrote.
The idea is similar to a different McGill-based program, nerdnotes.ca, launched in September 2007, which focused on providing notes for students, typically in Arts courses, who didn’t have access to note taking classes.
According to Stefan Dimitriadis, one of the creators of nerdnotes.ca, their biggest challenge was developing the time and money to exert in such an operation, explaining that is was eventually shut down due to financial costs.
“[Nerdnotes.ca was] an experiment, and the response by students was proportionate to the amount of effort [students] put into it,” Dimitriadis said. “Considering the amount of time [we] put into advertising and making the system user-friendly, the response was quite good.”
While Nerdnotes.ca charged users $2.50 a lecture, UniversityJunction is trying to become an ethical alternative to note-buying sites, and wants to avoid legal infringements or violations of professors’ intellectual property rights.
“[We’re providing] a greater understanding of course material without compromising ethics code,” Mitchell wrote.
