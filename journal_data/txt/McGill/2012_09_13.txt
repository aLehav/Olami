A motion to end the Art History and Communications Studies Graduate Student Association (AHCS-GSA) strike passed unanimously last Tuesday at a General Assembly held in the basement of the Arts building.  There were 19 members present.
The strike had been ongoing since April 6, and was declared in response to the Liberal government’s proposed tuition hike. The motion cited the election of the Parti Québécois to a minority government and the promises made by its leader Pauline Marois to abolish the hike and overturn Law 12 as the reason for the decision.
With this motion, the AHCS-GSA also decided to mobilize for the September 22 demonstration to “celebrate the strike’s conclusion and to maintain pressure on the newly elected government to keep [its] promises and push for a national summit on education in Quebec.”
The AHCS-GSA plans to pressure the McGill administration to revoke disciplinary charges brought against student strikers, and to reimburse fees already levied for tuition hikes.
The motion credited “the longest and largest student strike in Canadian history” for the Liberal party losing its majority.

McGill students hit by embassy closure
Two hundred and sixty-two Iranian students at McGill are facing difficulties following the federal government’s decision to close its embassy in Iran. The closure has also made it difficult – and for some, impossible – to return to study at McGill.
Last Friday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird declared the immediate closing of the Canadian embassy in Iran and all Iranian diplomats in Canada as personae non gratae. According to Baird, Iranian diplomats were informed that they had five days to leave.
“Canada views the government of Iran as the most significant threat to world peace and security in the world today,” he said.
Of the 262 Iranian students currently enrolled at McGill, 232 are graduate students, 26 are undergraduates, two are post-doctorates, and two are in continuing studies. There are approximately 4,000 Iranian students in Canada as a whole, many of whom currently face challenges posed by the closing of Canadian consular service in Iran.
The services that will no longer be directly available in Iran include the ability to apply for a study permit and to receive letters exempting or postponing mandatory military service for male Iranian citizens aged 18-34.
Of the 54 newly admitted students to McGill, 29 do not have their documents in order due to the embassy’s closure. This includes students who sent in their official documents and passports and can no longer retrieve them.
The current VP External of the McGill Iranian Students Association (MISA) and an Iranian student at McGill, told The Daily, “If I lose my passport, there is no organization I can prove my identity to. I cannot stay here. I cannot even go to Iran.”
According to MISA President Maiid Sheikholeslami, newly admitted students who are still in Iran must now apply for study permits through the Canadian embassy in Ankara, Turkey.
Sheikholeslami also said that applicants must submit their CV, a list of professors, research interests, and past publications. This was not the case in previous years.
With the increased paperwork and the subsequent backlog, many students have missed the deadline to defer their classes.
Pauline L’Ecuyer, Director of International Student Services at McGill, said that the University is going to be flexible in granting deferral permission to students who did not make the class deferral deadline of August 31.
“This does not solve the problem of deferral of funds,” she said. “Scholarships and grants that have been promised to Iranian students this semester are much more difficult to defer as they come from a variety of sources.”
The sanction imposed on Iranian banks on July 26, 2010 by the Canadian government has also made money transfers more complicated for Iranian students at McGill, who must now transfer money through more expensive alternatives like foreign exchange offices.
“The sanctions put against Iran doesn’t [so much] put the government under pressure as it puts the people under pressure,” said Salimi.
Last Tuesday, L’Ecuyer organized a meeting to provide Iranian students at McGill with information and assistance.
“The purpose of the meeting was to know what students expectations are from [McGill], what it is we can do to make their access to McGill now – [as well as] those who are still in Iran – easier,” said L’Ecuyer.
Of the 262 Iranian students invited, 32 were present at the meeting.
L’Ecuyer, in partnership with her counterparts at the University of British Columbia and the University of Alberta, plans to lobby the government of Canada on behalf of students.
Emails were sent out to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Citizenship and Immigration Canada on September 10. So far, there has been no response.

Members call for student striker amnesty
The Post Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) met for the third time this academic year to discuss a number of issues relating to the Society, including the recent provincial elections, the approval of the Executive Workplan, and strike bylaws.
Regarding the election of the Parti Québécois (PQ) to a minority provincial government on September 4, council members entered a Committee of the Whole for ten minutes to discuss the impact of a new provincial government for PGSS.
After the discussion, a motion was amended and approved to mandate that PGSS “develop a local education summit here at McGill,” and “advocate for amnesty for students who were charged with disciplinary offences by their university related to non-violent political activity during the student movement.”
PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney later brought forward an emergency motion, which was passed to mandate for PGSS to support the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) in pursuing a policy of cooperation, rather than antagonization, toward other student federations.
Mooney explained that as a member of FEUQ, PGSS has to advocate the direction of policies it would like to see the Federation take.
Council members also voted unanimously to approve a motion regarding Law 12, which stated that “PGSS draw attention to the undermining of civil liberty and the subversion of the principle of civil liability inherent in Law 12.”
Law 12, previously known as Bill 78, was passed as an emergency law on May 18 by the National Assembly of Quebec. The Law restricted protest activities on or near university grounds, and further required that organized protests of fifty or more people in a public space anywhere in Quebec submit their routes to the police for approval.
Speaking in favour of the motion, Mooney explained that although Law 12 was likely to be repealed by the current provincial government, “it is not okay that it was made in the first place.”
Hasan Nikopour Deilami of the Faculty of Engineering also brought forward a motion for the PGSS to create an electronic referendum in which all members can vote online whether to declare a strike. The motion was voted down.
In March, PGSS voted in overwhelming favour of a three-day strike in support of the Quebec student movement against tuition hikes. The strike, which took place from March 20 to 22, was voted on in a General Assembly (GA) on March 7.
PGSS Equity Commissioner Gretchen King spoke against the motion, stating, “If we have something like the highest authority of PGSS being the GA, and in the process of the GA we have the right to strike votes, then it should be the GA… that has the right to decide how we are going to do that vote… I think it’s unfair to the GA and the democratic principles built up in this organization to take this away from the GA.”
Council members also voted to approve the Executive Workplan for the upcoming academic year. Some of the highlights of this year’s executive plan include addressing and researching the quality of graduate supervision, researching the effects of University-industry and University-community partnerships, improving the quality of representation on the PGSS’ committees and governance, participating in the reform of the Student Code of Conduct set to take place over the next few years, and increasing the sustainability of the Thomson House and PGSS practices.
Correction appended September 13. An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed Gretchen King’s statement to Alexandra Turnbull. The Daily regrets the error.

McGill University announced yesterday that it would not reimburse any change in tuition fees until it receives an official directive from the new government.
The Parti Québécois (PQ) won a plurality of seats in the National Assembly on September 4. Last week, PQ leader Pauline Marois promised to abolish the $1,625 increase in tuition proposed by the Liberal government of Jean Charest.
The University said that students could leave the credit on their account for the winter or request a refund through Minerva.
On Friday, Provost Anthony Masi told The Daily that he expected a loss in revenue of $90 million by 2018. McGill’s budget for the 2013 fiscal year – which took into account the tuition hikes – projected a cumulative deficit of $281.9 million for 2013.
Both the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) and the Fédération collégiale du Québec (FECQ) hailed the PQ’s decision as a victory for the student movement. The Coalition Large de l’association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE), however, has vowed to remain “vigilant” until the hike is abolished.
“We ask for a meeting with the new government to discuss the current situation and to demand that the [Liberal government’s] promise to increase student loans and bursaries is kept,” a statement on its website read in French.
Under the tuition hike proposed by the previous government, bursaries and student loans were set to expand.

After a summer-long battle against federal Bill C-19 – a federal bill that would destroy Canada’s national long-gun registry – Quebec has won a significant legal victory in its quest to maintain its provincial registry.
Quebec Superior Court Justice Marc-André Blanchard ruled on Monday that because the federal government had developed the registry in partnership with individual provinces, it could not unilaterally destroy the data.
In the 42-page document detailing his decision, Blanchard wrote that Bill C-19 “impinges in a very substantial way, even exorbitantly, on provincial powers, and there is no rational or functional justification or any necessity to do so.”
Blanchard’s ruling granted a permanent injunction against the destruction of the data and gave the federal government thirty days to relinquish all of the data on Quebec long-gun ownership to the provincial government.
He also ordered that Canada’s attorney general and the federal director of the registry continue to maintain and update the registry so as not to create a gap in the data, according to the Montreal Gazette.
Public Safety Minister and supporter of Bill C-19 Vic Toews said in a statement that he was disappointed with the ruling, and “will thoroughly review the decision.”
According to the CBC, federal ministers are in the process of studying the ruling to decide whether to bring the case to Quebec’s Court of Appeal or even to the Supreme Court of Canada.

David Bertschi is a Quebec-born and Ontario-based insurance lawyer and prospective Liberal Party of Canada leadership candidate. He ran unsuccessfully in the 2011 federal election as the Liberal party’s candidate in the Ottawa-Orléans riding. In May of 2012, Bertschi established a ‘grassroots exploratory committee’ to gauge public support for a potential Liberal leadership bid.
The McGill Daily (MD): You’ve said you’re “strongly considering” running to be the leader of the Liberal party. The leadership race is several months away and there are only a couple officially declared candidates and few prospective candidates. Why are you getting such an early start?
David Bertschi (DB): Because I believe in being prepared […] As a trial layer who’s been practicing for over 28 years it’s all about preparation, reorganization, and it’s also all about dedication. You need a clear approach to matters… for the past several months I’ve been traveling across the country, coast to coast to coast, and meeting with Canadians and discussing with Canadians of all political stripes about what they believe is important and what the federal government needs to do to properly address their concerns. And from there once I’ve finished traveling, then I will sit down with my family and the people who frankly approached me to consider running, and then I’ll make my decision.
MD: Was it after the federal election in 2011 that people approached you and asked if you’d think about running?
DB: Yes…I was approached within a span of about a month[…] And you know, we’ve got lots of talented people in the Liberal party of Canada, in Quebec, in Ontario, and across the country. They’re Canadians who believe in a balanced approach to politics, who believe that you have to encourage and have an economic environment that’s healthy, that you encourage entrepreneurship because small businesses really are the backbone of our country. But at the same time you have to take care of the vulnerable. You’ve got to support, care for, and help those who are less fortunate or do no not have the wherewithal to succeed, and that’s the true sign of a healthy society. And frankly the Harper government has failed miserably at looking after First Nations. And I [mean] looking after the issues that everyone is facing. If they’re the First Nations, they’re not addressing them, if they’re the provinces, they don’t speak to them. The Harper government and Mr. Mulcair’s NDP are ideologically driven. Canadians want a reasonable alternative to the Harper government.
MD: And what would your specific alternative be?
DB: My view is that a federation is made up of constituent points. The federal government, the provincial governments, the municipal governments, they all have their respective jurisdictions and at the same time you have to work together as Canadians. There’s no monopoly on good ideas. And I find that the Harper government dismisses any good idea if it’s not from their ideology, as does Mr. Mulcair. If it’s not dealing with a certain stance on an issue they discount it, and that’s wrong. Canada is a very large, very complex country and we have to listen to people and work with them to solve the problems.
MD: With this all in mind, what are your thoughts on the recent results of the Quebec election?
DB: You know, Quebec politics are fascinating. The citizens of Quebec are extremely well-informed and engaged. And as many have written recently, Quebec people have spoken by the way they have voted. It’s been a very unique approach to the governance. Obviously they were disenchanted by certain parties and obviously they weren’t enchanted with anyone to give them a sufficiently large number of seats. I think the Quebec election also bodes well for the Liberal party…Mr. Charest and his government certainly defied the pollsters by getting fifty seats.
MD: You ran in 2011, but you’ve never held office. Without a voting record or something that people can refer to in the way of political experience, how are you going to convince people, say you are to run, that you’d be experienced enough for the job?
DB: […] I’ve run a number of successful multi-million dollar businesses and I’ve created successful businesses […] Plus, as someone who was born in raised initially in Sainte Adèle, Quebec, who was educated in French, I also understand the diversity of our country when it comes to the importance of bilingualism and French culture in the fibre of our country.
MD: I found there was a huge disconnect between students in other provinces and those here. Did you try to help students from opposite ends of the country understand each other?
DB: […] I certainly established and discussed with others across the country the challenges that the students were facing in Quebec. And a lot of those challenges, students were facing elsewhere as well. We have to keep striving to do a better job and to make sure that the economy grows, that there are jobs for students, that education is always not only affordable but very accessible to all. Because that’s one of the primary ways to get people out of circumstances that they find themselves in, into a better situation. Education is critical and I could relate to the concerns of the students across the country when they worry about the debt load they’re facing. The fact that when they graduate they still can’t get a job, let alone a job in their own chosen field. The fact that they’re burdened with debt. The fact that they cannot only not pay them off, but they’re burdened with the thought, “when will I ever be able to afford a house or start a family?” because they want something like I wanted and something better for their children.
