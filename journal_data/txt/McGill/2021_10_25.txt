Programming featured panels, workshops, and community events
This past month celebrated McGill’s Queer History Month – while students have observed Queer History Month for the past four years, this year was the first to have the month officially recognized by McGill’s Senate. The month is designated to highlight the history and achievements of 2SLGBTIA+ communities at McGill, and throughout Montreal and Canada. This year’s theme was “Coming Together” – hoping to encourage connection and reflection amid easing pandemic restrictions. 
From September 29 to October 28, a series of events were hosted aimed at raising awareness, advancing education, and increasing the visibility of 2SLGBTQIA+ communities. The film screenings, panels, workshops, and community events recognized 2SLGBTQIA+ history and contributions, and brought together students, faculty, alumni, and other community members. 
2SLGBTQIA+ Indigenous Artists Talk
This event was held September 23 to celebrate the beginning of Queer History Month in tandem with Indigenous Awareness week. Dillan Chiblow, Anachnid, Pasha Partridge, and Dez Grégoire discussed the future of 2SLGBTQIA+ Indigenous artists’ creative forms of expression, and how they can be used to build community and connection. 
Community Connections: Sharing and Exploring Queer Identities on Campus
On September 27, the Office for Sexual Violence Response, Support and Education (OSVRSE) hosted this workshop for 2SLGBTQIA+ students looking to discuss, share, and unpack the intersections between queerness, identity development, and in-person connections with the McGill community. The workshop was held at the OSVRE office, and was hosted by Wellness Advisor Margot Nossal. 
Opening Event: Return of the Rainbow
Official Queer History Month events started September 29, with the “Return of the Rainbow.” The month was opened by Kawennotas Sedalia Fazio, Mohawk Elder and Founder and Director of the first Sweat Lodge in Montreal. The event is McGill’s homecoming for current and past 2SLGBTQIA+ students, staff, and faculty. This celebration was started in 2001, and is an opportunity for queer alumni to return and reconnect with the university and its campus. 
Keynote: “Diversifying Entomology” 
This year’s keynote was delivered October 1 by Dr. Jessica L. Ware, an entomologist and curator at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC. She focuses on working with and researching dragonflies, damselflies, cockroaches and termites, along with other insects. In her talk, Ware touched on the complicated history of entomology; while it is a vibrant and exciting science, she said that the discipline is deeply rooted in colonialism. Ware spoke to, however, the many initiatives to diversify and advocate for equity within the field, mentioning groups like 500QueerScientists and Entomologists of Color. The talk ended with spoken word performances by Powetik, a Montreal based spoken word performer, writer, playwright, and community organizer. 
“Chat with an Elder”
On October 19, participants were invited to partake in an evening of intergenerational exchange and knowledge led by Two Spirit Elder Blu Waters, member of the Métis Nation of Ontario. Those in attendance were invited to ask questions or seek advice from Elder Blu Waters, whose gifts include giving traditional spirit names, hand drumming, house cleansing, song and creative writing, and providing traditional teachings. 
Zine Making Workshop
Held on October 21, this workshop introduced participants to classic zine formats. The workshop was led by Jenny Lin, a Montreal-based visual artist, whose work is often interested in queer identity and history. Those who attended the workshop were also shown a selection of Lin’s zines, their format and content widely varying.
Trans and Non-binary in Academia
To be held October 27, this panel will feature one professor and two PhD students discussing their experiences in academia and sharing successes and strategies, followed by a Q&A. This event is a closed space for Trans, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. 
Closing Event: Queer Open Mic with Opera Queens
Queer and allied folks are encouraged to sign up for and attend this open mic event taking place October 28, featuring a performance from Opera Queens, a Montreal and Toronto-based opera company that puts on queer, gender-bending performers and performances. At the end of the evening, invited Elder Sedalia will be closing out Queer History Month. 
Lesbian and Queer Archives Panel
On November 5, this panel will discuss the sustainability of digitizing archives, the risk of the “digital dark ages,” and the challenge of sunsetting digital humanities projects. Hosted as part of Disrupting Disruptions: the Feminist and Accessible Publishing, Communications, and Technologies Speaker and Workshop Series, it will highlight the particular challenges that Lesbian and queer archives face, as many exist apart from institutions. 
Several other community-building events were held over the course of the month, such as a watch party and discussion of the rom-com “Saving Face” on October 6 and a spooky scavenger hunt on October 16. A Halloween crafts and movie night will also be held on October 30, hosted in the Queer McGill office.

One year since release of the AP-ABR
It has been over a year since Principal Suzanne Fortier announced the implementation of McGill’s Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism (AP-ABR), based on the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Plan released in June of 2020. As the AP-ABR is only one year into its five-year trajectory, many objectives have yet to be completed – regardless, the university has maintained several of its commitments thus far. Associate Provost of Equity and Academic Policies Angela Campbell clarified, however, that the plan is only meant to be a starting point for the university: “this is going to be an ongoing effort […] as long as the [university] goes, there has to be a commitment,” she said during a student press conference.
Among the university’s completed objectives is the appointment of Professor Terri Givens as the Provost’s Academic Lead and Advisor (PALA) on the Action Plan. In her capacity as PALA, Givens will lead McGill’s efforts to hire more Black professors for tenure and tenure-track positions and “advise academic leaders (Deans, Chairs, Directors, and Associate Deans) about the distinct needs and experiences of Black faculty.” In this vein, McGill has designated 15 Black faculty members to be added to McGill’s tenure-track positions, according to documents sent to the Daily by McGill’s Media Relations Office. Givens commented that she would like to surpass McGill’s goal of having Black faculty make up 5 per cent of M-Level employees: “My goal is for McGill to become a beacon for people who are interested in the study of the African diaspora [and] Black studies.” The BSN has advocated for the creation of an Africana studies department in the past, but the University has not announced any intention to create a department specific to African diaspora.
The AP-ABR also included commitments specific to student experience. The university has succeeded in meeting their first goal in this category with the creation of a student census, which is available for all students to complete via Minerva.  Additionally, the university has been conducting monthly meetings with students from the McGill African Studies Society and the BSN to get student feedback on the progress of the AP-ABR, and revise accordingly. 
To meet the mental health needs of Black students, the university has created two positions in the Wellness Hub. One of these positions has already been filled: a Local Wellness Advisor (LWA) with expertise in the psychological impacts of racism was hired in January of this year. Although the Wellness Hub has previously been criticized for difficulty in accessing mental health services, Campbell says that the Black Student Liaison has not raised concerns in regards to the accessibility of this LWA; McGill reports that the LWA has served 120 students thus far.
When asked about how students and staff would be held accountable to the anti-oppressive mandates of the EDI Plan, Campbell said that the first step in fostering an anti-oppressive culture is getting people to understand why microaggressions are harmful. “When [microaggressions] occur, the difficulty is often that […] the community dominant groups don’t often understand why they’re so harmful or painful,” she explained. The university is in the midst of educating professors and administration on the impacts of microaggressions, and the launch of the Office for Mediation and Reporting has created a channel for students to report discriminatory behaviour on campus. Last year, Provost Christopher Manfredi told the Daily that the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures would be a means of reducing anti-Black racism, claiming that most students experience microaggressions from other students. During this year’s press conference, Campbell instead emphasized a top-down approach to combating anti-Black racism which prioritizes educating faculty and administration.
These educational initiatives include the implementation of modules about anti-Black racism. While Campbell said that she does not expect modules to eliminate racism on campus by themselves, she said “it sends a message that it’s important and that we take the matter seriously. [The module] does not by itself achieve [an end to racism].” In discussing the modules, Campbell remarked that It Takes All of Us, McGill’s mandatory online module about sexual assault, has served as an example for other universities seeking to reduce sexual violence on campus. Likewise, Givens said that educational workshops and modules have seen good reception: “I’ve really been kind of overwhelmed with the positive approach that a lot of people are bringing to the workshops.” Campbell hopes that these workshops will encourage professors to adopt more inclusive curricula and pedagogies, another goal presented in the AP-ABR. She also hopes that the University will begin to consider how bias may impact an instructors’ student evaluations – Deans and Department Chairs refer to student evaluations when considering whether an instructor should be given a tenure-track position, so Campbell wants “to make sure that [instructors] aren’t penalized in a way that’s unjust on account of bias on the part of the students who do the work evaluating them.”
The AP-ABR stated that the university would reach a final decision about what to do with the statue of James McGill by the end of the bicentennial year. The Daily asked for clarification as to when the deadline for a decision would be, but the university employees present at the conference were not aware of the specific timeline for this decision. The statue has been removed from campus for the time being due to vandalism, but there is no final decision as of yet. The university has also not created a website to “showcase the presence and success of Black McGillians over time,” as was included in the AP-ABR; instead, the Bicentennial website is pointed to as a space for highlighting the history of Black students and staff at McGill.

Network intends to create community for LGBTQIA+ grads to share their experiences
This past month, the McGill Young Alumni Association announced the launch of the McGill Queer Alumni Association (MQAA), an alumni network created for queer graduates. 
“The general aims [of the organization] are providing community to graduates,” Grey Cooper, SSMU Gender and Sexuality Commissioner and co-lead of the MQAA told the Daily, “partly just to create more community and be able to talk about career related concerns, and also for people who aren’t as comfortable in the general associations because of homophobia concerns.” 
The association will serve to support all students who identify as queer. According to Mike Fan, co-lead of the MQAA, it will ensure that queer identity is approached with an intersectional attitude. “I come from an immigrant Chinese-Canadian background and identify as gender nonbinary as well as queer,” Fan told the Daily. “It’s really important to have this community where a lot of the queer and especially BIPOC community in the alumni association don’t really have an outlet to congregate and meet each other, and to learn from each other,” they added.
According to Fan, the creation of the MQAA has been in conversation for a while. “I know for myself, for future students coming to McGill, or alum of all different generations, we really have this big impetus to unite,” says Fan, “and to share our experiences, both positive and negative, and continue to create positive change moving forward.” 
The association is supported by the Subcommittee on Queer People, part of the Joint Board-Senate Committee on Equity. The subcommittee was crucial in facilitating conversation and providing institutional support for the MQAA, according to Cooper. Alongside supporting the MQAA, the subcommittee is engaged with many other advocacy initiatives on campus. Recently, according to Fan, they have worked with IT departments to change McGill’s automated systems so that they recognize chosen names and pronouns. The subcommittee is also spearheading this year’s Queer History Month events, which span from September 29 to October 28. “This is the first Queer History Month which is now recognized by Senate,” says Fan, “so it will be something that will be part of the McGill fabric moving forward.” Apart from advocacy, the subcommittee also creates community on campus: “[It’s] a space where faculty, students, et cetera [can] meet each other, get to know each other, and work together.” 
The MQAA is further bolstered by the University’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan (the EDI). Cooper stated that the EDI provided a precedent for the association’s creation: “The MQAA is [created] to support students, and the precedent for existing comes from the need for there to be support of equity and diversity for students at McGill, especially with institutionalized queerphobia,” according to him. Cooper continued that the EDI provided institutional support and structure for the association, as it “gives a guiding frame for how the MQAA will run so that it orientates itself around equity and diversity instead of prioritizing, for example, white queer people.” 
The association is still determining what it’s going to look like. According to Cooper, organizers are working towards implementing fundraising and mentorship programs within the association, “so that people could talk to a queer person in the field they wish to go into and have mentorship where they aren’t afraid of there being homophobia,” he says. Mentorship would also be aimed at supporting queer alumni post-graduation. Cooper says, “There’s a lot of concerns when people graduate due to gender presentation or sexuality of how to present themselves in the workforce, or how to network, or even just if people have been very engaged in the queer community as McGill and then move away, losing connections can be hard.”
The association also aims to give queer students access to the wide network of queer alumni. “We have Alum at McGill across the world,” says Fan, “[the goal is] to provide opportunities to engage online, particularly given this pandemic environment, hopefully in-person in the future, and for us to know each other and to provide solidarity for each other in our communities.” 
As the association continues to grow and evolve, the MQAA will be hosting events. On October 19, they hosted a Meet and Greet event, where leaders introduced themselves, the state of mandate was presented, and attendees answered poll questions and participated in discussion. According to Cooper, discussion points included the importance of campus or community entities’ involvement, concerns over whether the MQAA should focus on funding initiatives for current students, and if the association should include allies or be a closed space. 
More events are currently being planned, per Cooper. At the moment, everything will be held online, but the association eventually plans to hold in-person events in Montreal once pandemic conditions are safer. 
MQAA leaders are currently looking for student and alumni involvement and input on what the MQAA should look like; if you have ideas or request for the association you can contact the Subcommittee on Queer People by emailing queer@mcgill.ca. Queer History Month events will be wrapping up this week; the closing event, a Queer Open Mic with the Opera Queens (an Opera company led by Fan) is happening October 28. “It’s really meaningful during Queer History Month this year that [the MQAA] is actually coming together and being announced and that there are new individuals getting involved,” says Fan. “It really is acknowledging both the queer history that’s coming before us and hopefully the positive queer history coming after us as well.”
