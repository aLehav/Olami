Following weeks of public hearings and vitriolic accusations, Premier Jean Charest has been cleared of allegations of influence peddling in the judicial appointment process.
Following weeks of public hearings and vitriolic accusations, Premier Jean Charest has been cleared of allegations of influence peddling in the judicial appointment process.
At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, former Supreme Court of Canada Justice Michel Bastarache announced that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that Charest was complicit in rigging the judicial nomination process for appointing three judges – Michel Simard, Marc Bisson, and Line Gosselin-Després – from 2003 to 2004.
On April 14, 2010, the provincial government tasked Bastarache with heading an investigation into former Justice Minister Marc Bellemare’s accusations that he received undue pressure from Liberal fundraisers to select particular judges. After weeks of public speculation and controversial testimonies, the Bastarache commission finally concluded in an approximately 300-page report.
“The majority of the evidence leads me to conclude that these nominations were those of Mr. Bellemare,” said Bastarache in a press conference, reported by Le Devoir. “He was not forced to act against his will.”
Shortly afterward, Charest made a statement to the press reaffirming the report’s conclusions: “Quebeckers can be reassured about the integrity of the judicial system in Quebec,” said the premier in French, reported by TVA, “and so can the men and women who occupy the positions of judges, and who lived with great difficulty last year as false accusations sowed doubts about our judicial system.”
However, Bastarache noted that the appointment of provincial judges is susceptible to political influence, and recommended clarifying the role of different government actors and instituting a more rigid structure to the judicial nomination process.
“He did not really apportion blame, but instead raised some red flags about the ‘porousness’ of the appointment process and its potential to be subject to political influence, including the discretionary power of the minister of justice,” wrote Antonia Maioni, the director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, in an email to The Daily.
Despite the positive resolution of the Bastarache commission for Charest, according to a Léger-Marketing poll the premier’s Liberal government still faces a severe lack of credibility among Quebeckers.  The poll, conducted from January 10 to 12, revealed that 75 per cent of respondents were dissatisfied with the Liberal party.
According to Maioni, it is doubtful whether the commission’s outcome will restore Charest’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
“The facts were the object of conflicting testimony; most damaging was the spectacle of having the sitting premier being accused in this way and of having the judicial appointment process being called into question under his administration,” she said.

Both parties blame each other for delay in start of collective agreement negotiations
Negotiations for a new collective agreement between McGill and the University’s largest non-academic worker’s union – representing over 1,600 employees – broke down this past Thursday before they even began, with both parties blaming miscommunication and the other side for the delays.
Kevin Whittaker, president of the McGill University Non-Certified Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), has attributed the delay to the administration’s refusal to provide financial information. Whittaker maintained that MUNACA was prepared to present its “non-economical” demands, including increased job protection and better vacation leaves. However, the union’s request for financial information from McGill regarding payroll, benefits, and other matters, had not been met. MUNACA was hence unable to present its economic demands.
“McGill has refused to negotiate with us until we provide its bargaining committee with a full set of our demands. To do this, we first need financial information from McGill,” said Whittaker.
He explained that the only information that McGill provided MUNACA was locked in PDF files that could not be modified. Similarly, MUNACA did not receive any of the scheduling and salary-related information it requested.
A statement issued by McGill’s human relations department claims that it did provide the financial information in the same format as in the past.
According to Lynne Gervais, Associate Vice-Principle of McGill Human Resources, negotiations failed when MUNACA failed to present its full set of demands.
“At our meeting, MUNACA was not ready with its demands. It had not prepared them,” Gervais said. “Until negotiations officially begin, there’s not much I can say.”
Gervais explained that, conventionally, negotiations only begin once both parties have set forth their final and complete set of proposals. This was the expectation heading into the meeting, an expectation Gervais said McGill fulfilled.
“MUNACA was given the requested financial information,” said Gervais. “They just didn’t like the format it was given in.”
The delay has left Whittaker frustrated. “We want to continue with negotiations on non-economical concerns, but McGill has insisted on waiting.”
According to Whittaker, during pre-negotiations in December MUNACA clearly expressed a need for specific financial data from McGill. However, on January 13, the University informed MUNACA that it felt the union already had all the necessary information to form its proposals.
“What puzzles me is why McGill did not inform us of this in December rather than refusing to bargain in January,” said Whittaker.
Demands
According to Whittaker, one of MUNACA’s main demands is fairer staffing processes. “We want better selection of personnel that respects the seniority of MUNACA workers,” he said. “Currently, McGill overrides our contract by hiring less-experienced non-union workers because it is cheaper to do so.”
Whittaker feels that it is important for senior personnel to have their seniority respected rather than act as a hiring obstacle. “We want a staffing process that will encourage our members to grow rather than remain in the same place,” he said.
MUNACA is also seeking a more transparent scheduling process. The union wants to receive specific work schedules from McGill. It also wants to be notified when the schedules are changed, which McGill has failed to do before.
Once negotiations begin, Whittaker will most likely start with non-economical demands. “Why not start now when both parties have prepared their non-economical demands?” he asked. “Perhaps after seeing McGill’s demands, we can decide how to arrange our priorities and continue accordingly.”
Whittaker speculates that salaries will be the point of greatest contention.
Regarding the timeline of negotiations, Whittaker had little to say. “We had hoped to reach a resolution within a year,” said Whittaker. “But since negotiations are being dragged out from the beginning, it could take awhile.”
“When MUNACA is ready with all its proposals, we will be ready to negotiate,” said Gervais.
Both parties are scheduled to meet again on January 26.

McGill Law student’s survey data sheds light on equity and diversity issues
According to a report entitled “An Evaluation of Undergraduate Education Quality at McGill University, 2009-10” the majority of McGill undergraduates are concerned with how effectively McGill prepares them for future employment, adequate advising, and academic gains. The report, authored by second-year Law student Michael Shortt, was presented to SSMU Council on November 25, 2010.
Shortt has produced an annual report at the behest of each SSMU VP University Affairs for the past four years. This year’s report contains the results of the 2010 Vulcan Student Survey, completed by 1,193 students – about five per cent of the undergraduate class.
One of the report’s main focuses is workforce preparedness. Of the students surveyed, only six per cent of U1 students and nine per cent of U3 students considered themselves very well prepared to enter the workforce, while twenty per cent of U1 students and 33 per cent of U3 students felt well prepared.
In an email to The Daily, Shortt said, “This pattern of poor performance on McGill’s part is particularly troubling, given that most undergraduates place a high importance on employability and workforce-related skills.”
Another point of concern highlighted by the report was academic advising. Only 15 per cent of first-year students and eight per cent of students in their graduating year agreed that they were satisfied with the program advising they had received. According to the report, many students stated that the program advising they received was often “revealed to be unhelpful over time and in many cases prevented them from reaching their academic and personal goals.”
Findings on academic gains, and students’ abilities to retain information were equally concerning. Only five per cent of students ranked their “ability to recall facts or background material related to [their] discipline” as “very good.” Further, seven per cent of students strongly agreed that “I receive extensive feedback on my assignments and exams.”
The library received high marks, with 68 per cent of students agreeing that, “The library is comfortable and inviting” and 59 per cent agreeing that, “There are enough quiet study spaces for individuals in the library.”
Shortt said, “The library has always been very supportive of the survey and always takes a keen interest in its results.”
Within the Equity and Diversity section of the report, Shortt also reported that, although only nine per cent of white students felt, “or have been made to feel, uncomfortable on campus due to [their] race or ethnicity” – compared to 36 per cent of non-white students – it is important to focus on their feeling included on campus. He wrote that some white students “felt excluded from groups which focused on a specific ethnic group or gender.”
Emily Clare, SSMU Equity Commissioner, was “not surprised” with the report’s findings. She noted the importance of keeping up with the trends mentioned, as “equity is constantly changing and evolving.”
When gender or nationality-specific groups meet, explained Clare, “It’s not to exclude people. It’s about community within a specific subset of individuals. These tensions are a part of our human existence. McGill is a really great place to learn about inter-group dynamics – it’s a microcosm of the larger world,” said Clare.
Shortt clarified that his role in this process was not to lobby for policy changes.
“As a researcher, my role was to gather and report data. Which means, of course, that the report is all problems and no solutions,” he said.
Josh Abaki, SSMU VP University Affairs, said that “the data that we gathered from the survey will form the basis for discussion on different Senate committees and Faculty councils…and some points will be raised up at Senate.”
Shortt also stated that Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning, had received and commented upon the report, “He seemed to be genuinely interested in what students had to say, and in identifying how their experiences of McGill’s strengths and weaknesses mapped onto the strengths we aspire to.”
“Of course it’s early,” said Shortt, “so it’s impossible to say whether that commitment will be continued. I’m optimistic though.”

After anger and outrage over the behaviour of Concordia University’s Board of Governors, Concordia newspaper The Link published an open letter penned by Concordia faculty members on January 10. The letter, signed by 181 faculty members, demands increased transparency in the actions of Concordia’s Board of Governors. It was addressed to Peter Kruyt, the Chair of the Board, and calls for the Board to issue a statement of their actions.
“The Board appears to have assumed the role of a modern-day star chamber, acting according to its own dictates, accountable and answerable to no one,” the letter reads.
The publication of the letter came on the heels of the Board’s dismissal of former Concordia President Judith Woodsworth on December 23. Her departure joins a series of unexplained shifts in the senior administrative ranks, including the removal of five Vice Presidents and one President in the last six years.
In addition to the letter, the Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA) issued a motion at a January 17 meeting, calling for Kruyt and the vice-chair of the Board to step down. “This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue,” wrote the CUFA on their website, “the reputation of the University has been tarnished and the morale of the university community has been eroded.”
Many members of Concordia’s academic community also question the Board’s management of university funds. Several of the senior administrators who have been asked to step down by the Board have received large severance packages.
“These dismissals and departures cost money that faculty members, staff and students are constantly told the university does not have,” read an open letter addressed to Kruyt, “it’s an abuse of power.”
In reply, Kruyt released a letter on January 12 to the Concordia community stating his reasons for withholding specific details surrounding Woodsworth’s departure. Kruyt wrote, “Notwithstanding our support of the principle of transparency, good governance requires, among other things, that the Board respect confidentiality agreements in conducting the business of the University.”
Free Education Montreal (FEM), a Montreal-based advocacy group formed to eliminate tuition, has insisted that the entire Board should resign. “The board is tainted by hubris,” says their website. “It has engaged in behaviour unbecoming of members of a collegial institution.”
FEM also calls upon Line Beauchamp, Minister of Education, Recreation, and Sports for the Quebec Liberal Party, to create an inquiry into the actions and motives of the Board.
In response to the events, Beauchamp expressed distress to the Gazette and said she is watching the proceedings at Concordia intently.

Anxiety as local Tunisians rally for revolution at home
Thousands of supporters of what Western media have dubbed the Jasmine Revolution gathered in Montreal’s Dorchester Square this past Saturday as former Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted on January 14.
Haroun Bouazzi, an organizer of the rally and member of the group Collectif de solidarité au Canada avec les luttes sociales en Tunisie, emphasized the participation of Tunisian and non-Tunisian Quebeckers alike. The rally was attended by hundreds of “people that felt close to our cause because Tunisian people were fighting for values that are shared,” he said.  These included members of the political party Québec solidaire, Amnesty International, and various labour unions.
Françoise David, spokesperson for Québec solidaire, attended the rally. “People were in high spirits, but also concerned because on the one hand they were able to oust the dictator Ben Ali from power, but on the other hand, at the same time people were obviously concerned about what was going to happen in the future,” she told The Daily in French.
In the days following Ben Ali’s ouster, attention has turned toward a Westmount mansion that, according to property records obtained by the Gazette, is owned by Mohamed Sakher El Materi, the billionaire son-in-law of the ousted dictator. Members of the Tunisian community have protested outside the house in recent days, throwing ketchup and placing a sign that declares the mansion the “property of the Tunisian people.” El Materi is currently renting out the house, however Montreal has been cited as a possible asylum destination for the billionaire.
There was no sign of activity or vandalism, and the mansion showed clear signs of being under renovations Monday evening. The property overlooks downtown Montreal, with an expansive view of the city from the slopes of Mount Royal.
In the now oft-quoted diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, American Ambassador to Tunisia Robert F. Godec wrote that, after a July 2009 dinner, El Materi “repeatedly pointed out the lovely view from his home and frequently corrected his staff, issued orders and barked reprimands.” The ambassador criticized El Materi for the “wealth and excess” and “over-the-top” nature in which he and his family lived alongside the poverty of Tunisia. According to the BBC, El Materi’s mansion in Tunis, where he entertained Godec and kept a pet tiger named Pasha, has since been looted by demonstrators and left in ruins.
Bouazzi insists he had nothing to do with organizing the demonstrations outside the El Materi mansion in Montreal, but will campaign to bring El Materi to justice all the same.
“The day we will have real justice in Tunisia, we’ll ask any country where he is – Canada or France or Saudi Arabia – to send him back to Tunisia and to have a trial in the Tunisian justice system,” he said.
The role of WikiLeaks in the popular revolution has been downplayed by many bloggers as well as activists, including Bouazzi. “This revolution was made by Tunisian people and just because of the struggle for justice, and it is not because of WikiLeaks.”
Bouazzi gave more credit to the role of social media and mobile technology – such as Twitter and Facebook, outside the control of Ben Ali – as a means of organizing demonstrations.
When asked about the possibility of El Materi and his family seeking asylum in Canada, Ahmed Ben Fekih of the Tunisian Embassy in Ottawa said that “it’s not for the embassy to decide – this is a Canadian immigration issue,” though he also stated he too was interested in locating El Materi, who is reportedly in France.
Robert Gervais, the Media Relations Spokesperson for the Immigration and Refugee Board for the Eastern Region of Canada, refused to discuss El Materi, stating, “We don’t comment on international events.” He further stressed that Canadian immigration policy was to evaluate refugees fleeing Tunisia on a “case-by-case basis.”
Melissa Lantsman, representing Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon, urged “all Tunisians to work together to end the violence that continues to threaten the safety of the people and safety on the ground. What he [Cannon] has been clear about is that he has welcomed the news of elections to be held in the near future and Canada urges the government of Tunisia to ensure those elections will be both free and fair.”
Ben Fekih hopes that the Canadian government will promote continued economic investment in the country, and despite the current travel advisory against non-essential travel to Tunisia issued by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, one day “encourage tourists to spend their vacations in Tunisia.” He also warned that “television does not show the real reality, and it only throws gas on the fire,” referring to the depiction of riots and unrest in international news. “The real reality is that this started a month ago and it is a social demonstration. People are demanding employment,” he said.
When Bouazzi was asked what is next for international Tunisian activism, he stated. “The Tunisian people had no help from any outside power whatsoever, but now there [are] a lot of powers, especially in the Arab world…that don’t want this experience to succeed. So now we’ll have new things to deal with. … Intelligence services are going to try to destroy the experience,” he said.

The Department of National Defence (DND) hosted an informational session Monday afternoon at Thomson House for McGill graduate students interested in career opportunities within the organization.
This was the first time such a high-level event had been held at Thomson house in at least eight years, claims Bliss Ward, the building’s House Manager.
The session was part of the Policy Officers Recruitment Program, a nationwide DND initiative seeking graduate students looking for post-graduate employment. The purpose of the program is to prepare these candidates for senior positions in the Canadian military and elsewhere in the federal government.
The recruitment drive was aimed at students in the upper echelons of policy study – specifically MAs in political science or international relations with concentrations in economics, statistics, or sociology.
“Ideal candidates will have an interest in national and international defence and security issues,” according to their website.
The elite recruitment program offers a base salary of $50,000 for the first two years and can climb to as high as $70,000 within a few years. The program also provides candidates a $5,000 “relocation allowance” for those who move to Ottawa to work for the department.
McGill’s Career and Planning Service notified graduate students of the session in a broadcast e-mail from Graduate Student Career Advisor Susan Molnar, obtained by The Daily. Neither Molnar nor officials from the DND could be reached for comment Wednesday.

SSMU President Zach Newburgh, along with two of his fellow executives and one Councillor, introduced a notice of motion proposing to abolish the current General Assembly (GA) model, replacing it with an  “Annual General Meeting.” SSMU Council is scheduled to vote on the motion at its next meeting, on February 3.
The motion was submitted by Newburgh, VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew, VP Internal Tom Fabian, and Councillor Emilie Leonard, a fact that was announced only after Management Councillor Eli Freedman inquired about its authorship. Speaker of Council Cathal Rooney-Cespedes ruled that debate on the content of the resolution was out of order, due to its status as a notice of motion.
VP External Myriam Zaidi and VP University Affairs Josh Abaki declined to comment on the resolution’s content until it is debated and voted upon at the next Council meeting.
The motion outlines the removal of SSMU bylaws regarding the GA process as it currently exists.
The resolution’s description of the AGM stipulates that “Annual General Meetings shall not entertain any other resolutions that are not contained within Articles 28.1 and 28.2”
These limit the agenda to four items: presentation of the State of the Society, the ratification of nominations to the [SSMU] Board of Directors, a review of audited financial statements, and the nomination of the Financial Auditor.
Under this model, students could submit resolutions for consideration by Council, and no other student body. Resolutions would require motion by fifty Society members or one Councillor, and would remove the option for non-Council members to vote.
The Fall General Assembly, held on October 21, 2010, had difficulty reaching and maintaining quorum: after the GA, Newburgh had told The Daily that the process warranted review and that, due to room occupancy restrictions, the current GA model is “really not a democracy, it’s first-come, first-serve democracy.”
In response to concerns that structural changes to the GA would rid students of an open forum for democratic debate, Newburgh insisted that “now that [the motion] is presented, there are individuals on Council who will ponder this question, [who] will hopefully bring amendments to the floor, and that Steering Committee will now consider the question with real rigor. There is absolutely an intention to ensure that there is more democracy for individuals in the Society.”
Arch Café finally dead?
Councillor Maggie Knight requested an update on the status of Architecture Café discussions.
Newburgh refused to comment publicly on the issue.
A Board of Governors report on January 19th informed Senate that “the October 25, 2010 Executive Committee meeting included an extensive discussion of a comprehensive report provided by the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning).”
“The Committee concluded that there was no apparent basis for the Board to reconsider the administrative decision to close the Architecture Café given the thorough consideration and well-documented reasons for the closure,” the report read.
It is unclear whether the subject will be presented again at future Council meetings.
Read the full text of the proposal here.

New Securitas contract among items approved
Senate easily passed a new policy on cyclical academic unit reviews yesterday. Reviews will be conducted at least twice a month over the course of seven years. Lydia White, a Faculty of Arts Senator, will manage the process.
Eric Caplan, senator for the Faculty of Education, was the only opposition to the motion, on the grounds that it “would be useful [to have] some kind of mechanism for the departments and the evaluating committee to have a conversation.”
When Provost Anthony Masi replied that such a process would be very costly, Caplan disagreed.
“As of right now, the reports that come out are a series of monologues – it would be more collegial to have more dialogue, and as five of the seven reviewers are McGill employees, they could easily be connected through Skype [or such technology],” he said in an interview with The Daily. “So I don’t see any budgetary problems, and nobody raised any procedural problems, so that was the only reason for my opposition.”
Board of Governors report
Amir Raz, Senate representative from the Board of Governors (BoG), reported to Senate that the BoG approved the purchase of ten “state-of-the-art” sequencers as per the Genomics Funding Proposal at its October 25, 2010 meeting.
In closed session, the BoG Executive Committee also approved “any purchase contracts and accessory documents of $4 million or more associated with the Genomics funding proposal approved by the Executive Committee on March 22, 2010,” according to the Board report.
At closed session on November 30, 2010, the BoG approved of a number of other items that were not presented at Senate, but were included in the report.
These include awarding a contract to Securitas Canada Inc. that will be effective from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2014, increasing premium rates for the McGill Health and Dental Plans, and authorizing a budget to convert 410 Sherbrooke O. into a residence.
As required by the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail du Québec (CSST), the BoG also approved giving “signing authority to the manager of staff benefits in Human Resources Department for claims from the University for 2011, 2012, and 2013.”
Exams, Academic Advising, and Mentorship
Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), presented a motion yesterday to create a “comprehensive University policy regarding the assessment of students,” to be voted on at the next Senate meeting taking place February 16. VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki is the student representative to a working group on examination regulations.
Student Arts Senator Amara Possian spoke yesterday about the upcoming launch of a new cross-faculty mentorship program. Over the past two years the Dean of Students Jane Everrett and Faculty of Science Senator David Harpp have been developing a program to address “the lack of a sense of community at McGill and the lack of mentorship – especially outside of one’s faculty or development,” said Possian in an interview with The Daily. “There are opportunities for mentorship through CaPS [Career Planning Service] or through one’s program, but McGill doesn’t make an effort to create a sense of community across faculties or departments.” The new program aims to bridge this divide. Student sign-up begins on February 1.
