Progressive taxation after graduation can help reduce upfront costs 
As tuition fees continue to rise across the country, a study published last month examining post-secondary education funding in British Columbia states that students are already paying the full cost of their degree – despite government subsidization – through taxes after graduation.
The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) published the study by economist Iglika Ivanova, which updates a 1998 CCPA report by former UBC economist Robert Allen.
“In British Columbia, 30 years ago…government funding used to be 88 per cent of university operating expenditure, and now its 57 per cent,” said Ivanova. “[Universities] used to be funded a lot by taxpayers, and now they’re funded more by tuition and private funding.”
This altered funding was part of the motivation behind the CCPA study. Ivanova said she wanted to see if students then paid the government-subsidized university costs through taxes after they graduate.
Ivanova found that trends similar to those found in the 1998 CCPA study still apply over a decade later. “Students still pay two or three times more than their tuition costs to the public treasury through taxes,” said Ivanova.
“People focus on upfront cost, and, because tuition doesn’t cover the full cost of education, [they believe education is] subsidized,” said Ivanova. “In all of Canada, it’s true that students pay back this subsidy through taxes after graduation.”
Ivanova said the study raises the question of how post-secondary education should be financed.
“Do we want to do it collectively through taxes and then recoup the benefits, or do we want to ask individuals to pay up front through high tuition fees which can create financial barriers and…have an impact on peoples financial situations long after education?” she asked.
SSMU President Maggie Knight said she found the data useful, even though it was exclusive to British Columbia.
“[The data] really makes the case that it just makes more sense to have more public financing of post-secondary education though progressive taxation on university graduates, to prevent the front loading of costs on people who don’t have the same financial security,” she said.
While the study focuses on undergraduate education, the trend applies to graduate studies as well. Professional graduate education is relatively more expensive than undergraduate, a factor that impacts students’ career choices. Ivanova gave the example of law students.
“There is clear evidence that if you charge more upfront…fewer people go into public interest law. More people go into more lucrative forms of law,” said Ivanova. “That’s problematic because it means that we don’t have enough public interest careers.”
Knight pointed out that, despite the study’s focus on British Columbia, there are similar studies regarding Quebec. “This [study shows] that it’s a general trend of tuition increasing. It provides an analysis that does bear out with the ideas that SSMU is mandated to fight for in terms of accessible education and public sector financing,” said Knight.
Ivanova favors the idea of a similar study being conducted to integrate nationwide statistics and to account for provincial differences, despite the difficulties that would involve such an expansive study.
“There’s a lot we don’t know in education, and that’s why it’s difficult to do a nationwide study,” she said.

Over 10,000 eligible First Nations students denied financial support
Students across Canada are calling upon the federal government to honour Aboriginal treaty rights to post-secondary education by removing a cap on funding growth.
Despite increases in tuition across Canada and the expansion of the Aboriginal population, the growth of the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP) – a government-funded program that provides financial assistance for Status Indian and Inuit students enrolled in post-secondary education – has been capped at 2 per cent since 1996.
Kakwiranoron Cook, outreach coordinator at McGill’s First Peoples’ House, said that while each First Nation has signed its own treaties with the government, they all guarantee Aboriginal access to education.
According to Aboriginal Students’ Representative for the Canadian Federation of Students Patrick Smoke, “It is a treaty responsibility for the federal government to ensure that every First Nation and Inuit student has a right to education.”
Before the 2 per cent growth cap was put in place, Smoke explained, there were 27,000 students receiving funding from the program. Now there are only 22,000.
Not only are tuition hikes outpacing the growth of PSSSP funding, but the number of Aboriginal individuals who are eligible for funding is rapidly increasing as well.
According to the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), the cap has meant that 10,589 eligible First Nations students were denied financial support from 2001 to 2006 as a result of the limited funding available. In 2007-08, AFN estimated that an additional $197 million would be required to overcome the impact of the cap – this number continues to grow.
According to Smoke, “We’re the fastest growing demographic in Canada. We’re outpacing the birthrate by six times… The number of First Nation and Inuit students who want to attend secondary school is going to expand as well.”
Geneviève Guibert, spokesperson for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, confirmed that the department’s approved annual growth rate for the program stands at 2 per cent, but clarified that “the overall annual growth rate is larger due to significant investments – nearly two billion dollars – made in priority areas through successive budgets since 2006.”
Regardless of the actual growth rates, many students are finding that PSSSP funds are still not enough. Many students have to take out loans, and Non-Status First Nations and Métis peoples aren’t eligible for funding.
Cook works with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities across Canada to connect with youth and promote higher education. He has found that “a lot of people are interested in McGill, but the biggest issue is funding.”
Indeed, as the number of students asking for funding increases, Aboriginal communities are forced to make compromises in how they distribute financial assistance.
For Smoke, this may complicate the continuation of his studies. Smoke is from Alderville First Nation outside Toronto, which recently had to divert funding away from healthcare in order to serve the students who had applied for funding. Because of these budgetary constraints, only the students with the best marks will continue to receive funding come September.
“The thought of having to take on $10,000 of debt to pay for my education next year is a scary thought,” he said. “It’s not right because I am entitled to funding, as is every First Nations student in Canada.”
Removing the current growth cap on the PSSSP to fund all eligible students would require an additional investment of about $250 million annually. According to some calculations, however, this is a small figure compared to what the government might save.
Assembly of First Nations Chief Shawn Atleo recently told the National Post, “If in one generation, we close the education gap, and the labour market gap, this could result in new revenue for the Canadian economy of $400-billion, and savings in government expenditures of $115-billion.”
In spite of these figures, Smoke explained, “It is going to be a difficult task with the conservative government that’s currently in place. Considering their cost-cutting mode, to invest $250 million back a year into post-secondary education for Aboriginal students really isn’t on their agenda right now.”
What may be on the agenda, however, is the complete reform of the PSSSP to a government loan program. The current program – which has been under formal government review for seven years – provides financial assistance that does not need to be paid back by its recipients.
“I can’t imagine what the day would be when they decided to change [the PSSSP] into loans,” said Cook. “There would be a lot of outcry for sure, and it’s hard to imagine what that would do to sway students away from pursuing post-secondary education.”
Smoke added that “a lot of First Nations and Inuit students cannot take on debt… By making [PSSSP] a loans program you’re going to see our numbers drop [in post-secondary education].”
For many of those calling on the government to increase funding to the PSSSP, it is a matter of the government responsibility to honour treaty rights and promote equity.
First Peoples’ House Aboriginal Student Advisor and recent McGill graduate Alyse VanEvery, who received funding from PSSSP, explained that “I’ve heard my non-native friends say, ‘Oh, you’re so lucky, look what you get.’ No, look back, look at the bigger picture. I’m not so lucky. There is such a thing as discrimination in this world,” she said.
“At the end of the day, the government funds students [because of treaty rights], and I don’t think it’s a lot to ask for,” she continued.

#6party may be formally included in negotiations with administration 
QPIRG announced details of its offer to enter into tripartite negotiations with the McGill administration concerning the validity of the results of its fall 2011 referendum.
If accepted, the offer would mean that QPIRG, the McGill administration, and the group of students who occupied the office of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson in the James Administration building – who are known as “#6party” – would sit at the bargaining table.
QPIRG has been in discussions with McGill concerning the referendum results, however, member of the QPIRG Board of Directors Kira Page said the organization had not been meeting frequently over the past week.
“They offered us the same thing they offered to CKUT on Monday, and we asked them for time to consider that decision given the context of the occupation, and that was until Friday,” she explained.
CKUT announced on Wednesday that they had accepted McGill’s offer: submitting a new question concerning the online opt-out system in exchange for recognition of the existence portion of the question.
Page spoke to the reasoning behind QPIRG’s offer to include the occupiers.
“Given that their primary demand is the same as our primary demand, namely the full recognition of the referendum results, we felt like particularly for that reason, the best thing to do moving forward would be to try to get everybody at the same table,” she said.
A QPIRG press release stated, “In light of the administration’s refusal to negotiate with the students of #6party and their increasingly inhumane treatment of these students (including but not limited to denying them access to food, bathrooms, and electricity), we hope to resolve this dispute as soon as possible.”
“We believe that in-person negotiations between representatives of the three parties will be the most expedient way to achieve this,” the statement read.
Ethan Feldman, a student on the sixth floor and Daily staffer, said that the students learned of QPIRG’s offer “moments before the press release was sent out.”
“[QPIRG] chose to do this, and without a doubt we have their back, and we’re glad that they have ours. It’s important to have allies,” Feldman said.
Both Feldman and Page stated that QPIRG was not involved in planning the occupation.
“We very much stand in solidarity with students being able to take these sorts of actions and we totally understand the place that it’s coming from, the anger and frustration with the way that the administration is disregarding student democracy and student democratic processes,” said Page.
However, Page noted that the two groups do not share all the same demands.
“We’ll be negotiating on the goals that we share, namely, the full recognition of the referendum results,” she added.
The sixth floor occupiers are also calling for Mendelson to work out of Service Point for the remainder of his term, devote at least 15 per cent of his workday to holding office hours for students, and reconfigure his former office into a student space.
QPIRG negotiations are held with representatives from Mendelson’s office. Director of Media Relations at McGill Doug Sweet told The Daily that Mendelson was unavailable to comment on QPIRG’s offer.
Since occupying Mendelson’s office on Tuesday, the only administrator that students on the sixth floor have negotiated with is Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell.
Page said she hopes to resume negotiations over the weekend. “None of us like working weekends, but in the context of people being denied access to food and bathrooms and electricity, and having been in [the James building] since Tuesday, we really want to move forward as quickly as possible,” she said.

Incident latest in series; no specific support group on the campus exists dedicated to queer issues
Article updated Feb. 13, 2012
On February 2, a Macdonald Campus student was assaulted at an event by six non-McGill students, who fled the scene without being identified. He was attacked for dancing with another male student.
The student, Kristian Fidrych, a U2 Wildlife Biology student, was put into a headlock, punched, and kicked until he managed to escape. It is believed the assailants were intoxicated.
The incident has put Macdonald campus under the microscope for what has become an ongoing issue for its small queer community. Although this was the worst attack Fidrych has experienced, he said that it is not the first.
In an interview with The Daily, Fidrych described past incidents.
“At least the [students] that are out [who] I know…most of them have experienced verbal [attacks] and pushing to a degree,” he said.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs for the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences David Lewis called the incident “really sad and unfortunate.”
“I just wish [the incidents] didn’t occur, but I can’t stop them from occurring,” he continued.
As well as associate dean, Lewis is also disciplinary officer for the faculty, and is charged with resolving issues like these either formally or informally. In Fidrych’s case, no disciplinary action can be taken because the attackers were not McGill students.
“If students come in to me and say they’ve been harassed or something of that sort, then of course they have a grievance, and I’m there ready to help them as best I can,” said Lewis.
Lewis noted that, due to the nature of the small community atmosphere at Macdonald campus, when issues like this do occur, they attract increased attention.
Fidrych cites the rural atmosphere and a small group of students who “come from non-urban areas that aren’t exposed to the gay lifestyle,” as a possibility for the high incident rate.
For targets of homophobia at Macdonald campus, there is no specific support group dedicated to these issues. At the downtown campus, SACOMSS (Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society) and Queer McGill act as support groups. Queer McGill’s Macdonald counterpart, Rainbow Mac, closed this year after a chronic lack of members in recent years.
Fidrych said queer students that have not publicly come out were afraid to join.
“They didn’t want to be associated with being gay, with Rainbow Mac, because they were afraid,” he said.
It is an option for queer students to come downtown, or phone in to support services to seek help. As Kate Rath-Wilson, external coordinator for SACOMSS said, “We’re here to listen to anyone who wants to call the line.”
Lewis said he hoped that “students in these kind of situations would, at the very least, speak to someone that they are comfortable with,” and also hoped that they’ll feel comfortable speaking with him.
Rath-Wilson said that SACOMSS has been lobbying to get Rez Project into Mac residences. Rez Project is a seminar for first-year students living in residences, where discussion focuses on “gender identity, consent, and a whole bunch of issues that come with people living together.”
As for Fidrych, he expressed some apprehension about his next visit to the campus.
“This is scary. I don’t really see myself partaking in any late-night activities there anymore,” he said.

Provincial Day of Action scheduled for March 22
Since last spring, when the Quebec government announced a $1,625 increase in tuition fees over the next five years, debate has sparked among students about how best to protest the hikes.
A group of McGill students have been organizing with students and organizations across the province to organize a general student strike this spring.
At the winter AUS General Assembly (GA), Jaime Maclean, a member of the AUS Mobilization Committee, supported a motion to create an AUS Strike Committee. The motion did not pass due to loss of quorum. According to Maclean, the committee would inform students about what a strike would look like, and rally support through “grassroots mobilization.”
Maclean said that in order to vote on a general student strike, AUS would need to become a member of the pro-strike organization Coalition large de l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE). In order for AUS to become a member, its constitution must be amended to make the GA the highest governing body of the society.
The question will be voted on in a special referendum already underway.
Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, a spokesperson for CLASSE, said that the coalition has already begun discussing a possible start date for the strike. He told The Daily he hopes that McGill’s student associations “will join the strike as soon as possible.”
Nadeau-Dubois added that CLASSE plans to stay on strike until the government repeals the hikes.
Maclean said that joining a coalition of Quebec student associations is necessary because it will play an important role in government negotiations. “If we don’t join a larger coalition like [CLASSE], or if we don’t go on strike, then our voices will be lost,” she said.
If the AUS joins CLASSE, students will be able to vote in a GA on the question of a general student strike this March. Should the vote pass, it will have to be renewed on a weekly basis.
“The point is to keep it democratic and make sure that students are still committed to the cause,” Maclean said.
SSMU VP External Joël Pedneault explained that in the case of a general strike, students would have to partake in picket lines and encourage others not to go to class in order for it to be effective.
Pedneault also noted the possibility of forming a “strike council.” This council, made up of anyone from the student body who chooses to be involved, would meet on a daily basis to brainstorm ideas and decide what actions students should take. He stressed the potential for this process to be “as open as possible.”
“People can decide to use the energy that was created this year to make the University more democratic, and oppose specific government policies,” Pedneault said.
Both Pedneault and Maclean also stressed that, based on the history of student activism in Quebec, a student strike could be successful in putting economic pressure on the provincial government.
“A student strike isn’t about striking from education, it’s about putting economic pressure on the government because [universities] can’t sustain a cancelled semester,” Maclean said.

McGill shuts washroom facilities to #6party
The students occupying the sixth floor of the James Administration building, known as #6party, initially demanded the resignation of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson. However, in a communique released on Friday night, the students announced that they have “reformulated” their demands.
The occupiers are now calling for Mendelson to work out of Service Point for the remainder of his term, devote at least 15 per cent of his workday to holding office hours open to students, and to reconfigure his former office into a student space. The group’s second demand, pertaining to the recognition of the fall referenda, remains the same.
U4 Arts student Ethan Feldman explained that the decision had been made on Thursday night.
“We had a clear and level-headed discussion with ourselves about what was going on, and we recognize that those who only receive our public messages do not know our private internal lives, and do not see all the conversation that goes on behind the scenes,” he said.
“Our demands [aim] to be received by the administration. It is clear that they haven’t. Where they have been received is in the public sphere, and in that sense it is important that we provide a message to our audience because those who have the ability to deal with our demands have not budged,” Feldman continued.
Another round of negotiations between #6party and Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell took place Thursday evening. Feldman stated, however, that Nicell is in contact with #6party outside of negotiations.
Feldman spoke to the students’ relationship with Nicell.
“[Nicell] is honest in that he always tells us the limits of his abilities. He makes it clear that he has no power and he is just a pawn, wasting our time when he comes to negotiate and when he calls us, and he is deadly honest about it,” he said. “He’s been deadly honest about how powerless he is. We trust him in a sense.”
Nicell called the students Thursday evening as reports of increasing security were disseminated.
Pierre-Paul Tellier, director of Student Health Services, also called students on Thursday, to follow up from his Wednesday visit to the sixth floor.
Nicell called again on Friday morning shortly before the students were informed that they would no longer have access to washrooms.
“We shut [down] the washroom being used by the protestors on the sixth floor, as another measure to get them to leave of their own accord. We are maintaining access to drinking water,” wrote Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa in an email to all students and staff at around 12:30 p.m. on Friday.
“We are working very actively to end the situation, but are also taking steps to ensure that acts of civil disobedience on campus are conducted in a way that does not cause undue disruptions to university activities,” Di Grappa continued.
A student on the sixth floor who wished to remain anonymous told The Daily on Friday afternoon that the group has created an “improvised bathroom” in one corner.
“We’re using bags, and hopefully soon air freshener, to go to the bathroom. We’re considering a variety of tactics for disposing of shit,” he said.
The student said #6party does not intend to end the occupation.
“It changes the day-to-day experience in a minor way, but we all came prepared for not having access to a proper bathroom, and we all came prepared to accept contingency measures,” he said.
The occupier told The Daily that the students have a “good food supply,” and “a sustainable re-supply system” in the form of a pulley that was first used on Thursday night to get food and supplies up to the sixth floor.
Feldman told The Daily that Nicell called the students on Friday night wishing them a “very nice, peaceful night.” Moments later, he reported that security agents covered the window to the hallway with paper blocking out all light. Students have LED flashlights and headlamps. One hour later, #6party tweeted that the paper had been removed.

Letter neither condones nor condemns the occupiers 
SSMU Legislative Council decided last Thursday to support a peaceful resolution to the student occupation of the James Administration building.
Council decided neither to condone nor to condemn the occupiers, seeking to avoid placing blame on the students.
At the start of the session, during the announcement period, Jade Calver, president of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), announced that Jamie Burnett would no longer represent the Faculty of Arts on SSMU Council. The AUS announced that a statement justifying the decision is forthcoming.
Burnett released a statement accusing Calver of being in violation of the AUS Constitution, as she made the announcement to Council without submitting a  motion for his removal.
The discussion about the James occupation began after members of the gallery and Engineering Senator Usman Bin Shahid urged SSMU to make an official statement.
Arts Senator Matt Crawford and Clubs and Services Representative Adam Winer were among the 23 students who entered the office of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson last Tuesday.
Following calls for unity on campus from both councillors and students, Council decided to adopt a tone of cooperation in the letter.
Cameron Butler, a U3 Engineering student and member of the gallery, stated that he disagreed with the occupation, but also expressed that he wanted to avoid students blaming each other.
“It is counterproductive to condemn the occupiers. The SSMU needs to work at bringing together the student community – that is more productive than placing blame,” said Butler.
Emil Briones, Music senator, echoed Butler’s feelings and said that “focus should not be placed on making the student body more divided.”
“We have to steer away from labelling each other for doing things we believe in,” said Briones.
However, some students present in the gallery asked Council to condemn the actions of the occupiers following the writing of an open letter that had been signed by approximately 200 students at the time Council was held.
Brendan Steven, U2 Arts, asked Council to take a specific political stance on the actions of the occupiers.
“The SSMU has always been willing to endorse politically divisive issues – it would show a lack of courage if it failed to condemn the occupiers,” said Steven.
Zach Newburgh, former SSMU president, was also active in calling for condemnation of the occupiers.
“There is something wrong if we don’t come together in condemnation. This is not a divisive issue. The tactics are not appropriate. Members of this body that participated will have a hard time talking to the administration,” said Newburgh.
Following debate, councillors drafted a letter calling for a resolution of the occupation that “does not involve the use of force,” and expressing the “wish to see a constructive outcome to the current situation, one which expands the possibility for a more democratic University.”
Shortly after discussing the occupation, Council decided to propose a question for the winter referendum period to reform the Judicial Board (J-Board).
The question asks for a change in the SSMU Constitution to abolish the final authority the J-Board currently holds.
Newburgh and Steven, who have a pending J-Board case against Elections SSMU CEO Rebecca Tacoma, expressed their concern over decisions that could affect SSMU.
Newburgh stated that “lack of legal expertise” could lead to “ambiguity in the interpretation of the laws at hand.”
SSMU President Maggie Knight suggested that councillors vote in favour of the question on referendum, citing “no reason to doubt the competence of the SSMU legal counsel.”
Council also adopted a referendum question regarding the composition of the J-Board, which will propose adding two undergraduate students who are not in the Faculty of Law.
In addition, referendum questions will be brought forward regarding the CKUT fee becoming  non-opt-outable, as well as an increase to the fee for the SSMU Health Plan.

The Coalition Avenir du Québec has not yet won an election 
As the National Assembly prepares to reconvene on February 14, members of Quebec’s newest and most popular political party – the Coalition Avenir du Québec (CAQ) – will likely be sitting as independents.
On November 4, 2011, the CAQ was registered as a party with Quebec’s chief electoral officer, but has yet to be recognized as an official party by the National Assembly, despite holding nine seats in the Liberal-controlled Assembly.
In a poll conducted last December by CROP – a Quebec polling firm – the CAQ finished first with 39 per cent, beating the incumbent Liberals by over 10 per cent. CAQ leader François Legault expects an election to be called this spring.
Legault has capitalized on dissatisfaction among the majority of Quebecers alientated by the divisive rhetoric opposing federalism to sovereignty.
A former PQ minister, Legault wants to instead focus on the economy and improving the quality of life of Quebecers.
The Action Démocratique du Québec (ADQ), another opposition party in Quebec, merged with the CAQ on January 22, bringing six Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) with them. Three Parti Québécois (PQ) members have also defected to the CAQ.
The legal requirement for official recognition as a party is 12 MNAs and 20 per cent of the popular vote in a general election. Exceptions can be granted, as one was for the ADQ in 2009, by the Office of the National Assembly.
Robert Dutrisac, National Assembly correspondent for Le Devoir, said it is unlikely the CAQ will get a favourable decision from the Liberal-controlled Office.
“In 2009, there had been a recommendation from the Office of the National Assembly…recognize the ADQ. At the time, it was in the interest of Premier [Jean] Charest to recognize the party, but now things are different,” said Dutrisac in French.
In an interview in French with The Daily, CAQ President Dominique Anglade said the official party status would allow the current CAQ MNAs to have significantly longer speaking time, as well as a $400,000 research budget.
Anglade said the extra speaking time is what counts for the CAQ, because “they want to be able to talk about the real issues Quebec is facing today.”
“People want to hear what the new voices on the political landscape have to say,” said Anglade.
Both the Liberals and the PQ have challenged the CAQ’s legitimacy on the basis that they have not yet won an election.
The CAQ chose not to run a candidate in a Bonaventure riding by-election last December. PQ House Leader Stéphane Bédard also suggested Legault should run in the Argenteuil riding by-election. The seat was vacated December 16, and has returned a Liberal MNA in every election since 1966.
Anglade says Legault had already decided on running in his preferred riding, l’Assomption, when Argenteuil’s seat was vacated.
“It would have been too risky for him to run in Argenteuil, because it is a traditionally Liberal riding,” Dutrisac said.
The CAQ and tuition
According to SSMU VP External Joël Pedneault, the CAQ platform on post-secondary education is alarming. Based on the idea that students who are getting training for high-paying jobs should pay more for their education, the CAQ proposes a modulation of tuition fees according to their program’s profitability. Pedneault thinks this is “even worse than the current tuition increase” imposed by Charest.
“This kind of modulation has already shown to profit only the richer families,” said Pedneault.
Anglade suggested the CAQ will counter the problems of accessibility with a restructuring of the Quebec grants and loans program.
Anglade said she “cannot reveal the details” of the restructuring, since the party is still developing it.

Concerns over smell, increased truck traffic, and harm to reputation 
Saint-Michel residents are opposing the City of Montreal’s plans to construct a new organic matter treatment centre as party of a city initiative to implement citywide composting.
Late last year, the city chose a plot of empty land next to Highway 40 for the treatment centre. City plans for the site have long indicated that it would become a public green space alongside La TOHU, a large circus arts pavilion which doubles as the welcome centre to the Saint-Michel Environmental Complex. The Complex is where Montreal’s recycled waste is processed, and late last year the city announced that it had also been chosen as the location for the organic matter treatment centre.
The city also plans to build treatment centres in three other corners of the city: LaSalle, Montreal East, and Dorval. The park plan for the green space was originally hatched in 1995. Completion is currently projected for 2017.
The plot, which is similar in size to Mount Royal Park, was once a limestone quarry, and was later transformed into the largest urban landfill in North America by the Miron Construction Company, which bought the site in 1947.
“For the past few years, actors have been working to revitalize the neighborhood. This project is not in line with the current effort,” said resident Denis Sirois, of the Community Economic Development Corporation (CEDC) Centre-Nord economic development organization. Sirois is one of several residents who publicly oppose the project, and plan to meet with both the city council and Mayor Gérald Tremblay to explain their concerns.
Sirois argues that Saint-Michel has too long been identified as Montreal’s dump, and worries about the smell, increased truck traffic, and harm to Saint-Michel’s reputation that could occur if the treatment centre is built.
Meanwhile, borough officials in Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension are saying their initial support for the project was based on presentations by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM). According to city councilors, these presentations differed from those provided to residents.
“One of the differences we saw was the smell of the product that they bring to Saint-Michel,” said Frantz Benjamin, Saint-Michel’s city councillor. Benjamin explained that at the presentation given to elected officials, they were given the impression that there would be “zero” odour from the treatment centre, but that the public consultation included discussion of some smell coming from the waste brought into Saint-Michel. Benjamin added that plans for the green space would not be affected by the composting project.
Borough Mayor Anie Samson also noted that there were differences in the presentations, according to an article in the Montreal Gazette.
“I will not give any indication of what we will do until the OCPM publishes its report,” said Benjamin, but welcomed the public’s interest in the project as “a great sign of modernization of citizenship” in Saint-Michel. The OCPM is expected to release its report on March 1.
In an email to The Daily, Philippe Sabourin of Montreal’s Public Affairs Division wrote that the treatment centre’s construction will prevent the presence of “unwanted animals,” that the “solutions adopted…will significantly reduce odors” and that the transport of waste under the city’s composting plan will result in “an average decrease of 113 trucks/day, compared to the current situation.”
