Librarian Creates Classroom Guides
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which officially began in 2008 as a result of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, aimed to document the erased history of the residential school system and in doing so, act as a step towards meaningful, lasting reconciliation.
Before the final TRC report was published, the commission released a document with 94 “calls to action.” Actions 62 through 65 call upon federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as the Council of Ministers of Education, to create a mandatory curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Indigenous peoples in Canadian history for students in K-12.
According to the government of Canada, their response to Action 62 on the TRC Calls to Action is to transform education on reserves, contribute financial resources to the First Nations University of Canada, and allocate $275 million within 2016’s budget for language and culture until 2020.
Aside from the dedication of funding, federal response to Action 62 centers itself upon structuring the education of Indigenous peoples. Indigenous-specific educational institutions are disadvantaged when compared to non-Indigenous educational systems, in terms of funding and follow-through on behalf of policy-makers. The government must take care when intervening in the systems of knowledge they once worked to systematically destroy, especially in the context of the settler-colonial project that continues to erase Indigenous ways of knowing and living.
As for Action 63, the responsibility for responding to this Action falls on the Council of Ministers of Education. In Ontario, Indigenous educators and elders were invited to partake in the curriculum revision project. These curriculum writing sessions, scheduled for July 2018, aimed to infuse Indigenous perspectives into the course content of each subject. The writing sessions were cancelled just three days before they were set to begin. It is unclear who is responsible for the cancellation, though it is likely that the Ministry of Education cancelled the sessions in response to budget cuts by the Doug Ford administration.
Frustrated with this cancellation and the government’s failure to act, citizens are taking matters into their own hands. One endeavor, led by the University of Toronto’s Outreach Librarian Desmond Wong, initially aimed to create a list of free resources in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Comission’s Calls to Action and the Ontario government’s cancellation of the curriculum rewriting sessions.
This list of resources eventually evolved into a research guide, entitled “Infusing Indigenous Perspectives in K-12 Teaching.” The material includes audio and visual material as well as games, lesson plans, Indigenous language materials, and other forms of course support for teachers and educators. The research guide that houses these materials was started in 2013 by current Acting Director of the University of Toronto’s library, Jenaya Webb, and a student, Rebekah Bedard, in collaboration with the Deepening Knowledge Project and Dr. Jean-Paul Restoule. The guide is made available to all online through the University of Toronto’s teaching and education research program.
Though not the first of its kind – the University of Alberta also offers a comprehensive education guide – it is set apart by being a living, breathing entity, inclusive of a wide range of media forms; Wong is continually looking for new resources to improve and add depth to the guide. Most recently, a section on Indigenous-created Virtual and Augmented Reality has just been added. In conversation with the Daily, Wong expressed that he hopes the next step will be to more fully incorporate resources on Indigenous languages, which he says are “essential to Indigenous knowledges and worldviews, into pedagogy and every day interactions in classrooms.”
However, in regards to Quebec’s Ministry of Education and school board system, progress towards fulfilling the TRC Calls to Action is similarly slow-moving. A March 2017 report from the Advisory Board on English Education entitled “Indigenous Education: Walking on Both Sides of the River” includes a section on involvement of [Indigenous] community members in developing the education system. This report uses the rhetoric of “preserving community traditions and heritage […] as elders die” contributing to the image of the disappearing Indigneous population. Much of this report is centered upon improving the education process for Indigenous students, yet fails to commit to concrete changes for the implementation of Indigenous knowledges and historical processes within the education of non-Indigenous students. Section 8 condemns the present instruction of Indigenous content for non-Indigenous students in Quebec; though it mentions the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report, it merely describes what school boards in other provinces have done rather than putting forward any concrete changes to address this gap in curriculums.
As of October 2018, Quebec’s school system further revised its curriculum to include mention of residential schools, though it did so without consulting with Indigenous peoples. Further, the revised curriculum fails to address Indigenous treaties and contributions of Indigenous peoples.
While citizen-led initiatives such as Wong’s guide serve as an excellent resource, he recognizes “this resource is fairly limited compared to the breadth of materials that are available.’’ As he describes, “there is an entire world of fantastic Indigenous resources.”

Indigenous Court Opens in Calgary
The Calgary Indigenous Court (CIC) opened on September 4, operating weekly and overseen by four judges with deep ties to various Indigenous communities. Eighteen months in the making, the court deals mainly with bail and sentencing hearings, setting out to approach crime through peacemaking, as well as cultural and community connections.
Reconciliation in Court
Specifically designed to work towards connecting crimes to their affected communities and cultures, the courtroom is configured around a singular round table, in which all parties sit at the same level, facing each other. This arrangement involves everyone in the courtroom – judges, victims, offenders, and lawyers – as an equal participant in the judicial process.
The Court operates on a model of reconciliation and restorative justice, focusing on harm reduction rather than punishment. At the opening ceremony, Judge Eugene Creighton spoke to the need for a court of this kind, expressing that the “current system of justice and the criminal code itself are not effective in dealing with crime involving Indigenous people and do not honour First Nations’ traditions.”
The Court saw its first case on the day of its opening, involving a young man whose bail, according to the CBC, would not have been granted had it not been for the “supports put in place by agency workers connected to the court.” Agencies such as the Elizabeth Fry and John Howard Societies, Native Counselling Services of Alberta, Aboriginal Friendship Centre, and HomeFront, based in Calgary, play significant roles as stakeholders in each case seen in this courtroom, and together work towards finding how best to support the accused and affected communities.
“The whole objective is to start moving forward with reconciliation […] and being innovative with sentences,” Creighton stated, speaking to the court’s mission. “We’re wanting to throw some responsibility on the accused so they can take responsibility for their actions.” By giving the accused opportunities to make amends and connections with those affected, restorative justice makes it possible for them to take active responsibility in their community, as opposed to facing serious jail time.
It is reported that around 30 per cent of incarcerated adults are Indigenous, and are therefore overrepresented in the correctional system, exposing a serious issue with mass incarceration. Courts such as these aim to combat those numbers and to bring together all levels of the judicial system in a common goal – keeping offenders out of prison. Through implementing recommendations from the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) report, as well as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the Court intends to be a formative step in dismantling colonial violence in the justice system.
Past and Precedent 
Similar courts are already in use elsewhere in the country, notably in British Columbia, Ontario, and in Nova Scotia. Sometimes called “Gladue Courts,” in reference to the R. v. Ipeelee and R. v. Gladue cases, these courts were opened to fulfill recommendations based on restorative justice. Ipeelee and Gladue both set precedents in policy changes, and, when employed in the courtroom, work to inform alternative practices in sentencing.
While the judicial system as a whole has been hesitant to fully employ these changes, the Canadian Supreme Court reaffirmed the two landmark cases in 2000: “courts must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples […] they provide the necessary context for understanding and evaluating the case-specific information presented by counsel.”
Although the recommendations of these decisions were put forward over twenty years ago and their implementation has been slow-moving, courts created with Indigenous-specific contexts in mind are essential to ensuring fair correctional systems. Calgary’s court, along with its predecessors in other provinces, are part of efforts to embody these recommendations and judicial disparities. They focus on restorative justice and healing for the victim, offender, and affected community in every phase of the cases seen.

Government Inaction Five Years After Disaster
Content warning: colonial violence
Continue or go back to the main page
Little has been done to account for the Mount Polley mining disaster, one of the biggest environmental disasters in Canadian history, which began on August 4, 2014. Due to a breach in an Imperial Metals-owned copper and gold mine, approximately 24 billion litres of slurry and toxic waste were spilled into Quesnel Lake, Polley Lake, and surrounding waterways in British Columbia. Local Indigenous communities, including the Lhtako Dené, T’exelcemc, and Xat’sull First Nations, learned of the disaster from friends, and were not notified by Imperial Metals or the provincial government. Five years after the disaster, Imperial Metals has not faced criminal charges.
Quesnel Lake, one of the bodies of water most affected by the spill, is a crucial source of fish and drinking water for the Lillooet Tribal Council, which represents seven First Nations local communities in the Northern St’át’imc Territory. It provides a critical source of protein for members of these First Nations, as salmon is the primary food source in the area, with alternative replacements costing up to $3.8 million for each community.
Though the fish habitat was supposedly protected under the Federal Fisheries Act, Imperial Metals was repeatedly given an Environmental Management Act permit from the BC Ministry of Environment, to release waste directly into Quesnel Lake. Furthermore, several government and independent reports detailed the mine’s substandard construction both before and during its operation and preventable flaws in the dam’s design.
Two years after the breach, Imperial Metals’ Mount Polley mine resumed operating and was granted a permit allowing the dam to continue discharging waste into Quesnel Lake, until 2022, disregarding the Fisheries Act and the demands of Indigenous communities. As for now, the mine has deferred operations since May 31, due to low copper prices.
British Columbia’s Liberal government, headed from 2011 to 2017 by Premier Christy Clark, failed to file charges against the company while receiving millions of dollars in donations from mining giants, including Imperial Metals, which has donated almost $200,000 to the B.C. Liberal party.
Bev Sellars, Chief of Xat’sull First Nation at the time of the incident, attempted to file private charges in 2017, but was rejected by BC Prosecution Services. As of this year Prime Minister Trudeau and Fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson have failed to act on the deadline – August 4, 2019 – to file charges against Imperial Metals, in spite of the disaster being, as The Tyee reports, a “textbook case of corporate negligence.”
Though not often focused on in the media, Canada is a global force in the mining industry, and has a history of irresponsible practices and neglect of environmental devastation. Non-profit organizations, like SumOfUs and Reform BC Mining have petitions addressed to Prime Minister Trudeau, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Jonathan Wilkinson, and Minister of Justice David Lamett, in order to hold Imperial Metals accountable for the Mount Polley mining disaster, to enforce the Federal Fisheries Act, and to reform B.C. mining laws. Further, Amnesty International is pushing for a public inquiry into British Columbia’s mining regulatory regime.

ISA and BSN Talk Solidarity on Campus
Content warning: sexual violence, settler-colonialism, anti-Black racism, anti-Indigenous racism and slurs
Continue or go back to the main page
On September 19, three students from McGill’s Indigenous Student Alliance (ISA) and three students from the Black Student Network (BSN) came together for a public roundtable on the topic of solidarity and allyship – specifically in the colonial context of McGill University.
Among the panelists from ISA were Janelle Bruneau, Noah Favel, and Catie Galbraith. Chloe Kemeni, Kai Trotz, and Ayo Ogunremi were the panelists from BSN, with Ogunremi co-moderating alongside Galbraith.
Ogunremi opened the panel, remarking that it was “a very appropriate day” to be talking about solidarity. This past week, a series of photos and videos of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in brownface and blackface in the 1990s and early 2000s were found and published online.
“It was a very hurtful and astounding image to witness for anyone who has experienced any kind of racial discrimination,” Ogunremi told the audience. This pervasive bigotry and white supremacy, he said, has been institutionalized into our political system.
Kemeni, whose advocacy on campus centres around racial justice and the prevention of sexual violence, brought up the topic of intersectionality. She underscored the fundamental role of violence in allowing McGill students to operate in Tiohtià:ke: what settlers call Montreal. “Rape was used as a tool to take this land that we stand on,” she stated.
The University Experience
At an overwhelmingly white university, finding these safe, shared spaces can be extremely important for Black and Indigenous students.
Favel, who is a member of the Cree Nation, grew up in Calgary, Alberta. “There’s not a lot of appreciation for Indigenous people there,” he explained; “it’s something you try to hide.” Around four years ago, Favel began working as a forklift driver, and at the panel, he recalled his first day at work. “I go into the lunchroom. I walk in, and all these old, white forklift drivers are talking about all these drunk natives in Calgary,” he explained.
“They looked at me and they had a very surprised look on their face and said, ‘Are you Indigenous?’ And I said, ‘no, I’m not.’”
But being a part of ISA and being around Indigenous students, Favel says, has changed that. “That doesn’t even remotely cross my mind now – I’m proud to be Indigenous.”
Bruneau, who is from the Northwest Territories, echoed his statements. “They make navigating a world Indigenous people were never meant to be in a lot easier.”
“Say someone says something really shitty in class,” Bruneau explained; “I can go to my Indigenous friends, and they validate it and make me feel that my feelings are normal.”
It’s about the solidarity of having people around you who share a common history, she said. “You don’t have to explain where you’re coming from […] that labour – you don’t have to do it with Indigenous students on campus.”
Trotz agreed, adding that “coming to McGill and having a community of people who are like-minded and who know those experiences, validates you as a person.”
Kemeni, whose family immigrated to Canada, explained the internalized pressure she felt growing up to “adopt ‘white’ stereotypes and attributes” in order to be successful.
“I came here and realized that I don’t need to be that way – I don’t need to be white,” she explained. “I’m Black and if you have a problem with it, that’s really on you.”
McGill as a Colonial Institution
The moderator posed the question of McGill as an institution, asking if it has decolonial aspects. One topic that was brought up was that of land acknowledgements.
“It’s a contradiction [for McGill] to use land acknowledgements to say ‘we’re anti-colonial,’” Favel explained, because the burden of making those land acknowledgements rests largely on Indigenous students and Indigenous professors.
Regarding the Indigenous Studies program at McGill, Bruneau added that it feels strange to her.
“[The professors] talk about us in a such a way that trivializes our identity and puts us at a static point in history, in a book or a painting, like we are not in this room,” she said. “They operate under the assumption that we are not in higher education.”
Trotz also emphasized the lack of Indigenous and Black professors at the University, as well as the fact that even though Montreal has a large Black population, “you don’t see that on campus.”
Role of Non-Black and Non-Indigenous Allies
For ISA, Bruneau says, allies are critical because they can take on the emotional labour that is too often delegated to Indigenous students. When ISA was tabling and campaigning last year to change the R*dmen name, she told the audience, it was important that non-Indigenous allies took on the burden of talking to aggressive onlookers.
“Often all of their comments were directed at the visibly native person,” Bruneau explained, “so having a settler ally on the table really helped […] take some of the load off of us, so that we don’t have to do it all alone.”
As for Kemeni, she says that one of the most crucial things an ally should do is listen. Trotz echoed this statement, adding that it’s important to know “that your ideas matter and how you feel matters.”
“It’s literally as simple as just giving someone a hug,” Kemeni said, “and saying ‘I see you, you’re doing it, and we’re gonna get through this together.’”
She added, “it’s such high stakes when it has to deal with you.” At the same time, Kemeni explained, it’s important to ask yourself “why am I doing this?” and to understand the intention of why you’re doing something, because too often, there is still an element of white saviourism.
Trotz added to the dialogue regarding the role of non-Black allies in dismantling anti-Black racism. “It’s important to have a space where our bodies our prioritized,” she stated, “in classrooms and on-campus, Black and Brown bodies are not prioritized.”
But too often, Trotz says, people see BSN as “exclusive,” and they received comments saying that Black Frosh was “discriminatory.”
Kemeni stated that in addition to the anti-Black microaggressions from non-Black people regarding the BSN, “folks are scared because they don’t know how to navigate a space.”
“When you come from a racialized background, you’re always aware of your body and the space you’re taking up and how you navigate the world,” Kemeni explained. But for people who don’t have that experience, they have to deal with this new uncomfortability, where spaces aren’t automatically accommodating you.
But in addition to the solidarity between non-Black and/or non-Indigenous allies and these communities, the panellists touched on solidarity between Black and Indigenous peoples.
In the colonial context, Tratz stated, both Black and Indigenous peoples have “two incredibly oppressive histories.”
“There’s so much we can learn from one another.”

Indigenous Advocates Talk Maternal Health



Content warning: colonial violence
Continue or go back to the main page


On September 19, as part of Indigenous Awareness Week, people gathered to hear a panel of experts on Indigenous practices of maternity, pregnancy, and birth. The panel was mediated by Dr. Kent Saylor, a member of the Mohawk Nation, pediatrician in Indigenous communities, and current director of the McGill Indigenous Health Professionals Program. Also present was Dr. Ojistoh Horn, a member of the Bear Clan, the Mohawk Nation, and from the community of Kahnawake. She practices family medicine, long-term geriatric care, prenatal care, and baby care at the Kateri Memorial Hospital Centre in Kahnawake. The other panelist was Stacy Williams, who works as a doula with the Indigenous Birth Keepers Group, which operates in Fraser Region Aboriginal Friendship Centre, located in Surrey, British Columbia.

The panel proceeded from Saylor’s welcome into a chance for Horn and Williams to share their knowledge and experiences. Horn started by contrasting traditional Indigenous approaches to birth with the realities of giving birth today. Historically, she told the audience, birth was a multi-generational community event. Elder generations provided support and experience, and younger women used it as a learning opportunity. In her presentation, Horn questioned the modern “dissociation from this process until we are actually in it.” This “disassociation” makes the birthing process more stressful than necessary, aggravating depression and anxieties. Adding to this, many Indigenous women are forced to travel long distances in order to reach a hospital. And although rural Indigenous communities may have a clinic, they are often deemed insufficient, and pregnant women are strongly encouraged to travel to larger cities. Both Horn and Williams underscored the trauma of having to give birth in a strange hospital, without the comfort of one’s community. In stark contrast to the traditions of familial support, oftentimes, only one relative is able to join the mother – if at all.
What Horn and Williams are both doing, within each of their communities, is a start at providing additional birthing options and support to Indigenous women. In this vein, Horn spoke of creating solidarity amongst the few Indigenous practitioners of medicine. Similarly, Williams’ work within the Indigenous Birth Keepers Group is a way to provide support and reclaim tradition. Through the group, expecting parents can access doulas, who provide emotional and spiritual support, both during and after pregnancy. There are also parenting and childcare programs available, as well as the chance for new parents to connect with elders in the community.
Horn then mentioned some of the alarming statistics regarding birth and pregnancy within Indigenous communities. According to the National Collaborating Center for Aboriginal Health, Indigenous mothers are disproportionately affected by premature and stillborn births. This may be attributed to toxic pollution and insufficient access to proper nutrition – a part of the larger, structural mistreatment of Indigenous communities. The systemic exclusion of Indigenous people in medical studies only worsens the problem. But Horn also reminded the audience that as troubling as these facts are, this negative lens provided by mainstream media is not the only narrative.
On a positive note, the rate of breastfeeding among Indigenous communities is on the rise. Due to the institutional and historic separation of Indigenous women and their children, traditional practices of caring for children after birth have been disrupted. Macleans reports that as part of forced assimilation in the early 1900s, the Canadian government started making Indigenous women travel to federally-operated hospitals, disrupting various birthing traditions such as the inclusion of extended family members. But according to the 2018 Quebec First Nations Regional Health Survey, more than half of First Nations children between ages zero to five are now being breastfed, compared to less than 40 per cent of children in 2008. Breastfeeding has numerous positive benefits for babies, such as the development of motor, intellectual, social, and emotional abilities, per the report.
There have been numerous efforts from Indigenous advocates across the country to provide new mothers with more resources and opportunities to embrace traditions historically denied them by the impositions of the colonial government. At Kateri Memorial Hospital in Kahnawake, Vanessa Rice has been a breastfeeding support worker for the past two decades, starting to work with new mothers in the 24 to 28 hours after birth. In a 2018 article, Rice tells CBC, “Having the support as soon as moms come home with their baby, I think that’s what makes their breastfeeding journey very successful. Peer support is what is in demand and what has been happening in our community.” And in Manitoba, the Manitoba Indigenous Doula Initiative was recently founded, providing women with during and post-birth traditions, such as the placenta ceremony.
Speaking on this, Horn explained to the audience, “there are a lot of those outcomes that we know anecdotally, but we don’t necessarily have the research to back [them] up.”
Williams recounted her experiences as a doula as incredibly varied. She emphasized how every mother is different – a reality that is unfortunately often overlooked. There is a problematic tendency, she says, to generalize within dialogues about Indigenous communities. It’s critical to remember that “Indigenous” is a very broad term, and that each community has different practices and traditions. Within these communities, Williams says, each mother and family will have different outlooks, personal histories, and levels of comfort and desires. Part of her job as a doula is to listen to the mothers and provide them with the best possible experience. This may vary from seeing them through a traditional home-birth with a midwife, to trying to make a birth in a hospital more comfortable. She doesn’t think of this sort of community-oriented approach to birth as work. To her, “it’s out of love, and it’s just from the heart.”
Finally, Horn explained her own personal journey and change in approach to medicine throughout her career. Despite some initial skepticism as a young medical practitioner, she summed up her reconciliation of the importance of tradition: “our stories may not necessarily be rooted in science, but at least they’re giving our women their cultural knowledge.” It is this cultural knowledge that supports and rebuilds communities, while reclaiming the process of life.
