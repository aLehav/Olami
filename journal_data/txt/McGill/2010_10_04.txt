The Daily Talks to Plateau MNA Amir Khadir of Québec Solidaire
Amir Khadir is many things to many people – a Member of the National Assembly for the Mercier riding, which covers a large swath of the Plateau and Mile End; the only MNA and most prominent member of the leftist party Québec Solidaire; a practicing physician who has been to Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Palestinian territories with Médecins du Monde; and a McGill alumnus.
Khadir was born in Iran in 1961, where his parents were active in opposing the Shah’s regime. Moving to Canada when he was ten, Khadir received his Bachelor’s degree from l’Université de Montréal, mastered in physics at McGill, then obtained a medical degree from Laval. He became a well-known activist in Montreal, and still practises medicine once a week since he became a MNA (he specializes in infectious microbiology). He was a candidate for the Bloc Québécois in the 2000 federal election, but ran against the provincial Parti Québécois in Mercier in 2003 for the Union des forces progressistes and in 2007 for Québec Solidaire. He did not win an election until the 2008 upset that took him and his young party to the National Assembly. The Daily spoke by phone in French with Khadir, who was en route to Chicoutimi at the time of the interview.
The McGill Daily: You’re a doctor, and you practice in a country with free health care. Do you think post-secondary education should also be free?
Amir Khadir: Yes, in the sense that it’s a question of priorities. If you consider education a cost instead of an investment, you fall into a cost-benefit analysis. At the moment, priorities being what they are…it’s a system that systematically advantages capital over work or knowledge. [The argument goes] “No, this can’t be free, just like any other consumer product. There has to be a price attached to practicality.” But for us, on our little raft, education is not just spending. It’s an investment, first, and more fundamentally, it’s a right. Québec Solidaire is proposing to massively reinvest in education and make it free.
MD: How will you pay for your reinvestment in education?
AK: We have proposed, since the [Finance Minister Raymond] Bachand budget, legitimate ways for the government to find extra revenue. We’ve talked about imposing taxes on those whose individual incomes surpass $115,000. Abolish the many fiscal exemptions the government accords to the financial sector. Not across all private enterprise…but reintroducing a capital tax on financial companies. We give too much freedom to companies that are still very, very lucrative to Canada. It’s a useless waste of money for the government. We absolutely have to control our natural resources better…over water, over mines, on all of our resources, to increase revenue. So we’ve made calculations based on a series of concrete, immediately applicable measures…that would allow the government of Quebec to collect between $5 billion and $6.5 billion in added revenue every year. In other words, it’s not that we don’t have the means, it’s that we’ve voluntarily deprived ourselves of legitimate revenue.
MD: There are student groups, like FEUQ, that say universities don’t know how to manage their finances. Do you think the government should have a role in managing universities to this effect?
AK: If you begin to question universities’ independence, you run into a lot of problems. I think students need to closely scrutinize the way public money is being spent, and level criticisms. But that does not mean we have to put universities under guardianship or demand that the government intervene in them. The problem is our funding model, first of all, a model that encourages bureaucracy, with…a “bonus” mindset. And all of this has corrupted universities with sometimes opulent spending for the administration, which authorizes all kinds of largesse, while at the same time cutting into student services and increasing tuition fees. Certainly, I understand that student associations would be angry with that. It could be a political or governmental decision to attach certain criteria – like good and transparent management, making sure they’re ethical – to university financing. But I don’t think the government should meddle in university financing.
MD: Education Minister Line Beauchamp promised “action” against McGill for its massive increase in MBA tuition this September, as did former minister Michelle Courchesne. Do you think these threats are sincere?
AK: I don’t know if they are sincere. I have reason to believe Ms. Courchesne was without a doubt sincere about it. I don’t know about Ms. Beauchamp – time will tell. We are still pleased to have two ministers speak out like that, but it’s up to them to prove their sincerity. It’s plain to see that elsewhere in this government – whether it’s with health care, the financing of public institutions – there’s a tendency to privatize and hike fees. So I understand the meaning of your question – it’s a legitimate question to ask.
MD: Would you punish McGill for the tuition increase if you could?
AK: Of course, yes. This accentuates the erosion of the idea of accessibility, of equity, and of free education.
MD: You know Premier Jean Charest’s political thinking well; you’re well-known as a critic of his. Do you think he is ready to deregulate tuition completely after 2012?
AK: [The Liberals] have used a very consistent logic since the beginning of their mandate in 2003, their first mandate. Everything we’ve seen has been privatization, from Mont Orford [a public park slated for condominium development] to the subtle, sneaky privatization in the health care system. Using this same logic…[the Liberals] are absolutely trying to finance education as a pay-as-you-go system. So if they have the political opportunity, I’m convinced that if the government maintains power after 2012 [when the next provincial elections are scheduled] they will use it. It has been exclusively because of society’s resistance that they have not had the political power to [deregulate tuition] yet.
MD: When you were at university, what aspects of the experience most strongly influenced you? How do those experiences affect your thinking on post-secondary education today?
AK: My parents both attended university, but once we were in Canada, our financial means were certainly not very comfortable. So I come from a family who, thanks to public education and the financing of post-secondary education – the support I received throughout my years of studying – I was able to become a doctor, a specialist, with scientific training. It’s an incredible investment and that’s why companies should contribute directly to the task of financing universities – because they’re the first ones to profit from it.
MD: Won’t private sector financing of universities lead post-secondary education in the direction businesses want?
AK: They are already doing that, directly, through foundations with financing attached. We are against that. They have to contribute to the financing of education in the form of a tax. A dedicated tax…a fee for knowledge. They’re extractingthe  knowledge of our people, which is our most important natural resource. They exploit it, so they should pay a fee on it. When you exploit a resource that belongs to the public you have to be responsible; you have to pay something for it.
Whether it’s mines, or shale gas, or water. And now, we’re seeing [that logic] extended to knowledge – they’re exploiting all the natural resources that we produce in public, without paying any fees, without assuming part of the costs.

Council passes a motion after hair’s breadth vote
SSMU has joined AUS and Midnight Kitchen in officially endorsing a boycott of McGill Food and Dining Service (MFDS), in the latest development in the ongoing dispute over who serves food at McGill. The boycott comes in response to the administration’s closure of the student-run Architecture Café.
Boycott of McGill Food and Dining Services
The motion, presented at last Thursday’s Legislative Council, passed with just over 50 per cent of council members in favor. The motion calls for an official boycott of all MFDS establishments on campus until the administration begins consultation with students on the matter of the Architecture Café’s closure, and financial transparency with regards to the Café’s books becomes publicly available to students.
The resolution also mandates SSMU to make clear which dining establishments are and are not associated with MFDS, which operates the Redpath Oasis, the Subway in the Arts building and Sinfully Asian, among others. The resolution does not pertain to those students – mostly first-years – who have already purchased and rely on meal plans. Councillor Kallee Lins and Arts Senator Tyler Lawson, co-authors of the resolution, presented it to council.
Erin Hale, a U3 student and former Daily editor, spoke before the motion was presented, as a guest speaker from Mobilization McGill, a group facilitated by Midnight Kitchen that was instrumental in organizing the September 22 rally to save the café.
Hale described to council what she hoped the boycott will achieve: “I am fairly confident that the boycott could cause some financial loss,” she said.
“It might not mean much to McGill, since they have outsourced food services to a multi-million dollar corporation,” she continued, referring to Aramark, a U.S.-based company that runs most of MFDS’s outlets. “At the very least, though, it would be great if this embarrassed [McGill].”
While no SSMU council members openly opposed the sentiment behind the motion, there was a substantial amount of debate about the efficacy of an official boycott in re-opening the Architecture Café, and on whether or not the gesture would actually impact the McGill administration.
Councillor Lauren Hudak said that despite supporting the Café’s reopening, she did not support the motion to boycott. “The resolution directly links the events surrounding the Architecture Café to McGill Food and Dining Services. Is that ultimately who students are fighting against?” She went on to state that a general boycott had the potential to detract attention from the Architecture Café itself.
“The target of student frustrations has been and should continue to be on certain departments of the McGill administration for a complete lack of transparency surrounding the financial stability of the Arch Café and for a complete lack of student consultation, especially with the senior managers of the Arch Café,” Hudak continued. “By supporting this boycott, this diverts the attention from the above problems and places it on another group, which is not necessarily the source of the problem for the Arch Café’s closure.”
Kirk Emery, the Law Faculty Student Representative, emphasized that the gesture’s symbolic importance would be reason enough to pass the motion solidifying the boycott. He argued that the financial impact the boycott would have on the administration does not need to be quantifiable, and that a statement clarifying the students’ general dissatisfaction with the administration would provide a clear message to the University. He went on to stress that the motion would take a stance on a larger issue: the administration’s continuing disregard for students’ desires and the lack of student consultation in the administration.
“The administration just gave you [the undergraduate student body] a big ‘F you’ by completely ignoring what you want,” Emery said. “Don’t cooperate with them. They’re motivated by purely financial reasons. It’s important to make a statement back to them.”
Lawson emphasized the motion’s origins as a grassroots movement with palpable student support.
“This is an act of solidarity with sentiments on campus, and can further the agenda of student centrality,” he told council. “It pertains to a much larger issue with the administration, so it’s really important that we follow through with the boycott.”
 Lins said the passage of the motion was a victory for students. “I’m really happy the motion passed, because it shows our commitment to showing solidarity with students on campus who have already taken up this issue,” she said after council. “The debate tonight really focused on linking the Architecture Café to the larger issue of students’ ability to run student-run food services on campus, so I think we did a really good job of amending the motion to reflect that.”
Exec Reports
In his executive report, SSMU VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki referred to the last Senate meeting, in which SSMU President Zach Newburgh attempted to present a motion for reconsideration of the Architecture Café’s closing. “The Principal considered the motion out of order, which really was out of order because the motion was in order,” Abaki told Council. The motion is scheduled to appear before the Steering Committee of Senate, which will decide whether it can be presented at the next Senate meeting.
In the wake of issues surrounding SSMU councillors involved in the QPIRG Opt-Out Campaign, VP Clubs & Services Anushay Khan explained that she is looking to clarify the role of councillors. “If they are considered administrators [of SSMU], then they are bound legally [to disclose student group affiliation]. In the case that they are not considered administrators, then they are not bound because they are considered representatives. It is a grey area right now, but definitely something that I’m looking into.”
Spencer Burger, an Arts representative and member of the Opt-Out campaign, lost an election for the External Affairs committee, and dropped out of the running for the Funding committee, anouncing that he nevertheless thought he would have done a good job.
Maggie Knight and Max Zidel were elected to the Funding committee, while Lawson, Amara Possian and Zach Margolis won the  External committee election. Zidel, Knight and Katie Larson will sit on the Interest Groups committee.

Taxes and rent expected to follow suit
Montreal’s 2011 property evaluations are in, and the results are likely to leave a lump in the throat of some students. For residents of the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough, the average property value predictions tabled by the City of Montreal’s Assessment Office increased by 34.7 per cent. This is the highest increase among Montreal’s 19 boroughs.
Patricia Lowe, a representative for the  Assessment Office, explained that the evaluations are based on a number of factors. Assessors examine deeds of sale and track renovation permits and major development projects in order to determine the market value of the properties. In all 23,778 commercial, residential, institutional properties were considered in the Plateau-Mont-Royal, adding up to a total value of $13.2 billion. The new assessment roll is based on 2009 tallies.
Montreal’s property value increases should not come as a surprise, according to Lowe. The city’s last assessment roll, which was released in 2007, “went up much more for residential properties compared to the 2004 roll.”
“The reason for that was because Montreal property values had fallen behind those in other cities. The prosperity started to come back to Montreal [and] the property value started to rise,” she added.
Lowe says even if tax hikes don’t accompany the leap in property values, Plateau residents and landlords will be paying more in the near future.
“The budget determines the tax rate,” Lowe said, “and the budget won’t be presented until the end of November.” But she specified that “if the value of your property goes up, then even if the tax rate stays exactly the same you will have some increase to absorb.”
Based on the property value increase, and taking into account normal inflation, residents of the Plateau will most likely witness an increase in rent and property taxes. In the residential sectors of the Plateau, values are up by 35.6 per cent compared with a 32.3 per cent increase in non-residential markets.
The spike does not put Montreal on par with other big Canadian cities just yet though, Lowe emphasized. “Property values are still lower in comparison than Toronto, Vancouver, other large metropolitan centers,” she said.
Ali Farasat owns and operates a number of residential properties in the Plateau-Mont-Royal and his principal tenants are students.
“Taxes are going to go higher so owners are going to share part of the cost,” Farasat explained. The remaining share of the burden will of course fall on the tenants of the properties.
“I don’t expect the rent to go up by exorbitant amounts,” said Farasat, “but I do expect the rent to maybe go up more than previous years. If [property tax] increases by anything more than 10-15 per cent then definitely you’re going to see an impact on the tenants and on the landlords.”
When asked whether City Hall had any concerns over forcing low-income families and students from the neighbourhood, Lowe responded, “The city worries about that yes, and that’s why they try to be as fair as they can with taxes and with programs to help people buy affordable housing and to stay in the city.”
Farasat doesn’t find the efforts by the city to be self-evident. When asked if he felt a tax increase would be justified, he replied, “I don’t think so, especially looking at the Plateau over the past three years. You see that [on] St. Laurent there is a lot less business, the streets are less clean. The Plateau is still happening, it’s probably one of the best neighbourhoods of Montreal, but you just don’t see where all this money goes.”
 Farasat said students and other residents are more likely to bear the burden of rent and tax increases than abandon the neighbourhood.
“I don’t know, because it’s so close to McGill,” said Farasat. “I don’t think you find this type of atmosphere in any other area. I feel like the city knows that and they’re using it to their advantage. The city needs to do their part – if they’re going to increase taxes there has to be some benefit for the residents.”
“There’s no parks being built, there’s no [additional] parking,” he continued. “I don’t see any improvements in the Plateau.”
Lily Hassall, a U1 McGill student who lives on DuBullion near Duluth, said she would move out of the Plateau if rent went up significantly. “I love living in the Plateau,” she said. “It’s a great neighbourhood. But part of its charm is that it’s affordable.”

International student tuition set to jump 50 per cent
Concordia’s Board of Governors (BoG) has voted to sustain a tuition increase for international students and to keep a new billing structure for graduate students which student groups have said amounts to a fee increase in and of itself.
Of the BoG’s 40 members, an unknown number attended the meeting on September 30. Of those, only 12 voted on the motions to repeal the increases, with nine supporting a repeal and three opposing. Due to an unknown number of abstentions, however, the motion did not achieve the required two-thirds majority.
Adnan Abueid, President of Concordia’s Graduate Student Association (GSA), submitted the two motions to the University’s highest governing body. The first motion called for the immediate recall of the tuition increases, and to “respect the demands” of a petition to the same effect, which organizers said gathered over 2,500 signatures.
Tuition for international students at Concordia has increased by 50 per cent for business graduate students, and 28 per cent for business undergraduates.
Students have decried the suddenness of the increases. Erik Chevier, of the not-for-profit Free Education Montreal, pointed out that, “Concordia has a very rigorous project to recruit international students,” adding that “if they do recruit them under [certain] conditions, they shouldn’t change those conditions at the last minute.”
According to Chevrier, the fee increases only represent a 1.5 per cent increase in revenue for Concordia’s operating budget. “For one student to get a 50 per cent increase obviously has a negative effect on their economic well being, while a 1.5 per cent increase really isn’t doing that much for the University,” he said.
A response to the motion issued by the administration argued that the tuition increases are permitted by the provincial government’s defreeze of Quebec’s international tuitions. The official response, inserted in the meeting’s official agenda, also emphasized that the University only retains 24 per cent of undergraduate international tuition and 35 per cent of graduate international tuition. The rest goes to the province and back to students in the form of financial aid, the response contested.
According to Chevrier, these figures neglect to incorporate rebates Concordia gets from the province after the initial forfaitaire, or fee.
Concordia has pledged to contribute 25 per cent of the increases to student bursaries and other aid, something both Abueid and Chevrier would like to see transparently documented. “We need some kind of report about where this money is going to go. How is this going back to the students?” Abueid asked.
Abueid is planning to bring forward a motion to reconsider the BoG’s decision, based on the fact that, of those who did vote, more board members approved than disapproved of the motion.
Concordia’s new graduate billing structure has also come under fire from the GSA. The new system compresses six tuition installments into four larger ones for master’s students, and from 12 to eight for PhDs. The University’s response says that the new structure brings Concordia in line with other Quebec universities and helps to close a $600,000 annual loss.
The new billing structure also requires that full-time students complete their Master’s degrees in four terms, and PhDs in eight terms, lest they receive a “continuation fee” of $400 per student per extra term.
Concordia’s administration response stated that “there was continuous inter-action [sic] with the Graduate Students’ Association and with all graduate students directly on this matter. The University has no intention of agreeing to the demands of some students that the fee billing structure be rescinded.”

Laws violated “security of the person,“ Conservative government plans to appeal
On Tuesday, September 28, an Ontario Superior Justice struck down three federal laws which it ruled placed sex workers at risk. The laws, which restricted communicating to solicit sex, running a bawdy house, and living off an income procured by sex work, were successfully challenged by Terri-Jean Bedford, a dominatrix, and Valerie Scott and Amy Lebovitch, both former sex workers. Justice Susan Himel ruled that these laws violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Conservative government has announced they will appeal the Ontario Superior Court’s decision, which would otherwise take effect in 30 days. The ruling only applies in Ontario, but if the ruling survives appeal, the government will almost certainly take the case to the Supreme Court. If Himel’s decision is upheld at the national level, the criminal prohibitions restricting sex work will be abolished across the country.
Hedy Fry, Liberal Vancouver-Centre MP and Chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, applauded the landmark ruling. “This is an important step in recognizing the constitutional rights of adult sex-trade workers to security of the person and acknowledges the difference between the rights of consenting adults and the exploitation of vulnerable persons,” she said.  
“[The ruling] means that the safety of sex workers is a new criteria to analyze prostitution. … Now, saving the lives of sex workers will be taken into account,” explained Pascale Robitaille, Outreach Team Coordinator for Stella, a Montreal community group run by and for sex workers. Stella is applying for intervener status in the appeal case. 
Fry explained why transparency means increased safety. “There are sex trade workers, especially street workers, who face greater risks daily, because they cannot call the police for protection or report a ‘bad trick,’” she said. 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General Rob Nicholson provided no explanation when he announced the Conservatives’ decision to appeal.
Fry suggested that disapproval can tacitly condone violence against sex workers. “There are still those who say that street sex workers are ‘not respectable’ and the work they do is ‘shameful and indecent’; ergo these are throw-away humans who ‘deserve what they get,’” she said.
“The state above all cannot be devoid of compassion and care for all of its citizens. The responsibility to do so is not limited to the ‘decent’ nor can it subjectively and ideologically measure that ‘virtue.’”
Robitaille and Susan Davis, a Vancouver sex worker and coordinator of the BC Coalition of Experimental Communities (BCCEC) both say they are unsurprised by the government’s decision to appeal. Davis’s testimony was used in the trial, along with research submitted by the BCCEC.
“The plan all along was to win this one and then win at Supreme Court level,” explained Robitaille.
“It’s good for [the case] to go through to the highest court of the land. … We just want to see [these laws] come down all over the country,” said Davis.
Davis is optimistic that the ruling will be upheld.
The laws struck down by Himel’s ruling were adopted in 1985 in response to complaints of sex work being a nuisance and an eyesore.
A 2006 report the Standing Committee on the Status of Women urged the decriminalization of sex work in combination with strategies to deal with intersecting social problems. Fry explained that these included “dealing with issues of poverty, addiction, the plight of urban aboriginals, prevention, education and helping women in the sex-trade with exit strategies when they wish to do so.”
