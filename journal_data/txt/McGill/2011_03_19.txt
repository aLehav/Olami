“There’s a lot of pessimism” in Fort Chipewyan, says George Poitras
George Poitras, indigenous rights activist and former chief of the Mikisew Cree First Nation in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, spoke at the event “Tar Sands: Life and Death Downstream,” organized by Climate Justice Montreal, QPIRG McGill, and the McGill First Peoples’ House. Poitras sat down with The Daily after the event.
 
The McGill Daily: What impact has the tar sands had on your community and on your life?
George Poitras: Since about four years ago when the Tar Sands first began to operate in the region where we live, which we call our traditional homeland, our people our hunters our trappers – anyone who uses the land have observed a number of different impacts on our water…water quality, water quantity, impacts to the fish, impacts to the animals – we’ve observed all of those, but much more so in the past 15 years or so.
Our doctor has been concerned about many of the cancers he was observing in our community, cancers which are considered very rare and aggressive, and statistically have been linked to petroleum products. These kinds of cancers, called cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancers or soft-tissue cancers…recently its been proven by the Alberta Cancer board – who we forced to do a cancer study – there are at least 30 per cent elevated levels of these cancers in our community.
MD: How has the Alberta government responded to the Tar Sands, and how has that response changed over the last five years as awareness about the Tar Sands grows?
GP: The Alberta government is slowly being forced to be more accountable in the way they manage the Tar Sands. It’s not because they’re being…it’s not because of their free will, it’s not because of that. It’s because a lot of pressure has been applied upon the Alberta government because they’re doing such a bad job at managing the Tar Sands, and have been for forty years. More recently they’ve been made more accountable to establish a more responsible more comprehensive monitoring system, and its because of work by…environmental organizations that are telling the truth about [the Tar Sands] bad impacts on the environment, on the water and so on. But also because of some efforts from my community – fishermen who are exposing, showcasing to the world some of the problem fish.
MD: How would you compare the response of Alberta’s provincial government with that of the federal government?
GP: Up until just a couple months ago they were one and the same in terms of relinquishing their responsibility in managing and regulating the industry. Alberta has a very high senior representative in Washington, D.C. who many people would consider like an ambassador from Alberta. Their sole responsibility there is to promote investment in the tar sands, to lobby all the congressional members,  senators, anybody who’s influential in making the tar sands a possibility for the Americans. The Alberta government does the same thing. I’ve met with the Canadian ambassador in D.C. twice now, and I know with certainty that their role is to promote investment in the Tar Sands. And they do it with other bodies as well, like the U.N. Climate Talks. We know in Copenhagen that both Canada and Alberta were very instrumental in encouraging other countries not to adopt anything that might potentially impact the ability of Tar Sands mined in Alberta to be exported anywhere, and so they’re for thwarting any possibility of any adequate climate agreement.
MD: Looking at your community, are people optimistic, or are people feeling the heaviness of the fight against the tar sands?
GP: People do feel a sense of pessimism, they do feel let down, especially when our doctor did make the claim of unusual cancers in their community and neither [provincial nor federal] government came to our assistance. Many people were feeling very let down, but I think…we’re seeing that we can, as a community contribute to a larger campaign, so I think people are feeling a little bit better, so while there’s a lot of pessimism there is some hope in terms of this industry being better managed  and hopefully managed in a sustainable way, in the long term.
MD: What are the main, practical things that you’re calling for, in the short-term and long-term?
GP: Our community has been calling for a moratorium on any further approvals on any new applications or approvals of expansions of any existing projects until its known what the environmental situation is like. … I mean there are so many issues as far as Tar Sands are concerned and a lot of science has been left behind by the fast pace of development. I think its very logical and rational that until we understand with certainty what the status of the environment and people’s health is that it makes absolute sense to put a moratorium. But at the same time, Alberta and Canada – who are responsible in regulating this industry – should strengthen the regulations, the  legislation around management of the Tar Sands, because it’s very weak, when you compare it to other countries.

New coalition forms to defend decriminalization after September decision
In September 2010, Ontario Superior Justice Susan Himel struck down three provisions of the Criminal Code that placed sex workers at risk in the now historic case Bedford v. Canada. Both the Ontario and the federal government will be jointly appealing that decision.
In an email to The Daily, Kristen Rose, senior coordinator of Media Relations for the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, wrote that, despite being stricken, laws prohibiting sex work “continue to be in effect and the status quo remains.”
The three provisions – communicating to solicit sex, running or working in a brothel, and living off income procured by sex work – were ruled to be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms when they were challenged in court by Terri Jean Bedford, a dominatrix, and two former sex workers.
The Ontario Court of Appeal stayed the decision of the Superior Court of Justice until April 29, 2011, or until the hearing of the appeal. The appeal is scheduled to be heard over four days by a five-judge panel and will start on June 13.
If Bedford v. Canada stands, the sex trade will be legalized in Ontario, setting a precedent for other jurisdictions in Canada.
Maria Nengeh Mensah, a professor of Social Work at UQAM, spoke to The Daily about the controversial provisions before moderating a panel discussion at the official launch of the Feminist Alliance in Solidarity for Sex Worker’s Rights (FAS) at the Théâtre Ste. Catherine. FAS is a newly formed Quebec coalition of over 200 “individuals and feminist groups working together to support and defend the rights of people working in all sectors of the sex industry.”
Mensah explained that the laws are often applied in a way that creates unsafe working conditions for sex workers.
“They are a cause for repression on the street and indoors – negotiations cannot happen in the best way. And this is the main reason why we want to decriminalize [sex work]. These laws are under the guise of ‘protecting,’ but, in reality, they limit options for police. For instance, it’s hard for sex workers to report theft when explaining the circumstances would criminalize the worker,” she said.
“The laws take aim at the most vulnerable sex workers, those who work off of a street base,” Mensah added.
Rose refrained from providing opinion as to why the Ontario government was appealing the decision, as the matter remains before court.
“We can say, however, that Ontario’s position at the Superior Court was that these provisions of the Criminal Code are designed to prevent individuals, particularly young people, from being drawn into prostitution, to protect our communities from the negative impacts of street prostitution and to ensure that those who control, coerce or abuse prostitutes are held accountable for their actions,” she said. “Thus, in our view, they are consistent with the core Charter values of human dignity and equality.”
According to Mensah, the current laws target and criminalize sex workers, not sex work abusers.
“Criminalization of some things is redundant, particularly when used to intervene when there is assault, gangsterism, exploitation, or the violation or exploitation of children, since laws prohibiting these already exist,” she said.
Mensah also disagreed with the government’s stance on youth.
“Behind the idea of ‘preventing youth’ is the moral idea that sex work is bad, but the law is not meant to reflect particular morals – to paraphrase Pierre Trudeau – the law has no business in the bedroom,” she said.
Seven civil and social groups have intervener status in the upcoming appeal case, including the Canadian HIV/AIDS Network and the Canadian Liberties Association.
Maggie’s, a Toronto-based government-funded sex workers’ agency, also applied for intervener status in order to argue that the legislation further discriminates against women on the basis of gender and occupation.
The Montreal Gazette reported that Ontario Justice Dennis O’Connor denied their application Wednesday as it was too late to address this “significant new ground on which to challenge the legislation.”
Mensah added that in Montreal there are municipal bylaws in place that are meant to remove marginalized workers – especially street-based ones or youth – from the streets.
“For example, it is illegal to communicate with a moving vehicle or throw a cigarette on the ground. More and more the criminal code is being used to target these workers. But with the municipal bylaws, if you don’t pay your fine, it begins a cycle of being judicialized,” she said.
“The bottom line is that sex work involves feminist issues of gender and sex, so we ask for close solidarity, not to impose a particular view or meaning onto the work, but to support each other in their rights.”

Former Journal de Montréal workers optimistic about keeping weekly afloat
Canada’s longest running media labour dispute may have officially ended late last month, when the Syndicat des travailleurs de l’information du Journal de Montréal (STIJM) accepted Quebecor Media Inc.’s offer, but much of the union’s back to work protocol has yet to be finalized.
Of the 253 employees initially locked out from their jobs at the Journal de Montréal, 62 will be allowed back to work, 42 of whom will be in the newsroom. Rue Frontenac, the online and recently weekly print newspaper started by the locked out journalists as a pressure tactic against their employer, will be allowed to continue publishing.
Earlier offers from Quebecor – such as the one the STIJM rejected by a resounding 89 per cent of the vote last October – included a non-concurrence clause, which would have shut down the Frontenac brand.
The offer that the STIJM finally accepted initially included stipulations about Frontenac’s fate, which the STIJM refused to agree to during negotiations. Quebecor offered to tie the paper to its media empire by offering the paper, among other things, a $4,000 rebate on publishing and distribution.
However, the proposed financial aid came with conditions which felt “very restrictive” to Frontenac’s growth, according to STIJM secretary general Pascal Filotto. The paper would have had to adopt a worker’s co-op business model without the option of taking on new business partners and investors. As well, it would not have been allowed to publish a daily print edition for five years.
After two years on the street, the animosity between Quebecor and its former employees has left Filotto doubtful that an alliance between the two groups will emerge. He said that, although 42 people will ultimately be allowed back to the newsroom at the Journal, “as it stands, they don’t even have 42 people willing to go back.”
Most will likely take a severance package instead.
The fact that Frontenac is looking increasingly viable as an independent publication will likely further hamper the possibility for a merger between Quebecor and Frontenac. According to Filotto, advertisers have been pouring in since the end of the lockout.
“Advertising with us was somewhat of a political statement – you were taking sides. I can see why advertisers were scared of that,” said Filotto. “Now, we’re seen more as a legitimate business, less as a pressure tactic.”
Frontenac has been able to cover its costs of operation with the money brought in from advertisements and donations, but the STIJM has been paying for the staff’s salary. Once the deal between Quebecor and the STIJM is hammered out, Frontenac will become independent of the union and will lose that funding.
“We’re really optimistic, we think the community wants us to survive,” said Filotto. “But we’ll see what happens when we’re off the union respirator. We’ll see how the patient reacts.”

McGill Anatomy students using cadavers as educational tools
More Quebeckers than ever are dying with no one to claim their bodies. With the elderly the most common among them, many of the deceased eventually find their way to educational institutions such as McGill, where they are appreciated in a different sense: for their help as educational tools.
In 2010, 424 bodies – approximately 0.74 per cent of total deaths – were left in the custody of the Quebec government. This is an increase of 124 bodies – approximately 0.56 per cent of total deaths – from 2000.
Genevieve Guilbault, spokesperson for the Quebec Coroner’s Office, said “we think the reason why we have more unclaimed bodies than before is most of all because more and more people grow old and die alone without anybody that takes care of them.”
This is in keeping with what Sandra Miller, a professor in McGill’s Anatomy and Cell Biology Department, told Le Délit in November 2009.
“Usually the deceased persons are elderly, Francophone, Catholic, and come from the middle class,” said Miller.
Guilbault also said that “immigrants, people that come from other countries, sometimes come alone and it becomes more difficult for us to find family.”
There are also cases in which those close to the deceased are aware of their death, but do not wish to take responsibility for them. Guilbault cited funeral costs as a factor. Those outside of the close family must assume all responsibility for these costs – which commonly start at $1,500 – if they wish to claim a body.
Of the 424 bodies unclaimed in 2010, 58 were taken to the Quebec Coroner’s office due to the violent or accidental nature of their death, while the remainder, when authorized by a physician, were made available to educational institutions like McGill. The institutions are then, by law, financially responsible for the transportation of the cadavers to their facilities.
Subsequently, the bodies must undergo a preservation process involving the injection of chemicals. After this, Miller explained to Le Délit,  “the students find themselves face to face with real human beings having all kinds of abnormalities, and this in 3-D.”
As stipulated in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, Chapter L-0.2, “An Act respecting medical laboratories, organ, tissue, gamete and embryo conservation, and the disposal of human bodies,” educational institutions are required to send a report on each body to the physician in charge of that region, including not only information about the deceased but also the name of each educational institution to which the body was offered or transported. This way, the fate of the deceased may be made known to any family in the future.
As for the bodies not suitable for scientific purposes, Guilbault explains that they must be kept by law for a minimum of thirty days after their discovery while the police search for next of kin. If, after this period, no claim has been made to the body, it is buried in a precisely marked graves so that it is easily identifiable for anyone who comes looking.

Owner resists “revitalization” of the Quartier des Spectacles
The owner of the popular St. Laurent bar and strip club Café Cleopatra, Johnny Zoumboulakis, will not be selling his bar to the Société de développement Angus (SDA), an urban planning group. The SDA’s request to relocate Café Cleopatra is part of their large-scale plan to refurbish and revitalize the Quartier des Spectacles.
Zoumboulakis described the SDA’s plans as a proposal presented to the city “to take or expropriate the whole lower Main and turn it into some kind of office tower.”
“The Main was never known as an office space. It is a historic place, and it’s been the center of entertainment since Montreal was founded,” he said when asked to explain why he refused to sell. Café Cleopatra has been a part of the neighbourhood for 34 years.
“I want to see the continuation of the idea of a Quartier des Spectacles, and not turn it into a Quartier des Office Tower,” he added.
A representative for the SDA, Geneviève Marsan, described the goals of the SDA’s project.
“The idea isn’t just to make office buildings, it’s to revitalize the area; to make it more lively, more attractive for tourists and for Montrealers,” she said in French.
“Have you been there recently? We want to revitalize the Quartier. We don’t want strip clubs. They don’t fit in with [SDA’s] values. We certainly want to integrate commerce, but not exploitative commerce,” she added.
According to Marsan, the revitalization would take place in two phases – beginning in 2013 – and would include opening office buildings and residential spaces. She emphasized that the SDA has no intention of corporatizing the historic area, but instead wants to render it more accessible to the greater Montreal community.
Zoumboulakis insisted that the area remains popular for locals and tourists alike, attracting a diverse and reputable clientele.
“[Our clientele] are very nice, very reputable people. Federal government employees come here…they are mainstream people that work from all surrounding areas, from all walks of life, and I have clientele from all nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. Francophones, Anglophones and Allophones – all get along very nicely in here, and they appreciate the existence of Cleopatra,” he said.
Zoumboulakis also denied the claim that Café Cleopatra functioned only as a strip club, pointing out that the bar also serves as a venue for many events and festivals.
Though Zoumboulakis’s refusal to sell has not deterred the SDA from their plans to proceed with the revitalization of the neighbourhood, it has caused frustration for some of the project’s coordinators.
“We’re disappointed. We would have preferred to make one cohesive, integrated, and complete project,” Marsan said. “We’ll construct all around [Café Cleopatra] and we’ll do our project anyway.”

Excess embryos in Canadian clinics create ethical dilemmas
Debate has been sparked on ethical ways to deal with the thousands of embryos across the country that lie in a state of suspended animation, frozen in reproductive clinics.
Existing in a state of limbo – not quite alive but certainly with the potential to become so – these embryos have the capacity to survive for decades in cold storage. Currently, Canada’s surplus of embryos exists without any national regulation controlling or keeping track of their proliferation.
No one knows the exact number of frozen embryos in cold storage in Canada. Many of these embryos are “orphans,” and no longer have any connection to their genetic parents. Best estimates on the number of embryos in existence come from speaking to individual clinics.
As Simon Phillips, lab director at the Ovo Fertility Clinic in Montreal told The Daily, their clinic alone keeps over 2,500 embryos in their freezers. Genetic parents have three options regarding their extra embryo: disposing of them, donating them to research, or giving them up for adoption.
Ovo Clinic began offering the adoption of embryos with the genetic parents’ consent over two years ago. Most parents choose to donate their unwanted embryos to research or have them destroyed rather than give them up for adoption.
“Many people hesitate to choose the adoption option because, on some level, they still feel that these are their children,” said Phillips.
There is, however, a growing problem in addressing to whom the orphan embryos belong and who has the right to decide their fate.
The decision to offer anonymous adoptions of unused embryos has come with a slew of ethical criticisms. Most criticism is centered around whether embryos have rights and whether these rights are violated when they are given to parents with whom they share no genetic ties. Concerns over whether these children should be allowed to find out the identity of their genetic parents have also been voiced.
Clinics across Canada have begun to address this problem by turning to embryo adoption programs. This type of third party procreation entails parents unable to have a child of their own adopting an abandoned embryo to which they have no genetic ties.
Toronto hospital Mount Sinai is one of the first to offer a carefully monitored anonymous embryo donation program through its Centre for Fertility and Reproductive Health.
“Everyone who partakes in the program is made fully aware of the social and ethical issues surrounding their decision. Psychological and legal counselling is necessary when dealing with donor eggs or a gestational carrier, and both partners are screened first for infectious diseases,” said an administrative assistant at the Toronto centre who wished to remain anonymous.
Other centres have followed suit, including Vancouver’s Genesis Fertility Centre and Calgary’s Regional Fertility Program, where 75 to 100 children have already been born through adopted embryos.

Last Thursday SSMU Academic Research Commissioner Devon Willis hosted McGill’s first ever “Forum on Undergraduate Education” in the Shatner ballroom.
Willis organized the forum in collaboration with Engineering senator Andrew Doyle and SSMU VP University Affairs Joshua Abaki. Concerned about the current dynamic between students, administration, and staff – and having briefly discussed something similar in Senate caucus – Willis decided that a more comprehensive discussion would be “a really positive way to connect.”
“I wanted to create an environment where students, faculty, staff, and administration could come and be together and have a discussion about something that they all could participate in,” Willis said.
The forum’s main purpose was to discuss the role of a research institution in undergraduate education. Willis explained that she chose this particular topic because it was “open,” and could be a starting point for a more expansive dialogue between different groups within the University.
Paul Axelrod, a professor in York University’s Faculty of Education, directly addressed the topic of research-intensive universities in his keynote lecture. He focused on teaching strategies, and stressed the importance of undergraduate education in all institutions claiming to promote “higher learning.”
A short presentation by Cynthia Weston, director of Teaching and Learning Services at McGill, led to a discussion about teaching outcomes, and allowed students to express their concerns about the development of their own learning. While the majority of students felt satisfied with their breadth of knowledge, many felt that they lacked professional capacity and autonomy.
“Weston brought up those two categories, the first one being knowledge-based and the second one being citizen-based,” said SSMU Clubs and Services representative Max Zidel. “Knowledge is important to my degree but I don’t see how those two things are separate. I want them to be combined.”
Zidel also questioned the large disconnect, for Arts students in particular, in terms of their education and the University’s research.
During the lunch break and roundtable discussions held at the end of the forum, students were given the opportunity to speak informally with some of McGill’s faculty and administrators, including the Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi and Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson.
Mendelson, who also took part in a panel discussion, spoke about the role of students and administrators in the active learning process. While he recognized that the University has a responsibility to provide opportunities for students, he told The Daily that “students [need] to become engaged in their own education” both inside and outside the classroom.
Mendelson also noted McGill’s low levels of student-faculty interaction. He referred to the launch of the student-staff mentoring program, which “was done very specifically for trying to increase…interaction.”
In his closing remarks, Abaki said he hoped the forum would be the “beginning of a cooperation between students and staff.”
In terms of future forums, Willis hopes to make the event less formal.
“Next year I’d like to have more roundtable discussions about different issues,” said Willis. “I was happy that we managed to make this event that was really useful, but also really fun and comfortable.”
