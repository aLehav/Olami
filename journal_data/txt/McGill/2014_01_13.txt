The Nest opens after three years of lobbying
Correction appended January 15, 2014
Last Monday, after three years of lobbying from student groups, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) opened up a new student-run cafe (SRC) called The Nest. Tucked into the second floor cafeteria in the Shatner building, replacing the vacated Lola Rosa Xpress.
The new café, which features gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan menu choices, is student-run, with former SSMU President Josh Redel at the helm as manager.
In an interview with The Daily, Kathleen Bradley, head chef, noted that, “The general reaction to the café this first week has been overwhelmingly positive. [Students] love the prices, the size has been good, it’s a great bang for their buck, and [the menu] rotates daily but there’s something you can come to expect everyday like the burritos.”
Despite the successful first impressions, there have been hurdles with implementing the new SRC. According to Redel, the biggest challenge has been trying to “piece all the vendors together, get them talking, get stuff ordered, get the right prices and [… find] the right suppliers who can deliver on time.”
Redel added that he expected “getting the recipes down pat, and [hiring and training] the staff” to be the biggest challenge but that it was not.
“The initiative is a learning experience for all of us. I want to know where people think we can improve and do better since part of our mandate is a comprehensive customer feedback mechanism,” Bradley said. “We’re continuing to work on customer and student engagement.”
For Bradley, the most meaningful feedback has been from students who appreciate the ability of the SRC to accommodate dietary restrictions. “Being able to provide something vegan everyday, lots of vegetarian food, lots of gluten-free food, is really important and people have really responded to that.”
Students who talked to The Daily generally had positive things to say about the new café, although not all of them knew about it. A U2 Management student said, “I’ll definitely check it out [but] they should publicize it more in emails and posters throughout campus.”
A U1 Faculty of Engineering student standing in line to purchase a vegetarian burrito at The Nest mentioned, “I’m so happy there are vegetarian options for a low price. I’m always broke or low on money so finding a good burrito for cheap, and at such a convenient location, is awesome.”
Currently, the student-run café is limited to breakfast and lunch. Prices are set around $7 to $8 for a sandwich and soup combo, and $5 for a burrito, along with $1.40 for a coffee. Prices are adjusted for students who bring reusable plates or mugs.
“For me, [as] the manager, the most exciting thing is that we haven’t hit any big hiccups in the first week. This means we can start next week on the engagement pieces, the events we’re planning,” Redel said. “We’ve already had student groups talk to us about getting involved, so that’s the best part about this start-up: it’s been pretty seamless.”
In an earlier version of this article, The Daily quoted Josh Redel as saying that it has been challenging dealing with recipes and staff. In fact, Redel said that he expected it to be a challenge but that it was not. The Daily regrets the error.

Students claim lack of consultation, administration says talks ongoing
Throughout the last year, multiple student associations have raised concerns about the Faculty of Arts’ People, Processes & Partnerships (PPP) initiative, especially regarding the extent of student consultation done by the administration.
The PPP dates back to 2010, when Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi’s Working Group on Administrative Services started working on an anticipated problem related to an upcoming turnover of administrative and support staff. A number of staff were approaching the normal age of retirement, and an emerging government policy limited the Faculty’s re-hiring policy to a one-for-two basis, according to Manfredi.
“The question became, how can we organize the administrative and support staff to best provide services to faculty and students,” Manfredi said in an interview with The Daily. However, the urgency of the situation changed with provincial budget cuts.
According to the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT) President Ken Hastings, the Faculty of Arts is not the only faculty undergoing similar constraints.
“All faculties across the university are affected, and in a similar way – the total number of support staff will be reduced. The decisions about how to function optimally with those reduced numbers are not being made by the central administration, but are being made at the faculty level. Each faculty is taking its own approach,” Hastings explained in an email to The Daily.
In an interview with The Daily, Associate Dean (Academic Administration and Oversight) Gillian Lane-Mercier pointed out that the situation quickly became a crisis.
As such, in November 2012 the faculty decided to launch a “much more extensive, more public, and participatory process to address the situation.”
“I individually […] have tried to make students aware, be it through [the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS)], be it through their associations, be it through Facebook […] to try to get as many students not only aware of the various aspects of this PPP initiative but to become actively involved,” Lane-Mercier later said.
However, McGill Industrial Relations Association (MIRA) representative Matthew Crawford-Appignanesi believes that there has not been enough student involvement by the Faculty of Arts students in planning out the PPP.
“We had this presentation by one of the admin on PPP, they had the whole plan laid out for us. But we weren’t really involved with the process apart from AUS President Justin Fletcher, so we did feel a bit out of the loop,” Crawford-Appignanesi explained in an interview with The Daily.
“I don’t think enough has been done, and it seems that much of the outreach has been a reactive response to criticism rather than a proactive effort to build support,” Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Secretary General Jonathan Mooney said in an email to The Daily.
“For example, given the absence of a formal Faculty of Arts graduate association at McGill, PGSS […] should have been involved in selecting representatives to PPP and probably should have been consulted in the very early stages of this process,” he explained.
According to Manfredi, students have been actively involved in the process.
“For example, the working group on Graduate Affairs has six graduate students on the working group itself. So that’s not just consultation, that’s actually getting them rolling up their sleeves and helping us solve the problem,” he explained later in an interview with The Daily.
According to Fletcher, the students were indeed involved in these changes and the committees of the PPP initiative.
Pointing out the backlash by the student body to a proposal to restructure Leacock building’s third floor into a central advising hub, “I think a lot of what we, as a society, have done has changed the direction the production is coming in. […] And I think our concerns were heard on that, and the new proposal is a lot different,” said Fletcher in an interview with The Daily.
The debate around the PPP is still ongoing, and a Town Hall organized by the AUS will take place on January 22.

Ruling upholds U.S. government electronic device searches at border
Late in December, a McGill student involved in a years-long constitutional battle with the U.S. government saw the dismissal of his lawsuit challenging the government’s right to search electronic devices at its borders. The decision dismissed the case on both standing and merit, while raising debate about post-9/11 homeland security policies and the extent of reasonable suspicion when conducting searches at the border.
Pascal Abidor, a doctoral student in Islamic Studies at McGill, was riding an Amtrak train from Montreal to New York in May 2010 when border agents removed him from the train, handcuffed and questioned him in a holding facility, and confiscated his laptop for 11 days. A dual French-American citizen, Abidor found himself singled out by border agents due to his earlier travels to Jordan and Lebanon recorded in his French passport, which culminated in a preliminary search of his laptop on the train and its later confiscation.
Soon after the incident, Abidor worked with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to file a complaint, and later a lawsuit, against the Department of Homeland Security. The plaintiffs, which included Abidor, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the National Press Photographers Association, sought to challenge the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) suspicionless search policy, which allows for the search and seizure of travellers’ personal belongings, including laptops and other electronic devices.
The ACLU argued that such searches were illegal under the first and fourth amendments.
“This is part of a broader pattern of aggressive government surveillance to collect information on too many innocent people under lax standards, and without adequate oversight,” said Brian Hauss, a legal fellow at ACLU who spoke with The Daily regarding the case.
The judge, Edward R. Korman of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York, dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have standing for the lawsuit – due to the lack of “substantial risk that their electronic devices will be subject to a search or seizure without reasonable suspicion.”
According to DHS data, device searches, at present, stand at about 15 searches a day.
“My immediate reaction was [… ] New York just had the lowest crime rate in 50 years, so are they going to just stop prosecuting murders, because they don’t happen often?” Abidor told The Daily, referencing the judge’s grounds for dismissal.
“In terms of our rights, quantity and quality are equal,” he continued. “When someone’s rights are violated, all of our rights are violated.”
As the government did not break any laws, the plaintiffs’ standing in the case was very unlikely to be decided upon.
“If the government looks at your stuff and decides that it doesn’t want to prosecute you, and it just invades your privacy and has not found any evidence of wrongdoing, there’s basically nothing you can do, under this judge’s interpretation,” said Hauss. “It’s like, ‘tough luck.’”
Aside from the plaintiffs’ standing in the case, the primary reason behind the case’s dismissal, the judge also questioned the case’s merits, writing that reasonable suspicion need not be required for routine electronic device searches at borders, as it would be within the U.S. interior.
“Effectively, we think that the judge’s ruling, in this case, makes the border a constitution-free zone,” said Hauss.
Aside from the other grounds on which the judge dismissed the lawsuit, the judge also questioned the necessity of bringing a laptop when travelling.
“As a human being today, it is not plausible [to travel without a laptop],” Abidor said. “He said I don’t have to travel with a laptop, which by extension is… I don’t have to be in school? […] I made a choice to study outside of my country, so that choice makes me susceptible to having my rights violated?”
After the recent decision, the ACLU is still waiting on its decision to appeal the case, which would go to the Court of Appeals.

Confusion over proper allocation of the money
After three to four years of a combination of conservative enrolment estimates, unfilled positions and employee turnover, changes in the fiscal year, and the 2011 MUNACA strike, Student Services has accumulated a surplus of almost $6 million.
A document obtained by The Daily that was presented at a Committee on Student Services (CSS) meeting in late November indicates several proposed uses for the money. This includes providing extra security to open up the libraries later during the exam period, increasing the number of mental health advisors, hiring a part-time fundraising employee for the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office, maintenance on the Brown building, emergency funds, and enrolment services.
Other proposals included graduate supervision, teaching assistants, and an innovation fund.
The surplus was surrounded by confusion when first presented at the CSS. According to Post-graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Member Services Officer Elizabeth Cawley, the student representatives on the CSS were taken by surprise when they were handed – without the usual prior notice – documents pertaining to the allocation of this money.
To Cawley, even though the students had been given details of the proposals, this was not a transparent move on the University’s behalf. “The fact that this proposal was not circulated to the members beforehand for discussion and we were effectively taken by surprise, in my opinion, is inappropriate. […] I would never be comfortable making a decision about $6 [million] of student money without consulting with PGSS members […] We were expected to make a decision in favour of this on the spot,” Cawley wrote in an email in November.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) (DPSLL) Ollivier Dyens told The Daily in an interview that the surprise was a mistake. “My mistake was I should have told CSS […] ‘this is the beginning of a conversation.’ It was never meant to be a top-down process, and that was why I brought it to CSS.”
Student representatives were equally upset with some of the suggestions made for the surplus, many of which – such as hiring TAs or providing extra security for the libraries – are usually paid for from the University’s operating budget.
Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) VP University Affairs Joey Shea told The Daily in November that the shifting of funds could “set a dangerous precedent” for other restricted funds. “[The proposed initiatives are great] but if it’s a Student Services fee, it needs to be kept within Student Services. […] Beyond the legality of it, it is still not very financially transparent.”
Cawley echoed this sentiment, calling it a potentially “serious detriment to the credibility of Student Services.”
“How could they possibly come to the students and ask us for a fee increase during the next referendum period,” she said in November, “if we know that this money can be taken away and used for other projects around the university at will?”
Since December, the administration has been quick to assure students that the money would not be spent outside of the purview of Student Services. “[SSMU President Katie Larson] and I had a meeting with both [Provost Anthony Masi and Dyens] before Christmas. They assured us that the money would be spent inside Student Services and kept in it,” Shea explained to The Daily in a follow-up interview.
At the December meeting of Senate, Shea and PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney submitted a question on the surplus to Dyens, asking why the money was being considered for purposes of the Student Services portfolio. Dyens responded that the proposal would be open to future consultation.
However, Shea said in a follow-up interview, “It’s good to monitor [the situation] and make sure that it’s kept within Student Services.”
Projects such as deferred maintenance on the Brown building, and discrepancies between salary increases for staff and the budget, are necessary, according to Dyens. Both of these projects are normally funded under the purview of Student Services. However, the CSS will meet again this semester to advise Dyens and Executive Director of Student Services Jana Luker on where the rest of the money should go.
According to both Shea and Crawley, $6 million won’t be enough to make big, permanent changes, such as adding mental health professionals to lighten the load on McGill’s Mental Health Services. “We need to make sure that we have the resources available so that the initiatives we fund are sustainable and will continue to improve the delivery of Student Services beyond one influx of cash,” Cawley wrote to The Daily in November.
Both Cawley and Shea agreed that the “innovation fund,” shelved under “other projects to consider,” is a viable destination for the money. “Every unit within Student Services should be allowed to present a proposal for how they could use this money to improve their service,” Cawley explained in November. “I think the ideas should be innovative, collaborative, and then be voted on by a committee like CSS where student members have parity.”
Shea echoed a similar sentiment in an interview with The Daily in November. “There’s a lot of need for that money within Student Services, it’s just a question of how you allocate it, what that process is like, and ensuring that it’s fair.”

Student-led initiatives pave promising path for change
Correction appended January 15, 2014
While McGill continues to maintain its investments in various fossil fuel and tar sands companies, growing pressure from student advocates and organizations has been building to spur the divestment movement among students.
Divest McGill and its efforts to urge the University to divest from tar sands and fossil fuel companies have gained support from the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society, and the Post-Graduate Students’ Society – which together represent over 32,000 students at McGill.
Out of the 645 publicly-traded companies in which McGill invests, 35 are involved with fossil fuels and 14 extract crude oil from tar sands. McGill’s endowment is valued at over $1 billion, and the stocks and bonds from these companies comprise about 2.5 per cent.
As early as February 2010, SSMU voted at a General Assembly to divest from tar sands and financial companies with stakes in fossil fuels. In January 2011, it passed a Five Year Ethical Investment Plan which, among other things, set a clear path for this divestment.
Although SSMU has been quietly divesting its holdings in fossil fuel and tar sands companies since then, in May 2013, the University’s Board of Governors (BoG) voted against divestment, and the University refused to divest its holdings.
The rejection was in large part due to the BoG’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), the committee charged with maintaining the University’s ‘ethical’ investments.
CAMSR’s definition of “social injury” – essentially, the terms of reference guiding an ethical investment – prevented the possibility of climate change being considered a social injury. Advocates have since been working toward a new attempt to change the terms of reference.
“We are actually working on a response to CAMSR, and addressing all of their different reasons which they gave us for rejecting divestment,” said Perry. “We’re also just working on building relationships on campus, not just with students but also with alumni.”
The divestment campaign at McGill follows a larger movement of divestment strategies across universities, cities, and other organizations in the U.S. and Canada.
As a strategy, divestment is one that has a long past at McGill – in the 1980s, the University divested from the South African apartheid government after pressure from students, and has since divested from tobacco and Burma.
“Divestment is a tactic which is supporting work being done in a climate justice movement,” Divest McGill member Kristen Perry told The Daily. “Divestment is just one part of a larger campaign to just shift the weight from fossil fuel extraction and burning,” she added.
“A major motivator for us is making sure that we can reduce climate change as much as possible and the effects of it […] and to [keep the world] at a climate that we can live in,” Perry said.
Perry added that although “climate change affects everyone,” Indigenous people are the ones who are most touched by it in Canada. “Extraction projects in particular really affect the Indigenous populations where the tar sands and pipelines are basically on their lands. They are most affected [by climate change]. They are in the area where they’re extracting fossil fuels.”
“A large goal of our campaign is to create a dialogue, so even if the University doesn’t divest, we have succeeded in already creating a dialogue,” said Perry.
“Contrary to what the Board said, fossil fuel companies do not promote or encourage alternative energy outside of a strictly [public relations] agenda. There are court findings of social injury against fossil fuel companies; […] there are significant environmental and health impacts associated with the tar sands and climate change.”
Robin Reid-Fraser, past SSMU VP External and current Divest McGill member, noted that students’ relationships to their universities give them a voice in these kinds of decisions. “[Divestment campaigns] call attention to the financial dealings of the University, which otherwise are not often examined or questioned, and then [create] a space for students to demand a say in those financial decisions which are usually left up to more removed bodies like McGill’s Board of Governors.”
“I think that this also creates an interesting situation in which students who may not yet have their own financial investment decisions to make, or involvement in other institutions that do, can use their relationship to their universities to have a voice in these kinds of decisions.”
In an earlier version of this article, The Daily quoted Kristen Perry as saying that Divest McGill was preparing a response to CAMSR that would state the reasons against divestment. In fact, Perry said that Divest McGill’s response would address the reasons. The Daily regrets the error.
