SSMU VP Internal
VP Internal Alex Brown is responsible for coordinating SSMU events and activities with the administration, faculties, and all other student groups. Brown hit the ground running this year, having tackled SSMU Frosh only a few months into her term, and will turn around and orchestrate another huge event—SnowAP—his winter. She tried to make SSMU Frosh more green—and though her results were questionable, we hear she took a pretty hard line with Frosh leaders.
To reach her constituency, Brown has taken to tabling at the Y-intersection, armed with brochures informing students about SSMU’s activities. She also has big plans for SSMU’s web site, which she hopes to have translated into French in the coming months. (Good luck.) We’re pretty excited about her initiative to team up with Food Systems for Film and Feast screenings on the lower field.
However, if Brown wants to distinguish herself, we think she should take a line from her fellow VP, José Diaz, who ran for VP Internal two years ago. Back then, he was spouting with ideas for alternative and inclusive events. Concordia’s Student Union (CSU) kicks our ass as far as speakers are concerned—they’ve hosted Naomi Klein, Robert Fisk, and Spike Lee—and we want to see that change. Maybe Brown could book a meeting with the organizers of CSU’s Speaker Series to learn how.  We’d like to see more artsy events, like SSMU’s own take on the Fridge Door Gallery (run by Art History students), or readings of student literature, poetry, or spoken word. It would be equally refreshing to see events that partnered with Montreal-based organizations to strengthen ties between SSMU and the community or local charities. Finally, Brown could collaborate with SSMU President Ivan Nielson to coordinate mixers—beyond Franco-Fete—that engage McGill commuter students in university culture.

It’s a shame a student-run food service didn’t get priority from SSMU to take over the former tenant’s lease last year, but at least we can get panini now. Right?

SSMU VP Clubs and Services
SSMU’s VP Clubs and Services Sarah Olle is in charge of overseeing and communicating with the myriad undergraduate clubs and services on campus, and will also be a key player this year in guiding The McGill Tribune toward independence. For better or worse, Olle has admitted she doesn’t have “big dreams” — though she is convinced that her previous experience as SSMU’s Interest Group Coordinator will help her cut administrative red tape. Olle wants to focus her attention on making SSMU services and resources more transparent and easily attainable for students. To achieve her goals, Olle has printed brochures explaining club bureaucracy, cleaned up the SSMU web site, and scheduled two weeks of tabling at the Y-intersection. Room booking should, “hopefully,” be available online by next week, and students will see the return of a two-day Activities Night again as well as the inclusion of club events on McGill’s online calendar. Unfortunately, Olle has already expressed frustration with the administration and Board of Governors (BoG) as she helps negotiate The Tribune’s Memorandum of Agreement.
Olle has a good head on her shoulders, and we think she has a solid work ethic. We agree that cleaning up bureaucracy is a smart way to engage students overwhelmed by the prospect of using SSMU services or creating a club, but it’s still unfortunate that Olle’s strategy avoids anything more controversial or political than simple streamlining. Potential groups seeking club status must still run their name by McGill administration before applying to SSMU—lest the University incur any sort of liability— nd the Kafka-esque process of booking rooms outside of Shatner keeps student space restricted. Perhaps some outside-the-box thinking is in order to put some forward momentum into Clubs and Services. Concordia, for example, lets external groups use their spaces, bringing the outside world into the sometimes-insular university context.

McGill expert speaks on the United States’ portrayal of our universal health care
As the fervent debate over health care reform has unfolded across the United States, Canada’s publicly funded universal health care has become a potent symbol for both sides. Proponents of public health care cite Canada’s system as a model for reform, while those in opposition have brought up long waiting times and unavailable treatments to criticize the very concept of public health care.
The U.S. debate has been characterized by a confusing multitude of assumptions about Canadian health care, which has often been portrayed as a failing system. Professor Antonia Maioni, Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, spoke with The Daily about how Canada has been portrayed in the health care debate. She argued that while the Canadian system may have its flaws, interest groups opposed to reform have perpetuated inaccuracies in order to misinform the American public about Canadian health care.
McGill Daily: Why has the health care debate been so explosive? What are the interests at stake?
Antonia Maioni: In the U.S. health care reform is the great, unfinished business of the Democratic Party— an issue divided on deep partisan lines. The debate about health care has a larger meaning about the role of government in people’s lives, government regulation in the economy and in society, and also a larger political meaning, in that President Obama has staked a lot of his political reputation on the health care issue.
MD: How has Canadian universal health care been used in the debate?
AM: It’s not the first time that Canada has become a player in the health-care debate. Since the seventies, there has been a push to provide all Americans with the kind of coverage they need. Under Bill Clinton, Canada was used as a model by those who wanted to see more government involvement, and also used by interest groups against government regulation. Canada became a whipping boy for these interests—most typically the insurance industry. We are seeing a revival of this in 2009— of seeing Canada used as a political instrument. Also we see how deeply conservative Republicans and their allies in federal interest groups are characterizing the Canadian system as something that is not attractive and something even Canadians don’t want.
MD: Is Obama’s reform intended to bring about a system similar to the Canadian model?
AM: Not really. What most Democrats would like to see is reform that intends for more access for more of the public. Every American should have access. Today most are insured through their employers. But what Democrats want to develop is a public plan that could be an option alongside employer insurance and private insurance, so people can choose how they would like to continue. It would still be a health care system in which there are different systems, not just single-payer like we have in Canada, but what is being proposed is a public option.
MD: Why has Canadian health care been distorted in American media coverage?
AM: I don’t watch Fox News so I can’t tell you the extent of it. However, the misinformation does not appear out of nowhere but is being promoted by interests who do not want to see reform. It’s not The New York Times talking about it—the facts, and the people that respect the facts, know what the Canadian health care system looks like. The misinformation is strategic. I don’t think Americans are purposefully bashing Canada. The United Kingdom and European countries have also been targets of misinformed scrutiny. Why have such wildly inaccurate statements been directed at health care systems abroad?
There is something in American political culture about the belief in American political exceptionalism — a belief that the U.S. is so different from other places that there is little that can be learned from abroad. Many Americans are insular in that way, and because the U.S. has many institutions that are believed to be unique, it would be impossible to have institutions that are similar to those found abroad.
Since the beginning of the twentieth century, every time the debate has come up there has been a backlash against a foreign model. In the early parts of the twentieth century, social reformers in California based reform on a model in place in Germany. The opponents of this reform used the anti-German war sentiments a way of really destroying that effort. In the forties, the debate became more about the communist threat. Anything seen as government regulation was seen as a slippery slope towards communism. So, the vilifying of Canada is nothing new from the American perspective.
MD: How have Canadians reacted to the portrayal of their health care system?
AM: We complain so much, but as soon as someone attacks it, most Canadians are ready to be up in arms. One of the things which is interesting and happened in the nineties as well, is when you keep on seeing something vilified in that way, many people begin to wonder, “Am I missing something? Is that really the way things are?” It plants a seed of doubt that can undermine confidence within as well. Attacks on some of the problems on our health care have given a lot of fuel to people that want to see more private health care in Canada. People who want more private health care are using the criticisms we are hearing on the American side as ammunition.

Referendum held before resumption of classes
The Post Graduate Student’s Society (PGSS) voted in favour of joining the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ)—the largest student federation in Quebec—last week. The move will align PGSS with a predominantly French-speaking consortium that lobbies for student interests on a variety of issues.
The motion was approved with 58 per cent in favour and 36 per cent opposed. With 588 votes cast, the referendum exceeded quorum with 10 per cent of the graduate student population participating—double the percentage required by PGSS by-laws. The number of graduate students present in August—roughly 5,800—was 1,800 short of McGill’s 2008 academic-year average.
Though PGSS Council originally recommended that the referendum be held in October, a motion was brought forward in PGSS Council over the summer to move the referendum to an earlier date. Since the Council itself did not have quorum to decide on the change, the issue was bumped up to the Executive Committee, which approved it.
Both PGSS President Daniel Simeone—and VP External Ladan Mahabadi—members of the Executive Committee—said that they supported the date change for logistical reasons. They cited the high level of work demanded of elections officials and felt it would be incompatible with the demands graduate students face during class time.
Mahabadi also said that given the Society’s other responsibilities, it made sense to hold the referendum early.
“The Executive Council moved the dates to August because had we waited for September, the window would have been gone. You have to have 14 days of campaigning,” Mahabadi said. “I had other initiatives that would be coming up — that Council had to decide on, and members had to go to referendum on. We just didn’t have the manpower [to wait].”
Holding the referendum before classes and campus journalism had resumed raised eyebrows, leading many to question the legitimacy of the vote. However, Simeone, Mahabadi, and even Tarek Hamade — the only member of the “No” committee — felt that this was a non-issue.
“Graduate students don’t go by season. Most of the graduate students I know are always here; they don’t take off during the summer,” said Hamade.
Hamade was also content with the extent of information available to students prior to the vote — despite the absence of the student press. He also chose not to create a Facebook group or web site — unlike his opponents.
“I didn’t see the point [of making them] because the message was circulated to the inbox of every graduate student. Everyone was aware of the debates and platforms,” Hamade said.
As Elections Commissioner, Simeone felt that overall the election had been carried out fairly.
“I thought both the ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ groups had [some negative] issues. I was not happy with either statement. But both behaved well at the debates. It’s fair to say there was a bit more mobilization on the ‘Yes’ side, but there was the option to form committees.”
Simeone added that the idea of contacting the press had not even occurred to him until the last moment.
“The campus media don’t write about us. We hadn’t even thought about [telling them] until later,” he said.
Adrian Kaats, last year’s PGSS VP External, was more specific about why the press was not notified until late.
“I think The Daily wrote an article once about PGSS last year; The Tribune one time ran an article. [Campus media] just don’t care about the graduate students,” Kaats concluded.

SSMU VP External Affairs
As VP External, it is Ronderos-Morgan’s responsibility to represent the interests of McGill undergraduates to all external bodies—be they government-affiliated, other student unions, or the Montreal community at large. With the provincial Bills 38 and 44 threatening to outsource the governance structure of Quebec universities, the 2009-2010 academic year is bound to be a busy one for this exec.
But Ronderos-Morgan seems prepared to think long-term. He is committed to building bridges with the residents of Milton-Parc to make Frosh activities more neighbourhood-friendly, and creating a stronger sense of shared community. Ronderos-Morgan has also taken up the agenda of promoting the new provincial student consortium Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TACEQ) with as much enthusiasm as his predecessor, and is confident that the new student union will provide McGill students with the lobbying power needed to take on the provincial government. SSMU’s troubled history with student unions has left The Daily feeling more then a little dubious about TACEQ’s chances, though Ronderos-Morgan insists that the new union is free of the bureaucratic trappings that led McGill to unceremoniously quit the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ) in 2006.
At this term’s General Assembly, Ronderos-Morgan is looking to McGill students to set the agenda. He insists that low participation at SSMU events is not a sign of student apathy, but a lack of visibility on SSMU’s part. Fair enough, but we’re still waiting to hear how he’s going to fix this. As VP External it’s part of his job to get students excited about issues—and let’s be honest, he’s going to need a lot more than a government bill if he wants this year’s General Assembly to actually represent the student population. (Instead of being composed of your usual political hacks and journalists.) One issue we recommend? SSMU should actually ask students if they want to join TACEQ before they jump into it.

SSMU VP  University Affairs
Dooley is SSMU’s main delegate to the University administration. She represents all aspects of undergraduate student government— from faculty unions to the student senate caucus—and coordinates any projects that SSMU and the University jointly manage. Dooley’s predecessor, Nadia Wilkinson, had an impressive track record: among other things, she helped to launch McGill’s Office of Sustainability and SSMU’s Food Systems Project. While Dooley clearly intends to keep the gravy train running, her minimal experience in SSMU politics gives us reason to believe that she will have trouble keeping up with the pace set by Wilkinson. She has decided, for instance, not to set too many “big long-term goals” for herself but rather to focus on “little things,” like the accessibility of medical notes, feedback on course work, and problems with class scheduling. But theses issues are, for the most part, beyond the jurisdiction of any SSMU exec, and detract from more urgent concerns, like on-campus student employment and the new residence director’s draconian anti-drug mandate.
On the other hand, her commitment to improving the accessibility of student services, like the health centre, is admirable—provided she manages to make headway in that area. She has also started working with the University to create a user-friendly “access point” for a wide range of student learning resources like tutoring and online course materials. Her plan to continue the Office of Sustainability’s work through a special sustainability fund should be a healthy addition, and her close contact with Associate Vice-Principal (University Services) Jim Nicell is a strong starting point. Finally, her pledge to use the academic roundtable as a means of identifying problems that faculty clubs face with administrative red tape could ensure that student government at all levels stays informed and well coordinated.
But overall, we worry that Dooley may not be setting the bar very high. While we are pleased with her decision to start wine-and-cheese-style Town Halls following Senate meetings, she also needs to use her portfolio to initiate a few ideas of her own. She needs a more cogent plan for defending student jobs, and in that respect, needs to maintain a close relationship with McGill’s TA union—the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill—and the nascent Association of McGill Undergraduate Student Employees. She also needs to heavily prepare for her seat on Deputy Provost Anthony Masi’s Administrative Task Force on Dealing with Economic Uncertainty, while ensuring that the University understands student concerns with tuition increases and the record-breaking highs in student unemployment

SSMU VP Finance and Operations
Though he was a politically engaged SSMU councillor, José Diaz has inherited the most technocratic SSMU VP position. The VP Finance and Operations (FOPS) is responsible for the SSMU budget, chairs the Operations committees, manages Gert’s and Haven Books, and sits on a number of smaller working groups — like the Financial Ethics Research Committee (FERC), which reviews SSMU’s investments.
Acclaimed in last year’s election, Diaz has said from the beginning that he isn’t promising to break even on SSMU’s secondhand bookstore and financial sinkhole Haven Books. Even worse, former VP Clubs and Services Julia Webster—who took over the Haven portfolio when Tobias Silverstein resigned—dropped the ball last year on the book drives that make up a healthy portion of Haven’s stock. Diaz’s two ideas were to move Haven almost exclusively online—except during the early days of term—or to sell additional merchandise, like used records and clothes, to bring in extra customers. However, he has also admitted that “Haven can’t be saved,” so we hope that he drafts an exit plan ASAP, rather than prolonging Haven’s demise.
We were a little more pleased, though, with Diaz’s plans for Gert’s. He has already helped organize a few minor renovations: getting two new pool tables and sanding down the bar to show its wood finish. He is also getting quotes to install hardwood flooring, a bar top, and shelving behind the bar. Considering how nice the graduate students’ bar is at Thomson House, it’s about time that Gert’s became somewhat comparable and stopped resembling Bar des Pins. But if Diaz wants to bring some class back to Shatner, perhaps the planned hot tub party in Gert’s isn’t the way to go.
While Gert’s and Haven are important, we’d like to see a little more creativity from Diaz—or as much as he is allowed within his mandate. Last year, FERC barely got off the ground—and if it did, we didn’t notice. We’d also like to see a little more political gusto on issues concerning university financing. The 2005-2006 VP FOPS Eric van Eyken wasn’t afraid to lobby the federal government, and we hope Diaz—who was never a timid SSMU councillor in years past—will do the same.

SSMU President
The SSMU President is required to be a bureaucratic Jack of all trades—he chairs different SSMU committees, helps his fellow VPs with their portfolios, and represents SSMU’s interests at the Board of Governors (BoG) and Senate. Neilson seems competent in these areas, and we were also impressed by his interest in SSMU’s different green initiatives—including supporting funding for an industrial composter and encouraging McGill Food Services to serve a locally-sourced meal. An equally pragmatic suggestion was to hire an independent advertising manager for General Assemblies to battle the trend of student apathy on campus.  We liked Neilson’s interest in outreach to McGill commuter students—and while his suggestion to incorporate them into the Rez Life project was very good, he had no proposals for how to get outreach off the ground. Neilson’s concern for greater transparency in ancillary fees and referendums was equally vague.  But while these are all important parts of SSMU, they are also comparatively safe issues, and could be handled by special committees.
On external issues, Neilson seems intent on playing nice with everyone rather than fighting the status quo. The McGill Reporter—the administration’s self-promotional newspaper – has hailed him as a “bridge builder.” Building bridges might be a pragmatic approach to the Bill 38 issue—where SSMU and the administration take a common line against a mandatory 60 per cent external membership on BoG—but not for contested issues like tuition increases. Neilson told the Daily that plugging the tuition line would be damaging to the relationship he hopes to build with admin—though he has also said that he intends to work for greater “accessibility”—whatever that means. We only hope he has the chutzpah to remind his fellow governors that the recent several-thousand-dollar tuition increases in the Management, Engineering, and Science faculties for international students have coincided with a huge spike in student unemployment. Because McGill now gets to keep a greater portion of its international tuition revenues—rather than pooling them with other Quebec universities and divvying up the spoils—the University should increase the number of bursaries and loans available, as Heather Monroe-Blum herself promised in an interview with The Daily last year.
Neilson has admitted that he’d like to keep, “idealism out of the office,” because it conflicts with his work. On this, he couldn’t be more wrong. Making sure SSMU runs efficiently and achieves small, concrete goals is important, but he was still elected to be a political leader—not a glorified office manager. It’s true that his role as president is to represent Council interests and act as spokesperson for SSMU in a way that doesn’t conflict with Council’s political prerogatives, but that doesn’t mean he can’t create his own motions or initiatives. His predecessors, Jake Itzkowitz and Kay Turner, both did an adequate job—but they failed to make their mark in the way the extremely political Aaron Donny-Clark did in 2006-2007. At best, we may find ourselves with another forgettable though well-organized SSMU President, and at worst a lapdog of Monroe-Blum.
