Timeline of Events, Student Reactions, and Future Plans
On October 11, just before the Thanksgiving break, SSMU VP Internal Sanchi Bhalla was mandated to send out an email on the listserv on behalf of SSMU Indigenous Affairs Commissioner Tomas Jirousek. The email in question was mandated by a motion passed at Legislative Council just a day prior, condemning the Liberal government’s appeal of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal’s decision to award $40,000 to First Nations children who were taken from their families by the federal government.
However, the email, notifying students of an upcoming demonstration, was not sent out until the next day, October 12, around 10 a.m. The delay in sending this email on the listserv led to the creation of a letter calling for Bhalla’s resignation, signed by Jirousek and seven other Indigenous student leaders. “It is the opinion of the Indigenous student community that the conduct of Vice-President Sanchi Bhalla is grounds for resignation,” the letter reads. “By failing to provide timely allyship to Indigenous students Vice-President Bhalla demonstrated a lack of respect towards the issues as well as the labour that Indigenous students had applied.”
Timeline of Events
In Bhalla’s official statement, she wrote that a number of difficulties concerning the communications staff, as well as personal circumstances, led to the delay of the email. More specifically, Bhalla said in her statement that she had incorrectly assumed that the communications department had been aware of the motion and the email it required.
Upon finishing a midterm, she stated that she did not have the most current password for MailChimp, the application used to distribute SSMU listservs, as it had recently been updated for security reasons. As a result, she was unable to log on to compose and send the email. As well, due to it being a Friday night, she said that there were difficulties in reaching the communications director to fix the password, and only around midnight were they able to solve the issue. Just prior, around 11:30 p.m., Bhalla stated that a combination of a number of factors caused her to fall asleep.
Due to the omission of Bhalla’s whereabouts between 9:30 p.m and 11:30 p.m. in her statement and Facebook post, in combination with numerous sources informing the Daily of her presence at a bar during that time, the Daily reached out to Bhalla to clarify the situation. In an email, she confirmed that she went to Randolph’s Board Game Pub, which she identified as a cafe, around 9:30 p.m., “with notifications switched on the whole time,” and was there until 11:00 p.m.
Ineffective Communication
The Daily spoke to Jirousek, who stated that Bhalla was not communicative. “I understand that we need to take time for selfcare, and can respect that Sanchi may have needed time,” he wrote. “However, during this entire time she failed to respond to my email communication, in addition to a full day’s notice that listserv need[ed] to go out that night.”
“Moreso,” Jirousek added, “efforts could have and should have been made to communicate to me personally that she was unable to act in allyship, at which point I would be able to make alternate arrangements.” At that point, it fell on SSMU President Bryan Buraga, who, per Jirousek, was “staying up, coordinating with staff, and ensuring that this situation was rectified as quickly as possible.” Afterwards, Jirousek indicated that he sent an email to the entire executive, to which he received personal emails from Buraga and VP University Affairs Madeline Wilson.
“At the same time, Vice-President Bhalla made no effort to respond to my email, nor to relay that she was facing technical difficulties,” Jirousek added. “Due to her decision, Indigenous students who had worked on this statement, and expected to share the statement to generate publicity for our event, were forced to continue work in a stressful situation due to a lack of support from Vice-President Bhalla.”
“I understand that we need to take time for self care, and can respect that Sanchi may have needed time. However, during this entire time she failed to respond to my email communication, in addition to a full day’s notice that the listserv need[ed] to go out that night. Moreso, efforts could have and should have been made to communicate to me personally that she was unable to act in allyship, at which point I would be able to make alternate arrangements.”

Student Responses
Student responses to Bhalla’s statements have ranged from simplification of the situation as a “technological failure,” as the VP Internal phrased it, to the spread of intense anti-Indigenous racism across social media in response to Indigenous students’ calls for her resignation.
“It saddens me to see some students’ attempts to distort or misrepresent the current situation regarding the relationship between Indigenous students and Vice-President Bhalla,” Jirousek wrote to the Daily. “The actions of the Indigenous community have been undertaken with the goal of promoting reconciliation, solidarity, and support for future generations of Indigenous students. Sadly, certain students fail to understand this underlying goal and work done by the Indigenous community at McGill.”
Jirousek added, “Indigenous students are marginalized, isolated, and made to feel culturally alone on campus. Indigenous students struggle with systemic barriers which limit our success at institutions like McGill. For students to try and portray the actions of Indigenous students as some type of ‘attack’ is saddening and speaks to the struggles we face on campus.”
Future Plans
Regarding the reforms in SSMU that Jirousek proposed in The McGill Tribune – “a three-step reform to ensure our independence and autonomy in mobilizing to promote Indigenous issues at McGill” – he has already begun to meet with certain executives to work on implementing these changes. The three proposals include the creation of an Indigenous Equity Fund, changing the position of the Indigenous Affairs Commissioner to operate independently of the SSMU executive, and reforming the SSMU Indigenous Solidarity Policy.
In addition to Vice-President Wilson’s work helping to draft and support the Indigenous Equity Fund, Jirousek stated that he has “had conversations with VicePresident Wilson about the change in power dynamics and […] received her full support for the changes.” With regards to the other members of the executive committee, Jirousek expects to meet with them individually to discuss how the changes in the Indigenous Solidarity Policy will affect their respective portfolios. “Sadly,” he added, “I do not expect to receive such support from the Vice-President Internal, but I do look forward to working with the other five executives.”
“I would also just like to note in closing how much damage has been done at this point. While Sanchi may feel this response is unnecessary, there has been very real damage done to the relationship between Indigenous students and the SSMU due to her inaction, whether she meant to do so or not. Further, her failure to take a personal stake in the course of these events is particularly saddening. Yes, her inaction may very well be a symptom of a larger institutional issue. However, we still remain personally responsible for our actions and their effects. She had the choice to personally reach out, and discuss the issue when I emailed. She ignored my email. She had the ability to apply herself diligently the same way President Buraga and Vice-President Wilson had. Again, she didn’t.”

The Shag Shop Talks Queer Sex Ed
In collaboration with McGill’s Queer History Month, a Queer Sexual Education event was held on October 22. The event was organized by the Shag Shop as a part of the Healthy Living Annex at McGill.
Aiming to “provide information that is often harder to come across,” the Shag Shop’s goal is to “empower queer people to have informed sex that is relevant to their desires and bodies!” In an interview with The McGill Daily, the Shag Shop discussed the importance of these resources being accessible for queer people, and emphasized the various barriers they face in accessing adequate sexual education. “There is a lack of standardized and comprehensive sexual education in Quebec that includes queer experiences and bodies,” the Shag Shop said. They also elaborated on the lived differences that queer people experience regarding sex and sexuality, including the notion of having to “come out” as someone with a queer identity, and then subsequently having to navigate the various social expectations and pressures that are often present in heterosexual relationships. Further, the general stigmatization of discussing sex and sexuality is a barrier in itself; the Shag Shop spoke to how “just generally talking about sex openly, especially if one’s desire is not what is ‘expected’ of them, can be really awkward and hard for queer people, [making] accessing or engaging in sexual education challenging.”
To address these barriers, the event started with a discussion facilitated by Shag Shop co-ordinator Leigh Hoffman and co-facililtator Anna Walton on how to talk about sex and sexuality in inclusive and nonjudgemental ways. The organizers used gender neutral language throughout the event when discussing bodies and sex acts in order to ensure that the event was a safe space.
The workshop covered a variety of topics, including STIs, protection and barrier methods, sex toys, and lubricants. The language that was used in discussing these various topics was positive and inclusive, destigmatizing many of the traditionally taboo subjects. The event was also very interactive – the Shag Shop passed around some sex toys that they carry, as well as examples of various protection and barrier methods including a demonstration on how to convert a condom into a dental dam. Throughout the event, participants were free to ask questions to the presenters, and it was clear that this event offered many participants a safe space to pose questions facilitating discussions outside of the workshop’s agenda, opening the conversation to topics such as pornography or how hormones interact with birth control.
Queer sexual education is a crucial resource to be able to access, especially during McGill’s Queer History Month. Speaking to the gaps in sexual education that drove them to run the event, the Shag Shop posed the question: “how can folks explore their sexuality or engage in sex safely if they do not know what risks are associated with the kinds of sex they have, or have never encountered sex ed materials that include trans bodies?” The Shag Shop emphasized why a need exists for fundamental, queer oriented sex ed: “for so many reasons, folks may not have had access to informed, sex positive sexual education. Beyond having access to foundational sex ed, even fewer folks have had access to sexual education that specifically focuses on sex/sexualities of queer people.”
The Shag Shop provided a safe, accessible, and informative Queer Sexual Education event for their attendees that positively contributed to McGill’s Queer History Month. “In order to be best equipped to have happy, healthy, and consensual sex lives, we need access to information that is relevant, informed, and nonjudgemental about the types of sex that we have, the types of bodies we have, and the kinds of relationships we have!”
The Shag Shop and the Healthy Living Annex provided many resources for those who attended the event, including free condoms and access to sexual health services. These resources are inclusive and available for all McGill students. The Healthy Living Annex organizes student-run workshops on a variety of topics including sexual health, and the Shag Shop coordinator is always available to answer questions regarding sexual health. Furthermore, the McGill Shag Shop is a great sex-positive resource to access sex toys, condoms, lubricants, menstrual products, pregnancy tests, and more at low prices (www.mcgill.ca/shagshop). The Shag Shop also referenced scarleteen.com as a reliable additional resource for sexual health.

2SLGBTQIA+ Medical Professionals Discuss
On October 30, 2019, the McGill Faculty of Medicine, Post-Graduate Student’s Society (PGSS), and Social Accountability and Community Engagement Office (SACE) hosted the panel “What is it Like in the Inside?” to discuss the experiences of 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals working in healthcare. Topics discussed included the difficulty of continuously having to come out to both colleagues and patients, the difficulties of reforming the healthcare system to be more trans-sensitive, and the impact which the intersection between race and sexuality has on one’s identity.
The event began with a presentation by Saleem Razack, pediatrician and Director of the Social Accountability and Community Engagement Office at McGill, which defined the goals of the panel: namely, to provide a space for 2SLGBTQIA+ identifying students and faculty, as well as allies, to gather, to encourage fostering an intergenerational dialogue about issues impacting the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, and to assess interest in forming a Queer Health group at McGill. According to Razack, the event was the first Queer History Month event hosted by the Faculty of Medicine. Dr. David Eidelman, VP-Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, also expressed his support for Razack’s efforts in creating a space for such discussions, and stressed the importance of diversity, especially given McGill’s historical lack of tolerance in the Faculty of Medicine.
Razack continued his presentation with a history of the attitude towards the 2SLGBTQIA+ community in the medical profession. He referred to the significant advancements in the treatment of HIV-AIDS made in his lifetime as well as historic psychiatric “diagnoses” of 2SLGBTQIA+ people to illustrate the positive influence which members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community can have on health care. Razack emphasized the activism which took place to make this progress, from psychiatric professionals advocating against conversion therapy to activists outside of healthcare seeking to hold the medical profession accountable for its treatment of 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals. Such history plays an important role in how Razack teaches medicine; he advocates teaching that “owns” the intolerant history of medicine. “We aren’t discontinuous with that history […] the way to own it is to bring it out, make it be known.” He concluded his presentation by stressing the important role that he believes expressing his sexuality plays in his practice: “I’ve been a doctor who was not out […] there’s no going back for me. Being gay and being out as gay has made me a much more authentic and real doctor.”

After the presentation, members of the panel introduced themselves and briefly described their experience in healthcare as a 2SLGBTQIA+ person. Many of them emphasized the need for a queer community amongst medical professionals – Donovan Duncan, a pediatrician who identifies as a queer male, characterized his experience in medicine as “empowering,” thanks to the community of queer students which he found in his first year of medical school. Paul Lerner recounted his time as a trans man in college who was not out, saying that he had no support and felt isolated. Eventually, he concluded that he needed to be “out” at medical school to access a supportive community.
Panelists also acknowledged the difficulty of coming out; each described coming out as a continuous process. “One of the weird things about your third year of medical school is that you’re essentially starting a new job every few weeks […] how are you going to signal being out to a new group of people?” Lerner wondered. In the context of working in an international capacity, coming out became even more complicated for Hiba Zafran, occupational therapist-psychotherapist. She recalled working in Lebanon, where she didn’t come out to her colleagues for fear of her own safety; Razack had a similar experience in Siberia. Each emphasized the importance of ensuring one’s own safety when making the decision to come out.
Zafran and Razack emphasized the importance of ensuring one’s own safety when making the decision to come out.
Zafran and Razack also spoke about the intersectional nature of their identities – Zafran identifies as a queer person of color, and Razack is a gay man of South Asian descent. For Zafran, it is difficult to reconcile these aspects of her identity with her teaching demands: “the curriculum is straight, and the curriculum is white, and even though I’m not those things, I represent the curriculum,” she remarked in a comment concerning a class she held about sex and gender diversity. Razack encourages embracing all aspect’s of one’s origin, even if at times they may conflict; being Muslim and gay has allowed him to appreciate aspects of Islamic culture which he otherwise might not have, he says.
The panel also speculated as to how medical professionals could be trained to be more trans-sensitive, especially in light of the recent death of Hayden Muller. Muller was a non-binary trans activist whose death in September was attributed to the transphobia of their health care provider – their doctor advised against a double mastectomy – despite Muller’s desire to have the procedure done – to combat stage 3 breast cancer. Panelists stressed the magnitude of work needed to be done regarding trans-sensitivity in healthcare. They pointed out that not only doctors, but also secretaries, orderlies, nurses – anyone the patient might encounter during their treatment – should all be educated on trans issues, but this would be a monumental feat. Furthermore, in a healthcare system which is simply not built to be trans-sensitive, there is work which needs to be done on a systemic and legal level to encourage trans-sensitivity.
Anyone the patient might encounter during their treatment should be educated on trans issues.
Razack concluded the event by emphasizing the importance of providing good healthcare above all else. “We’re here to build community, but we’re also here to serve patients well,” he said, stressing how including the 2SLGBTQIA+ community in discussions around healthcare would ultimately improve quality of care for patients.
