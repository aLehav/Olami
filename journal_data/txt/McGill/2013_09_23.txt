Explores idea of ‘divestment as a protest strategy’
Following its inaugural year, on September 19 Divest McGill kicked off the academic year with a workshop and meet-and-greet for newcomers. Divest is a student-run environmental group whose mission is to have McGill divest its holdings from institutions that participate in the production of fossil fuels or are involved with ‘The North for All’ (the resource plan formerly known as Plan Nord) or the Alberta tar sands.  Attended by over 40 participants in the SSMU ballroom, Divest McGill leaders led a group discussion which explored divestment as protest strategy, the progress the group made last year, and plans for the future.
Divest McGill is one of 13 major university divestment groups in Canada, and soon will be joined by a new branch at Concordia. On a global level, it is one of more than 300 campus groups of its kind, largely stationed in North America.
McGill invests in 645 publicly-traded companies in total, of which 35 are involved in some form of fossil fuel pollution and 14 extract crude oil from tar sands. The stocks and bonds from these companies comprise about 2.5 per cent of McGill’s over $1 billion endowment, according to organizers.
Emily, a U1 student and first-time Divest attendee, told The Daily, “As much I’m totally against corporations who profit off fossil fuels, on a much deeper level I’m just surprised no one tell us where our money is going.”
Divest McGill argues that divesting from environmentally harmful companies would be akin to the divestment process from apartheid South Africa – a movement that encompassed divestment from states, companies, and universities, and had a profound impact on the economic health of the apartheid state.
After receiving over 1300 signatures, according to organizers, from the McGill community members last year, Divest made its case in front of the McGill Board of Governors last May. They were rejected following the advice of the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility, citing the reason that the investments exhibited no “social injury.”
When asked about the future plans for the organization, Amina Moustaqim-Barrette, Divest McGill’s media contact, explained, “We would love to really connect with other groups on campus, to really build up and unite the Green community.”
“One thing we want to do is have a SSMU referendum in the winter, but it’s something we have to discuss further. It’s still a big goal though,” she said.
Another meeting will be held in the coming week to discuss more concrete objectives, goals, and ideas for the group in the coming school year.

A landlord and city’s reinterpretation of artistic space
“There wasn’t, ‘oh, you have to pay this,’” said Isabelle Charlebois, reminiscing about the Moreau Lofts community that resided in the building at the corner of Ontario and Moreau in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood.
Charlebois, a professional seamstress and student at Université du Québec à Montréal, was one of around 100 residents who were removed from their homes following an eviction notice that was doled out on June 5 of this year. The artists who were residing in 34 of the 38 loft spaces, who did not have a certificate for occupancy in the commercial building, were told to leave their homes behind before September, on the premise that the building was breaking various fire code regulations.
Although a registered commercial building, artists have been calling the Moreau Lofts their home for over two decades. “Over there I’ve seen the worse trash things I’ve ever seen in my entire life, and I’ve seen the best things of my life,” said Charlebois.
“As you were entering, it was dark, and they would light up candles all around you. And they would play a song and blow out candles one by one,” Charlebois  said, recalling one of the building’s homegrown art events. “The very good thing about this community and the loft is the art, and the sensitivity they provide the community with was really direct and accessible.”
The night of one of the art events in 2012, four groups of around 100 people were taken around the lofts, into strange places filled with theatrical experimentations, light, and live sound production. On the first floor, Charlebois said, there was an upright electric bass player, with two dancers moving around him. The lights were switched on and off, so that when someone walked into the room, the dancers wrote movement in space with flashes of bright light.
The eviction of these artists will make way for new ones, if the plans of landlord Vito Papasodaro become reality. Papasodaro was reported by CTV News to be planning to invest $1 million to transform the space into another type of artistic lofts, with the full support of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough mayor Réal Ménard. The 38 units will be converted to 70 instead.
“There’s an elite vision that art is for people who can understand stuff, whereas we felt whoever wants to come in can come in. It became a public space,” said Charlebois.
For over two decades, Papasodaro has been receiving approximately $40,000 in total rent on a monthly basis from the residents of the Moreau Lofts – but faces accusations of neglecting to cycle enough money back into the building in order to keep it up to the standards of provincial building code.
Following repeated complaints filed by residents of the Moreau Lofts, inspectors were sent to evaluate the property’s well-being, although, according to tenants, no sufficient action was taken to keep the building from breaking code.
The Moreau Lofts were once the site of documentary film La maison des rêves, or The House of Dreams. But in reality, such dreams were often modest in nature. The only dream Guillaume Vallée-Rémillard, one of the occupiers who had stayed in the parking lot of the Moreau Lofts in protest of the eviction, spoke to, was that of a society that would accept a truly mixed-income neighbourhood.
“Rich people just want to get poor people evicted. Poor people just want to survive,” he said.
* * *
The Comité BAILS of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve – BAILS being Base Action Information Logement Social, an organization that promotes and defends social housing – later organized an occupation of the Moreau Lofts parking lot, organizing tenants in the struggle against gentrification and for more social housing. The occupation in the lot was to last from September 1 to 3.
After that, the occupation continued until the early morning of September 6, when the 15 occupiers who had stayed the night were forcibly removed by armed riot police. It was 6 a.m.
According to Vallée-Rémillard – one of the occupiers awoken to the blare of a megaphone – there were around 40 riot police, with approximately an additional 20 police officers there to take down the camp.
With that, the days of co-operative food share, daily general assemblies, live music, and community housing were over.
Jonathan Aspireault-Massé, community organizer at the Comité BAILS, said the Moreau Lofts would be a marker on a neighbourhood that had traditionally pushed for social housing. Although he doesn’t believe that Mayor Ménard is working directly with the landlord, Aspireault-Massé indicated that the mayor was indeed complicit in the eviction of the Moreau Lofts artists.
“I think the mayor might never have even met this landlord. However, he was very happy about the project that the landlord was developing,” said Aspireault-Massé.
“It feels a lot like it was arranged at the end,” said Charlebois, adding, “At the beginning of the summer, we spoke with the [mayor of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve] and he was all for social housing and helping us.”
“Finally at the end of the summer, Vito Papasodaro was suppose to provide architectural plans so we could set up all the renovations he was going to do. He didn’t do much until the third of September. He was waiting for us to be kicked out. That’s the reality,” said Charlebois.
Fred Burrill, community organizer at the P.O.P.I.R. Comité Logement – which aims to improve housing conditions and provide legal advice to residents in Petite-Bourgogne, St. Henri, Côte-St. Paul, and Ville-Émard – also felt that the timing of the eviction was eerily strategic.
“As soon as the landlord, who has done this before in Hochelaga […] had a project that would bring in a lot more money, that’s when the borough was ready to apply all its inspection rules,” said Burrill. “That’s when the borough was sending the police, the fire department, and of course we didn’t see that before.”
After occupiers were removed from the parking lot of the Moreau Lofts, city workers came to clear out the remnants of the occupation, which was located on Papasodaro’s private property.
“To the audience of The McGill Daily, if they want good tips on how to make their occupation have a better chance to stay longer […] whatever you build has to be high in the sky,” said Vallée-Rémillard.
The beginning of gentrification happens with the conversion of building spaces, said Burrill, who went on to describe the conversion of industrial buildings to residential and other private spaces. According to Burrill, McGill’s conversion of an older industrial building to create the Solin Hall residence in St. Henri set off a wave of gentrification in the neighbourhood.
“McGill students, as a relatively privileged population, who circulate around through neighbourhoods without ever making a huge link or contribution to the struggles going on in those neighbourhoods […] definitely play a role in gentrification,” he said. “It’s about how you chose to participate or not participate in the process.”
The change that gentrification has begun to enact on the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood is a microcosm of the city of Montreal as a whole. As gentrification and the promotion of private development becomes actual public policy, the makeup of this city’s artistic spaces will also change.
When asked what she thinks the Moreau Lofts will look like in the future, Charlebois answered, “It’s probably going to look trendy, and cute […] whatever. But it won’t have a soul. The new architecture is really cold these days. I’d be surprised that this building has a soul in two years. I was there two days ago. It felt like a ghost.”

Local anarchists shine light on misrepresented philosophy
Local anarchists gathered Thursday night to discuss the need for hope in their community. The event, which took place at Bar Populaire on St. Laurent, was held to promote the launch of the zine Anarchism and Hope written by local anarchist, journalist, and activist Aaron Lakoff.
Lakoff’s zine is the second zine to be published by the two-year-old Montreal-based Howl! Arts Collective, which describes itself on its website as a collective of artists and activists working for social justice issues through artistic expression.
Over 50 people from the anarchist community attended the event. The engaged and supportive group was quick to dispel the myth of anarchism as a force of violence.
“Anarchism has often been perceived as violent [and] inherently chaotic,” said Lakoff in an interview with The Daily. “My response to that is nothing can be actually more chaotic than the current state of the world. There is nothing sane about living under capitalism, about people having to sell their labour for shitty wages, for people to have to breathe in all the toxins that are in our environment, for oil pipelines to be built across the country. That, to me, is insanity, and I think what anarchists are actually proposing is a world based on sentiments of mutual aid and on love and passion.”
This sentiment was the basis of Lakoff’s zine, which he first conceived of three years ago. “Amongst anarchists, there is this really unfortunate sense of cynicism,” said Lakoff. “I started writing the zine after the G20 protests in Toronto a few years ago where some of my really good friends were in jail […] and people just kind of lost hope.”
Migrant justice activist Mostafa Henaway explained the concept of hope in an anarchist community at the event. “When we talk about hope, it’s that people [are] able to regain a sense of agency over their lives.”
“You see anarchism every day,” remarked Henaway. “You see people making decisions collectively through consensus, you see people reject unjust authority […] it’s not a very radical idea. What may seem radical is the way in which people perceive anarchism is trying to get there.”
While to some, anarchism and hope may not seem connected, to Henaway, “They’re intertwined. […] Especially working with people who are precarious workers […] it’s either they have hope, or capitalism breaks them down.”
“Bureaucracies are this way to keep us oppressed,” Lakoff stated. “They’re cold, they’re faceless, they’re hard to navigate, and they’re essentially made to disorient people. The beautiful thing about anarchists and what anarchism is trying to do is break through those bureaucracies by trying to put forth a more human way of interacting with each other.”
Howl! Arts Collective member Stefan Christoff highlighted the need to spread ideas and create discussion on the subject of social activism. “We wanted to publish Aaron’s text on anarchism […] because we felt it was important to create a publication that could be shared with others [and] that’s rooted in reflection,” he told The Daily.
“Hope is like bread,” Lakoff said at the event. “It’s something that we need to nourish us.”

Reduced administrative staff poses a potential problem
Students, professors, and administrative staff gathered on September 19 in the Leacock Building for a question and answer period regarding the Faculty of Arts’ People, Processes & Partnerships (PPP) plan. Discussion centered around the administration’s intent to reorganize a diminished administrative staff into a series of ‘hubs,’ each of which would aim to serve students in several departments.
Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi stressed that the aim of the plan was to eliminate inefficiency through the reorganization of remaining administrative staff. “It’s not about doing more with less,” said Manfredi. “It’s about finding things we don’t need to do anymore.”
The plan comes in the wake of government budget cuts that have forced the University to reduce costs across the board. To help lessen the blow of cuts, a Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP) was put into place for staff. However, after 255 staff took advantage of the VRP, the number of administrative and support staff for the Faculty of Arts’ 16 departments has shrunk from 59 to 52.
While savings from the VRP were significant, totaling $583,000 for the Faculty, the staff downsizing has not gone unnoticed.
Department of English Chair Allan Hepburn told The Daily he was concerned about whether a decreased administrative staff would be able to fulfill the needs of multiple departments. “I delegate certain tasks to the people who work for me. I can’t do them. They’re [human resources], they’re finance, and so on. I’m not a support staff person,” said Hepburn.
“[The concern is] how many administrative staff are designated to take care of students,” Hepburn added later. “If you have 1,600 students and you only have four administrative staff to take care of their needs, those staff are responsible for 400 students each.”
The PPP plan also calls for the consolidation of 16 independent departments into six interconnected units. As such, support staff may have to relocate and serve multiple departments.
Mary Chin, a union representative and member of the Communications Committee at the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA), remarked that staff members “feel very proprietorial and very connected to [their] departments,” and that they “won’t know how to help” after the move. She then added that the support staff is “concerned about workload.”
In answer to a question about how support staff would adjust to changes, Manfredi said, “Obviously we want them to go where they want,” later adding that the plan’s implementation will require a lengthy “transition period.”
In a statement to The Daily, Chin questioned the administration’s strategy.
“We need to know: are we going to have the time to learn about these new programs and how to help these new students? Whether Dean Manfredi has addressed that, I think the answer was a little general.”
Nevertheless, Chin emphasized that she was glad for the consultation process. “It’s important to come and speak and really take up the offer of dialogue.”

Discussion surrounds Charter of Values, budget cuts
Just two weeks after she took the helm of McGill, Principal Suzanne Fortier chaired her first Senate meeting on September 20, commenting on contentious topics on campus such as the Charter of Values. Senate has a large say in university and academic affairs, and contains 107 voting members – including senior administration, Deans of Faculties, some professors, and 19 student representatives.
Fortier comments on Charter of Values, university rankings
Fortier opened the meeting by emphasizing that her priorities as principal align with those of the McGill community, but also underlined building good working relationships with universities and governments.
A few days ago, Fortier released a statement on the controversial Charter of Values, reaffirming that McGill is committed to promoting “cultural diversity, both in the recruitment of its students and in the hiring of staff and faculty members,” and also to promoting a “climate of tolerance on campus.”
On Monday, the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) and the Faculty of Medicine, along with affiliated teaching hospitals, also denounced the Charter’s proposal to limit “overt and conspicuous” religious symbols.
Following Fortier’s speech, SSMU VP University Affairs Joey Shea asked Fortier how the University would “engage the provincial government to protect the rights of staff and students.”
“At the moment, [the government has] nothing concrete,” Fortier responded. “[McGill should] use this period as a period of consultation, that’s why it is very important for us to participate in the consultation and debate.”
Fortier added, “Already we know that there is a possibility of exclusion – that colleges and university could ask to have an exclusion [from the restrictions of the Charter of Values …] At the appropriate time we’ll take actions that are required.”
As in her interview with The Daily, Fortier also addressed McGill’s much-talked-about drop in worldwide university rankings.
“It is actually astonishing that McGill University keeps its place in the 25 best universities in the world, given the very large difference between our financial situation and the financial situation of many [other] universities,” Fortier said, adding that it “shows the commitment of people in this community.”
Budget cuts
Provost Anthony C. Masi gave a report to Senate on the state of budget cuts at McGill. The University has met 95 per cent of its cost reduction targets after the provincial government slashed $38 million from McGill’s budget last year.
“It’s not easy. McGill is a great place, and we do perform at levels far above the funding that we actually have as an institution,” Masi said. He added that after speaking to provosts of American universities at a conference in the summer, it was evident that cuts were not only a McGill problem.
To avoid collective dismissals, McGill implemented hiring freezes, salary freezes, and a Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP).  According to Masi, it was expected that 30 per cent of the 502 people who qualified for the VRP would take it – instead, 255 people, or around 50 per cent, retired. “[The] total reduction [of positions] still requires that we do things radically different,” Masi said. “The reduced number of people cannot possibly do all the tasks that used to be done.”
Fundraising and reports
Marc Weinstein, Vice-Principal of Development and Alumni Relations, presented the results of Campaign McGill, an eight-year fundraising campaign wrapped up in June 2013, that raised a record-breaking $1.026 billion for the University.
One member of Senate, Marc Richard, cautioned Weinstein for future campaigns about situations “when private donations came with strings attached that involved influence in the private structures of the University.”
Weinstein affirmed that the campaign was “very vigilant,” adding that several gifts had been declined because of this problem.
Two annual reports were also presented on potential problems at McGill: one on the investigation of research, and the other on harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination.
Abraham Fuks, the Research Integrity Officer under the Office of the Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations), presented the report on the Investigation of Research Misconduct. According to the report, there were only two investigations this year – into one allegation of plagiarism, and one allegation of fabrication or falsification.
“Protecting the integrity of our research is enormously important, [as is] protecting the reputation of our research,” Fortier commented.
The Annual Report of the Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, & Discrimination Prohibited by Law talked about the educational activities and the amount of complaints. According to the report, in the 2012-13 year, there were 35 complaints received – an increase over the 24 received in the 2011-12 year.

High healthcare costs also discussed
Correction appended October 7, 2013.
McGill’s Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its first general meeting of the academic year on September 19, during which members passed motions regarding Quebec’s Charter of Values, bylaw changes, and international student health insurance.
Quebec Charter of Values
Following the lead of McGill professors and of Principal Suzanne Fortier, PGSS addressed the Parti Québécois’s proposed Charter of Values.
The motion presented in the GM read, “Be it resolved that the PGSS oppose the Quebec government proposal to limit the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols by state personnel.”
Two amendments to the motion were brought forward by Art History and Communications Studies Graduate Students Association (AHCS-GSA) representative Gretchen King. The first amendment was a resolution for PGSS to send a letter to Premier Pauline Marois expressing the Society’s opposition to the Charter. The second amendment was a resolution to notify post-graduate students in the event of any mobilizations against the Charter.
Both of the amendments were adopted, and the motion passed with strong support.
However, a third amendment proposed by King – for PGSS to mobilize post-graduate students in the event of demonstrations against the Charter – was rejected. As one attendee put it, “PGSS is a student society, not a trade union.”
Bylaw changes
Out of the 11 proposed bylaw changes in the first motion presented to the GM, two stood out as contentious.
The first bylaw change proposed to amend the composition of the appointments board – notably, the motion proposed that two members of the PGSS Executive would sit on the board.
This proposal was challenged notably by Economics Graduate Student Association (EGSA) representative Guillaume Lord, who argued that having two executive members on the board would reduce its useful role as a check and balance on executive power.
The bylaw change passed, however, after PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney explained that the proposed change was merely a matter of resolving contradictions between PGSS’s constitution and the Society bylaws.
The second proposed bylaw amendment aimed to modify Council seat apportionment. The amendment would reduce the size of Council, which currently stands at 131 seats.
Some students argued that a large council is more representative and should be kept as is, while others branded the size unwieldy, pointing out that PGSS’s council is far larger than SSMU’s council, which has 45 seats.
One student pointed out that if all 131 members were to attend the council meetings, they would not be able to fit into their designated room, and that the PGSS council dwarfs even the US Senate – which has 100 members.
The proposal was passed, and Council size will be reduced.
Health insurance
In a follow-up to this summer’s discussions with student union Fédération étudiante universitaire de Québec (FEUQ) regarding the affordability of international student health care, a motion was passed that advocated “expanding Quebec Medicare coverage to international students.”
According to the motion, although international students are treated as Canadians for tax purposes when working, a Quebec government directive forces hospitals to charge international students three times the Quebec Medicare rate. This has led to a skyrocketing of health insurance premiums, which PGSS denounced as “an obstacle to educational achievement.”
An earlier version of this article stated that passing a motion does not mean any action will be taken, but instead that the PGSS Council will vote on it at a later date. In fact, motions that pass at the General Meeting do not need to be voted on at PGSS Council for any action to be taken. In addition, The Daily stated that Guillaume Lord was a representative of the English Graduate Student Association. Lord is in fact a representative of the Economics Graduate Student Representation.

Thousands take to the streets to protest proposed project 
On September 15, a group of around  30 people gathered at Sherbrooke and McTavish to protest a large-scale mining project taking place in Romania. Most of the group walked in a circle holding signs and banners, some chanting and banging tambourines, all with the mission to gain attention from passersby. One of the organizers, Manuela Oanes, told The Daily, “We are here today in solidarity with the thousands that are protesting across Romania.”
Oanes continued to explain that the Rosia Montana Gold Corporation (RMGC) was seeking to create the largest open-pit gold mine in Europe in the Rosia Montana area in Transylvania. Oanes also noted that the project is 80 per cent owned by Gabriel Resources, a Canadian company based in the United Kingdom.
“We want Canadians to know that mining companies from Canada a lot of times don’t always act ethically and morally in countries that are less developed, or maybe [where the] legislation isn’t as good,” she said.
 * * *
 Over 7,000 kilometres away, in Bucharest, Romania, a mining project was finally greenlit on August 27 after 14 years on the backburner. Days later, on September 1, activists and citizens began to take to the streets to protest the project.
Alexandru Predoiu, one of the organizers of the protests and a member of Militia Spirituala, a non-governmental activist organization, told The Daily, “On the first night [that] we saw the law had been drafted, had been put into Parliament, some other people put together a Facebook group calling for protests.”
Predoiu, who is based in Romania, explained the bill that allowed the mining project to go forward. “It’s a special law that exempts [RMGC], the gold mining company, from environmental laws, constitutional laws – it just offers them the project on the table.”
“We are marching through the streets, through the capital and the cities to let people know.”
Demonstrations quickly spread across Romania in the following weeks, with protests being held in major cities like Iasi and Brasov. In Bucharest, numbers have swelled at Sunday night protests to as many as 25,000 people, with thousands more taking to the streets across the globe in solidarity protests in places like Gezi, Turkey, and London.
* * *
 The Rosia Montana project would see 500,000 ounces of gold extracted per year over a period of 16 years, according to the company’s website. The region has seen mining taking place as far back as Roman times, up until the present day, with mines in the area previously being used during the Communist period.
One of the main reasons people are upset about the project, according to Vicentiu Garbacea, another activist based in Romania who has been present since the protests began, is due to the way the mining will take place.
“This project means digging an accumulation lake, with a huge surface, that is going to be full of cyanide,” he said.
Garbacea noted that Romania has already dealt with an environmental accident involving cyanide mining – a project that was a joint venture between an Australian company and Romania. In 2000, a mining accident occurred when cyanide from the nearby Baia Mare mining project spilled into a river, causing massive environmental damage. Many considered the accident to be the worst environmental disaster since Chernobyl.
“You cannot do anything with the area after cyanide, except for possibly freezing the soil forever,” Garbacea noted. “Cyanide gets into the water, it gets into the earth, it affects everything.”
The Rosia Montana project would also see the destruction of three villages and four mountains in the region – involving the uprooting of thousands of people from the region and the destruction of ancient Roman mining galleries. Garbacea noted that the company, not the government, would be in charge of moving people.
Garbacea explained that the protests are not merely aimed at the mining project, but also at the systemic corruption present in the Romanian government.
“It’s an escalation of many things, mainly state corruption, and aggressive Western capitalism,” he said.
Garbacea believes that government corruption allowed for the project to begin in the first place, despite the fact that the current government’s campaigns centred around opposition to the project.
“Since the so-called revolution in 1989, nothing has changed. All the people and all the politicians are linked to the former Communist party,” he said. “We have had no change of system – just the name changed.”
Romania is currently lead by the Social Democratic Party, under the leadership of Prime Minister Victor Ponta. The country began its transition to democracy in 1989, when over 40 years of communist rule ended with a series of protests across the country and culminated with the execution of former leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
Despite Garbacea’s view of the government, Maria Popova, a professor of Political Science at McGill, noted, “[The Romanian government] is a democratic regime; it is not an authoritarian regime that is going to crack down and wipe out dissent and go ahead with whatever they want to do.”
While both Garbacea and Predoiu are firmly opposed to the project, the same could not be said for all Romanians. Gold miners in the Rosia Montana region were involved in a five-day protest underground where they blockaded themselves in a mining pit 300 metres below ground, and threatened to go on hunger strike if the mine did not go ahead.
Additionally, the CEO of Gabriel Resources announced that he would take legal action against the Romanian government if they did seek to stop the legislation that would allow the project to go ahead.
In recent days, the government has begun to reconsider the draft bill put forward on August 27, with the President of Romania, Traian Băsescu, calling it “unconstitutional,” according to several Romanian media reports.
* * *
 According to Predoiu, the nightly protests have remained non-violent, with people marching on the streets in large numbers every Sunday night. During the rest of the week, University Square, where people have been meeting in downtown Bucharest, is kept ‘alive’ with teach-ins and volunteers handing out leaflets.
Despite the large number of demonstrators – last week, 25,000 people protested in Bucharest – the protests have remained peaceful.
“This is a great accomplishment, because there had been protests last year that had turned violent, but this year, because of us, because of the protesters, we have just gone for a peaceful cultured protest,” explained Garbacea.
“There has been no reason for violence, beside the normal pushing, maybe a bit of pepper spraying when [the police] feel threatened by the numbers of the crowd,” he continued.
Predoiu listed four of the protesters’ specific goals: shutting down the legislation that would approve the project, banning cyanide mining in Romania, declaring the area a UNESCO heritage site, and making the current government step down from power.
The legislation is currently on hold, according to Garbacea, and a special committee was convened “of representatives from [the] parliament, the opposition, NGOs [non-governmental organizations], the company [… and] civil society involved, in order to debate the pros and cons about the mining bill.” The committee has until October 20 to determine whether or not the bill will move forward.
Predoiu believes that the government expects, with the convening of the committee, the diffusion of civil tension – but stressed that the determination of the protesters would win out.
“We are going to go on until all the demands are met. […] None of those points are negotiable.”
Despite the odds, both Predoiu and Garbacea were proud of the social mobility that has been achieved so far in Romania and across the globe.
“It has evolved into a culture of peaceful protest,” Garbacea remarked. “We have been meeting every night, playing, singing, mostly having concerts, a string quartet played a couple of nights.”
“I feel very proud about my generation, that we managed to unite finally for a cause, for something that affects us all,” said Garbacea. “There is nothing political with this protest, there is nothing to gain. We are protesting for basic human and civil rights, the right to clean environment, the right to clean air and not be poisoned.”

Student Services will find creative solution to budget cuts
As of September 20, the $20 registration fee instituted earlier this year to access Mental Health or Counselling Services is no longer in effect. Students who have already paid the fee will be reimbursed.
The fee was officially announced on September 1, but after being brought to the attention of the Fee Advisory Committee, it was determined that the $20 would constitute a mandatory fee and therefore have to be subject for a student referendum before it could be approved.
Jana Luker, Executive Director of Student Services, told The Daily in an interview that this was a best case scenario. “It’s something we didn’t want to do in the first place [… so] in the end, it kind of worked out well.”
According to the press release, despite the loss of revenue that the fee would have brought in, there will be no reductions in service. Luker also pointed out that the staff hired in anticipation of the income generated by the fee are already on contract, and so waiting times should not be affected by the cancellation of this fee.
The $20 registration fee was implemented in May for Mental Health Services, and in the beginning of September for Counselling Services. Although the direct fee was thought up years ago to increase accessibility to Mental Health and Counselling services, Luker told The Daily, it was because of deep budget cuts that the fee was implemented.
Mental Health and Counselling Services both fall under the funding of Student Services, which lost almost $500,000 after university-wide budget cuts. Although 70 per cent of Student Services’ funding comes from student fees, 30 per cent comes from the University’s operating budget.
SSMU VP University Affairs Joey Shea expressed her support for the cancellation of the fee, but cautioned against taking it too positively.
“I definitely think it’s a good thing [for students]. I also think we have to be careful about thinking it’s too much of a good thing, because it should never [have been] there in the first place,” said Shea.
Dr. Vera Romano, Director of Counselling Services, said that Counselling Services welcomed the cancellation “since Counselling Services is deeply rooted in the social justice model” with respect to the services offered. Romano also added that Counselling Services places “paramount importance” on accessibility to students.
According to Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens in the press release announcing the fee change, there was a significant amount of support from students for the fee. Luker echoed this statement: “We never had any pushback from the students, they were so supportive,” she said.
Now, it is up to Student Services and the administration, along with a variety of working groups, to come up with new ways to find more money for Mental Health and Counselling Services.
“Given the pressing and growing need for these services, we will take steps to reallocate resources within Student Life and Learning and we will actually try to improve the service, even without the fee,” Dyens said in the press release. “We are hoping to keep the service open longer, in fact, and once we get the new details in place, we will make them widely known.”
However, the reallocation of resources will be through “nickel-and-diming” or innovative initiatives, Luker said. “I just want to stress that this is not going to be at the expense of something else, because that’s not an option. And we aren’t going to go to referendum, so we’re not going to find another way to make students pay more, because that’s the whole point, is getting away from that. I think it’s really about more creative ideas.”
The 15 or 16 session cap for Counselling and Mental Health Services, respectively, will remain in place. “Obviously it’s the same thing: no one would be denied further treatment [… but] we’re going to try and maintain a sort of short-term therapy model without being limiting,” Luker said, adding that the average person usually only had around six sessions.
“We think that if there’s the goal and people know that, they’ll be working with the clinicians towards that goal,” Luker added.
According to the press release, the future of additional funding for Mental Health and Counselling Services will be discussed at the joint meeting of Senate and Board of Governors on November 12.

Environmental advocates discuss going green in an election year
In light of the upcoming Montreal municipal elections on November 3, two prominent local environmental groups held a public meeting on September 18 at l’Église Notre-Dame de la Salette to discuss environmental crises in the greater Montreal region and their prominence – or lack thereof – in the current electoral agenda.
The public discussion began with the ongoing project of creating a greenbelt in the greater Montreal region. A greenbelt is typically defined as protected green space or park that can include forest, wetlands, marshes, and meadows, and that helps keep an urban area such as Montreal pollution-free.
Les Partenaires du Parc Écologique de l’Archipel de Montréal (PPÉAM) – in English, “Partners of the Montreal Archipelago Ecological Park Project” – is an environmental group and coalition working to promote a greenbelt since 2007.
In 2011, the Green Coalition participated in public consultations with the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal (CMM). The Coalition submitted a request that the CMM’s Land Use and Development Plan (PMAD) include the creation and protection of a greenbelt. After 400 groups filed briefs in support, CMM ultimately added the goal of a greenbelt to the PMAD’s outline.
Additionally, the PMAD calls for the conservation of 17 per cent of greater Montreal to maintain biodiversity. But Sylvia Oljemark, founding president of the Green Coalition, noted the PMAD’s slow pace.
“We are in 2013 and there is still not a hell of a lot of movement in this plan,” she told The Daily. “Without the greenbelt, there will just be condos as far as you can see.”
In her opinion, many of those condos are unneeded. “To me, that’s only a proliferation of greed,” Oljemark said.
David Fletcher, the vice president of the Green Coalition, added to the conversation by criticizing municipal candidates for a perceived lack of concern for natural spaces.
“[Excluding Projet Montréal], the other electoral candidates in Montreal, with embarrassingly few natural spaces left, have made no mention of a conservation imperative in their platform, and we have heard nothing favourable from Laval candidates either,” Fletcher said.
Fletcher also pushed the need for a green agenda in the upcoming elections.
“We have [the] power to make an impression on the people that govern us and on the people that now seek to govern us,” he continued. “It is clearly very important that we now talk [about] this issue of preserving [natural spaces], and ensure that it becomes part of the political dialogue between now and election day. We need to make sure that it is resounding enough that all of the parties of the provincial level hear the message.”
Other members of the Green Coalition and environmental activists expressed their own concerns, such as the ongoing controversy over the condo development that will potentially destroy Parc Oxygène in the Milton-Parc neighbourhood.
In 2008, a change in zoning laws to allow development on the land put Parc Oxygène – a small green space maintained by Milton-Parc residents – in danger. The Milton-Park Community, the local co-owners’ association, has fought to save the space ever since.
Norman Nawrocki, a resident and active member of the Milton-Park Community, told The Daily that the CMM – which heads up the Land Use and Development Plan – the city council, and a member of Projet Montréal, Alex Norris, all promised to help, but the public had yet to see any tangible results.
“We are still fighting by ourselves – up until two weeks ago,” he said. “Two weeks ago, they decided it was time to take action. Two weeks ago, after four years of non-stop activity by citizens in the neighbourhood, looking for the support of Projet Montréal to back us up against a developer.”
Norris said during the meeting, “What we did upon taking office was to seek assurances that the land will be protected, and we obtained those assurances.”
“Our responsibility is not only to protect green spaces, but also to manage our budget,” he added.
Fletcher ultimately emphasized the holistic nature of environmental reform.
“We’ve all been redefined socially as consumers and workers, there is no other definition for us. We need to stop looking at ourselves that way, we need to start looking at ourselves as valuable human beings that have other dimensions that need to be fulfilled,” Fletcher said. “Green has to stop meaning green bags, and has to start meaning what is in the heart and soul of each one of us, but what we have been deprived of for so long. And that is the opportunity to get out into the nature. […] We’re living in a place for termites and rats, not for people.”
At the end of the meeting, the attendees decided on a declaration of intent, and planned a follow-up meeting to create more elaborate plans for spreading their message and seeking public support.
