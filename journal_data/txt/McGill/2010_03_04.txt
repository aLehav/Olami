Editors resign as paper campaigns for fee levy in referendum
Ten editors at the McGill Tribune resigned at midnight Monday to help run the newspaper’s fee levy campaign in the winter term referendum. According to SSMU electoral by-laws, editorial staff of major campus publications or on-air personalities must resign during the election period.
The weeklong resignation has been a headache for publication, but editor-in-chief Thomas Quail, who resigned last week, said the newspaper’s greater concern is whether or not students will approve their proposed $3 non-opt-outable fee.
The Tribune is currently supported by funds provided by SSMU, but was mandated two years ago by the Society to become independent by January 2010. The fee levy will allow the newspaper to support itself after independence.
“A ‘No’ vote means you support the cessation of the publication of the McGill Tribune. It’s a referendum on how valuable the Tribune is as a student service,” Quail said.
The date was later pushed back to September 2010 in order to provide the newspaper with more time to plan for the change.
According to Quail, the newspaper’s move to independence was motivated both by concerns over a conflict of interest, since the newspaper reports on SSMU while also depending on the Society for funding, and the fact that SSMU is legally responsible for the newspaper.
“If we publish something legally libelous or slanderous, we are not accountable for our actions,” Quail said, noting that legal costs would come out of the SSMU budget. “If we’re sued that threatens club funding.”
The mandate for independence was originally dictated by SSMU without consulting the Tribune editorial board. However, Quail said that the publication is now looking forward to the change.
“It’s a valuable, natural step for a newspaper that’s 30 years old. The best papers across Canada are independent – and in order to do that we need to separate from SSMU,” he said.
According to Elections McGill chief electoral officer Mike Vallo the Tribune’s independence bid has run smoothly to date, though he suggested the campaign may have been unduly complicated by SSMU’s strict election laws.
“Personally I think the rules could be loosened a bit. The campaign rules are pretty narrow,” Vallo said, although he explained that universities with looser regulations have had problems containing campaigns. “We’re trying to avoid the situation at Concordia, where they have billboard trucks [for candidates],” said Vallo.
Quail said that he was informed of the bylaw that required staff to resign several weeks ago at a meeting with Elections McGill. Editors will return to their positions when the campaign period closes.

Signatories support boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israeli government
On February 25, Montreal-based Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! announced that 500 local artists had signed a declaration of support for the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against what they call Israel’s apartheid policies against Palestinians.
The statement argues that there are parallels between South Africa and Israel’s systems of segregation, and that support for the Palestinian struggle for human and civil rights should mirror the international anti-apartheid movement of the 1970s and eighties.
“A matrix of Israeli-only roads, electrified fences, and over 500 military checkpoints and roadblocks erase freedom of movement for Palestinians,” it states. “Israel’s apartheid wall, which was condemned by the International Court of Justice in 2004, cuts through Palestinian lands, further annexing Palestinian territory.”
The statement goes on to reference the Israeli military’s blockade of the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip, which has been ongoing since 2007. “Israel continues to impose collective punishment on the 1.5 million Palestinians of Gaza, who still face chronic shortages of electricity, fuel, food, and basic necessities.”
“These 500 artists signify a very critical shift in our society: a shift toward questioning in many ways the Israeli government and its policies and Canada’s support for Israel and Israel’s policy of occupation and apartheid,” said photographer and Tadamon! member Stefan Christoff.
He added that the artists are not calling for the boycott of Israel to be all-encompassing. “Is this a boycott of all Israeli artists? No. It should be on a case-by-case basis. It should target institutional structures,” he said.
The BDS movement began following a 2005 request by Palestinian civil society groups that Israel conform to international law by withdrawing from the Arab territories it annexed in 1967, and by permitting the return of Palestinian refugees to the homes they lost in 1948.
Several of the artists in attendance stated that support for the BDS movement has become necessary due in part to the Canadian government’s unwavering support for Israel.
“I think the BDS movement is something that will permit us to slowly take back the reins of control and help pull back the money that is flowing into the government that is propelling this occupation,” said Yassin Alsalman, a local hip-hop artist who goes by the anonym The Narcicyst.
Fortner Anderson, a poet who also signed the declaration, echoed Alsalman’s statement, and added that the letter should be seen as a first step in a broader, global movement.
“The 500 Montreal artists, who create the climate of ideas that we live in, have said enough is enough – something must be done,” he said. “This cannot be left to the governments because the governments are incapable of resolving the problem.”
Freda Guttman, an installation artist and Tadamon! member, said that the 500 signatures were a significant accomplishment given the pressures artists often face from their patrons.
“There are people who wanted to [sign the letter] but couldn’t to protect their jobs,” she said. “[Blacklisting] is happening more and more because Israel realizes it’s working.”
Anderson agreed that the political statements artists make can adversely affect their professional lives. “A lot of artists in Canada survive entirely off government largess, so for people to take positions like this can, for some, be of concern,” he said.
The list of signatories includes members of local bands Kalmunity Vibe Collective, Nomadic Massive, Silver Mt. Zion, and The United Steelworkers of Montreal.

Organizers defend term “apartheid,” cite South African support
The Legislative Assembly of Ontario unanimously passed a resolution condemning Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) last Thursday, taking particular issue with use of the term “apartheid” in conjunction with Israeli policy. The province’s actions have prompted Conservative MP Tim Uppal from Edmonton to announce that he will table a similar motion in the House of Commons next week.
IAW is an annual series of educational events that take place at over 40 universities and colleges around the world with an aim to “educate people about the nature of Israel as an apartheid system and to build Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns as part of a growing global BDS movement,” according to the IAW web site. Montreal’s sixth IAW begins today with events held at McGill and Concordia.
MPP Peter Shurman, who tabled the motion in Ontario, argued that the use of the term “apartheid” in relation to Israel bordered on hate speech and offended those who experienced apartheid in South Africa.
“It’s a provocatively charged word and it’s presumptive: if you say something is apartheid then, hey, it must be – there is certainly not consensus on that. If we’re talking about Israel let’s discuss it – let’s not have a one-sided diatribe about it, which is what IAW is about,” Shurman said.
According to Shurman, the resolution passed in the Ontario legislature is intended to have moral suasion, but does not prohibit the week from continuing. However,  it is likely that student organizers in Ontario will continue with the week as planned.
“It’s ironic how these politicians can find the time to condemn [IAW] and silence student activism and student voice, but they can’t find time to condemn Israeli’s crimes on and systematic oppression of the Palestinian people,” said Yafa Jarrar, member of the Students against Apartheid at Carelton University. “They are trying to systematically suppress our freedom of speech and our activism. But we will not be silenced.”
Organizers of the IAW in Montreal argued that the event is meant to be a week of open discussions and that the decision to use the term “apartheid” is based on the policies implemented in Israel that have segregated Palestinians living in the region.
“The reason we’re calling it Israeli apartheid is because it is what it is. The policies that Israel has been implementing against the Palestinian people show a systematic tendency of alienating and separating them. Apartheid means separateness, and the racially policies that Israel has passed have an unquestionable goal of segregating the Palestinians,” said Nina Amrov, a member of the IAW organizing committee and of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights– National.
Scott Weinstein from Independent Jewish Voices said there are many Jewish individuals who support IAW and are involved in organizing the week. He also explained that the term “apartheid” is intended to be provocative and spark debate – though it has not been as successful as hoped.
“[We] have begged, pleaded, and invited our counterparts in the Zionist movement to debate us…[but] they absolutely refuse. They don’t want there to be a public discussion about any profound criticism of Zionism and the nature of racism in the Jewish state,” said Weinstein. “If they would guarantee a public debate on the issue and they don’t want us to use the word apartheid, then sure, that’s not an issue – but they won’t debate with us, not yet.”
MPP Shurman warned that apartheid does not exist in Israel and that the association the term creates between Israel and the South African apartheid regime is inaccurate. “You cannot make something true just by saying it is. Just because there’s a week called Israeli Apartheid Week doesn’t support that there is apartheid in Israel – because there isn’t; apartheid has only taken place in one place, South Africa,” said Shurman.
However, supporters of IAW were quick to point out that “apartheid” is a term that has been used to describe Israel by many individuals involved in the fight against South African apartheid, and that Israeli policies fit the definition of apartheid as articulated by the UN International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of 1973.
Emanuel Lowi, a former editor at Haaretz in Israel who describes himself as an observant Canadian Jew, discussed the criticism of Israel by South African leaders. “The best people [to judge whether it is] apartheid are the people in South Africa who fought against apartheid. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has come out very strongly against Israel. [Tutu said that] what Israel has been doing to the Palestinian people in many ways is not only reminiscent of South Africa, but is worse than it. Nelson Mandela has come out against the Israeli’s treatment of Palestinians,” said Lowi.
Mookie Kideckel, president of Hillel McGill, pointed out that Jewish students on campus often feel singled out and targeted by talks of Israeli apartheid. “Israel is a democratic country; it’s made a lot of efforts for peace. It’s also something that’s emotionally tied to the majority of Jewish students,” Kideckel said. “By seeking to delegitimize Israel, [IAW] effectively makes a lot of Jewish students feel delegitimized. A lot of the agony and fear from the week comes from the idea that it really obsessively singles out Israel, and makes a lot of Jewish students connected to it feel singled out unfairly.”
Lowi tried to address the fears that Jewish students are experiencing. “The students who are scared, they have to think about what it is they should do to protect our people from being discredited by being associated to despicable acts committed in our names [by the Israeli government], and it is to speak out against it,” said Lowi.
