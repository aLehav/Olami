McGill administration claims methodology is flawed 
The Liberal government of Jean Charest neglected to divulge a 2011 study questioning the existence of university underfunding in Quebec. The study, which was leaked last week by the Parti Québécois (PQ) government, said that Quebec universities received 2 per cent more in tuition per student than the Canadian average.
In an email to The Daily, Vice-Principal (External Relations) Olivier Marcil claimed that the report’s methodology was flawed.
“[The report] does not focus on the activities most directly affecting students and their learning experience,” Marcil wrote. “Quebec universities have lower per-student funding and spending on operations, which funds the things that students and professors are asking for.”
Between 2008 and 2009, the Quebec government spent $29,242 per student compared to $26,383 in Ontario, according to the report.
With a lower cost of living and a different teaching system, Quebec universities invest 4 per cent more than institutions elsewhere in Canada.
“The total funding per student (revenue), however, is lower, and funding is a better measure of underfunding than spending,” wrote Marcil.
A previous study in 2010 reported that revenues for Quebec universities were $27,628 per student, compared with the Canadian average of $28,282 – a difference of around 2 per cent.
Marcil added that the Council of Ontario Universities and a 2010 study by the Conférence des recteurs et des principaux du Québec (CREPUQ) showed that Quebec universities were “indeed underfunded.”
Martine Desjardins, the president of the Fédération étudiante du universitaire Québec (FEUQ), told The Daily that the leaked 2011 study discredited the notion of university underfunding.
“It confirms what we’ve been denouncing for a while, and that [the government] must redo its calculations,” she said in French.
As for the CREPUQ study, Desjardins claimed that the study was flawed, and that the former principal of the Université de Montréal had denounced the document for its “lack of rigour.”
“In fact, we pay far more by student [in Quebec], and they have more money than in the rest of Canada,” said Desjardins.
In an email to The Daily, SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser said that the study’s results were not a surprise.
“I find it interesting that this is coming out now as a new thing, when some of this information was already available during the strike,” wrote Reid-Fraser. “However, it certainly does bring in to question what the motivation was behind the tuition hike from the Liberals all along, if their own commissioned study was telling them these things.”
The leak came days after Quebec Premier Pauline Marois and Minister of Higher Education Pierre Duchesne called into question the notion of university underfunding in Quebec. Last Thursday, Marois released another document that emphasized the government’s financial contribution to the university system.
CREPUQ Director General Daniel Zizian told Le Devoir that he was disappointed by the announcement and that it was not true that university underfunding had “suddenly disappeared by magic.”

Dean’s appointment discussed
The University’s Post- Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held their monthly council meeting at the Macdonald campus last Wednesday, which discussed the appointment of a new Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning), the local education summit the Society will be hosting in early December, and the Society’s relationship to the Legal Information Clinic (LIC) at McGill.
Council entered into a Committee of the Whole to discuss, along with three representatives sent from the LIC, the status of graduate students at the Clinic.
Graduate students pay a $2 fee every semester to the Clinic – undergraduates pay a $3.50 fee – and are entitled to all of their services, including information and advocacy.
PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney told The Daily, “[PGSS’] real question to them was to what extent, and in what ways can graduate students participate in the governance of the Legal Information Clinic,” he said. “Can we go to your general meetings? Can we vote? Can we see a copy of your financial statements? Can we get a copy of your bylaws?”
According to Mooney, the Clinic has agreed to address the questions of the PGSS executive and appears to be making good faith efforts toward better delineating the relationship between the two organizations.
Council also approved the Executive Committee’s proposal for the McGill education summit that PGSS committed to hosting at their council session in September.
According to PGSS External Affairs Officer Errol Salamon, the summit is meant as a preparation for the provincial summit slated for the spring, but it is also meant as “an alternative summit,” where issues germane to McGill will be tackled.
The proposal outlined the five themes that the summit will revolve around, which include the question of underfunding, international and out-of-province students, tuition, public-private partnerships, and the role of teaching, research, and support staff at the University.
Salamon cited the public-private partnership theme as being of particular importance in the McGill context.
“There has been a lot of unrest on campus at least in the past year or so concerning public-private partnership with regard to food services, securitization on campus, particularly following last year’s events on November 10,” he said.
The first part of the two-day summit – which will most likely take place in the first week of December – will be dedicated to public panels, according to Mooney.
“So you have these studies that come from various different groups saying that universities are underfunded, that they aren’t. We want to actually get those groups together […] explain why they think they are or aren’t, and then let students and faculty members question them. Ask them: why are you making these assumptions?” he explained.
Confirmed participants include members of the administration, representatives from the Fédération étudiante du universitaire Québec, as well as representatives from l’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante.
Council entered into a Committee of the Whole to discuss the position of the Deputy Provost following a motion brought forward by Members Services Officer Elizabeth Cawley, who is also one of the two students sitting on the advisory committee choosing the candidates considered for the position.
“This is such an important administrator for student views, I really wanted to get the PGSS’ opinions about what qualities and characteristics they felt should be taken into consideration,” she said.
Discussion lingered on the personality of the ideal candidate, rather than on background, and in a phone interview with The Daily, Cawley spoke to the difficulty in gauging something such as personal characteristics, but nonetheless underlined the importance of soliciting as many student perspectives as possible.
“I think everybody thinks it’s a difficult position, and there’s a general anxiety about who this new person is going to be but I haven’t heard enough people’s opinions about it,” she said.

SSMU has begun a campus-wide consultation process in preparation of the upcoming summit on higher education, planned by the provincial government for the spring.
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser has been meeting informally with faculty association executives, and plans to hold a series of strategic summits open to the entire University community in the upcoming weeks.
Reid-Fraser has also been in talks with the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) about the upcoming summit they will be hosting in early December.
The provincial government has released few details regarding its summit’s program. At the last SSMU Council meeting, councillors outlined the themes they hoped would be addressed in their internal consultations, as well as at the summit itself.
These themes include tuition fees and alternatives, research, financial aid and student debt, university governance, the role of university in society, out-of-province and international student needs, anglophone students in Quebec, quality of education, and structural barriers to postsecondary education.
“After last year, it seemed like people were pretty divided around the strike and the hike, or there were people that didn’t seem to engage with that particular issue,” said Reid-Fraser. “So I’m hoping this will be a broad enough range of issues that there will be people that haven’t participated in the past.”
Following the consultation process, recommendations will be brought to Council and sent out to faculty associations for feedback. Reid-Fraser plans to submit a preliminary reflection document to the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) – the provincial student federation that represents SSMU members – by December.
“Relating to quality of education, classroom sizes seem to be of particular concern,” added Reid-Fraser. “I’ve already heard back from a couple of faculties that this is something they would like to see brought up.”

On Friday, the Macdonald Campus Graduate Student Society (MCGSS) voted to separate from the Macdonald campus’ undergraduate society and remain only a member of the downtown Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS).
The referendum passed with 176 in favour, four against, and four abstaining. 184 out of 563 Macdonald campus graduate students voted, representing a turnout of 32.7 per cent.
As a result of the referendum, the Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS) will contact the Deputy Provost’s office and ask them not to collect fees from graduate students at the Macdonald campus for the Winter 2013 semester and future semesters, according to PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney.
Next semester, MCGSS students will pay $60.91 in fees, the same amount as all other graduate students downtown, according to MCGSS President Lucy Lu. This represents a decrease of $51.75 for full-time students, $44.25 for part-time students, $51.75 for half-time students, and $36.75 for additional session students.
“We expect it to go through with no problems,” Mooney told The Daily. “We have a pretty clear contract with MCSS about what the obligations of MCGSS and MCSS are given this outcome.”
“Theirs are to go forward and contact the Deputy Provost to cancel the fees and to announce that they no longer consider graduate students to be part of MCSS. Our obligation is to work with [MCSS] to finalize the contract for services that MCSS will continue to provide to graduate students so that the situation at Mac campus won’t change,” he added.
Mooney said that the negotiations for the contract with MCSS are still in progress, but that both parties will be meeting this evening to continue work. They expect to have the contract finalized by the Winter 2013 semester.
“I really appreciate how cooperative MCSS has been through this whole process,” Lu told The Daily. “I look forward to working with them and PGSS to finalize an agreement regarding the terms of separation.”

Bill C-31 eliminates coverage for certain refugee categories
The Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) at McGill organized a panel last Thursday entitled “Stop the Cuts!” regarding budget cuts and changes to the Conservative government’s Interim Federal Health Programme (IFHP), which provides temporary healthcare coverage for refugees.
According to the IFHP website, the program applies to those who “are not eligible for provincial or territorial health insurance plans and where a claim cannot be made under private health insurance,” including “resettled refugees, refugee claimants, certain persons detained under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and other specified groups.”
However, the program saw significant changes with Bill C-31, “Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act” – called by some the “punishing refugees act” – which was passed in June and eliminated health coverage for certain refugees.
Under the new IFHP changes, the Federal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has the right to deem some countries “safe.”  Asylum-seekers and refugees coming from those countries designated as safe do not have access to the program’s health coverage – even if urgent. This can only be overridden in the case of a medical condition that poses a threat to the public health of Canada.
Those from “non-designated countries of origin” will have access to medical care – provided it is urgent – but will not have any access to medication and vaccination unless the medical condition poses a public health danger.
No dental, vision, or psychological medical care will be provided to any refugees.
Thursday’s panel included presentations by members of organizations such as the Health Justice Collective, Doctors of the World, and Solidarity Across Borders, all of whom have been involved in actions against the federal cuts.
For Degane Sougal, QPIRG Internal Coordinator and panel presenter, the main aim of the panel was to address the question, “How do these cuts affect migrant communities?” – a question which, according to Sougal, “many believe has been neglected from mainstream media and Minister Kenney.”
In an email to The Daily, Sougal explained, “the government has justified these cuts by saying it will save taxpayers money and that refugees will still be getting the ‘same care’ as Canadians, even with the cuts to the IFHP.”
The panel questioned these claims, engaging panellists with expertise in the field such as healthcare workers, community organizers, and those who are from migrant communities or work directly with them.
According to speaker Samir Shaheen-Hussain of the Health Justice Collective, the Conservative government is pandering to a certain group of people in their electorate that have rigid positions on immigration.
He also called Bill C-31 “hypocritical,” saying that it would actually contribute to the conditions that cause many people to migrate in the first place.
In defence of Bill C-31, the government has claimed that most claimant refugees present invalid cases.
Janet Cleveland, a researcher at McGill and speaker at the panel, admitted that some could be abusing the system, but said that the government was inaccurately attempting to portray all refugee claimants to be illegal.
According to Naheed Dosani and Ritika Goel, who wrote an article on the cuts for the website Healthy Debate, the program changes will worsen health outcomes for refugees and could even cause threats for Canadians – as in the case of tuberculosis, which is not considered a public threat until after diagnosis.
Cleveland supported this with another example, citing cases where suicidal people are unable to get medication until their tendencies become homicidal, endangering not only their own lives but those of others as well.

City seeks to strengthen animal protection laws
About 200 abandoned pets found new homes the last weekend of October at the Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The SPCA called the weekend “Operation Adoption,” a project in collaboration with the City of Montreal to encourage new pet owners to adopt animals from shelters rather than pet stores.
“We look forward to the day when it is no longer necessary to have large animal shelters caring for homeless and neglected animals,” read a press release from Montreal SPCA Executive Director Nicholas Gilman.
However, it is unclear whether the weekend-long adoption campaign will significantly address problems of overpopulation and mistreatment of domestic animals.
Quebec was singled out as “the best province to be an animal abuser” in a study published by the Animal Legal Defense Fund this year, based on a number of criteria including standards of basic care for domestic animals and punishment for animal abuse.
In April 2011, an investigation by Radio-Canada’s program Enquête did an exposé on Berger Blanc, Montreal’s largest for-profit animal shelter. Reporters uncovered widespread mistreatment of animals and euthanization by non-veterinarians, which can lead to unnecessarily slow and painful deaths.
The Montreal SPCA runs a non-profit animal shelter. Director of Development Anthony Johnson claimed that Berger Blanc’s for-profit status was the root of its problems.
“We believe that for-profit pounds have a negative impact because they rely on overpopulation to continue to profit, and so are not part of the solution to animal care and control,” Johnson told The Daily.
In the aftermath of the exposé on Berger Blanc, the municipal government made a concerted effort to change the city’s reputation regarding animal welfare.
Currently, animal protection laws vary among the 19 neighbourhoods of Montreal. The mayor’s office has proposed a standardized bylaw for all of the neighbourhoods, which they have not yet approved.
According to Martine Painchaud, the press officer for the mayor’s office, “Each borough is responsible for animal control. They each have their own bylaw, some with the best practices, some not. The city of Montreal worked with the experts and the boroughs to harmonize the bylaw so that we offer the opportunity to every borough to adopt this bylaw, which is based on the best practices, some of which are already in place.”
“Our goal is to harmonize the bylaws so that every borough will have the same bylaw in terms of animal control,” she continued.
The city has also commissioned a new animal refuge, scheduled to open in 2014.
Painchaud believes that the existence of a government-run shelter will do much to resolve Montreal’s problems with domestic animal overpopulation and abandonment.
“We have a big problem in Montreal: all the animal shelters are full. We want to create a municipal animal shelter managed by the city because we want to respond to the needs of Montreal in terms of the control and well-being of animals,” she explained in French. “It will be an integrated centre where all services will be provided: animal control, veterinary services, and a service for animal well-being.”
Johnson praised the city’s initiative in planning a municipal animal shelter and standardizing the city’s bylaws on animal protection.
“The city has got to take the lead in animal care and control,” he said. “I think there are a lot of really good side effects that occur because the city is taking the lead. I don’t believe that the city taking a step forward and creating a best-practices and humane approach to animal care and control will be a negative for those of us who every day are working to make the city better for animals.”
Julie Desgagnés, the communications representative at the Animal Rescue Network (ARN), argued that the city might more effectively accomplish its goal by funding smaller animal shelters like the ARN and helping them expand.
The ARN is entirely volunteer-run. According to its website, it is “the largest no-kill shelter in Montreal.’
“We are glad they want to build [the government-run animal shelter],” said Desgagnés. “It’s important that a city like Montreal takes care of that problem, because there is a problem of overpopulation of animals. But there are existing solutions that need money, and with that money you could really help [an association like the ARN].”
However, even if the city of Montreal’s planned changes solve the problem of domestic animal abandonment, there still remains the fact that most Canadian animal protection laws – and those in Quebec in particular – are restricted to the protection of domestic animals.
Leiba Feldman, president of McGill’s Student Animal Legal Defense Fund, attributed the lack of legislation protecting non-domestic animals to a general ignorance about the well-being of animals that people don’t encounter on a regular basis.
“In general, there’s a focus in legislation on what people hear about and what they know,” she told The Daily. “We know our domestic animals, but sometimes people disconnect themselves from other kinds of animals. Because of this disconnect, there are less laws to protect them.”
