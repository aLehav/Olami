People’s Climate Tour precedes upcoming march in New York City
In preparation for the People’s Climate March on September 21 in New York City, which is projected to be the largest climate march in history, the People’s Climate Tour came to Montreal on September 3.
The event was organized by Divest McGill, Divest Concordia, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Concordia Student Union (CSU), and international environmental organization 350.org, featuring talks from two guest speakers: Ellen Gabriel, a human rights activist from Kanehsatà:ke, and 350.org founder Bill McKibben. The speakers explored issues related to the fossil fuel industry, such as the contamination of natural resources and the disproportionate effect of climate change on people of colour.
SSMU VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette opened the talk by connecting the issue of sustainability to broader social justice issues, speaking from her experience at a conference on climate justice in the Philippines. Moustaqim-Barrette said that “doing migrant justice work is a form of climate justice work,” as people are often displaced by climate change and subsequently migrate to places, like Canada, where they are likely to be taken advantage of by migrant worker programs.
In the speeches, Gabriel focused on Indigenous views and practices for sustainability, while McKibben focused on the scientific proof of the damaging effects of climate change. Both speakers outlined the necessity of immediate action in order to combat these issues.
“Indigenous groups,” Gabriel said, “have criticized the way colonizing peoples have been treating the earth long before scientists discovered problems associated with unsustainable extraction practices.”
Gabriel also condemned political leaders such as Stephen Harper, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush for encouraging environmentally damaging extraction methods, such as fracking and pipeline projects. “It is the role of government to protect the people; it is not the role of the government to trample on the rights of the people. It is the role of government to always be the one to look out if there is any danger for the people. And they have failed you, miserably.”
Jon Milton, an audience member and student at Champlain Regional College St. Lambert, echoed these criticisms of how politicians have dealt with climate justice to The Daily after the event. “Indigenous treaty rights are some of the only legal mediums for environmental defense, after Stephen Harper gutted the environmental regulations of Canada.”
Gabriel concluded on an apologetic note, acknowledging the fact that it is the current generation of young people who will have to grapple with issues left by the detrimental practices of the past, and urged the audience to instill immediate change.
According to McKibben, scientists sounded the alarm bells about climate change 25 years ago and have shown that, in particular, Canada will be severely affected by climate change since it is so close to the disappearing ice of the Arctic.
“They told us that was going to happen, and nobody did anything – none of our leaders, none of our systems reacted the way that you would think that they would,” said McKibben.
He said that 350.org was founded in response to the need to heed these warnings at a grassroots level. The organization aims to bring all people together, but especially those with less power – such as young people and the economically disadvantaged – in a collective manner that will be much more effective than people trying to create change individually.
While the event was popular – tickets sold out – it did not conclude without criticism. A member of the audience interrupted McKibben during the talk. The audience member criticized the way that the People’s Climate Tour is being run, citing a lack of Indigenous involvement and overrepresentation of “zionist organizations which are [carrying out] the genocide of Palestinian people.”
McKibben responded by recognizing the importance of Indigenous involvement, saying that it has been an important aspect of how 350.org has been organizing, and added that it will take everyone working together in order to combat climate change.

McGill, Concordia linguists partner to help develop educational tools
Not all McGill research happens at McGill. Since Fall 2011, the Listuguj Mi’gmaq community has been the site of the Mi’gmaq Research Partnership (MRP), a joint venture between the linguistics departments at McGill and Concordia and the Listuguj community. The project aims to bring linguists, their students, and Mi’gmaq community members together to develop a deeper understanding of the disappearing Mi’gmaq language.
The MRP originally began as LING 415: Field Methods of Linguistics, a joint undergraduate and graduate course taught by Professor Jessica Coon in McGill’s linguistics department. This type of course is meant to provide students with the opportunity to analyze a language with which they have no familiarity. Janine Metallic, a PhD candidate in McGill’s integrated studies in education department and a native Mi’gmaq speaker from Listuguj, was brought in as a language consultant for the class.
“[Language] is an important part of identity; it is part of belonging to a community.”
– Janine Metallic,  Mi’gmaq language consultant and PhD candidate
Metallic emphasized that the project was a partnership from the beginning. “During one of our first meetings I asked if [findings from the class] could go back into the community, because I knew that in the community, there’s this renewed interest in teaching the language and having more speakers,” Metallic told The Daily in an interview.
Carol Rose Little, a McGill alumnus who participated in the field course during her undergrad, noted that Metallic’s expectation of community involvement was very clear from the beginning, and that this led to the class being memorable. “I think that’s one of the big differences [about the MRP]. A lot of the time in field methods classes you just do a project and you do a class and [you get] a grade. It doesn’t go back to the community,” said Little.
After the first session of the course, the students presented their findings to the Listuguj community, and were subsequently asked back to continue their research. Currently, the project is developing educational tools to aid Listuguj teachers in teaching Mi’gmaq in schools, and to make it easier for others to learn the language. The MRP has a wiki site that covers the basic linguistic structures of Mi’gmaq, as well as a webpage that has flashcards and information about summer language workshops.
Metallic said that the struggle to keep Mi’gmaq alive is rooted in a colonial legacy, particularly the community’s experience with residential schools.
“The majority of our [Mi’gmaq] speakers are actually in their late fifties, their sixties, and older. […] There were policies back in the 60s and 70s that prevented people from learning the language. We have some residential school survivors in the community who also were not allowed to speak their language when they were taken to residential schools, and due to various factors the language was kind of lost along the way.”
Canada was home to over eighty residential schools, the last of which only closed in 1996. Indigenous children were forcibly taken from their parents, homes, and communities, and placed in schools where they were not permitted to speak their language, wear traditional clothing, or participate in their cultural practices. Abuse was exceptionally common – the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada estimates that over 4,100 children died in these schools, and the trauma caused by this violence and cultural deprivation is still evident in many Indigenous communities today.
“There’s a really common misconception that a lot of Indigenous languages have gradually fallen out of use because people lost interest. But that is really not [what] happened,” Coon told The Daily. “At least in a lot of parts of North America, this was a really concerted effort by different groups in Canada to get rid of the language[s].”
“It would be nice if other people who are doing academic work at McGill [could] think a little bit about the real-world impact that their research can be having.”
– Michael Hamilton, PhD candidate
involved with MRP
According to Metallic, the Listuguj community has found a new generational interest in preserving Mi’gmaq. “[Language] is an important part of identity; it is part of belonging to a community. Now, as people are having their own children, they’re thinking about ‘Oh, I don’t have this language to pass on now,’ but they want to be able to.”
This shift in appreciation for Mi’gmaq opens the door for possible applications of the MRP. Metallic emphasized that the Listuguj community is not relying on the MRP to preserve the Mi’gmaq language, but that it does offer ways to help the process. While the project is very active in providing support for language teachers in Listuguj schools, it also has potential to promote use of the language outside of the classroom.
Little told The Daily that Mi’gmaq is becoming more popular on social media, especially among young people. “There is this whole #speakmigmaq movement going on right now which is great to see. Hopefully [speakers] will carry whatever words they have learned on social media in their daily lives, and actually start speaking it on a daily basis.”
The Listuguj Mi’gmaq language program has a very active Twitter account, sharing a “word of the day” and encouraging people to #speakmigmaq. It has also been part of a larger social media conversation about preserving both Mi’gmaq in particular and Indigenous languages in general.
According to Metallic, casual use of the language is key to its survival. “We can learn a lot through classes and having [Mi’gmaq] as part of a program in school, but in the end we need to hear the language in the community – at this point, we don’t hear it as much.”
Coon echoed the sentiment, noting that a lack of common usage of the language is one of the biggest obstacles for someone trying to learn Mi’gmaq. “If you’re learning a language like Spanish, you can go to Mexico and spend a semester there,” Coon said. “A challenge for endangered languages is that there isn’t somewhere you can go and be immersed as easily.”
The MRP has continued over three years because of its reciprocal relationship with the Listuguj community. However, this type of project is not the norm in linguistics or academia in general.
Michael Hamilton, a PhD candidate in McGill’s linguistic studies department who has been working on the MRP since 2011, described the research practices the MRP hoped to avoid. “We call them parachute linguists – they go in and they get their data, they pay a couple of people, and then they just leave and that’s it. The community doesn’t know what happened with the data and there is no giving back to the community at all.”
Metallic agreed that cooperative projects were more rare. “I think it just takes some imagination to come up with a project that would suit both researchers and community members and to work collaboratively,” she told The Daily.
Hamilton also commented on the direction researchers should take at McGill. “It would be nice if other people who are doing academic work at McGill [could] think a little bit about the real-world impact that their research can be having,” he said.

Members vote in new VP Finance, discuss National Aboriginal Day
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Legislative Council met for its first meeting of the academic year on September 3. During the meeting, executive members and Arts Senators updated Council on their work over the summer break. Council also approved several AUS staff hirings, voted in Li Xue as the new VP Finance, and reacted to a rejection of a request to fly the Hiawatha Belt Flag on National Aboriginal Day from the Secretariat, McGill’s governance office.
In their report to Council, Arts Senators Jacob Greenspon and Kareem Ibrahim gave a follow-up on two motions that the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council approved at its April 10 meeting. The motions mandated SSMU to endorse the moving of the Hochelaga Rock, which commemorates the Iroquois settlement that used to exist at McGill’s current grounds, to a more prominent location, and the flying of the Hiawatha Belt Flag, a symbol of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, on National Aboriginal Day. SSMU’s support was to be expressed to members of the administration. 
According to Greenspon’s and Ibrahim’s report, the Secretariat rejected McGill’s Work Group on Aboriginal Affairs’ proposal to fly the Hiawatha Belt Flag on National Aboriginal Day. It justified its rejection by stating that, “People feel that we should more fully consider this request in the context of other community members who may have a similar interest in celebrating a particular group or tradition.”
AUS VP Social Kyle Rouhani addressed the Secretariat’s decision before Council. “The University has no problem changing the flag for when a representative of the crown comes, but was really, really reluctant to change the flag for the nation whose lands we are on.”
In an email to The Daily, AUS President Lucy Ava Liu suggested that the Secretariat’s decision was not the end of the AUS’ involvement with the issue. “I think it is an issue that will definitely engage a number of Arts students, especially following last year’s recently approved Indigenous Studies minor. I think this topic may be brought up again at AUS Council in the future, potentially in the form of a motion by an AUS councillor.”
Council’s most time-sensitive issue on the agenda was replacing AUS VP Finance Kateryn Kim, who resigned from the position for personal and family reasons. On August 22, a memo was sent out to members of AUS eligible to run for the executive that instructed them to prepare a letter of intent and a presentation for the September 3 Council meeting, should they be interested in running for the vacant position. 
According to its constitution, AUS Council is required to appoint a replacement for the VP Finance position from amongst its members or from an official committee at its Legislative Council meeting. If deemed necessary by Council, the new VP Finance would temporarily occupy their position until a by-election is held.
The two candidates who ran for the position were Dan Rozenblum, VP Communications of the Society of Undergraduate Mathematics Students (SUMS), and Xue, an Economics and Computer Science double major, who was on the AUS Financial Management Council last year.
Xue won in a secret ballot vote at the meeting over Rozenblum 25-15, with two abstentions.
However, Council deemed it unnecessary to hold a by-election. As such, Xue was appointed as VP Finance, rather than as interim VP Finance, and no further elections will be held.
Kim expressed her support for a swift appointment rather than appointing an interim VP Finance until a by-election would be held. 
Kim stated that it took about a month to get used to the tasks of the job – an interim would only be fully operational at the time the by-election took place, and the process of retraining would have to begin. 
Kim told The Daily that she was feeling confident in Xue’s appointment. “This job is very operational, so you learn as you go along, and once you get the hang of the operation, it’s just time management skills,” Kim stated.

SSMU Council to revise contingency budget regardless of result
Finding itself under severe budgetary constraints, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) will once again seek approval of the University Centre building fee in the Fall 2014 referendum, it having been rejected by students in the Winter 2014 referendum. The fee was introduced to pay rent and utilities costs for the Shatner building, which have increased almost twofold in virtue of the lease agreement signed by McGill and SSMU last March. The signing of the lease, which covers a ten-year period from 2011 to 2021, followed almost four years of negotiations.
The non-opt-outable fee levy proposed in the Winter referendum amounted to $6.08 and $3.04 per semester for full-time and part-time students respectively, increasing at a yearly rate of 5.6 per cent to cover planned increases in costs. For the Fall referendum, the fee has been slightly lowered to adjust for an increase in the number of students.
Having approved the question in February, SSMU Council did not form a ‘yes’ committee to campaign for the fee in preparation of the Winter referendum. The referendum question failed to pass, with 53.6 per cent of students voting against levying the new fee.
Since its constitution forbids it from running a deficit, SSMU was forced to come up with a contingency budget, which included a reduction in building hours, an increase in fees for SSMU Mini Courses, and cuts to the personal budgets of SSMU executives (though not their salaries). At its last meeting of the year on April 10, Council approved the budget and resolved to ask the building fee question again in the Fall referendum.
According to VP Finance and Operations Kathleen Bradley, the contingency budget will be in effect until October, at which point Council will be revising the budget regardless of the result of the referendum.
Bradley added that the contingency budget is not financially sustainable in the long run because it stops the yearly transfers of $50,000 to SSMU’s Capital Expenditures Reserve Fund. This fund is used for long-term projects such as the renovation of Gerts and the opening of the student-run cafe.
“If the building fee question doesn’t pass, we will continue to be unable to make that transfer, which is seriously going to impact our ability to maintain the building, to improve the building, [and to] make long-term renovations,” Bradley explained.
In an interview with The Daily, President Courtney Ayukawa emphasized the necessity of informing students on the importance of the fee. “I think my big thing on this is really ensuring that everyone has the information made public and accessible to them so that people can make an educated and informed vote,” she said.
Ayukawa went on to note that many students regretted their vote in the Winter referendum once they were more informed about the issue.
“Unfortunately, in the time following last year’s referendum not passing […] I received a lot of feelings of regret from a lot of people around the campus. Right now, I really want to make sure people know what they’re voting for this time, and if […] it doesn’t pass, then at least I know that people made an informed vote,” Ayukawa added. 
Ayukawa further explained that there is nothing in SSMU’s bylaws that would prevent it from asking a referendum question that has already failed.
“Something that would not allow for us to re-ask the question is a moratorium period, which is basically this idea that if something does not pass, it cannot be asked within one year,” said Ayukawa. “That currently is nonexistent in our constitution.”
When asked about the University’s course of action in the event that the budget question fails to pass for a second time, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens said, “I am not going to comment on things that may or may not happen. […] We don’t want to comment one way or another and unduly influence the [referendum].”
Although certain Canadian universities, such as the University of British Columbia, lease their student union buildings for a small symbolic fee, Dyens argued that McGill’s model is fair.
“We provide SSMU with free space, which is where the offices of SSMU are located,” said Dyens. “[The] Shatner building runs commercial operations. It is on top of what the student group already receives. […] It is real estate that is expensive for the University.”
Commenting on the lease, Ayukawa noted that the current executive is not responsible for its signing.
“This legacy of the lease and the building fee not passing –  but mainly the greater lease history – is very much a thing that we’ve inherited,” said Ayukawa. “At this point we’re just trying to do our best to move forward with it, in a way that is best for all of the students on campus.”
