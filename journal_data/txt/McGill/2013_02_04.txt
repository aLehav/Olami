Harper characterized as a despot by prominent Mohawk activist
Katsi’tsakwas Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk activist, and Warren Allmand, the former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development under Pierre Trudeau, debunked myths surrounding the Idle No More movement, on Wednesday.
The event, which took place in the Leacock building, drew about fifty students, First Nations people, and other members of the Montreal community. 
The organizers, Madeleine Pawlowski, a U1 Arts student, and Chanel Fournier, a U0 Arts student, felt a need to inform people – especially students living in residence – about the Idle No More movement.
“It’s hard for someone just reading the news and the media to know what’s going on,” Fournier said. 
“This event is as much for Montreal citizens as for international students who are coming here and don’t really know what’s going on in Canadian politics,” Pawlowski told The Daily. 
The organizers and the speakers agreed that it was time for Canada to make changes. “I’m so fed up with being silenced because I am an indigenous person, and on top of that, I’m a woman,” Gabriel said.
During the two-hour talk, Allmand and Gabriel spoke about social and political roots for dissatisfaction, environmental, and cultural concerns for Aboriginal communities across Canada. 
Allmand drew on his past experience as both a Liberal Member of Parliament, and a former minister involved with Aboriginal affairs. He focused his frustration on what he saw as a long-term trend of significant misconceptions by the general Canadian public.
“Some Canadians say Indigenous people are just another minority. They’re not a minority, they were here before we arrived!” Allmand said. “All these resources in the land, all this land, belongs to another people. They offered to share it with us, but not to take it from them!”
Gabriel also addressed discrimination against Aboriginal communities in academia, the media, and the general public.
This discrimination not only stemmed from vitriolic attitudes, but from simple ignorance, Gabriel argued. 
“It’s as if we are slowly being wiped away from history, and [being] put into the museums. That’s one of the things I’m really scared of happening, that our language and our culture will one day be in the museums,” she said.
Gabriel blasted Harper for his treatment of Indigenous communities in Canada, characterizing the prime minister as a “despot” who ruled cruelly and maliciously. 
“Stephen Harper has put a price tag on the human rights of Indigenous peoples,” she said. 
She also accused the Canadian government of failing to properly atone for past sins. “Thank you for the apology for the Indian residential school system, but it has to be more than mere words. You apologized for something that is classified as genocide…. You are apologizing for saying that we were inferior to you. But where is the proof that you are sorry?”
Allmand agreed with Gabriel and noted that Canada had been the last to sign the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in 2007, and that action on these rights had yet to materialize.
“How can we [as Canadians] ask Iran, Iraq, North Korea, to live up to human rights standards, if we don’t do it ourselves?” Allmand said.
The two agreed that the issues were not new, but that pressure was building. “Enough is enough,” Gabriel said. “We have had our ancestors die, going to their graves, questioning and appealing to government with the same words that we have been using for [an entire] generation.”
Despite a history of negligence regarding Aboriginal rights, Gabriel was confident that the movement would not falter. “The government looks at us and says, ‘they’re crazy Indians, and they’re going to phase out. Idle No More is just a fad.’ And I can tell you that, maybe we’ll take a break, maybe we’ll take a rest, because you know, we’re tired of being in the cold. [But] we’re going to speak up. We’re going to speak up because we cannot stand it any more.”

Following the announcement of the departure of Travel Cuts/Voyages Campus from the Shatner building, SSMU hosted a summit to discuss space allocation in the student union building last Friday.
The “SSMU Summit on Space in the Shatner Building” – the start to a six-week-long consultation effort – featured discussions on the establishment of a student-run cafe and the financial challenge of operating infrastructure owned by McGill.
The summit opened with a presentation on the history of the SSMU building – dubbed the William Shatner University Centre in a 1992 student referendum – and the various changes that have taken place as part of student initiatives throughout the years.
Though its activities are operated by SSMU, the Shatner building is property of the University, with physical maintenance such as heating and cooling controlled by McGill’s Utilities and Energy Management.
Financial reports from 2010-2011 budgeted $187,899 for chilled water for the building’s cooling system and $145,925 for steam used for heating. The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system has not seen major changes since the building’s construction in 1965, and their costs are not directly paid for by SSMU.
In an interview with The Daily, VP Clubs & Services Allison Cooper addressed the importance of maintaining Shatner as a student space in a university system where funding is becoming increasingly limited. 
“This building is different from any other building on campus. Yes, because different executives are [elected] every year, there are many changes to the building that you don’t see in the general university system. [That] is what makes SSMU progressive,” Cooper said.
On the issue of McGill’s limited financial support for student unions, SSMU President Josh Redel commented, “There are other student unions funded by their university administrations. [The University of British Columbia] just signed a symbolic $1 contract lasting 50 years…. The fact that the SSMU [building] is owned by McGill makes it restrictive.”
SSMU also operated under a $1 symbolic contract until lease negotiations which took place in 1999 – after which the rent was raised to $100,000.
Referring to the contentious closure of the popular Architecture Café by the administration, Redel urged the attendees to question the meaning of “student-run.” 
“It’s important to ask ourselves, is there still a desire for a student cafe over another interactive space, like a student lounge where people can eat and study at the same time?” 
Redel emphasized that student-run operations should incorporate flexibility, with a vision less driven by financial profits.
He also expressed his disapproval over the discontinuation in financially unsuccessful student-operated projects: “It seems that we’re afraid of this culture of failure…You shouldn’t discontinue a student [bake] sale, for example, because they make a mistake of going, let’s say, $5,000 in red. There should be a chance to learn from those mistakes.”
Although the lease negotiations are still ongoing, SSMU looks to finalize the contract agreements by the end of Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson’s term at McGill.
Other events included a presentation on the History of the Building and Long-Term Visioning Efforts, Food in the Building, Prioritization of Room Categorization, Event Space in the Building, and Sustainability in the Building.

Students support The Daily / Le Délit
The Daily Publications Society’s (DPS) existence was ensured for another five years when it won its referendum by a resounding 76 per cent last Thursday.
A ‘Yes’ vote for the DPS means that the society is able to renew its Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the University – which dictates distribution on campus – as well as continue collecting student fees, which account for half of the DPS’s total budget.
Since 2003, the University has required independent student groups on campus such as CKUT, QPIRG, and the DPS – which publishes both The Daily and Le Délit – to hold existence referenda every five years as an indication of student support.
Voting began on January 23 with a hiccup when all 27,606 electors were sent a defective email ballot. Within an hour, DPS Chief Electoral Officer Faraz Alidina had received over 150 emails alerting him to the problem.
“I doubt it affected turnout,” he told The Daily. A corrected ballot was immediately sent out, he explained, and reminder emails were sent out to electors who had not yet voted the following Saturday and Tuesday.
Quorum was met within a few hours on the first day of voting. Ultimately, voter turnout totalled 18.8 per cent, with 5,202 votes cast.
The DPS received similar results in its last existence referendum five years ago, when 80 per cent of the 5,729 votes cast returned a ‘Yes’ vote.

More women part of 1 per cent but gender inequity persists
Statistics Canada released a new report this week that reveals a widening gap between the rich and the poor across Canada. The report showed that the median income of the top 1 per cent is 10 times higher than that of the remaining 99 per cent of filers. In 1982, the top 1 per cent was seven times richer, according to the report. 
Top income earners are also more likely to stay in the 1 per cent than they were before. 72 per cent of top income earners in 2009 remained part of the 1 per cent one year later. In 1982, that figure stood at 67 per cent. 
Quebec faces a similar situation, according to an analysis by the Institut de recherche et d’informations socio-économique (IRIS), a progressive think-tank. They have reported that the richest 1 per cent of Quebecers have seen their income rise by 59.3 per cent from 1982 to 2010. By comparison, the median income for the poorest 50 per cent of Quebecers has increased by 16.6 per cent during the same period. 
“Quebec shows some relative stability during periods of [economic] crisis, which can be attributed to its social safety that is stronger than in other provinces,” Simon Tremblay-Pepin, a researcher with IRIS, told The Daily in French. “But at the same time, inequalities [between the rich and the poor] have been on the rise.” 
“Unless there are significant political changes, these [inequalities] will persist,” he added. 
More worrisome, Tremblay-Pepin said, is the fact that the share of federal and provincial tax paid by the richest one per cent fell to 21.2 per cent, down from a peak of 23.3 per cent in 2007. 
“In Quebec, like in Canada, investment in private businesses has also remained stagnant,” Tremblay-Peppin added. “It’s hard to say that lowered tax rates for the richest benefited [the poorest] in our society.” 
The Statistics Canada report also revealed that a greater number of women are now part of the top 1 per cent of income earners. The figure almost doubled from 11 per cent in 1982 to 21 per cent in 2010. 
In an interview with The Daily, Gabrielle Bouchard, the Peer Support and Trans Advocacy Coordinator at the 2110 Centre for Gender Advocacy, said that the increase was not “necessarily positive.”
“I think that what this means […] is that a [greater] number of women managed to find a place within the capitalist system to stay in the 1 percent,” Bouchard said in French. “[The one per cent] is a problem that societies like Canada, the U.S, Greece, and Spain have experienced, so I don’t see how this could be a step forward.”  
“We should try to talk about the 99 per cent instead of the 1 per cent. It’s more important than trying to look whether or not women can become the CEO of a bank,” she added.
According to Statistics Canada, 7 out of ten part-time workers were women in 2009.
According to Tremblay-Pepin, the increased representation can be explained by the “massive arrival” of women in the workplace at the end of the 1970s. In 1982, he said, this “transition was not yet done.” 
“But it’s not because there’s more women in the workplace that they can find a workplace that is equitable, fair, and that gives them the same standing as men. There’s still a wide gap between the current situation and equality,” Tremblay-Pepin explained. 
In 2011, women earned an average of $20.11 an hour compared to $22.81 for men, according to a recent study by the Quebec Institute of Statistics. The difference in earning on a weekly basis is even more pronounced, with an average of $666.21 for women compared to $851.68 for men. 
Queer McGill’s Trans* Working Group noted in an email to The Daily that income inequality is “too narrow a field to account for the societal effects of sexism” and that looking exclusively at gender “doesn’t reflect the ways that gender combines with race, nationality, educational opportunities, and other factors to affect one’s ability to earn money.”
The absence of a third category for trans* people was also highlighted by the group.
“If the study had listed trans* people […] the results would likely reflect the fact that trans* folks earn a disproportionately lower income relative to both cis men and cis women,” they said.

Students demand divestment from fossil fuel industries and Plan Nord
A group of 12 students representing Divest McGill – a student-led fossil fuel and tar sands divestment campaign – submitted two petitions to McGill University’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) last Friday and held a brief demonstration.
The demonstration began with a chant, followed by a speech by Divest McGill member Bronwen Tucker. The petitions were presented to McGill Secretary-General Stephen Strople by Divest McGill co-spokesperson Christopher Bangs.
Divest McGill began its campaign in October 2012, and has since collected over 750 signatures for two separate petitions – one asking McGill to withdraw its investments from the tar sands and fossil fuel industry, the other seeking the University’s divestment from companies associated with Plan Nord, the Quebec government plan to exploit natural resources north of the 49th parallel.
Many campus groups have endorsed the content put forth by the petitions, including SSMU and the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS).
The divestment campaign is part of a North America-wide effort, run in Canada by the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition and in the United States by 350.org. In total, 200 campuses across North America are involved. Two of these universities, Unity College and Hampshire College, have succeeded in their divestment campaigns.
Divest McGill co-spokesperson Lily Schwarzbaum said, “the process doesn’t end with just submission. We plan to make a wider campaign that continues positive messaging, unites the McGill community, and raises awareness on issues surrounding fossil fuels and tar sands.”
Bangs said that the group is  expecting a response on the status of the petitions from Strople in two weeks. Strople will be bringing the petitions to CAMSR, which is chaired by Governor Emerita Brenda Norris.
Bangs and Schwarzbaum are optimistic about working with CAMSR toward divestment.
“We hope to see this be a positive relationship and so far it has been,” Schwarzbaum said.
Jonathan Mooney, student member of CAMSR and Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Secretary-General said his “understanding of the process would be that CAMSR would communicate with the investment committee after reviewing the brief and they would issue a recommendation.”
“The sense that I get is that it’s going to be taken very seriously, that there’s going to be a very measured, careful study by the members of the committee,” Mooney said.
“[The University] has a specific role in taking an ideological stand and determining the future, our future. […] We see our investments as a really key and important place for McGill to make an example,” Schwarzbaum said.
Non-student members of CAMSR and the administration were not available for comment by press time

At least a few thousand of McGill’s unionized workers are working without a contract, some for as long as two years.
Four bargaining units from two different unions representing course lecturers, invigilators, research assistants, and research associates are all currently negotiating contracts for the first time.
AGSEM, the union representing course lecturers and invigilators, has been at the negotiating table with the University since 2010.
AGSEM has represented Teaching Assistants since 1993, but was also accredited to represent course lecturers and invigilators in 2010. The Association of McGill University Research Employes (AMURE), which represents research assistants and associates won its accreditation in 2010.
Union officials say that the slow bargaining process is primarily because the contracts in question are without precedent at McGill and need to be built from scratch.
Negotiators for invigilators are chiefly looking for an increase in wages from $10 an hour to $15.25, which the union says is the provincial average. Negotiations have been under provincially supervised arbitration since last spring.
Other issues of contention for invigilators include the posting of vacancies and a standardized seniority protocol.
According to AGSEM negotiator Sunci Avlijas, the roughly 800 invigilators could see a contract by this spring.
The timeline for course lecturers is a bit less clear, as union officials in their bargaining unit are keeping mum about negotiations.
Bargaining for course lecturers is continuing “as usual,” according to Stefana Lamasanu, the bargaining unit’s communications officer. When asked if the recently announced cuts to Arts classes – which are hitting course lecturers the hardest – were affecting the bargaining process, Lamasanu reiterated that bargaining was proceeding as usual.
Lilian Radovac, president of AGSEM, says that the slow progress of negotiations is not a surprise. “McGill has a long history of delaying contracts,” she said, adding that the first TA contract took five years to negotiate.
McGill’s 1,200 research assistants and research associates, the latter of which are classified as casual workers, may have a contract to vote on as soon as next month, according to AMURE President Matthew Annis.
While research assistants and research associates are in two separate bargaining units, the two contracts will be finished at the same time, according to Annis, who is also on the bargaining committee.
