Concordia a shadow of larger weekend demonstrations
A  few dozen protesters decried Israel’s military offensive on Gaza amidst Wednesday’s lunchtime crowd in a Concordia cafeteria, a small version of larger rallies that have taken place across the city.
Wednesday’s event was organized by Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) Concordia and social justice collective Tadamon! focused on attacks aimed at Gaza schools.
“Our basic demands are that the University’s administration condemn the fact the Israeli military is bombing schools in Gaza,” explained QPIRG Concordia member Aaron Lakoff. “We also demand the University immediately cut its ties with all Israeli academic institutions.”
Lakoff explained that both groups felt Israeli universities were complicit in Isreael’s actions as none have spoken out against them.
QPIRG and Tandamon! also called for students to boycott companies that supported Israel: Starbucks, McDonald’s, Chapters, and Indigo Books.
Both groups also joined the ranks of community and civil society organizations at a protest downtown on Sunday that drew a crowd of between 5,000 and 10,000.
“There was a very palatable, visceral anger in the streets,” Lakoff said.
A six-month cease-fire between the two countries expired on December 19, as Hamas stated Israel had not lifted the blockade into Gaza except  for limited humanitarian aid. Israel, incensed at the 500 rocket and mortar attacks launched into Israel thus far during December, launched a military operation against Hamas in Gaza on December 27. At press time 13 Israelis and about 800 Gazans have been killed from air strikes and a ground offensive, while 137 Israelis and about 3,300 Gazans have been wounded, although exact numbers vary and are impossible to obtain.
Laith Marouf, another QPIRG member and Concordia chapter coordinator of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, a national student-run non-profit, explained that Sunday’s objectives varied slightly from the Concrodia protest: while student groups have called for academic boycotts, Sunday’s protest called on the Canadian government to use diplomatic means in pressuring Israel to end the offensive. Sunday’s protest also had one violent instance where an Israeli flag was burned whereas Wednesday’s was peaceful.
A second Montreal protest was organized for Saturday – but this time community and civil society organizations will be joined by labour unions, including the Montreal branch of the Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux (CSN-Montreal).
“Yesterday we adopted a proposition that says we will support the Palestinian people in Gaza, and we invited all our members to participate in the march,” said Dominique Daigneault, the second vice president of CSN-Montreal.
Montrealers are not alone in condemning the attacks, with protests being held around the world. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1860, which called for “an immediate, durable, and fully respected ceasefire,” among other things, but both Israel and Hamas rejected the resolution and the ceasefire.

Undergraduate union collects enough signatures for accreditation
A union for undergraduate on-campus student workers appears to be one step closer to realization, thanks to the recent acquisition of 50 per cent of undergraduate student workers’ signatures.
With them, the Association of McGill Undergraduate Student Employees (AMUSE) has a sufficient number of signatures as required by Quebec labour law to apply for accreditation with the Quebec Labour Relations Board – which means it can become an official union.
“We’re waiting right now [for accreditation],” said Max Silverman, former SSMU VP External Affairs and current AMUSE organizer. “It could come in the next couple of weeks or at the end of the semester; we’re not really sure.”
This hurdle has been a relief to organizers, who were forced to work without a list of the approximately 3,000 undergraduate students employed at McGill after the administration refused to provide them with a list of undergraduate student workers.
Deputy Provost Morton Mendelson defended McGill’s actions in an email to The Daily.
“The University takes its obligation to maintain the confidentiality of students very seriously. A group such as AMUSE did not have the right to see lists of students employed at McGill,” he wrote. “Unless obliged by law, the University could not, in fact, provide such information to a third party about a student, without the written consent of the student.”
As a result of McGill’s initiatives, AMUSE turned to enlisting students’ signatures one by one around campus.
“On the one hand, it was time consuming, and on the other hand it was really irritating,” said Silverman. “We felt bad having to walk up to people.”
Despite the tediousness of the operation, AMUSE was eventually succesful.
“[The strategy to acquire signatures] has been really effective,” said Silverman. “Students have responded really well.”
But the arrival of a new union at McGill could mean even more labour disputes for McGill – in the past year the University has faced a strike by the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) and a strike by the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Assocation (MUNACA) seems likely.
Despite McGill’s current lack of cooperation with AMUSE, Mendelson anticipated a warm relationship between McGill and AMUSE, should they become an official union.
“If AMUSE is indeed certified under the Quebec Labour Code, the University will fulfill its obligations under the Code,” said Mendelson. “McGill’s labour relations are, indeed, very good; most labour contracts have been settled without disruptions over the past several decades.”
Given the ambiguity surrounding AMUSE’s potential accreditation, a specific date has not been assigned as to when the union could be up-and-running. They have, however, been able to clearly state their functions.
“We will do representational work, like grievances and harassment in the workplace,” Silverman said. “And we’ll also have a collective agreement, a contract that involves everyone in the union, that will handle [things like] working hours, wages, and benefits.”
Silverman also said that until a collective agreement is signed and students start receiving benefits, they won’t have to pay union dues.
For the moment, however, the future of AMUSE remains in limbo. A hearing regarding its application is scheduled at the Quebec Labour Relations Board on February 2.
“Everything’s up in the air right now,” Silverman said. “But there will be some movement within the semester.”

Munroe-Blum takes positive attitude towards contentious campus issues
To start off the semester, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum sat down with The Daily, our sister publication Le Délit, and The McGill Tribune to talk about tuition, teaching assistants (TAs), and First Nations at McGill.
McGill Daily: The Charest Government has allowed Quebec universities to increase tuition, often by very large amounts in short periods of time, and you’ve largely welcomed this. Do you think a university should have the right to set tuition at whatever price the market can bear?
Heather Munroe-Blum: I don’t see any evidence of huge changes, they’ve been extremely modest on every account. From the time I’ve come to McGill, I’ve argued on every account for a different policy on tuition, which is one that would essentially be characterized as re-regulation, not deregulation.
I actually don’t believe in driving costs as high as they can go – I don’t think that funds [determine] either accessibility or quality in a university, but I do believe our tuition is too low, I believe our funding overall is too low – that’s empirically supportable. The policy that I asked the [Board of Governors] to approve in my first year, which they did, is that we be able to, within the legislative possibilities of Quebec, raise tuition within the normal range, so you could even use the Canadian average or Canadian plus the public American average.
MD: What about international student fees?
HMB: It’s hardly a dramatic step that [Premier Jean] Charest has made. Re-regulation would mean that we would have the flexibility of fees that would be approved by the [Board of Governors], but with a notion…that 30 cents of every dollar go to student aid…. What I hope to say while I’m Principal is that no qualified student will be refused, or be unable to come to McGill because they don’t have the financial means to come. We still don’t have enough financial aid through McGill or through Quebec…. If you compare us to the other research-intensive universities in Canada, we lack about $100-million a year that would normally come in from tuition. If you look at the universities outside Quebec, no government pays for international students, so they are completely cost-driven fees – and the same in the public universities in the U.S. with which we associate ourselves. We like international students as part of the richness of McGill, not as a moneymaker. Deregulation means you can charge whatever you want. Re-regulation means you have principles that would govern the way you raise fees.
McGill Tribune:* [There are] new travel restrictions that prevent students and professors from certain areas because of travel warnings that the Canadian government have…. Were you happy with the way that process was implemented, and do you feel that that might adversely affect students who work in areas that naturally deal with conflict or strife?
HMB: Of course we’re not happy when things don’t get communicated smoothly and effectively, and I don’t think anybody would say they were. I’m not going to pretend they were, and I don’t think Provost [Morton] Mendelson would say they were either. I think the process that has evolved subsequently is a good one…that is a small group working with the Deputy Provost that iterate on the regulations for international travel. So those will be coming back to Senate for discussion, and they’re well developed, and there’s been a wide consultation process.
Look, our goals are we’re a deeply internationalized university, we’re proud of it, it’s part of our essential character. The goals are to support student mobility in every way we can while being prudent on safety. We’ve lost three collegues as you know in the developing world in the last six months.
MD: McGill’s pow-wow tries to attract First Nations high school students to the University, but the First Nations House tells us little has changed in the number of First Nations students enrolled at the school. We wonder if the lack of a First Nations Studies program has anything to do with the low enrollment. Do you agree?
HMB: We don’t know how many aboriginal students we have because we don’t register students in that way. You have to identify as aboriginal in order to qualify for any special services or support. That being said, we have a number of initiatives to reach out to aboriginal communities and to support aboriginal students to participate in the academic programs of McGill. The Deputy Provost is leading an initiative looking at, for example, not only at Native Studies, but how to offer educational programs that will be accessible and of interest to aboriginal students. And then, how do we support aboriginal students when they come in to be able to succeed in their studies – and especially those who come from remote communities. It’s an area we have as a priority for fundraising as well, in [Campaign McGill], not just review and planning, but implentation as well.
MD: How should the University determine who owns the rights to content produced here. How much should the source of funding of research, the facilities used, and the amount of contribution between students and professors affect this determination?
HMB: The intellectual property  [IP] ownership should be determined through policy. We have policies that govern IP, and those policies are set in this case by Senate.
MD: There has been presence of corporate and military research on campus. We’re curious about the involvement McGill might have in their research.
HMB: Our normal policies pertain to grants of any kind, whether a foundation, a not-for-profit, a corporation, or government. A contract, whether it’s with [a] government, has different ways of looking at intellectual property and that’s determined again by our policy on a case-by-case basis. A lot of these questions then become philosophical: Who do you take money from? Well we don’t take illegal money. We then take a whole lot of money from a range of public sources – the majority of our money by far comes from public sources and the one example of so-called military research sponsored by the Department of Defense was for prosthetic research.
For better or worse, it’s unfortunate that the countries who have put the most into military research – the U.S., Singapore, Israel – have had more breakthroughs in science because so much basic science gets funded out of that. The fact is that governments spend an enormous amount of normal basic science research or applied science research – prosthetics would be an example – that has a broad human benefit or knowledge benefit. We look very much at what is the content of the research that’s being done here. Is it being used to benefit the quality of education here?
MD: Considering how much power TAs have on undergraduate marks, especially in large classes, do you think the amount of training they receive is sufficient? How would you change the way TAs are trained at McGill?
HMB: Dean Martin Kreiswirth – Dean of Graduate Students – works very closely with the faculties in giving full support to the orientation of graduate students and preparing them to teach. In any event [it] is a priority and progress is being made on that. This is an issue that could be expressed in a number of ways. Graduate students want preparation and high quality supervision and undergraduate students want TAs who are well prepared and do what they do. The close working relationship between professors and TAs is a key part of that. The Provost has overall responsibility for this, and has this as a high priority.

This year’s big white tent hopes to make a financial turnaround
Snow Air Pub (SnowAP) organizers are banking that this year’s big white tent will attract more revenue than last year’s financial flop, but some think that an alternative beer contract could help its future performance.
“Last year was a really hard year,” said SSMU President Kay Turner, who organized the event last year as VP Internal. She explained that last-minute costs changes put an early dent in last year’s budget – like the price of the tent doubling a month before the start of the event.
SnowAP, now in its 13th year, has operated at a loss before, and often fares worse than its counterpart Open Air Pub, held in the beginning of September.
Turner hoped that with the better scheduling and budgeting, the event will be more successful and profitable than last year’s disappointing returns.
Despite an early obstacle on Wednesday when heavy snowfall led the Fire Prevention Office to close SnowAP early, she said the first day was successful.
“It was full at 2:30 p.m.,” she said.
While the supplementary financial difficulties confronting SnowAP this year seem to have been addressed, some students think that the solution is to switch from Boréale to another beer.
“A better beer is more likely to attract more people,” said U1 Nursing student Rebecca Saunders.
U1 Arts student Spencer Hill conceded that the taste of the beer served at SnowAP was not spectacular, but its prices were attractive.
“It was very cheap, and on par with cheap college beer,” Hill said.
SSMU’s three-year contract with Boréale – which limits the beers that SSMU and the faculties can sell to students – will expire this year.
According to current VP Internal Julia Webster Boréale was selected because the company contributes to the Campus Life Fund and fits environmental requirements of being a local provider. Additionally, since SSMU collaborated with a majority of faculty associations to obtain a contract, the prices were cheaper.
As SSMU shops around for a potential new provider, Webster says they will collaborate with faculties and interest groups. The McGill Environment Student Society was involved in the process of developing proposals sent to several beer companies including Molson – which held the previous contract – Boréale, Sleeman, Unibrpue, and others.
“[SSMU] met with all of the faculties and Gert’s to discuss and come up with a proposal,” Webster said.
Interested companies will submit pitches to SSMU – which will select the best offer with faculty representatives.
Webster also explained that SSMU needs to consider affiliations between beer companies and Montreal bars in order to plan pub crawls during events like Frosh.

Students seek greater role in their own education
Students can expect to see the second edition of Indyclass: Student movements this winter.
The student-run course brings together undergraduates taking independent research reading courses to collaborate and discuss themes relating to their topics.
Joel Pedneault, the current coordinator of Indyclass, said the class allows people to study topics usually not discussed at McGill.
“The idea of this Indyclass is to act not just as an academic forum for discussion, but also as a more open type of seminar,” said Pedneault. “Indyclass gives an opportunity to break out of that mould.”
The course intends to bring together the different perspectives of students performing similar work, though in different faculties. This semester’s theme will focus on student politics and more effective activism.
“[Indyclass gives] a new spin on how student politics and education are done at McGill,” said Pedneault. “[It] will hopefully lead to more focused activism.”
Indyclass founder and U3 Sociology and International Development Studies student Cleve Higgins, heard about a program at the University of California, Berkeley called Democratic Education at CAL (DECAL), which consists of approximately 100 student-run courses.
Higgins found that there was a large overlap between the work done by students for social movements both in and out of McGill.
“[I thought] about the different research and knowledge production that people here at McGill do outside of school for activist groups,” he said. “There was a need for creating more space for people to be able to pursue those type of activities, like academic research and knowledge activities that they are interested in…that are relevant to them within a space at school and within the academic context.”
When asked about the success of the first Indyclass – prisons – Higgins said that although part of its mandate relates to the redistribution of the research back toward activists and organizations working on prison justice, it was difficult to achieve.
“The main advantage, the biggest success we had with Indyclass, was having a class that was only students and therefore that could really end up coinciding with our needs, our interests, and what we wanted to do,” said Higgins.
Professor of Sociology Marcos Ancelovici, who supervised five of the students last semester, thought the class was a useful resource for students.
“I think it’s great if students have the initiative to come up with an idea, and if they can organize, get together, and select a topic they are all interested in,” Ancelovici said. “It’s a great initiative.”
Ancelovici addded that the project would help develop independent thinking.
“I think it’s good in terms of fostering autonomy, allowing students to study something they are really interested in, and fostering self-management as a way to empower students to have more control over the educational process, as opposed to just doing what the professor tells them to do,” he said.
The professor found the project interesting, but it was somewhat difficult to reconcile his responsibility as advisor with the students’ freedom. He added that professors might be reluctant to take on students in another Indyclass due to the increased workload, but he hoped they would.
Higgins agreed.
“I would encourage people to start their own Indyclass. Find something that’s interesting to them and/or people they know and/or an organization they are working with and start one,” Higgins said. “It’s not something that requires any special knowledge. None of us knew about prisons before we did the prison edition.”
Indyclass is also open to students who are not undertaking an independent study course. For more information consult indyclass.wordpress.com.
