Expanding conceptions of accessibility in Montreal
As part of the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill’s annual event ‘Social Justice Days,’ Aimee Louw and Gift Tshuma of Accessibilize Montreal led an hour-long interactive workshop on February 11 that challenged conventional views on accessibility, and disability and explored different ways to fight for accessibility in Montreal. Throughout the workshop, Louw and Tshuma encouraged participants to share their experiences with and personal views on accessibility.
“Disability is viewed as a problem and it’s viewed in individualistic terms, not in terms of let’s try to make our community open and accessible.”
After participants discussed their perceptions of accessibility and disability, Louw and Tschuma showed a video of Tshuma and his friend during a practice fire evacuation at Concordia University. Tshuma was waiting for a fireman to help him evacuate the building, as he could not access the stairs in a wheelchair.
“That was a pretty scary situation since I was waiting for 45 minutes on the eleventh floor, and everybody else had evacuated the building,” Tshuma told The Daily. “You are less important of a student for the Concordia faculty. That’s how it was like. It’s kind of scary because the whole point of the institution is to take care of student needs.”
Louw also asked the participants to voice their opinions on possible ways to build a movement around accessibility, as methods such as protests and street blockades pose barriers to those who cannot “[use their bodies] as a weapon.”
Some participants suggested spreading personal stories and information about the challenges of accessibility in Montreal. “I feel like unless you know someone, are close to someone, or work with people who have challenges with accessibility, it’s not on your mind. So maybe in [… Montreal], awareness might be the first step […] Just to get people thinking about it [and] talking about it,” said a participant.
The workshop concluded with an announcement about Accessibilize Montreal’s “Strateg-Tea” meeting on February 25 that will mainly discuss strategies to spread awareness on the movement for accessibility in Montreal.
“Disability is viewed as a problem and it’s viewed in individualistic terms, not in terms of let’s try to make our community open and accessible,” stated Louw. “It seems like there’s a cultural shift [in the meaning of disability] that’s needed in order to make things work.”

Looking at the Spanish housing crisis during Social Justice Days
As part of the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill’s annual event Social Justice Days, the Collectifs des Immigrants Espagnol de Montréal presented the workshop ‘Squatting in Spain.’
The event looked at the reality in Spain following the collapse of the real estate bubble and the current economic and social crisis. Squatting is defined as taking residence in an unoccupied or abandoned building (usually residential). Squatters do not have legal permission to occupy the space.
“The unemployment rate for the general population is 25.8 per cent and for people under 25, the unemployment rate is 54.3 per cent.”
According to Enrique Llanes, who has been a squatter for more than five years in the United Kingdom and Spain, “90 per cent of squatters do not choose this life by choice, it is a necessity.”
Spain has been facing a housing crisis since the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2008.
“In 2007 there were more than 420,000 foreclosures and around 220,000 evictions of families.” Carol Galais, a member of the Collectifs, explained. “In 2012, every 15 minutes, a family lost their home in Spain due to foreclosures.”
According to Galais, since 2002, the Spanish government and banks have been encouraging housing construction as a means to boost the economy.
Veronica Crespo, another member of the Collectifs, continued, “Spanish banks gave out loans irresponsibly during this period. The loans covered 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the total cost of the home. At the height of the construction boom, 750,000 homes were built [per] year and yet no one believed that there was a real estate bubble […] until the burst in 2008”.
“The unemployment rate for the general population is 25.8 per cent and for people under 25, the unemployment rate is 54.3 per cent,” Crespo added.
The European Union has classified Spanish mortgage laws as a violation of consumer-protection rules. Currently, 13 to 15 per cent of homes are unoccupied in Spain. In response to increasing suicides of evicted homeowners, the Spanish government issued a two-year moratorium on evictions.
According to the presenters, housing is not considered a human right in Spain. In Canada, there have been efforts to push the government to enact adequate housing as a human right. In 2012, Bill C-400 was introduced to ensure secure, adequate, accessible, and affordable housing for Canadians. However, this bill failed to pass in February 2013.
