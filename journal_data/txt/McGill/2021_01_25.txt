Inuit communities still lack access to high-speed internet
In 2018, François Legault promised that a Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government would invest $400 million over four years to provide all of Quebec’s populated regions with access to high-speed internet and wide-band cellular coverage. Additionally, a joint federal-provincial investment of $125.2 million would give fourteen Inuit communities and twenty-eight institutions in Nunavik, Quebec’s northernmost administrative region, access to better internet.
It’s been more than two years, and Nunavimmiut have seen little change in the quality of their internet. According to Andrea Brazeau, a fourth-year Faculty of Education student and resident of the small Inuit community of Kangiqsualjjuaq, poor connection and slow speeds make it nearly impossible to access online health, financial, educational, and work-related services, including COVID-19 benefits and income support.
Last November, Brazeau published an open letter to Premier Legault urging him to follow up on his campaign promise. While most McGill students have had the option of taking their classes from home these past two semesters, Brazeau – due to the poor internet connection in Kangiqsualujjuaq – has had to remain in Montreal just to access myCourses, join Zoom meetings, and submit assignments. The Daily spoke to Brazeau to find out more about the situation in Nunavik and the reaction to her letter.
“I published it because I wanted to be informed,” Brazeau said, “to see if something would move forward […] I haven’t received a response.” Maryam Monsef, the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development, promised to update Brazeau on the multi-million dollar project, but as of this article’s publication, Brazeau has not received an update.
Brazeau was hopeful that Legault himself would reach out, but she has yet to hear from him. Brazeau contrasted the swiftness with which Legault’s government responded to restaurateur David McMillan’s #openourcellars campaign, which secured Quebec restaurants the right to sell alcohol without an accompanying meal in December, to the silence she’s grown accustomed to.“It shows who’s important and who’s not,” Brazeau remarked.
Reflecting on the Legault administration’s lack of action, Brazeau added, “I wish that these politicians could come up north and live two weeks, or even a week, just to see the realities – the internet, the lack of housing, the high cost of living. So they could actually feel what it’s like. Maybe then they would make a change.”
Brazeau said she would continue to fight for equitable internet access. She’s been working on an opinion letter, and says she’s been approached by other students about starting a petition.
Asked what readers could do to support her cause, Brazeau said, “Fight with us. Fight for things we deserve. Because we do deserve the same resources and services I receive down here.”

McGill Research Group on Health and Law panelists discuss data collection, surveillance, and distributive justice
On January 13, the McGill Research Group on Health and Law (MRGHL) hosted an interdisciplinary panel to reflect upon the delicate balance of individual privacy and public health. Panellists Dr. Anne Andermann, public health physician and member of the McGill Department of Family Medicine; Faculty of Law Assistant Professor Ignacio Cofone; and Khaled El Emam, University of Ottawa professor and founder of multiple data privacy and analytics companies; each offered a perspective from their respective field of study. According to the MRGHL, the panel aimed to address privacy concerns regarding contact tracing apps, specifically Canada’s “COVID Alert,” within a framework of the virus as a syndemic – not a pandemic, widespread over an entire population, but a crisis which more strongly impacts certain groups due to biological, social, and economic factors. Just as COVID-19 continues to disproportionately affect the elderly, racialized people, people with disabilities, those who are unhoused, and other marginalized groups, contact tracing apps, according to Professor Cofone, have the potential to disproportionately serve and surveil these groups.
Professor Cofone spoke on the surveillance of the “COVID Alert” app potentially creating an uneven distribution of who is surveilled and on how aggregated data from multiple platforms can encroach on people’s privacy. Although monitoring through contact tracing is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19, the distribution of surveillance is determined by which groups have downloaded the “COVID Alert” app, he explained. Groups with lower rates of smartphone ownership, such as the elderly and those in lower-income brackets – although more at risk of contracting and being severely impacted by the virus – are under-surveilled by smartphone-sourced data, Cofone said. He also brought up the prevalence of over-surveillance of ethnic and racial minorities, which he claimed is a risk with any data collection platform, but in his opinion, not necessarily “COVID Alert.” The U.S. has seen such over-surveillance and racial profiling with the Patriot Act, according to Cofone.
While he supports contact tracing, Cofone warned against government agencies solely relying on the app because of installation rates that are low and do not reflect Montreal’s population demographics, as well as individual negligence to report a positive test result on the app, if installed.  
Dr. Andermann highlighted the idea of distributive justice within the ethics of public health framework, asking, “Is the distribution of harms and benefits [of COVID-19 intervention] fair?” She noted that the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms protects individual freedom and privacy, unless that freedom and privacy is at the expense of others, giving an example of such an expense by pointing to Chapter VIII of the Public Health Act. The chapter states that a report of infection “must indicate the name and address of the person and contain any other personal or non-personal information prescribed.” For Andermann, stringent privacy laws are a necessary tradeoff for the protection of public health, especially when there is an incongruence between who exercises freedom and champions privacy laws and who is affected the most by the virus.
El Emam spoke on possible ways to keep data private and still useful, in order to meet privacy concerns. He gave an example of the use of what he referred to as “deepfakes for data” in South Korea: fake data that is made to mimic real data without releasing personal information. He believes it’s possible to enhance the privacy and usefulness of health data in Canada, but a lack of generally accepted standards for health data sharing and a lack of infrastructure for data storage and refreshment are current obstacles to El Emam’s vision of harnessing mass health data for precision medicine.
Ultimately, in the words of El Emam, and as the other panellists agreed, “health data sharing is important, especially in the context of a fast-moving pandemic.”
