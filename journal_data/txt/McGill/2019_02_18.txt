Increased Evictions and Changing Neighbourhoods
In December 2017, Mile End resident Tim Forster was notified that he and other building residents were all being evicted in order for their apartments to be renovated into permanent Airbnbs. 
The new owners pressured the residents to leave as soon as possible, earlier than the six month notice required by Quebec law. According to the Régie du logement, a landlord is allowed to evict previous tenants if they have plans to “divide the dwelling, enlarge it substantially, or change its destination.” The latter motive implies that converting the apartments to Airbnbs can be legal, but only after obtaining a permit that Forster believes the new owners did not have. According to a 2017 study by McGill Geography professor David Wachsmuth, in March 2017, only 42 of the over 6000 full-time rentals available in Montreal on Airbnb were properly certified. The tenants of Forster’s building contested the landlord’s attempts to push them out prematurely. During the negotiations, the landlord’s intentions were made clear. “Some of the other neighbors said that they were basically told […] if you win the right to stay, we will make your life hell,” Forster said. Two of the apartments were vacated ahead of schedule. The landlord quickly began renovations, which included unannounced water cuts, walls caked in dust, and endless noise. Forster and his roommate ended up moving out two months early. 
Airbnb puts pressure on an housing market undergoing rapid gentrification. The Plateau–Mile End, which currently houses a large portion of Montreal’s student population, is a particularly popular area for new Airbnbs. As landlords raise rent and evict tenants, students are pushed out. They, in turn, push residents out of working-class areas, namely Parc-Extension, Centre-Sud, and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. Working-class people bear the brunt of gentrification, as they are pushed out of their homes and away from their communities. Over the last few summers, Montreal has seen a steady increase in the number of tourists. Numbers jumped from 8.4 million visitors in 2013 to over 11 million in 2017, according to Tourism Montreal. Non-traditional vacation lodging, such as Airbnb, has increasingly been taking a larger portion of the housing market in past years. Government regulations for these ventures have struggled to keep up. 
These services have opened the door to what McGill’s Urban Politics and Governance research group has named “triple-threat” listings. These rentals are entire homes being rented out yearlong to tourists by hosts with multiple properties available. In some Montreal neighborhoods, these listings have taken over 2-3 per cent of the housing stock, suggests Wachsmuth’s study. Airbnb’s presence in these neighbourhoods are raising rents and increasing evictions. Despite efforts to tighten regulation of these rentals, including a push to restrict short-term tourist residence permits in the Ville Marie borough last summer, most listings still escape notice. 
To report illegal Airbnbs, you can contact permis.inspections.ville-marie@ville. montreal.qc.ca or call 311.

Liberal and NDP Policy Rundown
Candidates will enter their final week of campaigning ahead of the by-election on February 25. Polling indicates a Liberal victory in the riding of Outremont. As of February 15, Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan is polling at 42.6 per cent, while NDP Candidate Julia Sánchez is polling at 18.5 per cent. Historically, by-elections can be opportunities to test the waters for elections to come. Despite the possible predictive nature of this race, by-elections themselves are rarely significant, due to low voter turnouts and lack of widespread impact, as they only affect one riding of voters at a time. As a result, not much information is available about candidates and their platforms or promises; candidates tend not to run on competitive or ground-breaking policies, instead sticking to party lines. 
The Daily’s coverage of the by-election has focused on the Liberal and NDP parties due to Outremont’s history as a Liberal riding, and it’s recent decade of NDP representation. In addition, parties such as the Conservatives, People’s Party, and the Bloc Québécois have either not pursued substantial campaigns, or have only named candidates late in the race. 
CANDIDATE’S PLATFORMS 
Local issues 
Both candidates have mentioned a few standing points for citizens of Outremont. Rachel Bendayan is a self-described protector of the local community, and intends to include Outremont in the Liberal party’s federal policies. Bendayan plans to continue to lower tax cuts for small businesses, in line with the Liberal Party’s nine per cent cuts. She also aims to continue current Building Canada projects in Montreal, including building up the Réseau Express Métropolitain (REM), expanding Université de Montréal campus, and refurbishing the St-Joseph Oratory. Bendayan has also praised the Canada Child benefit program, claiming it provides over 17,000 children in the riding with funding. 
Sánchez has been less specific on local issues, but has mentioned her intentions to improve health insurance for the self-employed, and to fight for the rights of workers. 
Concerning housing issues in Montreal, Bendayan has promised to include Outremont in the Liberal Party’s National Housing Strategy, and to provide 100,000 affordable housing units. Sánchez has also mentioned intentions to facilitate better access to affordable housing for renters: she plans to institute 500,000 affordable and quality housing units over the next 10 years, and remove the federal portion of the GST/HST on the construction of new and affordable rental units. 
Environment 
Environmental issues top Sánchez’s platform, and she has recently unveiled a comprehensive plan in direct response to the current Liberal government’s policies, and Bendayan’s limited comments on these issues. Sánchez’s plan, called the “Grand Transition,” operates off four main points. 
Though the plan was originally posited as a challenge to the Liberal candidate, Bendayan has not commented. Regarding environmental policy, the Liberal candidate stands behind the federal Carbon Tax plan, and expresses pride in Canada being one of few countries with nation-wide carbon pricing. 
Though there hasn’t been much upset over platforms, both candidates have been victims of vandalism on either their offices or signage in the district. Anti-pipeline and anti-Liberal messages were posted on top of Rachel Bendayan’s campaign poster outside of the Saint-Enfant-Jésus Church. The poster was removed within an hour of its appearance. Alternatively, Sánchez’s office was the subject of graffiti, also anti-pipeline, but Sánchez opted to let the message remain on her windows. 
Leading up to the election, both candidates have been participating in community engagements. They have not appeared together in any formal debates, and have pursued different avenues of outreach. While Sánchez has participated in a town hall, a debate, and several livestreamed discussions, Bendayan has focused on meeting with local businesses and community organizers to voice support.

Mental Health, Students’ Rights, and “Cleaning up SSMU”
On February 12, AUS Elections held a candidates’ debate for the upcoming academic year. Three out of the nine positions are contested: Arts Senator, Arts Representative, and VP Academic. The rest of the positions are uncontested: Stefan Suvajac for VP Finance, Maheen Akter for VP Internal, Darshan Daryanani for VP External, Kim Yang for VP Social, Yoana Pehlyova for VP Communications, and Jamal Tarrabain for President. 
The debate began with an introductory statement from each candidate, then included questions from the incumbents, the audience, an online survey, as well as the live feed. Finally, each candidate closed with a personal statement. 
ARTS SENATOR
The candidates for Arts Senator are Chloe Kemeni, Iyanu Soyege, Henrique Mecabô, Lauren Jelinek, and Chlöe Shahinian. 
Chloe Kemeni is currently the AUS VP Academic, in which she has focused on equity and inclusive spaces. She has worked as the AUS Equity Commissioner, SSMU Anti Violence Coordinator, and as a Floor Fellow at New Residence Hall. Her platform focused on accessibility of services for marginalized and international students, and noted McGill’s missed deadline for its sexual violence policy. Kemeni stated that she hopes to sit on the Committee for Student Affairs and participate in related consultations, ensuring that there is a survivor centric approach in the policy’s language. Her platform takes note of the future challenges that McGill libraries will face, which she has already begun to address as chair of the Library-Partnership Committee this year. 
Iyanu Soyege has worked as an executive for the African Studies Students’ Association (ASSA), and represented her constituents on Inter-Residence Council, as part of her mandate as VP External of a residence hall. Throughout her time with the ASSA, Soyege noticed the critical lack of courses in the department, as well as in Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Indigenous Studies, and South Asian Studies. As an Arts Senator, she stated she would fight for these programs in Senate. Furthermore, she noted the value and importance of student volunteers for safety programs, such as Walksafe and Drivesafe. Soyege stated she would advocate in Senate for greater incentives for students to volunteer for these programs. She also hopes to sit on the Standing Committee on Student Services. The last part of her platform emphasized the importance of student engagement, which she hopes to increase through the use of Google forms disseminated to the student body, and through working with as many Senators as possible. 
Henrique Mecabô’s platform focused solely on revising the current assessment policy, which is up for review next year in Senate. He noted that the current policy allows a final to consist of up to 70 per cent of a student’s grade, which he hopes to change in order to reduce students’ stress. When asked about his experience regarding equity on campus, Mecabô responded, “I don’t have […] specific work experience in student representation or government; [I have engaged] with cultural or ethnic organizations such as the Latin American Students’ Association, and the Brazilian Students’ Association, but I have done no work on the equity front specifically.” Lauren Jelinek is currently an Associate Senator. She proposed three main points in her platform: student inclusion in the tenure process, improving student health services, and making our campus more inclusive. With regards to the last initiative, she wants to improve representation among professors, particularly in region-specific studies. While she has experience in advocacy through volunteering at the Legal Information Clinic, there were legal concerns about her proposal for the tenure process. In response, Jelinek acknowledged the legal barriers and proposed “a public forum […] for students to voice their opinion [that the University takes into account].” 
Chlöe Shahinian stated that the lack of awareness among the student body about their rights and how to access student services was what inspired her to run for Arts Senator. She noted that when equity violations happen in class, students often don’t know who to turn to. Her platform calls for an AUS-specific equity advisor. Although her platform brings up important provisions, such as equity outlines specific to certain courses, there were concerns that the addition of a new equity advisor might make the bureaucratic process more complicated, when a SSMU equity advisor already exists. 
ARTS REPRESENTATIVE 
The candidates for Arts Representative are Andrew Chase, Adin Chan, Ariana Kaye, Gabriel Ahmad, Ruofan Wang, and Shreya Dandamudi, who was not present, as she is currently on exchange. 
Andrew Chase, current VP External of the Economics Students’ Association, centred his platform on accountability and his desire to “clean up SSMU for you.” An important part of his platform was his support for student clubs, which he noted as an essential way for students to get involved on campus. In response to a question about SSMU being unable to sustain clubs further, he stated that a solution could be the upcoming referendum on increasing SSMU’s base fee, which he would like to see partly put towards club funds. He also suggested reducing the staff needed to manage clubs. The base fee has not yet been presented to SSMU Legislative Council, or passed by the student body, and it is unclear what that fee increase would specifically go towards. It seems counter-intuitive for Chase to suggest simultaneously firing staff needed to manage clubs while also suggesting the number of clubs on campus be increased. 
Adin Chan focused his platform on preparing Arts students for life after graduation, improving the Minerva system, and addressing the lack of bilingual accessibility on AUS’ website. When asked how to bring about an improvement of the Minerva system, Chan responded, “I would wager that half of the [Computer Science] students would do it for free.” There have been numerous student movements on campus against unpaid student labour, notably the Social Work Student Association strike last semester. To suggest that students would work for McGill for free is a devaluation of student labour and indicates a lack of understanding on Chan’s part regarding students’ labour rights. 
Ariana Kaye served for one year as VP Internal of the Art History and Communications Studies Student Association (AHCSSA), and two years as its VP External, representing the department at AUS Legislative Council. Her platform focused on equitable representation and advocacy for marginalized students. She stated that she would like to start a committee between SSMU and Rez Life as Arts Representative, working to improve Rez Project for first year students at McGill. She plans to do this by incorporating intersectional elements of social justice into the program, and ensuring there are definitions for marginalized groups that are not currently included in the program. Her platform also included advocating for necessary improvements in mental health treatment and SSMU accountability. 
Gabriel Ahmad focused his platform on “fresh new ideas.” Among these ideas were advocating for the opening of the Redpath Library doors. In response to cost concerns, he stated that he had looked up the annual salary of a security guard online and found it to be $30,000 to $40,000, which he believed to be contrary to what McGill had estimated: $200,000. This assertion does not consider the likelihood that more than one security guard would be assigned to the door, which could also be open for 24 hours. Ahmad also spoke to women’s involvement in politics. “I think we should market these [political] simulations to women so that they participate in them more, because I’ve seen women that are extremely capable and quite impressive, to be honest,” he said. When asked a follow up question about advocating for women running for political positions while being a man running for a political position, he responded, “I think that one of the most difficult problems for feminism in Canada right now […] is actually the stigma facing male feminists.”
Ruofan Wang, currently VP Communications for La Citadelle Hall Council, focused his platform on increasing accessibility for students. He stated he would advocate for better services within the Office for Students with Disabilities, such as note-taking, and exam deferral opportunities. Another key point of his platform was his desire to help first-year students and international students fully experience Montreal and feel included in the McGill community. Wang stated he would work with SSMU and First-Year Council (FYC) to develop more opportunities, and work to ensure that SSMU and AUS services are bilingual. 
VP ACADEMIC 
The last of the contested positions was VP Academic, with candidates Ananya Nair and Wing Wong. 
Ananya Nair has worked for the Social Equity and Diversity Education office (SEDE) at McGill for the last two years and currently serves as Arts Community Engagement Commissioner at AUS. Her platform focused on making education more financially and physically accessible. One key point she made was that “there are a lot of AUS funds […] that go unused and I want to […] redistribute it to students in the form of student aid, bursaries, and scholarships.” She also noted the immense importance of initiatives such as the McGill Book Fair, which has provided up to $2 million in scholarships, and stated that she would provide more support for this program as VP Academic. Nair also mentioned in her platform the need to fight for student rights with regards to exam scheduling, such as the problem in having three exams within 28 hours. Further, she expressed her desire to work with the VP External to create a job and summer internship fair for Arts students, ensuring that students of every major have the opportunity to gain experience in their field. 
Wing Wong has worked as Student Prime Minister of his high school and treasurer for the youth organization Interact. His platform focused a great deal on libraries, student course loads, and reviewing assessment policies to be fairer for students. While Wong’s idea to reserve floors for Arts students in McLennan during exam season is admirable, the incumbent VP Academic raised concerns about its feasibility. In response, Wong referred to the Faculty of Law’s policy, which designates areas for Law students only during finals. However, students of all faculties rely on McLennan for study space, and will especially start to rely on this library more as Schulich Library closes for renovations. Even if the library was closed to non-McGill students during finals as Wong suggested, the majority of people in the library are McGill students to begin with. In response to Senator Wilson’s question about the feasibility of reducing course loads, Wong did not seem to provide an clear response.

Every Friday this semester, Divest McGill is holding demonstrations on the steps of the Arts Building. These weekly gatherings were organized to protest McGill’s continuing investments in the fossil fuels industry. Divest aims to raise awareness about current climate issues and the practice of divestment through these “Fossil-Free Fridays.”
The initiative is part of the “Fridays for Future” movement, led by 15-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. In December 2018, she delivered an internationally renowned speech on the impacts of climate change at the United Nations’ Climate Conference (COP24). Using her new visibility, Thunberg rallied young people to take action against climate change. The movement encourages youth to go on strike every Friday and voice their concerns regarding the future of our planet.
“We wanted to partly affiliate ourselves with Fridays for Future to show our support and gain some momentum. We also wanted a larger presence on campus because not a whole lot of people are fully conscious about what divestment is,” said Violette Drouin, a member of Divest McGill.
Of the 645 publicly traded companies McGill invests in, 35 are among the world’s largest fossil fuel corporations. Divest McGill’s mission is to make students aware of this fact, encourage the University’s administration to take action, and ultimately, divest. “Our mission is to get McGill to divest its endowment fund from fossil fuel companies, with the goal of making it a statement that they really are divorcing themselves from anything related to industries that are harming the environment. Here, the main effect of divestment is a political and social one,” explained Drouin.
Movements like Divest McGill promote climate action, urging administrations to take a stand against pollution. Although support on campus for divestment is growing, Drouin believes “things are progressing at an extremely slow pace.” She explained further, saying, “the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility is supposed to give a response to their re-evaluation of divestment at the end of this calendar year. However, this […] could take much longer.”
Through Fossil Free Fridays, and their other initiatives, members of Divest McGill hope to send a clear message to the administration. “We’re here, and we’re not going away until divestment from the fossil fuel industry is complete,” asserted Drouin.

From February 6 to 13, the Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS) and the Student’s Society of McGill University (SSMU) held several student consultations on revisions to the University’s Policy Against Sexual Violence. The groups wanted to collect student feedback prior to the proposed policy going to Senate later this month. The consultations co-coordinated by volunteer students from the Support Branch at SACOMSS were held across both campuses, and included closed sessions for survivors.
The University’s current Policy Against Sexual Violence, established in 2016, has received a C- grade from the student-led advocacy group Our Turn, and has not been updated since, failing to meet deadlines set by the provincial government to adopt an approved policy.
Consultation sessions went over amendments to the Policy, provided clarification on sections that may be overburdened with bureaucratic language, and gave an opportunity for attendees to voice their concerns about the Policy. Volunteers running the consultation sessions stressed the importance of student engagement and advocacy, emphasizing the need for getting diverse opinions and ideas back to the administration.
Additions to the Policy include new definitions of terms, changes to disciplinary decision-making processes, and more explicit procedures of support for survivors. Notably, “the McGill context” now involves off-campus locations and activities. Additionally, the definition of “Teaching Staff ” now includes TAs, lab techs, and athletic coaches. The new policy also bans disciplinary authority in administrative decisions, meaning no external factors will be allowed to sway decisions. A set of new procedures aiming to clarify and simplify the process of reporting incidents of sexual violence are now included, along with guidelines for investigations of a claim.
Participants voiced concerns over accountability: many felt the policy was weak in this regard. Those concerned see the power of the administration and that of the special investigator to be overreaching and potentially unreliable. One participant asserted that accountability measures were meaningless if there was no action. Since known perpetrators remain at McGill, survivors continue to feel unsafe. Participants also posited that serial offences should be a separate consideration, and a distinct category in the updated policy. Despite the University’s new commitment to “support survivors based on their personal experiences, whether or not a criminal offence has been proven,”
participants voiced concern that the specificities of this support are not outlined in the Policy. Participants proposed increased protection measures for survivors, such as access to information concerning the whereabouts of perpetrators, regardless of outcomes.
Following the consultations, reports will be compiled and presented to SSMU executives, SACOMSS, and the University administration. These reports will inform ongoing revisions to the Policy, and will be voted on next month.

As a result of a pay equity agreement with McGill, over the next six months, AMUSE must find and contact almost 10,000 union members who worked for the University at some point in the past eight years in order to distribute retroactive payments. The agreement, signed in December 2018, follows a long process of negotiations.
A 2010 pay equity report published by the University’s Pay Equity Commission was the driving force behind these payments. The report was conducted following the guidelines of the Quebec Pay Equity Act, which requires all businesses to review employee data every five years to ensure its continued compliance with pay equity standards.
The basic principle of pay equity is to ensure that predominantly female job classes receive compensation equal to predominantly male job classes that demand similar duties and responsibilities. According to the Act, the purpose of pay equity is “to redress difference[s] in compensation due to systemic gender discrimination.” The Pay Equity Act divides jobs into “male class” and “female class” distinctions. This is relevant to AMUSE as male and female job classes would normally be compared within the institution itself, but given that all AMUSE jobs are female-predominant, differences in compensation were judged using the popular HAY point methodology.
Following the University’s release of their 2010 report in 2015, AMUSE filed an official union complaint. AMUSE claimed the report was completed improperly, and consequently, was inaccurate to workplace realities.
They challenged the lack of attention given to the benefits that different job classes receive, including health plans, life insurance, and vacation days. The University also grouped many dissimilar jobs into a single sweeping category entitled “Casual,” which may have made an accurate comparison between job classes unattainable. AMUSE also challenged the exclusion of Floor Fellows from the report.
AMUSE and the University agreed to meet in October 2016 to attempt to create a resolution for this dispute. In April 2017, AMUSE proposed a settlement offer which did not receive a response. Also in 2017, McGill’s 2015 pay equity report was released, and the Union found the same errors as in the 2010 report, and proceeded to file another complaint.
AMUSE proceeded to work on two separate courses of action: creating a Pay Equity Committee to revise the pay equity reports and establish a committee review process for future pay equity reports conducted by McGill, and working on a pay equity settlement between the University and AMUSE. In spring 2018, AMUSE and the University began negotiations on the settlement. The settlement included:
The Daily spoke to Meaghan Rye, an AMUSE member and employee for McGill Intramurals, who was compensated through the retroactive payments, as well as the raise for current employees.
For Meaghan, this money was entirely unexpected, and will go towards her next semester of tuition. Rye told the Daily, “we don’t really have too much contact with AMUSE, we know they’re there and I guess they do a lot of work in the background. Now with this, we get to see how much work they’re actually putting in for us.”
