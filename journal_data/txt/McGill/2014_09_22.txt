Demonstrators call for immediate action, better policy 
On September 21, over 5,000 Montrealers joined the People’s Climate March at Parc Lafontaine in a protest against climate change, sending a message to the world leaders attending the United Nations’ (UN) first-ever Climate Summit in New York on September 23. Montreal’s event was one of 2,800 held worldwide in solidarity with the main People’s Climate March in New York City, which saw over 400,000 people take to the streets and claimed the record for the largest climate march in history.
The UN Climate Summit is intended to allow leaders from all over the world a space to discuss climate issues in preparation for the Conference on Climate Change happening next year in Paris.
In an email to The Daily, People’s Climate Montreal coordinator Jenny Loughran said she hoped the march would be inspiring. “Far too often people feel like its too late or that know [sic] one cares. This event was meant to bring people from across Montreal together under one cause. It is not too late to take to reverse the trends, but the time to act is now.”
The march in Montreal started off with performances by a variety of musical groups, including the Raging Grannies, all of whom sang songs against environmentally harmful practices such as fracking and pipeline projects.
After the musical performances, speakers stressed the importance of taking action to protect the environment. Many of the speakers and demonstrators expressed discontent with Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s climate policies, urging for more action from the federal government – some protesters carried signs branding Harper an eco-terrorist.
Several people were also disappointed with Harper’s choice to not attend the UN Climate Summit. Harper will be sending Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq to represent Canada in his place. Phil Comeau, a protester at Sunday’s march, was one of many who objected to Harper’s absence from the summit. “I think that Canada should stop being a dinosaur and be part of our future,” Comeau told The Daily.
Grille, another protester at Sunday’s march, was equally upset by Canada’s lack of action with regard to environmental protection. She said, however, that the problem lay not only with Canada’s policies, but with the people as well. “It’s about time we learned that we should be proud to try and live with the minimum,” said Grille. “Right now, we admire people who are rich, but those people are destroying the planet.”
Carrying a sign that read ‘Degrowth Now,’ Grille explained that people should “minimize what [we] need,” and cited consumerism as an underlying problem. “It’s consumerism, but we have to change that. It’s the trend, yes, but it’s not sustainable, so stop talking about sustainable development, it’s a lie. We [need] to learn the other way around, [we need] to decrease our consumption [instead]. We have to. We are too many, we are six billion people,” Grille said.
Loughran also emphasized the need for a paradigm change. “Many countries who have yet to feel the sting of climate change are reluctant take action because they don’t feel the effects of Climate Change [sic] or they have the resources to deal with problems as they arise. What they don’t see are the poor island states that will be drowned, the rural communities that will no longer be able to scrape a living on marginal land, or the delta dwellers will be swept out to sea in hurricanes – climate victims are not massive carbon polluters, but they will be the first to pay the price of climate change.”
Echoing the urgency of others at the march, Comeau told The Daily, “I think that climate change is a big problem, and it’s getting worse every year. We’re almost at the point of no return, and it’s now or never that we have to change these policies.”

Book launch focuses on the radical change needed to end the climate crisis
“I think the biggest issue, honestly, is that people just think we’re screwed,” Naomi Klein told The Daily when asked why solutions to climate change weren’t working.
Klein, a Canadian author and political commentator, was in Montreal last Tuesday to give a talk marking the release of her book This Changes Everything.
The event – organized by the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Concordia Student Union, Divest McGill, Divest Concordia, Ricochet Media, and Climate Justice Montreal – drew a full house audience at the Imperial Theatre, near Place-des-Arts. The talk was centred around the relationship between activism, capitalism, and climate change, all themes addressed in Klein’s new book.
According to Klein, This Changes Everything focuses on the idea of radical change, a notion she described as “getting at the root of the problem.”
“In the book, the argument I’m making is that when you’re talking about 10 per cent per year emission reductions, you’re talking about challenging the fundamental logic of economic growth,” she said.
“It’s going to take intervention, it’s going to have to be a much more designed economy,” she continued.
Amina Moustaqim-Barrette, SSMU VP External and Divest McGill member, shared her perspective on the event.
“Hopefully it brings students out, it gets the word out […] and people are kind of swayed toward working on climate justice, toward working toward divestment, […] because of these events that are happening,” she said.
Tuesday night’s event featured a photo montage of sites along Enbridge’s proposed Energy East pipeline, shot by Robert van Waarden (a Montreal-based photographer who focuses on climate change). Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, an activist who played a large role in the 2012 Quebec student strike, also spoke to the connection between austerity politics and climate change.
Nadeau-Dubois focused on the penetration of neoliberal economics in the Couillard government’s current policy. He accused the federal and provincial governments of closing their eyes to the risks of the proposed Line 9 pipeline, saying that it is wrong of them to require economic grounds in justifying environmental solutions.
Central to the theme of Tuesday’s presentation was the notion of using activism as a tool to fight climate change; Klein spoke more about this idea with The Daily. “I think the change that we need is so deep and so rapid that the only precedents I can point to in history is times when activism stopped being a small subculture.”
“Without [activism] I don’t see a way to deal with the crisis,” she later remarked. “We’re up against the most powerful and rich forces in the history of money, they’re not going to give this up without a fight.”
Moustaqim-Barrette told The Daily that Klein has encouraged student activism in the past. “Naomi Klein is a big supporter of divestment and has been one of the people who is like the face of divestment. She’s been a great supporter of the the movement.”
However, Klein noted that the purpose of this activism would be more to raise awareness, as she said it is unlikely that actions like these would directly impact large corporations.
“This is not going to bankrupt Exxon,” she remarked in response to an audience question.
“The goal is for these companies to be made into pariahs like tobacco companies,” she added.
Klein later noted that she thought the real potential of fossil fuel divestment was the possibility of reinvesting divested money into socially conscious initiatives.
When asked about the potential for divestment as a movement to keep growing, Moustaqim-Barrette seemed optimistic.
“The momentum we’ve seen in the last few years has been insane and I have met so many people who are just so passionate about this and I really feel like those people are not going to let this die,” she said. “We’re going to keep pushing and we’re going to succeed eventually.”
Klein’s tour continues across North America and Europe, including an appearance on the late-night Colbert Report on September 23.

A selection of events from this year’s installment
Correction appended September 24, 2014.
From September 15 to 19, the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office hosted McGill’s annual Indigenous Awareness Week. The week-long series of events is meant to honour and celebrate Indigenous cultures at McGill and beyond, and help increase awareness within the McGill community about Indigenous peoples. Events included everything from lectures, to panel discussions, to workshops; here is a small selection.
Two-spirits: history and survival | The KAIROS blanket exercise | Healing and decolonizing: impacts of the institutionalization of Indigenous children | Holding the academy accountable: Indigenous studies and community inclusion | Indigenous students at McGill: before and beyond graduation


On Thursday, Ben Geboe, a PhD student at the School of Social Work, gave a lecture about the history and survival of two-spirit people at the Native Friendship Centre of Montreal. The lecture lasted about an hour, and focused on Geboe’s experiences as an Indigenous person in the LGBT community and on the meaning of the concept of two-spirit.
According to Geboe, two-spirit people are those who identify as both female and male. “While everyone has a combination of male and female spirits, two-spirit people have male and female spirits that are the same size,” explained Geboe.
Geboe grew up on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, U.S.. While he said that his tribe was very open to people who identified as gay, not all tribes were as welcoming. “Every community is different and some [did not] have the acceptance mine did,” he said.
Throughout the lecture, Geboe stressed that his tribe didn’t have the same gender binary as the Western world. “The main difference between the Western world and Native world is that [in the Native world] no one can tell you who you are, people have to ask you who you are,” he explained.
Alan Vicaire, the Indigenous Education Advisor for the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office spoke to the goal of Geboe’s talk. “[We want] to create a safe space and open [a] dialogue for Indigenous students at McGill. Our primary goal is to educate students,” he said.

The KAIROS blanket exercise, an interactive event meant to illustrate the history of Indigenous populations and their land, took place on Tuesday. During the event, participants played the roles of Indigenous peoples so that they could relate more directly with the history they were enacting, which also allowed for more emotional engagement with the subject of the exercise.
Organizers covered the floor with blankets to represent Canadian lands as they used to be inhabited by Indigenous people. The participants of the event were invited to freely walk on the blankets, to try get used to them, and to try to feel the connection with the land.
Yao Xi Zhang, a McGill Kinesiology student who participated in the exercise, considered the visual format of the event very helpful.
“They tell you [that people] took the Indigenous populations’ land. You hear it every day in social [science] class. Some country conquered another country. But when you are [standing] on the blanket, and they are folding the corners [to illustrate the land’s usurpation], you realize, ‘Oh. It’s my territory, and it just got smaller.’”
People who attended the event had a desire to learn more about colonization – precisely because the exercise had an emotional effect on the attendees, they found the exercise more illustrative of the colonization of Indigenous lands than class textbooks that aim to convey the same knowledge.
“[The exercise] is actually more important than the textbook, because we read [textbooks so much], we are not so sensitive to it,” Yao noted.
This was the second year in a row that the KAIROS blanket exercise was used during Indigenous Awareness Week. Although event organizers noted that this year’s exercise was a bit different from that of last year, participants still found it impactful and educational.

On Thursday, Lindsey Decontie, executive director of the National Aboriginal Circle Against Family Violence (NACAFV), spoke at McGill about the legacy of residential schools in Canada. Decontie touched on a variety of issues that have a concentrated effect on Canada’s Indigenous women, from familial abuse and homelessness to the reserve system.
Ending in the 1990s, residential schools were a systematic plan to assimilate Indigenous children into white Canadian society funded by the Canadian government. The schools were, as Decontie pointed out, places where “Aboriginal children were told they could not speak their own languages, and where there were many definite cases of physical and sexual abuse.”
Decontie called the residential schools’ legacy today a “historical trauma” that influences, for instance, how an Indigenous woman might seek help after being abused.
As she stated, “what happens is, since they were victims, they might be afraid to ask for help, or reluctant to solve these problems because their self-esteem and self-worth have taken a big hit.”
In her presentation, she elaborated on the “stereotypes and assumptions that do exist, not only about Aboriginals who are in this position but also about the shelters that they seek help from.” As an example, she pointed out the demeaning stereotype that Aboriginal women “will only be victims for as long as it’s profitable to be victims.”
To those who believe the situation is improving as a result increased awareness, Carole Brazeau, National Project Coordinator of NACAFV, pointedly warned, “the problem has not improved, it has gotten worse; it was a crisis ten years ago, and it is still a crisis now.”
When asked what McGill students could do to help, Decontie responded that “oftentimes people might feel that, there’s nothing we can do, this is such a big problem, and I don’t know where to start, but it doesn’t have to be anything big. It can be as simple as volunteering at a women’s shelter, or writing a letter to their local MP [member of parliament].”


On Tuesday, the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office and the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) co-hosted a panel to discuss Indigenous relationships with academia, exploring both the accountability of Indigenous studies programs to the voices of Indigenous peoples, as well as ways to create decolonized spaces in universities.
Moderator Molly Swain read out the questions, written by SEDE over the summer, to a panel consisting of three speakers: Marsha Vicaire, a doctoral student at McGill who is Mi’gmaq (from the Listuguj First Nation); William Straw, a professor at McGill and director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada; and Karl Hele, an associate professor at Concordia and director of its First Peoples Studies program.
Throughout the discussion, Vicaire focused on the perspective of the learner, saying that, as an Indigenous student, she would like to see recognition of the differences between Indigenous and Western culture, as well as recognition that the methods of Indigenous peoples, while different, are also valuable.
“We really need to be valued, respected, and we also need to have that sense of inclusion,” said Vicaire, “so I think those would be things to consider within those spaces, within those learning environments.”
Hele emphasized the importance of teaching the Indigenous community, as it is a complex society composed of different peoples.
“If you’re saying Indigenous studies, it’s got to be […] broad enough to include the other communities within at least McGill’s [reach],” he said.
Hele also encouraged the inclusion of more Indigenous voices and perspectives in the curricula of Indigenous studies programs at universities, stressing the importance of creating a welcoming place for Indigenous employees as well as hiring Indigenous professors to teach topics unrelated to Indigenous issues.
Straw said that those in charge of funding should make Indigenous studies more of a priority. He also criticized the tendency of other departments to make the Indigenous studies department the sole source of accountability for Indigenous issues, and noted a need to integrate more space for Indigenous students within the curriculum.
During the question-and-answer session, an Indigenous audience member and University of Victoria student spoke to the importance of accepting and utilizing alternative methods of research, such as more conversation-based qualitative data, in order to better represent Indigenous communities.
“We have to be looking through an Indigenous lens,” said the student, “and not looking through a separate lens […] and the understandings will come from there.”
In five years, said Vicaire, she would hope to see more second- and third-generation Indigenous students at university, as most Indigenous students are currently first-generation, as well as a more welcoming environment for Indigenous students.
“It’s going to be coming onto this campus knowing ‘yes, I am an Indigenous person and I belong here.’”

On Wednesday evening, Indigenous peoples, scholars, and activists gathered to celebrate Indigenous culture, hear from an alumnus about her experience at McGill, and to rethink McGill’s founding and its relationship with the Six Nations of the Grand River.
Audra Simpson, McGill alumnus and associate professor of anthropology at Columbia University, stepped up to give a different speech than the one that was expected. Simpson did not solely discuss the significance of McGill and of the forms of training she received for her scholarship, as had been planned, but focused instead on the history and legacy of McGill for Indigenous students.
According to Simpson, the founding of McGill is often narrated as stemming from the 1811 endowment from Scottish merchant James McGill. While the financial problems of the institution’s first forty years are often acknowledged, Simpson noted that little attention is paid to the money that was transferred from the Six Nations to McGill in the mid-1800s to rid the university of its financial crisis.
“No mention is made of the crucial transferring of funds from the Six Nations of the Grand River in the 1850s that helped to save McGill from bankruptcy, [and] helped to repair [and] construct buildings. I suspect that was also money that in fact kept the university open,” stated Simpson.
Funds from the Six Nations were used without the permission of the communities during the financial crisis, and McGill has never reimbursed the Six Nations for this outstanding debt, which now adds up to $1.7 billion.
“[This unpaid debt should be paid] through a public acknowledgement, and not a superficial one at that, that McGill was kept afloat because of this unpaid debt […] that needs to be acknowledged rigorously,” she said. “[Indigenous students] should [… also] have scholarships in the name of each person that signed off on this loan, who in different ways contribute to this complicated history and the flourishing of this fine institution.”
Simpson added that compensation for this debt should also be made through hiring more tenured Indigenous scholars and professors. “But what is needed along with this big commitment to revitalizing hidden pasts, forgotten pasts, non-commitments to pasts, is diversifying this university. And here I want to ask, ‘Where are the Indigenous scholars at McGill, scholars in tenured positions?’”
She also noted that McGill’s new Indigenous studies minor is a good start, but that the university should aim for an Indigenous studies major.
“I am very happy to hear that there is an [Indigenous] studies minor. That makes me happy. Let’s go now for a major.”
A previous version of this article stated that Holding the academy accountable: Indigenous studies and community inclusion was hosted by SEDE. In fact, it was co-hosted by SSMU and SEDE. The Daily regrets the error.

Construction on McTavish projected to end by late October
On September 17, Senate held its first meeting of the academic year, discussing the budget, mental health, and the promotion of consent on campus. Senate is the governing body at McGill that controls academic matters, and has representatives from across the university including administrators, faculty, and staff, as well as 13 elected student representatives.
Principal Suzanne Fortier addressed a question from a group of Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) senators regarding the potential effects of the recently announced $172 million in provincial budget cuts to universities in Quebec. According to Fortier, the cuts were anticipated and largely accounted for in the April budget.
“The impact for us is really on not being able to make additional investments that we were hoping to make,” said Fortier. “We don’t think we’re in a crisis situation.”
Fortier did, however, emphasize that the levels of government funding relative to universities in other provinces do have an impact on McGill’s position in university rankings. “Look at those [universities] ahead of us. They enjoy far more favourable financial situations [than McGill],” said Fortier.
In a written response to a question about the promotion of consent on campus submitted by Arts Senator Kareem Ibrahim and SSMU VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Olliver Dyens indicated that the training for frosh coordinators, frosh leaders, and orientation staff has been revised to include information about consent and the bystander effect, and that the 6,000 health kits distributed during Orientation Week included information on consent.
Dyens also indicated that the consent campaign planned for October will replace the Forum on Safe Space announced last March.
Addressing a follow-up question from Stewart-Kanigan regarding the institutionalization of consent training for athletes, Dyens said that although Athletics coaches and staff will participate in the newly introduced bystander intervention program, athletes will not receive specific consent training.
“I’m not going to target one group of students,” said Dyens.
Associate Provost (Policies, Procedures and Equity) Lydia White presented the annual report on the University’s harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination policy, which indicated that 67 per cent of the complaints did not proceed beyond the inquiry stage, thereby not leading to an investigation by the harassment assessors.
In light of this statistic, Medicine Senator David Benrimoh expressed concern that the policy might be failing to fulfill the needs of those who have been harassed or discriminated against.
White argued that these people might be choosing another avenue to pursue their case, such as a complaint to a dean, but noted that no statistics are being collected about those cases.
“If they go somewhere else, we have no way of knowing whether they went or what happened,” said White.
Senate also discussed its response to a question submitted by Stewart-Kanigan and Arts & Science Senator Chloe Rourke regarding the progress of the McGill Student Services’ Mental Health Working Group.
According to Dyens’ response, the group’s report will be available on the Student Services website by the end of the month, and its recommendations are already being implemented. These recommendations include setting up waiting list referrals between McGill Counselling and Mental Health and mental health first aid training for staff.
In response to a follow-up question from Benrimoh regarding concrete hiring and infrastructure changes to mental health provision at McGill, Executive Director of Student Services Jana Luker noted that waiting times at mental health have been reduced to less than two weeks due to staffing changes.
“We are doing this in different ways, but the access issue seems to be under control at this point,” said Luker.
Luker added that outsourcing services during exams could be an option if made necessary by increased demand.
Research Integrity Officer Abraham Fuks presented the Annual Report Concerning the Investigation of Research Misconduct for 2013-14. According to Fuks, six allegations of research misconduct were brought forward against McGill researchers, four of which had sufficient evidence to proceed as investigations. Fuks hypothesized that access to digital information has increased both the opportunity for researchers to falsify data and the likelihood of them being caught doing so.
Stewart-Kanigan also asked for an explanation as to why SSMU’s request to have the Hiawatha Belt Flag raised on National Aboriginal Day, which was June 21, was rejected. Secretary-General Stephen Strople addressed the decision.
“I would not characterize the response of the University as rejection. […] We were not able to fully analyze and consider the request in time for that date.” Strople emphasized, however, that there was a special page put on the McGill website for the occasion.
Following the presentation of the report of the Academic Policy Committee, Senate adopted a final set of changes for a new bachelor’s degree program in bioengineering.
During the opening remarks, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance) Michael Di Grappa provided an update on the McTavish construction project. It is projected to end by late October, with access to the street expected in early November.
“But really, we’re talking about construction in Quebec, so who really knows,” he said.

Funding approval, federal exemption still needed before sites can open

Last week, Montreal’s mayor Denis Coderre announced his intention to release the eventual locations of Montreal’s first supervised injection sites (SISs), though he gave no indication as to when that announcement will come, or when installation will begin.
A similar statement was released in December 2013, which declared that Montreal was soon to welcome four SISs, with locations across the city and one mobile clinic to serve the greater Montreal area.
Supervised injection sites are locations where injection drug users can obtain clean needles, dispose of used ones, access social workers, and receive on-site emergency medical attention if needed. They are part of an initiative known as ‘harm reduction,’ and work to provide safe spaces and non-coercive, non-judgemental care to those trying to fight addiction.
It has been over ten years since Quebec-based organizations such as the Association pour la Défense des Droits et l’Inclusion des personnes qui Consomment des drogues du Québec (ADDICQ), CACTUS Montréal, and Dopamine – located in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood – first started to campaign for SISs to be opened in Montreal after Vancouver opened its first SIS, InSite, in 2003.
The only role that these community-based organizations are playing right now is purely to raise awareness on a local level. “One thing we still can do is [to] have some groundwork [done] in our community in order to make sure that people understand why we need to have this sort of service, and what positive impacts it can have in the community,” Sandhia Vadlamudy, the executive director of CACTUS, told The Daily.
Funding for the sites has yet to be approved, according to Marie-France Coutu, a spokesperson from the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal, and until this is done the project cannot move forward. “We gave a document […] in January, and we are waiting for [Quebec’s provincial health ministry’s …] approval because we need the approbation of the federal government,” she told The Daily in an email.
The initial request for funding was filed by the Montreal Director of Public Health to Quebec’s Ministry of Health and Social Services, asking for $3.2 million initially and an additional $2.7 million annually.
Lucie Charlebois, Quebec Minister for Rehabilitation (Youth Protection and Public Health) declined to comment on her stance regarding SISs and did not respond to emails asking if funding had been approved or when the administration would announce a decision.
Once the funding is approved, the sites will require an exemption from Canada’s drug laws provided by the federal government. However, the Conservative government has shown hostility in the past toward SIS projects, when it refused to renew InSite’s exemption in 2008. Only after InSite appealed to the Canadian Supreme Court did the justices rule against the Conservatives, declaring in 2011 that InSite’s benefit to society trumped Canada’s drug laws.
Assuming the exemption request passes, it will need to be accompanied by a letter outlining security issues written by the Montreal police chief. Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) spokesperson Marie-Elaine Ladouceur confirmed in an email to The Daily that the SPVM has not publicly announced whether it intends to write one.
Only if all of these conditions are met can the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal begin working with community organizations to set up the clinics.
SISs have been controversial since their inception, as they involve the open provision of supplies to individuals who wish to use illegal substances.
InSite began as a pilot project, initiated to address the fact that Vancouver was experiencing the highest HIV transmission rates of any developed country.
While the 2008 Supreme Court decision allowed for the continued existence of InSite, its recommendation that ‘parameters be established’ has resulted in a motion called Bill C-2, or the “Respect for Communities Act.” If passed, the bill will place several conditions on any application for exemption, requiring them to include interviews of local police, doctors, and scientists. The bill is in its second reading.
M-J Milloy, a research scientist at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV and AIDS, an assistant professor in the department of medicine at the University of British Columbia, and a former McGill student, was part of a team that worked on evaluating the effect of InSite on overdose patterns among Vancouver’s intravenous drug users.
“What we’ve found [in Vancouver] is that a site is one good way to begin to meet these needs in ways [that] are not detrimental to other community members,” Milloy told The Daily in an interview. “By that I mean we did not see the site add to levels of drug use, add to levels of drug-related crime, and it does not damage communities’ local conditions to any extent.”
“InSite is right on the edge of Chinatown, and many Chinatown merchants were strongly opposed to the facility before it opened because they feared it would attract more people to the area, and that it would result in more drug use, violence, and litter,” added Milloy. “[Yet] a number of years after the facility opened, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper began making serious moves to close the facility, the heads of the merchant association wrote him a letter saying, ‘Please keep the facility open because of all the wonderful things it’s done for our neighbourhood.”
Anna Marie D’Angelo, the Senior Media Relations Officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, the organization that runs InSite, told The Daily she thinks Bill C-2 will “make it more challenging, if not impossible, for new SISs to start up.”
“For many people it’s a black and white issue. They don’t accept harm reduction, [which is] a research-supported addiction treatment.”
D’Angelo likened the process to smoking cigarettes. “If you look at people who smoke, there are a lot of people who use the patch, which is a form of harm reduction. It seems like when you go over the addiction line into the illicit drugs, everything has to change as far as the addiction treatment, when actually the same kind of principles work.”

Champagne and Jack Daniels rooms in Arts Lounge to be renamed
At its September 17 meeting, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) Legislative Council adopted a motion to acknowledge its position on colonized land at the beginning of every Council meeting, and launched a process to rename the Champagne and Jack Daniels meeting rooms in the Arts Lounge. Council also rejected a motion that would have have imposed restrictions on the composition of the AUS First-Year Events, Academic, and Representative Council (FEARC).
Arts Senators Jacob Greenspon and Kareem Ibrahim presented the Traditional Territory Acknowledgment Motion and explained the importance of explicitly recognizing the occupation of traditional Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) territory, where McGill is located, at the beginning of all sessions of Council as well as on the AUS website.
“McGill is on colonized land, and we just want to give recognition to the fact that the many people [and] populations of where we live experience oppression due to the past histories of the founding people in Canada, and essentially McGill,” stated Ibrahim. “It is basically a gesture that just goes to show that we are a cognizant group of students and that we care about the impacts of our ancestors and, I guess, McGill.”
During the debate period, AUS President Ava Liu expressed concern over the repetitiveness of stating the traditional territory acknowledgment at every Council meeting. “We do not currently either sing the national anthem nor have any other form of political or nationalistic affiliation, so adding it in politicizes something that may not necessarily already be in existence,” added Liu.
AUS VP Social Kyle Rouhani countered Liu’s statement and emphasized that this acknowledgment would serve as a reminder of the colonial occupation of Indigenous land at McGill. “I think that the point of having it at the beginning of every Legislative Council [meeting] is not necessarily that it’s preaching to the choir, but that it’s just constant reminder of the fact that we are all on occupied, colonized land.”
Ibrahim expressed hope that the motion’s success will set a precedent for other student associations as well as McGill’s administrative bodies, such as Senate.
“We hope that passing this motion will have a domino effect on our fellow student associations so that we can work in unison to help impact these important changes to make our community more inclusive,” Ibrahim told The Daily in an email. “And it doesn’t stop there – hopefully once we have student support, we can bring these ideas to bodies like Senate, which would be a huge step forward for McGill.”
Greenspon and Caribbean and Latin American Studies & Hispanic Studies Association Representative Vincent Simboli also brought forth a motion to rename the Champagne and Jack Daniels rooms of the Arts Lounge, used for AUS committee meetings and by the AUS Essay Centre.
Simboli felt that the current names for these rooms promote a drinking culture, which conflict with AUS’ principles of safe space.
“It’s a drinking culture that not everyone participates in and that not everybody can identify with. So I don’t think it’s a responsible thing to have those names.”
The motion passed by a wide majority. AUS’ next listserv email will include a nomination callout for new room names.
The motion to amend FEARC bylaws, which was proposed by VP Internal Leila Alfaro, was the only motion that did not pass at Council. This motion sought to ensure that one executive of FEARC would be a student coming from CEGEP and that another executive would be an international student. Both executives would have been responsible for organizing academic and social events for the first-year students that they respectively represented.
Alfaro told The Daily in an email that she had anticipated resistance from the AUS councillors in passing this motion.
“Because I understand and even expected this, I do not think it’s a big deal that the motion did not pass. In a way, it was meant more as an experiment,” Alfaro added.

Gender-neutral washrooms coming to Redpath Library
As part of the lengthy renovations of the Redpath Library, students can expect revamped washrooms – this time, with one that is accessible and gender-neutral. With partial funding from the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) for the renovations, the construction of the washrooms will tentatively begin in May 2015, with a projected completion date of August 2015. The oversight committee for the Redpath Library washroom renovation project will oversee the planning, design, and implementation of new washrooms.
“The fact that there [are] gender neutral bathroom[s] means that people can just go evacuate bodily fluid without fearing for their lives,” Gabrielle Bouchard, the Peer Support and Trans Advocacy Coordinator at the Centre for Gender Advocacy, told The Daily.
According to the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) Office’s website, “A gender-neutral washroom is a single-person facility which is not labelled male or female but rather is available to anyone, no matter what their gender identity or biological sex.”
The shift to include gender-neutral washrooms is part of a burgeoning trend across Canadian and American campuses. Concordia students and groups have been fighting to include gender-neutral washrooms for over five years. Resources also exist to direct people to existing gender-neutral washrooms, such as SEDE’s comprehensive list of locations on McGill’s campus, and Refuge Restrooms, an international crowdsourced site that offers information about washroom accessibility in general.
Reflecting on their personal views, Leela Scott, the co-op coordinator for the Union for Gender Empowerment and a representative on the oversight committee, wrote in an email to The Daily, “These spaces are important because despite being in an academic institution surrounded by people who would like to think of themselves as very educated and accepting, there are still a lot of really toxic behaviors and opinions present.”
“Even in universities, trans and gender non-conforming people have been subjected to physical, sexual, and emotional violence for using what someone decides for them is the ‘wrong’ bathroom,” they said, adding, “More commonly, a well-meaning person telling someone ‘I think you’re in the wrong bathroom…’ can be very traumatizing for a trans or gender non-conforming person.”
The Redpath Library renovation project did not always include plans for a gender-neutral washroom. Faced with problems securing funding, the Library approached the Library Improvement Fund last year, which is a SSMU fund of student fees and alumni contributions allocated toward capital improvements in McGill’s library.
“As the goal of the fund is not to take over the financing of operational projects from the University, we felt that it would be inappropriate to cover the cost of the entire renovation,” explained Erin Sobat, the Library Improvement Fund Coordinator, in an email to The Daily. “The committee that allocates the fund, which is comprised of student fees matched with alumni contributions, agreed to provide partial seed money in March ‘on the condition that a gender-neutral washroom be included in the redesign.’”
The majority of the members on the oversight committee for the renovations – which will review architectural plans, budgets, and timelines among other things this year – are university staff, but there are also three students, a significant inclusion according to Sobat.
However, Scott told The Daily that they felt tokenized by the committee regarding the fact that they identify as agender, as well as the fact that they have a previous background in gender issues.
“I’m a bit disappointed by the seeming lack of knowledge and research many of the others have. Obviously I know not everyone is interested or has the time to know everything, but gender is a part of this project (as it is with any project, really) and I think it’s their responsibility as paid employees to be aware of these things.”
According to Chuck Adler, the director of Campus and Space Planning (CSP), the Redpath Library project’s inclusion of gender-neutral washrooms was spearheaded by a SEDE report released in the fall of 2013. SEDE compiled a list of locations that had gender-neutral washrooms, as well as those that could be easily changed into gender-neutral washrooms through signage changes, among other things. The Office also looked at the universal access to washrooms on campus, another dimension of the project.
“I thought the teamwork between the SEDE Office, our office [CSP], and the students was really great,” said Adler. “I think it’s a good sort of framework for the University to advance.”
Over the next year, Adler said that CSP will be looking at securing funding for signage, locks, and other basic changes so that they can further convert washrooms on campus.
When asked whether the University has plans for having gender-neutral washrooms in every building, Adler said, “We haven’t projected that far down the road yet […] we’re going to follow the priorities of [SEDE’s report]. That will probably take us through the next year or so, and I guess we’ll reassess it with SEDE to see if we’re still missing needs or not.”
Scott felt that McGill’s progress still left a lot to be desired. “Unfortunately, change comes rather slowly in an institution like this,” they said. “While policy says they’ll strive toward having a ‘gender-neutral’ washroom on each floor in each building, right now some buildings have none, and many others only have [one].”
Although single-stall, gender-neutral washrooms are generally widely welcomed, there are also a few criticism. Bouchard raised concerns that if the gender-neutral washroom were located near gendered (men’s and women’s) washrooms, the person could inadvertently out themselves as trans or feel uncomfortable.
Scott added that they had raised concerns about the original plan for the Redpath Library renovations, which was to have men’s and women’s washrooms along with a single-stall washroom. The committee changed the design to include two gender-neutral stalls, but Scott pointed out that this overlooked the potential for safety problems, adding that they were looking into implementing multi-stall, ‘all-gender’ washrooms along with Sobat.
However, overall, Scott said that the renovations were a good step. “Access to washrooms is something that is often overlooked when thinking about how to make an institution safer because it seems so basic, but really – how many times a day do you go to the washroom? When it’s something you can do easily, without fear, you don’t think about it. But when it’s difficult and/or unsafe it can really affect your life and that’s really unfair.”

Bylaw changes, charter signature fail to pass at first Council meeting of the year
Last Wednesday, the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) held its first Council meeting of the academic year at Thomson House. Councillors discussed the ratification of a charter to protect the rights of student researchers, as well as changes to bylaws and to the Society Activities Manual.
Moved by PGSS External Affairs Officer Julien Ouellet, the ratification of the Charter of the Rights of Student-Researchers was supposed to have been voted on at the August Council meeting, which failed to reach quorum. According to Ouellet’s presentation before Council, the charter was devised by the graduate students’ association of Université Laval, who invited PGSS to co-sign and promote the charter with the hope that it be made into law.
“This is a good opportunity for us to collaborate with another student organization and to have a broad legal framework that would support us in our campaign,” said Ouellet when introducing the document.
Broadly, the charter has six major sections: general provisions, intellectual property, roles and duty of research supervisors, roles and duties of student researchers, role of the home institution, and role of the government. In its current form (as it is still a work in progress), it dictates that student researchers should own 100 per cent of the intellectual property created by their research, and should also be “fully independent” when conducting their research.
“Since this is a charter that would be ratified by the [Quebec] National Assembly, it would have more weight than local university regulation,” said Ouellet, in response to a question on how the charter would be implemented if it came into conflict with university regulations.
However, while it seemed that members agreed with the overall sentiments of the charter, many were concerned about smaller language issues, saying that certain parts were vague, unclear, or should be worded differently. In the end, PGSS decided not to co-sign the charter, opting instead to express agreement with the charter in spirit and to cooperate with students who are behind the charter.
PGSS Secretary-General Juan Camilo Pinto moved a set of bylaw reforms, as well as changes to the Society Activities Manual, which describes the composition and procedures for PGSS’ governing bodies.
The motion would change the name of the Board of Appeals to ‘Judicial Board,’ which is the term used by the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU). It would also remove the Secretary-General from the Board, so that they no longer have a say in appeals decisions, and also change the process by which members of the Board are chosen in order to “generate a more robust appeals process within PGSS,” Pinto told The Daily.
“If we are trying to generate an independent judicial process within PGSS, there is no reason why the president should be able to be also a judge,” said Pinto.
The changes to the Society Activities Manual included striking the ‘anglophone’ qualification from the reference to student associations with which the External Affairs Officer should work. Pinto told The Daily that the change was meant to show that “PGSS will strive to work together with other universities in Quebec.”
The bylaw reforms failed to pass, and were sent to the Policy and Structure Advisory Committee (PSAC), which will suggest improvements on the changes and return them to Council by its next meeting. The Society Activities Manual reforms were approved, and the motion will return to Council in October to undergo its second reading.

Workshop facilitators highlight barriers to accessible food in Montreal
September 19 marked the final day of Bite Me!, the Concordia Food Coalition’s week-long series of events designed to introduce students to food politics. That afternoon, Satoshi Ikeda of Concordia’s department of sociology and anthropology and Hugo Martorell, co-founder of Justice Alimentaire Montréal, facilitated a group discussion on structural racism in food systems.
Ikeda began by challenging participants to reflect on the nature of racism and on their personal experience with it. Ikeda argued that “there are structural features of Montreal that do not favour certain groups of people” when it comes to access to food.
Using location as a barrier to food accessibility to illustrate his statement, Ikeda noted that Montreal’s major grocery chains tend to concentrate their stores in more affluent neighbourhoods, while at the same time raising prices in these areas. As a result, he explained, they are less accessible to low-income families, who often end up in one of the city’s ‘food deserts,’ forced to travel prohibitively long distances to reach a grocery store.
In a 2010 article, Le Devoir found 17 ‘food deserts’ in Montreal, including Faubourg St. Laurent and Montreal North. He stated that it is no accident that these areas are home to ethnic minorities. Statistics show that the average income of such groups is consistently below the national average. Ikeda explained that structural racism is at work in a world where your access to food depends largely on your income, and where your income is influenced, at least in part, by your race.
Ikeda noted that the consequences of this imbalance in food access are both far-reaching and difficult to counter. With fresh produce virtually inaccessible, many low-income families tend to rely heavily on fast food and the limited selection available at their local dépanneur. This, in turn, increases their vulnerability to diet-related health problems, from diabetes and heart disease to numerous vitamin deficiencies.
Addressing the problem of how to challenge the deeply entrenched structural racism in our food industry, Ikeda stressed the importance of regaining food sovereignty. “To me, sovereignty is not just to know, but to have control over [where our food comes from],” said Ikeda. “If it comes from your backyard, you have 100 per cent food sovereignty.”
As first steps toward food sovereignty, participants suggested participating in an urban agriculture project to support local and organic farmers, as well as spreading the word about food health in areas where education on the topic may be lacking.
One participant raised the question of whether a particular entrepreneur can be morally faulted and held personally responsible if they disadvantaged certain groups when trying to maximize their profits. Ikeda answered that it would be too easy to simply blame the system and shrug off individual responsibility. The discussion group did not come to a consensus on this issue.
Several attendees also commented on how valuable they thought the exchange of perspectives had been. “I’ve been looking for this kind of conversation for a long time,” said one attendee. “I admit, I’m under-educated, and there’s no way I could be fully educated – because I’m not everyone.”
In closing, Ikeda cautioned attendees on their implication in food racism. “I try to make each student realize that you are actually implicated in the discriminatory structure […] often, you are even its beneficiaries,” said Ikeda. “We are all victims, but we are also implicated.”

Full shuttle buses leave Mac campus-bound students behind
The first weeks of the semester have been burdensome for many Macdonald campus students, as demand for the inter-campus shuttle that transports students between the downtown and Macdonald campuses has been largely exceeding capacity at certain hours. Every day, full shuttle buses leave behind many students attempting to commute to Macdonald in the morning and downtown in the evening.
“We’re now getting 25 to 30 students left behind on the 7:30 [a.m.] bus, for example,” U3 Environmental Science student Kristen Perry told The Daily. “It’s really unacceptable. We need to get to classes, and we can’t get to our labs or course lectures if the buses are full all the time, and there’s just not enough buses, or they’re not scheduled properly to get us where we need to go.”
The 48-seat shuttles, which are scheduled to run at 45-minute intervals from 7:00 a.m. to 6:15 p.m., take about 40 minutes to complete a trip that takes upwards of an hour and a half by public transit. Students sometimes line up at the bus stop over half an hour before their scheduled shuttle in order to secure one of the limited seats, further lengthening their commutes.
The availability of the shuttle service has been an ongoing concern for many of the 1,900 students who take classes at the Macdonald campus, with Daily coverage of the issue going back to 2008. Students’ concerns have been brought to the administration numerous times, but no substantial improvements have been made in response to these complaints.
“It’s definitely still not working the way we have it right now,” said Perry.
In fact, students have reported a worsening situation this year, with record numbers of students unable to get to class on time. “I can’t remember a time when this many students were consistently missing class this often,” said U2 Global Food Security student Marius Karolinski in an interview with The Daily. “It is more of a problem now than it was in the past.”
Perry, who is now in her fourth year at McGill, echoed this sentiment. “In the previous years it’s been, you know – ten, fifteen people maybe get left behind on a fairly regular basis, but this semester in particular it’s been particularly bad […] on the buses I take at least,” said Perry. “It’s definitely gotten worse.”
“One shuttle is over-full, then throughout the day […] there’s overflow, it goes into the next shuttle, into the next shuttle – people just repetitively miss their classes,” added Perry.
On September 8, Perry expressed her frustration in what she called “a little Twitter rant,” garnering attention from other students, as well as from Macdonald Campus Associate Dean Chris Buddle, who offered his help.
Perry’s tweets sparked organizing efforts in the Macdonald community. On September 11, Perry and U2 Nutrition student Maddy Hackstetter created a Facebook group titled “Intercampus Shuttle Incidents,” where students have been actively posting reports of early departures and overflowing shuttles, complete with time of departure, numbers of students left behind, and photos and video recordings.
“The reason [the group] is effective is that it’s a lot more of an accessible forum for students than having to email the shuttle office – they do have an email, which I’ve emailed before, but it doesn’t seem to do much,” Perry told The Daily. “Now I think we’re collecting a lot of complaints from students. […] It wasn’t that volume before, and I think that’s going to be helpful in really showing the extent of the problem.”
Hackstetter and Perry also launched a survey to collect data on students’ place of residence and time and location of classes, in order to be better equipped in discussions with the administration. “We also got people to fill out the shuttles they normally would take to get to class and back home by time, so we have that data and that’s going to be really helpful when we’re trying to rearrange the schedule or find a solution,” said Perry.
The Macdonald Campus Students’ Society (MCSS) executive has also been working on the issue.
“MCSS is currently talking to [all the] stakeholders at McGill in relation to the shuttle,” MCSS President Mathieu Rouleau told The Daily in an email. “We met with the Principal [Suzanne Fortier] and the Deputy Provost [(Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens] this past Tuesday.”
Representatives from MCSS will join Hackstetter and Perry this week to meet with Buddle and Gary O’Connell, Director of Academic and Administrative Services at the Faculty of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences, to discuss possible solutions to the problem.
“We are planning on looking at the current issues and creating an action plan,” said Rouleau.
While the University would incur significant costs if it added buses to the shuttle service, students have brought forward solutions that do not require additional resources. Perry suggested that a reallocation of existing buses to suit demand could solve the problem.
“If we were to have three shuttles leave from downtown in the morning, and then in the evening have the opposite – three shuttles coming from Mac – instead of having an equal two-and-two split, I think that would match the volume in demand,” said Perry.
According to a post on the Facebook group by MCSS VP Academic Stéfanie Thibert, the administration is considering imposing a fee to students who take the shuttle in order to increase the frequency of service.
For Perry, however, charging students is not an acceptable solution. “We shouldn’t have to pay another fee on top of what we already pay, I think, just to be able to get to our classes,” she said.
In a joint email to The Daily, Buddle and O’Connell agreed that the problem was a logistical one, but expressed doubts that the reallocation of resources could be a solution, instead putting the onus on students to use alternate means of transportation.
“[W]e have the proper resources overall, but […] given the logistical constraints, we are not always able to meet the early morning or late afternoon demand,” they wrote. “[G]iven additional complexities of rush-hour traffic and the distance between the campuses, there are limits to how many departures are possible. […] We […] may be close to the limits of what can be done to meet the demand at peak times, based on the number of buses and drivers we have.”
“[I]t may be necessary to promote other transportation options for students who are true ‘commuters,’” Buddle and O’Connell added.
Nonetheless, Perry was optimistic about the upcoming meeting with Buddle and O’Connell.
“We’ll have a lot more data collected by then, and hopefully be able to go in with some strong suggestions for positive change.”

Changes part of larger emphasis on consent promotion, community culture
This August, over 1,200 students underwent a new server training program at McGill in preparation for their roles as Open Air Pub (OAP) servers, Frosh leaders, and Orientation Week staff. The program, developed as a joint project between Campus Life & Engagement and Healthy McGill, was meant to put a stronger emphasis on bystander intervention and the role of alcohol in sexual violence.
The changes to server training come as a part of a series of changes happening on campus with regard to promoting consent, as well as changes to how Frosh is run in general. Liaison Officer (Harm Reduction) Bianca Tétrault ran a bystander intervention workshop during McGill’s Safety Week, and has a consent campaign in the works for October.
Joyce Chong, who underwent the training in preparation for her role as a Science Frosh leader, was pleased with the training. “It was very applicable, it was very helpful, and it was very intensive,” Chong told The Daily. “I feel like they really upped it this year.”
According to Amanda Unruh, Health Promotion Coordinator at Student Health Services and one of the designers of the new training program, this restructuring has been in the works for a while. “I’ve been aware of the fact that there are consent issues relating to alcohol for quite some time, but it wasn’t until last summer, in 2013, that we decided to do a revamp of [the training] based on what are called bystander intervention programs,” Unruh told The Daily.
Unruh explained that bystander intervention programs, active at other Canadian universities such as the University of Toronto and the University of Windsor, are meant to train students to be comfortable intervening in situations where alcohol is present that could potentially lead to violence, particularly sexual violence. “Alcohol is very prevalent in cases of university sexual violence,” noted Unruh.
Clare Knutson, an orientation week staffer, noticed the difference between the 2014 server training and the server training she underwent at McGill in 2011.
“The first round seemed very McGill-oriented […] and the second round seemed more community-oriented,” said Knutson. “2011 seemed to be more about school, and this year seemed to be more about culture, [in the sense of] drinking culture on campus, especially within the context of Frosh.”
Nicholas Proulx-Jones, who also underwent the training, agreed with Knutson’s sentiment.
“They brought up McGill at the end […] they went over consent and the effects of drinking in more detail, and more of what your role as an ethical person in a drinking environment should be,” Proulx-Jones said.
The training placed heavy emphasis on the ‘3 Ds’ of bystander intervention: to directly approach someone and check in on the situation, to distract someone who is causing a potentially unsafe situation, or to delegate someone else to intervene in a situation.
“I know a lot of people really connected to the feeling of ‘well, I don’t want this to happen, but what can I do,’ and so we provided really tangible things that they could do,” said Unruh.
While Knutson learned a lot at the training, she was not sure that it made her more empowered as a bystander.
“I feel, for me, it would be really hard to cut somebody off [from drinking] especially with Frosh and OAP,” said Knutson, who noted that more focus on this type of intervention could be helpful in future training.
Last week, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens noted that this year’s Frosh included more intensive staff training and increased communication with the Milton-Parc community, with which Frosh has historically sour relations.
Overall, Unruh is satisfied with the training changes. “I often get calls from other universities asking, ‘How do you run that, that’s so incredible.’ Concordia used our server training program as a basis for a lot of their leader training this year. I think its a great program.”

Unable to donate blood, members volunteer and bring fruit for donors
Last week, during the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) blood drive, Queer Engineer protested restrictions that keep men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood. The campaign was unconventional as it involved members of Queer Engineer, a group that supports queer people in science and engineering, volunteering alongside others to facilitate the running of the drive.
The campaign was initiated by Rodrigo Cubedo of Queer Engineer. Cubedo told The Daily in an email that he got the idea after he was denied the opportunity to donate blood, due to a restriction that does not allow men to donate blood if they have had sex with a man in the last five years.
“Once I looked into it, I couldn’t believe how unjust and outdated this rule [is],” wrote Cubedo. After being denied, Cubedo mobilized Queer Engineer, involving them in this issue that, in his eyes, infringes on gay rights.
Cubedo wrote that the immediate goal of Queer Engineer was to get Héma-Québec to allow its members to contribute to the blood drive. “The group brought bananas and apples to give away to donors and volunteered along with Héma-Québec, helping to distribute and finish Héma’s information pamphlets.”
According to Cubedo, this alternative method of protesting the exclusionary regulations was intended to be more collaborative with Héma-Québec, as they did not want to “aggravate the situation and bring us backward in our battle to keep our rights moving forward.”
Cubedo said that Queer Engineer will do more to campaign at the next drive in January, where it will be employing similar tactics as well as distributing ‘End the Ban’ fliers to further promote getting rid of these regulations.
Prospective blood donors must meet an exhaustive list of 31 criteria, which include drug use, possible symptoms of illness, and previous medical history; question 19 is, “Male donors: In the past five years, have you had sex with a man, even once?” Answering ‘yes’ to question 19 ends in a five-year ban from Canadian Blood Services.
In the mid-1980s following the AIDS epidemic, Canada followed the U.S. and the United Kingdom (UK), as well as many other countries, in banning MSM from donating blood. The policy was instituted with the intent of screening out donors who are supposedly more likely to have diseases.
Canadian Blood Services justifies its exclusionary regulations by claiming that the groups it targets are at greater risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases. “The criteria that Canadian Blood Services uses to determine the eligibility of blood donors are based on scientific knowledge of risk factors,” the organization’s website reads. “Screening out people at greater risk of transmitting blood-borne infections is necessary to safeguard the people who receive donated blood.”
In 2013, the Canadian Blood Services changed its policy from a lifelong ban to a five-year deferral. The UK shortened its deferral to one year back in 2011, and the ban in the U.S. remains permanent.
Héma-Québec representative Pierrette Lavergne told The Daily that the policy is likely to remain “stable.”
