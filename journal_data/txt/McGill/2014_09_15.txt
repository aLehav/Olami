Councillors create ‘yes’ committee for building fee question
The 36 members of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council held their first meeting of the year on September 11. Council discussed the impending review of SSMU’s electoral bylaws, the upcoming Shatner building fee Fall referendum question, and the recent changes to food provision services at McGill.
SSMU’s returning Chief Electoral Officer Ben Fung spoke before Council to present recommended changes to SSMU’s electoral bylaws, which he has been researching throughout the summer since last year’s electoral outcome. Among Fung’s suggestions were the introduction of a new demerit system, a shortening of the polling period, a switch to a preferential ballot voting system, and the creation of an elections review board.
The demerit system would create more transparency in judging campaigns for infractions – such as the exceeding of candidates’ campaign budgets and the hanging posters in prohibited locations – and imposing sanctions.
A change in the polling period from five to three days, Fung said, would “decrease the amount of overlap between campaigning and polling, as voters at the beginning of the voting period [wouldn’t] have less information about the candidates compared to voters who are voting at the end of the voting period.”
Fung also hopes to implement a preferential ballot voting system for future SSMU elections, which would allow for the transfer of a vote for a losing candidate to the voter’s second choice. Fung claimed this would be a better system than the current first-past-the-post system, which he called “not the most democratic or representative way of voting.” The change would have to be approved at a SSMU General Assembly, the first of which will be on October 22.
Motivated by feedback from students, Fung also stated that he wished to implement an elections review committee, to be convened “in very difficult judgement decisions in elections.” Fung indicated that he is unsure if the committee should be made up of councillors or of a pool of “unbiased members-at-large” of SSMU’s constituency.
In consideration of Fung’s investigation into the proposed bylaw changes, Council approved a motion for the creation of an ad hoc bylaw review committee to formalize the proposed changes. 
“A number of changes need to be made,” said SSMU President Courtney Ayukawa. 
Following last year’s loss of the Sustainability Coordinator position, Council also created an ad hoc Sustainability Committee, with the permanent institutionalization of the committee to be explored by the end of Winter 2015.
Council passed a motion for the creation of a ‘yes’ campaign committee for the Shatner building fee question on the first Fall referendum, to be held starting September 24. The referendum question will propose the creation of a fee levy of $5.78 per semester for full-time students to pay for the increased rent and utilities cost in the recently signed lease agreement between SSMU and the administration. The fee was previously rejected by students in the Winter 2014 referendum, and last year’s executive has been criticized for not having campaigned for the fee.
In her report to Council, VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan shared her plans to act regarding the diminishing amount of accessible food options on campus. “I’m aware that people are mad about the Tim Hortons,” Stewart-Kanigan said, referring to the replacement of the Tim Hortons in the Redpath library basement with the more expensive Première Moisson. 
Stewart-Kanigan indicated that she will continue to meet with the Libraries in order to express student discontent with the changes. She cited the lack of student consultation as unacceptable, since the library is a space that is “virtually exclusively used by students.” While the Tim Hortons outlet is not likely to return to the basement of the Redpath Library, “cheaper options are a future possibility,” she said.

Taking initiative important, says group director at Safety Week event
Last Wednesday, Yassmin Behzadian, director of the McGill Student Emergency Response Team (M-SERT), hosted a talk as part of McGill’s Safety Week in the Redpath Library. In keeping with the week’s theme of “internal responsibility,” Behzadian focused her talk on the barriers that bystanders face when responding to emergencies, and how these barriers can be overcome.
M-SERT is a student-run organization that provides on-call emergency responders to McGill events, such as intramural hockey games, 4Floors, Frosh, and Gerts. They also provide emergency care to McGill residences every day from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and have office hours from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. in room B-23 in the Shatner building where students can drop in for emergency care. Members serve, on average, 230 hours per year, or around 13,000 hours total last year, Behzadian told the crowd.
Behzadian, who has been involved with M-SERT for the past three years, said that she hoped to educate her audience on how to be helpful in an emergency situation. “In addition to providing first aid coverage, it’s also our goal to move toward a community where knowing or having first aid knowledge and acting on first aid knowledge is the norm and not the exception,” said Behzadian.
When asked by an audience member, Behzadian said that intoxication is the most common cause behind calls to M-SERT. “It starts out being intoxication, but then you find out that there are secondary injuries, so a person could be intoxicated and then they fall down the stairs.”
She added that a lot of emergencies at McGill happen during orientation. “If you’ve seen us at Frosh, you know that the majority of our calls come from that one week of insanity,” she said.
There are four major barriers that a bystander may face that could prevent them from acting in an emergency situation, Behzadian explained: fear of catching the disease, discomfort at the sight of gruesome injuries, fear of making the situation worse (and/or potentially getting sued), and the assumption that in a large group of people someone else will provide aid.
“These should not be barriers to calling 911,” said Behzadian, noting that calling does not require consent from the patient or require any direct contact with the patient.
She explained that it is quite difficult to contract an illness from helping someone if the necessary precautions are taken, such as wearing gloves and using a resuscitation mask (these items are easy to keep and transport on a regular basis). If the person’s wounds are too unsightly one should take a deep breath to calm down, and then try their best to help if they are able.
In addition, every province in Canada aside from Saskatchewan and New Brunswick has what is termed a “good samaritan law” to provide legal protection to citizens who offer help and unintentionally cause injuries, as long as they are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Finally, Behzadian addressed the bystander effect, and called on individuals to feel personally responsible for the well-being of the person, even if there are other people around at the time.
“Never assume that someone is receiving care just because you see a crowd of people around them. You should always take initiative, approach the person, and see if they want or need your assistance,” she said.
“If you find out the person is already receiving care, there’s still a lot that you can do – you can be on crowd control, you can make sure that the patient is receiving their fair amount of privacy, you can call 911 if it hasn’t been been [called], there’s basically no shortage of things you can do in this scenario.”
Sacha Fyson, a McGill neuroscience student who attended the talk, said he found discomfort in the face of injury a surprising barrier to action. “I didn’t think that people would be necessarily afraid of injuries or blood or sickness and things like that,” Fyson told The Daily. “I knew about the bystander effect already, but I didn’t know that that was actually a factor inhibiting some people.”

Bystander intervention training to start with Athletics
In one of her first public appearances on campus, Liaison Officer (Harm Reduction) Bianca Tétrault led a workshop on the prevention of sexual violence through bystander intervention last Monday, as part of McGill’s annual Safety Week. Tétrault has occupied the position since its creation last March, following widespread condemnation of the University’s inaction in a highly publicized sexual assault case involving three Redmen football players.
Sparsely attended, the workshop drew a crowd of about twenty people – only a few of whom were students – and lasted a bit over an hour. Tétrault began by compelling the audience to engage with some common myths about sexual assault, before moving on to an introduction to the bystander intervention program. The program aims to help participants develop skills for preventing sexual assault and assisting survivors.
“I found [the workshop] incredibly informative because it addressed a lot of issues,” said U1 Linguistics student Munyaradzi Guramatunhu. “We started with the myths. So first of all, [the workshop] addresses how people are thinking, and then […] guides them to [what] they should be thinking. […] A lot of the time people know that things like this are happening, but they don’t know how to respond, so it wasn’t just telling you sexual assault is happening – it was actually giving you the tools of how you’re supposed to deal with that.”
Tétrault highlighted the importance of noticing situations where people perpetuate harmful beliefs about sexual violence, and encoraging them to think of the harm they are causing.
“It’s a self-reflection that we have to start asking ourselves internally, because the more and more we’re able to identify when that tends to happen around us day to day, the more we’re going to start realizing [the] uses [of bystander intervention],” she said.
Tétrault then showed the audience a video clip that recounted an instance of sexual assault, and illustrated how it could have been prevented by bystanders as the situation was developing. For Guramatunhu, however, the video did not depict the perpetrator’s reactions in a realistic manner.
“I think it was just in the video that the guy didn’t have a tendency to be violent,” said Guramatunhu. “I think that the presentation should have included the case – so, what do you do if the person you’re intervening with does get violent?”
As one of the few students in attendance, Guramatunhu expressed concern about the low turnout and suggested repeating the workshop at regular intervals. “[The turnout] was quite sad because it’s something that can happen to anyone, not just the ten people who actually bothered to pitch up,” Guramatunhu said. “So people should be more interested.”
In an interview with The Daily, Tétrault explained that she saw the workshop as a testing ground for a full two-day iteration of the bystander intervention program that will be run in the Winter semester.
“The original program is meant to be a lot longer: there’s case scenarios that people can engage in and practice what it means to be a bystander and how to identify certain situations. There’s a lot more talk around […] how a lot of harmful behaviours are normalized in our society,” said Tétrault. “I am going to be starting it hopefully just before Christmas with Athletics – their coaches and staff have agreed to undertake the program as well [as the athletes], because it’s for anybody in the community.”
In addition, a consent campaign, involving an art collage, a social media component, and various events on campus, is in the works; it will be held in October.
“The campaign is really to engage the community around consent and […] how to apply it in your life in regards to sexual activity and day-to-day interactions,” Tétrault told The Daily. “It’s not going to be an approach where we tell everybody what it is. We really want students to engage with us, to let us know how they practice it, how it feels, and what it means to them emotionally, consent.”
Guramatunhu was enthusiastic about Tétrault’s upcoming work. “If there was a way we could get everybody to come and sit and watch this, I think we should,” she said.

Changes to CSUS constitution, general assembly date approved at SUS Council
The Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) Council held its first meeting of the year last Wednesday, where it approved an updated version of the Computer Science Undergraduate Society (CSUS) constitution, creating a VP Diversity position. Council also elected former SUS President Danielle Toccalino as Chief Returning Officer and set the date for the SUS Fall general assembly.
The newly updated CSUS constitution is meant to encourage member participation in CSUS by eliminating the requirement to be a computer science major to run for Council. The ratio of members to executives required for quorum has been reduced, and a VP Diversity position has been added. Additionally, a general assembly is no longer needed to change the constitution; it can now be changed by Council.
At the meeting, CSUS President Calem Bendell said that the position of VP Diversity was added primarily due to requests from students. At the end of last spring, when the constitution was being rewritten, six different people – four of whom were women – requested the creation of the position.
“Having a VP Diversity seemed wise when the people I discussed these issues with said they sometimes felt uncomfortable with the general computer science student body,” Bendell told The Daily in an email.
Bendell explained that the position will be more investigative, at least in the beginning. “The goal isn’t to make the student body more diverse – I don’t think there’s much we can do to directly affect that – but instead to make everyone who is already in the student body more comfortable. CSUS’ power to change this situation is unclear, but it should be thoroughly explored,” he wrote.
Other changes included a decrease in the required turnout at to pass a CSUS referendum from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the constituency, and the elimination of “bureaucratic” rules and procedures, such as Robert’s Rules (a formal set of rules that govern parliamentary procedures), from CSUS proceedings.
Council set the date for the Fall 2014 SUS general assembly, which will take place on November 5.
In addition, the SUS extended the applicability of its electoral bylaws to the Freshman Undergraduate Science Society (FUSS) elections, which will begin on September 15; this was done in order to  clarify the rules for FUSS elections. Toccalino will now oversee both SUS and FUSS elections procedures to make sure that campaigns follow the bylaws.
SUS Executive Revenue Officer Sibat Anam also informed Council that SUS has signed a contract dictating that Kaplan Test Prep will be the sole sponsor of SUS. Anam noted that this does not affect individual departments, who may sign contracts with other sponsors, dependent upon SUS approval.

“Healthy and local” too pricey for some
McGill has recently undergone drastic changes in its provision of food services on campus – most notably, the replacement of Sinfully Asian in the Bronfman building with Quesada Burritos & Tacos and Bento Sushi, as well as the opening of a Première Moisson express outlet in the basement of the Redpath Library on September 2.
“It’s impossible to find a decent, cheap place to eat on campus,” Vita, a U2 Arts student, told The Daily. “I feel like they’re trying to go for fancy looks and a nice atmosphere rather than trying to [address] students’ needs. I really feel like it’s meant to be more for McGill’s image, rather than what students need.”
In an email to The Daily, Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) president Ava Liu echoed Vita’s concerns over the accessibility of food on campus, and also raised questions about students’ participation in the decision to replace the small food court in Redpath Library, particularly the Tim Hortons, with a Première Moisson.
“Taking into account the Redpath [cafeteria’s] importance of location and the emphasis that students place on financial accessibility, I am curious about the consultation that went into bringing in this considerably more expensive option. I think this is a valid concern that many Arts students currently have,” said Liu.
Senior Director of McGill’s Student Housing and Hospitality Services (SHHS) Mathieu Laperle told The Daily in an interview that the change in food outlets in Redpath Library did take student voices into account.
“It was consultation with the Dean [of Libraries] and some students and the annual survey that we do. We were able to get information and it was needed to do some renovation [in the cafeteria] because it was outdated.”
John, a U3 Science student, was pleased with the variety of food offered in the Bronfman building.
“I really, really enjoyed Sinfully Asian. […] But considering that there is a Japanese option, and I really do like Mexican food, and there’s literally no options for Mexican food around Montreal in general, I really think it’s all in all a gain.”
“I personally quite like Quesada, especially taking into consideration the buzz on campus last year around bringing in Mexican cuisine to the Bronfman building. I think this choice tapped into general student input,” added Liu.
In fact, students’ opinions of Sinfully Asian were gathered in a widespread survey conducted by the Management Undergraduate Society (MUS) last fall. It received 1,401 responses, most of which indicated a preference for healthier food, and preferably a Mexican food option as well.
“We knew the lease was ending back in May and basically we worked with SHHS to get feedback on Sinfully Asian and inform the bidding process for the summer,” MUS President Sean Finnell told The Daily.
As Aramark Canada approached the end of its contract as the food services provider of the university, SHHS sought a new food provider through a competitive tender process, wherein the company that has the most attractive offer is allotted the contract.
On March 27, the Board of Governors’ executive committee approved SHHS’s request to proceed with the competitive tender process and authorized Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens to sign the contract with the successful bidder of the competitive tender process.
The winning bidder in the provision of food services was Compass Group and one of its sectors, the Bon Appétit management company.
Executive chef of SHHS Oliver De Volpi told The Daily that Compass and Bon Appétit will put a high priority on making foods, such as soup stwock, from scratch.
SHHS Marketing and Nutrition Counselor Monique Lauzon did not respond to The Daily’s requests for comment.
Other food locations to be opening soon include E-Café in the McConnell Engineering Building and Vinh’s Too in the Strathcona Music Building.

Ongoing litigation keeps student associations in limbo
Founded in 1981, the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) is an association of various student unions from all around Canada. CFS has been involved with multiple disaffiliation lawsuits in the past few years, with allegations of corrupt, overly bureaucratic tactics from various student associations. Here is a select overview of the cases, from across the country.
The problems between the Post-Graduate Students’ Society of McGill University (PGSS) and CFS started back in 2010, when PGSS held a disaffiliation referendum to leave CFS with 86 per cent of students voting to leave the organization. However, the results of the referendum were not recognized by CFS. This disagreement was eventually brought to the Superior Court of Quebec; after four years, the case is still ongoing.
Earlier in 2014, McGill PhD student and PGSS Internal Affairs Officer Ge Sa submitted a petition to CFS that requested another referendum. According to Sa, CFS failed to recognize the petition in a timely manner, and as such Sa had a hearing at the Superior Court of Quebec on March 18 to request a trial for a court-mandated referendum. 
During the trial, which took place on August 28 and 29, François Viau, the lawyer for CFS, argued that PGSS should not claim in one case that it was no longer a member of CFS, while, in Sa’s case, presupposing that it was still a member of CFS.
However, the court’s decision, which was released on September 9, ruled in Sa’s favour and mandated that PGSS hold a disaffiliation referendum. In the decision, Justice Gérard Dugré said, “The plaintiff has demonstrated a clear legal and quasi­constitutional right that a referendum take place.”
In a press release following the judgement, Sa said, “This judgement sets a precedent for all Canadian students who believe in freedom of association.”
On March 9, CFS rejected a petition by the University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU) to hold a disassociation referendum, on the grounds that the threshold for the number of legitimate signatures, which is 20 per cent of all members, was not met.
Speaking to The Daily on behalf of CFS, CFS staffer Brent Farrington said that the process by which CFS decides whether or not the the threshold is met requires the university to release a list of students. 
However, Walter Callaghan, chair of the UTGSU Litigation Committee, told The Daily in an email that it is contrary to the privacy policies of the University of Toronto (U of T) to release such a list.
CFS had also asked McGill to provide a list of students for Sa’s petition. In McGill’s case, the university initially refused to do so, but eventually did release the list. According to Farrington, this is customary practice with disaffiliation petitions. 
U of T, however, refused to release this list. As a compromise, CFS contacted Deloitte Touche, a third-party audit firm who, according to Farrington, determined that the petition did not meet the threshold, and thus the vote was not held; however, the validity of the petition is still disputed.
In an open letter to its members on July 14, UTGSU said that CFS “did in fact act and plan to act in ways that bring question to their use of discretion in the petition verification process and ensuring of procedural fairness in dealing with [their] members’ petitions.” 
UTGSU is ultimately leaving the issue of the petition’s validity to the legal system. “It will be the determination of a judge of the Superior Court of Ontario upon which these matters will ultimately be decided,” read the letter. 
In January 2011, the University of Victoria Students’ Society (UVSS) and University of Victoria student José Barrios petitioned to hold a referendum of disassociation to leave CFS. However, CFS did not approve the validity of the petition, as a counter-petition had been signed by students who claimed to have been tricked into signing the original petition.
Following this incident, Barrios and UVSS petitioned the Supreme Court of British Columbia for a referendum. The court ruled that, by declaring the first petition invalid, CFS had breached its own bylaws. Soon after, a referendum was held and students voted in favour of disassociation from the national component of CFS – this disassociation did not apply to the provincial branch, CFS-British Columbia (CFS-BC). UVSS did not get the chance to vote to leave the provincial branch.
“After the students at [University of Victoria] delivered a petition seeking a referendum in the spring of 2013 on the question of whether to leave the CFS-BC, the CFS-BC decided to expel the UVSS before the referendum was to take place,” said UVSS chairperson Kayleigh Erickson in an email to The Daily.
David Borins, who was the lawyer for UVSS in its litigation with CFS, told The Daily in an email that several disputes have arisen since 2008 in connection with referenda to vote on leaving CFS and CFC-BC. These conflicts can stem from a wide variety of technicalities, ranging from uncertainty over when campaigning is allowed, to whether or not petitions really do have enough support, to even “the validity of the referendum itself.”
The Concordia Student Union (CSU) and the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) have also been involved in litigation against CFS. CSU held its disassociation referendum in February 2010, and GSA in March 2010. While the results of both referenda were in favour of leaving the federation, CFS refused to acknowledge the results.
In March 2011, CSU filed a lawsuit against CFS, asking the federation to recognize the results of its referendum and demanding $100,000 in damages. GSA also filed a similar lawsuit around that time. 
In response, CFS filed a countersuit in December 2011, arguing that CSU owed roughly $1.8 million in unpaid membership fees to CFS. The two individual cases filed by CSU and GSA were then combined into a single case in January 2013.
However, because of a case between CFS and the Rassemblement des associations étudiantes (RAE, formerly CFS-Quebec), there was an issue in determining to whom exactly CSU and GSA owed the membership fees. On September 5, the Quebec Superior Court ruled that CFS-Quebec had indeed been the provincial component of CFS between 2007 and 2010, and therefore any membership fees owed from that period were to be paid to RAE and not CFS.
The trial for this joint lawsuit is expected to be held later in 2015. According to CSU President Benjamin Prunty, CSU plans to uphold the results of the referendum as valid, and no longer recognizes itself as a part of CFS.

Commissioners to collect testimonies spanning 24 years
September 12 and 13 marked the debut of the public hearings of the Popular Commission on Political Repression (CPRP), aimed at collecting the information necessary to publish a comprehensive report on political and police repression in Quebec from 1990 to the present.
Taking place at Concordia University, the Montreal hearings were the first in a series of six. The next audiences will be held in Quebec City on October 27, followed by sittings in Gatineau, Kanehsatà:ke, Sherbrooke, and Uashat-Maliotenam, an Innu reserve in Northern Quebec. Due to the high level of interest, there will also be a second wave of opportunities for those in Montreal to testify in late October.
“It has never been done, such wide research on that subject in Quebec,” CPRP spokesperson Brice Dansereau-Olivier told The Daily in an interview. “What we want to produce [is] a tool that can be used by anybody that’s studying this subject, anybody that’s a victim of political repression, anybody that’s interested in the subject […] it’s like a stepping stone to study the phenomenon of political repression in Quebec.”
The project, initiated by the Association pour la Liberté d’Expression (ALE), intends to study repression extensively – including its legal and legislative repercussions, and the role played by media and police – and to evaluate its effects on individuals and groups.
Leading the hearings were professors Céline Bellot from Université de Montréal and Francis Dupuis-Déri and Lucie Lemonde from Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), as well as local commissioner for Montreal and spokesperson for the citizen movement Montreal-Nord Republik Will Prosper. They heard testimonials from individuals and representatives of advocacy groups, including students, Indigenous people, and union representatives, as well feminist, anti-capitalist, and environmentalist activists.
Many of the testifiers noted an increase in political and police repression since the 2012 strike. One person said that they “didn’t know what repression was until 2012.” 
A member of an environmentalist organization said that the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) has been dealing with the group differently since 2012. The group was informed that it was being monitored, and the SPVM has threatened its members. This has made it difficult for the organization to continue its work, the activist said.
However, Dansereau-Olivier emphasized that the CPRP also aims to examine repression before 2012 as an already institutionalized phenomenon.
“I think most people, when they think of political repression, they only focus on the strike of 2012, but we’ve had to do [hearings] from 1990 to 2014, because [repression] is not something that’s punctual, it’s something that happens, and we thought it’d be important to give people who have lived that voice.”
One activist shared that they felt that their advocacy group experienced repression in economic ways. After the group lobbied against an action taken by their representative, the latter failed to subsidize the organization the following year. Since then, the group’s efforts have relied solely on unpaid volunteers.
Dansereau-Olivier also highlighted the politically independent nature of the CPRP, contrasting it with the Commission Ménard initiated by the Parti Québécois (PQ) government to examine the “demonstrations and actions of disturbance” that occurred during the 2012 student strike. Its report, released last May, was highly critical of police tactics such as kettling and the use of rubber bullets, flash bombs, and pepper spray, but the PQ ultimately ignored its recommendations.
“The police did not want to testify there, because they considered it to be sort of biased […] and the student associations did not want to participate because they felt that it was biased. Neither side of the conflict really wanted to be there,” said Dansereau-Olivier. “[When it was released] it totally slipped under the radar, and in the next couple of days when, finally, there was a few articles about it, the government straight up said: we won’t be following any of those recommendations.”
“We felt it was important to have a commission made by the people for the people, where everybody could testify, where we would make them feel comfortable,” added Dansereau-Olivier. “The main reason that tells me this project is important is that there were so many people who volunteered to give their testimony. There was a real need to tell their stories.”
The publication of the report is expected in a few months. The ultimate goal is to further the study of how political repression is articulated and what can be done to fight it, according to Dansereau-Olivier.
“What’s really interesting is, we don’t know exactly where this will end because we need to collect all the testimonies from throughout Quebec. There’s bound to be a few surprises in there.”
