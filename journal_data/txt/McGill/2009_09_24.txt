Projects target popuation hit hardest by HIV: men who sleep with men
SPOT, a free and anonymous HIV testing facility, opened in Montreal’s Gay Village this July for the exclusive use of gay and bisexual men, as well as heterosexuals who have sex with other men.
The three-year pilot project is a joint research initiative to help curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic and conduct research on the subject through the collaboration of 16 organizations, including McGill, Concordia, Université de Laval, Université du Québec à Montréal, and numerous community groups including the Séro-Zéro, a group that supports the sexual and emotional health of gay men, including sex workers.
The project also receives financial support from the province, through the Québec agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal, and l’Institut national de la santé.
Thomas Haig, a co-investigator from Séro-Zéro, said that SPOT is unique because of the heavy collaboration between research and community organizations.
“One of the very innovative and exciting things is that it brings together academic and community-based researchers under one roof. That’s a fairly new thing to do – have them be partners and have a community researcher as a main partner,” Haig said.
Haig also explained that testing will specifically target men  because they are the most at-risk population for HIV/AIDS in Montreal.
“Between 60 and 70 per cent of all new [HIV] infections in Montreal occur between men who have sex with men. The funding applications [for SPOT] were all done specifically in addressing this epidemic,” Haig said.
“The prevalence rate for HIV for men who identify as gay, who identify as bisexual, or men who might identify as straight but who have sex with men is 15 per cent. Compare that to the overall prevalence rate for Canada, which is 0.04 per cent [in 2007],” Haig said.
The Canadian AIDS Society notes similar statistics on their web site, as well as the fact that almost half of all reported cases of HIV in Canada remain within the demographic of men who have sex with men – though it has decreased from around 80 per cent in the eighties.
SPOT offers both conventional and rapid HIV testing. Rapid HIV tests can produce results in as little as five minutes and only require drops of blood using a finger prick, rather than the traditional method of drawing blood with a needle. However, the test requires the infected person to have contracted the virus at least three months prior. While it’s expensive, the clinic offers the rapid test for free.
In a CBC interview, McGill Faculty of Medicine professor and SPOT investigator Mark Wainberg noted that one in three HIV-positive Canadians don’t know they have the virus, and this population is most responsible for new infections.
Wainberg’s fellow Faculty of Medicine professor and co-investigator Bluma Brenner said that SPOT attempts to address this problem.
“When people are newly infected they can infect others – that’s a time of high transmission. Unfortunately it’s very hard to detect symptoms of HIV. People need to be routinely tested,” Brenner said. “What we’re trying to do is offer routine HIV testing together with innovative counselling approaches, to do a proactive approach to eliminate male sex infection.”
A member of the Conseil québécoises de gais et lesbiennes speculated on why HIV infection has gone unchecked in the past.
“[The stigma associated with the virus] is probably one of the major reasons people don’t go for testing, though definitely not the only one,” he said. “Some people don’t know enough about the consequences of the disease – they think ‘I’ll take a pill and be okay.’”
When asked whether the establishment of the clinic indicated that HIV testing is not yet accessible enough, the representative pointed out that “if an organization decides to put [up] a clinic, it probably means that it is not accessible for people to get tested when needed [with the current facilities].”

No significant cuts to TAs this year
University-wide budget cuts have required departments to slash spending this year, leading to fears that the number of TAs would be reduced.
Departments across campus were unsure how many TAs they would be able to employ this semester, and whether that number would meet student needs, adding to the usual uncertainty surrounding class enrolment numbers following the add-drop deadline.
According to the 2009-2010 University Budget, departments were required to reduce spending by at least 1.5 per cent. Despite the need to tighten spending, departments will not be significantly decreasing the number of TAs.
“The last thing we want to cut are teaching budgets,” said Provost Anthony Masi, explaining that while the University made suggestions, they would not give a set list of cuts that had to be made, and that major decisions would be at the discretion of the specific departments.
The University has suggested that departments cut travel and hospitality expenses, which can include anything from food purchases for departmental events to staff conference trips.
Masi added that departments should “make a choice that saves you the money,” but not a choice that sacrifices intellectual integrity, or causes the University to deviate from its basic principles.
It follows that potential reductions in TA numbers would be the result of departmental – not University – decisions. However, departments continue to face tough choices when dealing with cuts, which is especially true for programs that already experience regular shortfalls in their yearly budgets.
Professor Sebastian Sobecki, TA coordinator for the Department of English, said that departments are forced to use their own resources to fill these gaps.
According to Sobecki, no one has necessarily mapped out what the best ratio of TAs to undergraduate students would be in each discipline; however, the faculty of arts does set a general ratio at the beginning of each academic year.
Sobecki added that while faculty members in the English Department have met the proscribed ratio this year, the number of students to TAs could still be lower, a result that many fear will impair undergraduate learning.
Professor Scott Bohle, Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Chemistry, stating that cutting TA budgets would also do a disservice to graduate students who learn much by teaching and earn a salary for their teaching hours.
The budget cuts will further affect graduate students employed at the University if the administration’s proposed $1-million reduction in employee health benefits is passed this year.
The Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), which negotiates TA contracts, is in consultation with the University regarding the proposed cuts.
Masi commented that tough decisions are needed if the University is to meet its mandated deficit limit of $5 million, while simultaneously fulfilling its obligations to give students the intellectually rich community promised at McGill.
Masi added that targeted cuts and reassessments are carried out with quality of education in mind, in order to maintain the “self-fulfilling prophecy of excellence” for which the University is known.

Polytechnique professor condemns taser lethality, inconsistent performance
A lecture held at McGill Monday night warned that overuse and risk of malfunction make tasers far more dangerous than previously believed.
Pierre Savard of the École Polytechnique de Montreal led the audience through his research on the effects of electric stimulation on the human heart, demonstrating that use of electric stun guns can at times cause fatal complications.
“For many subjects with individual susceptibilities, the taser is in fact lethal,” Savard said, pointing out that individuals with heart disease and drug users face greater risks.
“The taser shock is analogous to the stress test hospitals give heart patients to test for defects,” Savard said. “These shocks stimulate flexors, extensors, and every nerve ending in the body.”
According to Savard, the danger present in these so-called “non-lethal weapons” is further exacerbated by what he saw as the RCMP’s gross overuse of tasers.
Savard illustrated this point with instances in which police used stun guns to wake up a subject sleeping on a bench and to pacify a grandmother who was making too much noise at a nursing home.
“It’s so easy to silence a subject [with a taser],” Savard said. “Too many policemen use it like the mute button on a remote control.”
Savard, a professor of electrical and biomedical engineering, began his investigation into taser safety after the October 2007 death of Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski.
Dziekanski could not understand English and became lost shortly after arriving at Vancouver International Airport. After an agitated Dziekanski threw a computer and small table to the ground, RCMP officers tasered him five times. Dziekanski died almost immediately.
Dziekanski’s death spurred a Michener Prize-winning CBC-Radio Canada investigation into taser safety, which found that at least 10 per cent of the stun guns currently in use in Canada malfunction outside of manufacturer specifications, putting subjects at greater risk of death.
Several individual police forces in Canada launched concurrent investigations that supported CBC-Radio Canada’s findings.
Based on these studies, groups like Amnesty International and the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP stepped forward, condemning taser overuse and urging a moratorium on stun guns until further research could be done.
Taser International, the sole manufacturer of tasers,  responded dismissively to these studies.
Peter Holran, the company’s spokesman,  called it regrettable that “false allegations based on scientifically flawed data” could raise such concerns and reaffirmed the quality of Taser International’s products.
Savard was concerned by Taser International’s lack of transparency. Savard noted that medical instrument manufacturers have “traceability,” meaning that a defective medical instrument can be traced piece by piece back to the raw materials, allowing selective safety recalls. Weapons manufacturers also undergo strict objective scrutiny from outside safety agencies. Tasers, however, qualify as neither medical instruments nor weapons, and are therefore subject only to the manufacturer’s testing standards.
Savard quipped, “If it’s not a weapon and it’s not medical equipment, it’s a toy.”
Tasers, however, still rank among police officers’ safest methods of applying force.
Savard cited a 2006-2007 study of Calgary police officers’ force interactions which demonstrated that out of all non-lethal force methods, stun gun interactions least frequently necessitated medical attention for the subject or the officer.
Savard himself admitted that tasers are among the safer means of subduing suspects, but firmly reiterated that more research into stun gun lethality, and more transparency in the manufacturing process are necessary if police officers are to continue using them on suspects.

Judge drops bail conditions against him, will likely annul security certificate next week
To the joy of his family and supporters, the restrictive bail conditions against Adil Charkaoui have been dropped – meaning the Montreal French teacher is no longer obligated to wear a GPS tracking bracelet.
Judge Daniele Tremblay-Lamer announced her ruling midway through the public hearing at the Federal Court in Old Montreal today, five months after the government’s lawyers retracted secret wiretap evidence from Charkaoui’s file.
The judge also hinted that the the court will annul Charkaoui’s security certifcate next Wednesday.
Full story coming Friday.

Concordia opened a state-of-the-art green building last Tuesday, constructed in accordance with the environmental standards set by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System. The John Molson School of Business  (JMSB) building at the corner of Guy and Maisonneuve features a wall of solar panels with cells that will heat the building and produce up to 10 per cent of the building’s energy.
Yves Gilbert, Director of Engineering and Building Perfor-mance at Concordia, said the building acquired official certification for its energy efficiency and environmentally friendly construction.
“[The building] is 25 per cent more efficient than the required model energy code buildings,” said Gilbert.
Concordia developed the building with the help of a subsidy provided by the Canadian government. Gilbert estimated the subsidy was around $500,000 – half of the original $1 million price tag.
Concordia usually only accepts energy efficiency projects that the university can pay back  in seven years or less, but the subsidy enabled them to adopt a larger project.
“[Normally] the payback is over 20 years [but] because of the subsidy the payback is below seven years,” said Gilbert.
However, Gilbert felt that the energy-saving technology in the Molson School of Business building is unlikely to become the standard for the rest of Concordia’s buildings in the future.
“There are more conventional ways to save energy,” he said.
Gilbert noted options such as heat recovery, pre-heating buildings, and motion-activated lights as cheaper ways to make buildings more energy efficient.
However, the project has not been completed without criticism.  According to an editorial in the Link, Concordia’s independent newspaper, the building LEED has a four-level certification framework: certified, silver, gold, and platinum. The new building has  been certified for the lowest level of approval.
“The new JMSB building is LEED certified. That’s it. We’re doing the least we can to earn our certification,” the editorial read.
The only platinum-certified building in Canada belongs to the University of Calgary, and some Concordia students are wondering why their university isn’t aiming as high. But Gilbert noted that the university’s efforts are limited by the availability of funds.
“This is not something we would normally do…[and] without financial help from the government, we wouldn’t,” Gilbert said.

Over 100 Montrealers formed a noisy flash mob at Place-des-Arts this Monday as part of the international Climate Change Wake-Up Call demonstrations, organized by tcktcktck campaign members Avaaz, Oxfam, Greenpeace, and others. Participants rang cellphone alarms and bells, played drums and harmonicas, clapped, and cheered well past the proposed five minutes starting at 5:35 p.m. Afterward, they phoned the Prime Minister and other Canadian MPs’ offices, urging them to pass Bill C-311, which would mandate an 80 per cent of CO2 reduction below 1990 levels by 2050, before the end of the year.
A similar event took place at 12:18 p.m. at the Roddick Gates Monday, signalling the last day of talks to be held at COP15, the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Copenhagen from December 7 to 18 this year.

Landmark case prosecuted in Montreal under new Canadian law
Désiré Munyaneza, a Rwandan residing in Canada, was convicted last May of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the Quebec superior court in Montreal. His lawyers returned to court last Tuesday to debate the terms of his sentence, which will be given on October 29.
He is the first person to be tried under the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act,  passed in 2000  that allows for residents who committed war crimes abroad to be prosecuted in Canada. The decision will follow two years of proceedings that have involved over 60 witnesses and a cost of $1.6 million.
Frédéric Mégret, an associate professor of law at McGill and director of the McGill Clinic for the Sierra Leone Special Court, acknowledged the complexity of the case while appraising its national significance.
“Rwanda is in Canada, and not just in an abstract way. There is a large [Rwandan] community here and this is part of our duty to uphold peace and certain values,” Mégret said. “We don’t want criminals running into their former victims.”
Munyaneza, a Hutu from Butare, Rwanda, has been found guilty of murder, sexual assault, and inhumane treatment of Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide of an estimated 800,000 Rwandans. He came to Canada in 1997, and was refused refugee status as a result of RCMP investigations that ultimately led to his arrest in 2005.
Jean-Paul Nyilinkwaya, a genocide survivor and head of the Truth and Justice Commission of PAGE-Rwanda – a Montreal-based association for parents and friends of genocide victims – commended Canada’s involvement in prosecutions.
“There are so many [war criminals] that if Rwanda takes it on themselves it will be a long time to achieve justice,” Nyilinkwaya said, adding that the legislation sends “a strong message that Canada is not a safe haven.”
There are an estimated 1,500 war criminals and human-rights abusers known to reside in Canada.
While many hoped that the fear of facing prosecution would deter such individuals from entering the country, many continue to land on Canadian soil.
Nyilinkwaya argued that the process of granting refugee status for individuals who enter Canada should be more rigourous, even suggesting that the process slow down or stop altogether until suspicious criminal claims are fully investigated.
Mégret agreed on the importance of exercising discretion during the refugee status process, but cautioned that it should not come at the expense of hampering the majority of civilians and victims of conflict who seek asylum in Canada.
Superior Court Justice André Denis is slated to hand his sentence down on October 29.
Observers expect a life sentence, but the defendant’s lawyers are also expected to appeal for a reduced parole period.
Defense lawyer Richard Perras will argue for leniency, citing the fact that the judge’s verdict found his client guilty of participation, but not of planning and deliberation.
Mégret said that the judge might take into account whether or not Munyaneza was a ringleader in the events.
“The ICTR [UN International War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda] was never meant to judge all of the accused. Its mandate is to indict and prosecute leaders, and Munyaneza was simply not one of them,” Mégret said.
Nevertheless, Nyilinkwaya said that the Rwandan community is watching the trial closely, which will set a precdent for future war crimes trials in Canada.
