Despite the rain and cold on Friday, November 12, students and activists gathered at the Roddick Gates in a rally concluding BDS (Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions) Week, hosted by the McGill and Concordia chapters of Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR). Demonstrators spoke about the ongoing occupation of Palestine, chanting, “Free, free Palestine.”
Organizers from Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU) distributed pamphlets detailing the purpose of the BDS Movement. “Resist the systemic inequality and discrimination of Israel Apartheid,” the cover read, alongside the slogan “Boycottons Israël!” The BDS Movement aims to put financial pressure on corporations involved in the occupation of Palestine.
Sabine Friesinger, who was president of the Concordia Student Union when Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, was invited to speak at the university in 2001, attended the rally. “Public institutions should be held accountable for their [financial] ties, and if they have ties with apartheid regimes like Israel, they should cut those ties in solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she said.

“The bill is a step backwards,” LGBTQ+ advocates say.
Content warning: transphobia, mention of genital mutilation 
Continue or go back to the main page
In January 2021, the Quebec Superior Court gave the province until the end of the year to rewrite several sections of their Civil Code that discriminates against trans and non-binary people. Last month the province released its proposed changes, but for many trans and non-binary people, this is a step back. Since Bill 2” was first proposed by Justice Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette, it has met fierce resistance from community organizers who believe that this legislation will only further endanger the communities it claims to protect.
Bill 2 would add an additional category to identification documents for people’s “gender identity” which would be separate from the “sex” category. While people are able to put their preferred gender under the “gender identity” category, they would only able to change their sex if they receive gender-affirming surgery. In an interview with the Daily, Celeste Trianon from Concordia University’s Centre for Gender Advocacy (CGA) explains that this is harmful, as “all transgender (including non-binary) people having not obtained (sterilizing) gender-affirming surgery can easily be ‘outed’ as trans if that is the case, since their ID documents will show a ‘gender identity’ marker distinct from the ‘sex’ marker cisgender persons will have.”
Since 2015, trans people have been able to change the sex designation on their IDs without undergoing surgery. Not all trans, non-binary, and intersex people can or want to have surgery, per Trianon. As they told the Daily, the surgery is inevitably sterilizing, and forcing individuals to undergo surgery in order for their gender to be recognized is a violation of bodily autonomy according to the Yogyakarta Principles. The Yogyakarta Principles are a compilation of legal standards for human rights relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. The province has also created an “undefined” sex designation for intersex people, which Trianon says “encourages parents (and doctors) to force intersex infants and children to undergo intersex genital mutilation, a procedure meant to make their genitals conform more with ‘binary’ genitalia, but often causes permanent physiological harm, sterility, and trauma.”
Although this bill was supposed to make it easier for trans and non-binary people to change their IDs, it seems to have the opposite effect. As advocate Daphne Barile from Action Santé Travesti(e)s et Transsexuel(le)s du Québec (ASTTeQ) tells CBC, “They decided to make it easy to change […] this new category of a gender identity, and then create all of these new barriers to changing one’s sex designation, which was the only thing that existed before.”
LGBTQ+ communities have been vocal in their opposition to the bill. Ever since the Bill was announced, resources and petitions have been circulating around social media. Trianon has created a legally binding petition against Bill 2 which clearly outlines its harmful characteristics. They explain that the CGA is engaging in many actions to oppose the bill, such as “vocally opposing Bill 2 online, coordinating with other trans and LGBTQ+ organizations on their actions, and preparing to deliver a brief and a spoken statement on Bill 2 as soon as parliamentary commissions open up.” 
Trianon advises students wanting to get involved in opposing Bill 2 to contact their lawmakers as well as sign the aforementioned petition. They also add that there are many volunteering opportunities and grassroots movements that people can get involved in, such as protests. Spreading awareness and donating to organizations supporting the communities affected also helps, they said. 
Jolin-Barrette has said that he is open to possibly modifying the Bill in response to the mobilizations from LGBTQ+ activists. He claims that “we are confident that we can find a solution with LGBTQ+ groups, and if there are improvements that can be made, they will be.’’ In fact, it was recently announced that the surgery requirement will be dropped from the bill. 
One widely-shared template to oppose Bill 2, written by Olé Oléolé and translated by Amy Bergeron, provides recommendations to improve the Bill. “In order to meet the objective of equality as a fundamental value of Quebec society, I suggest: the possibility of changing the sex designation on the birth certificate without the addition of a gender identity category; the possibility of changing the sex designation to gender ‘X’ (as provided for gender identity in section 253 of the present bill); the possibility of removing the sex designation.”
Barile also reminds us that the Bill is taking away rights that transgender people have had since 2015. She believes that “trans communities in Quebec are calling for a withdrawal of all of those provisions from the bill and keeping essentially the system as it has been, which [has] allowed us to change our sex designation without having to undergo that surgery or have it affirmed by a doctor.”
During this difficult time, there are several organizations in Montreal providing services for transgender, non-binary, intersex, and gender non-conforming communities. Queer McGill offers many services for McGill students. The CGA provides gender-affirming gear, and harm reduction/safer sex supplies. ASTT(e)Q offers counseling, educational workshops, and health services among many other services. AGIR Montreal offers programs and services specifically directed towards LGBTQ+ migrants. Aide Trans au Quebec also offers general resources and services for trans people in Quebec.

The McGill Daily
As McGill prepared to return to campus earlier this year, it became increasingly clear that guidelines given by the administration did not particularly favour the wishes of students and faculties. Several weeks into the semester, these concerns continue to develop. This is the third installment of the Daily’s recurring column exploring the relationship between McGill administration and the broader McGill community.
Mode of Instruction in the Faculty of Arts
In late October, a motion was passed in the Faculty of Arts council affirming the faculty’s authority to determine the mode and method of instruction. The motion was authored by Rine Vieth, the Arts Faculty Council’s (AFC) Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) Representative, and was first presented to the faculty council on September 28. It specifically concerns “whether Arts Faculty Council shall affirm and exercise its jurisdiction to oversee the content and method of delivery of its courses, including through hybrid, blended, and alternative means during the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
In the background and rationale of the motion, Vieth highlighted the August 29 memo from Provost Manfredi and its problematic implications of mandating faculty to teach in person. Additionally, the motion cites faculty and students’ concerns about the implementation of McGill’s health measures, including but not limited to “a lack of vaccination or testing mandates; inadequate ventilation; inadequate contact tracing; overcrowded classrooms; and planning and scheduling which has made hallway distancing impossible.” 
The motion further reasons that neither the Statutes of McGill nor the relevant Senate regulations (found in article six of the Statutes) provide the Dean or Provost of a faculty with independent jurisdiction over the content or mode of instruction of courses. Instead, writes Vieth, Article 7.5 of the Statutes gives the Faculty Council the authority to “control the courses of study and the academic work of the faculty, and provide rules governing the arrangement of its timetable and examinations and the conduct of its meetings.” 
The motion, now passed, resolves that the Arts Faculty council has jurisdiction to “oversee the design and mode of delivery of courses by recognizing instructor discretion to teach through various modes, including hybrid, blended and alternative methods, during the COVID-19 pandemic.” As of now, the Faculty of Arts is the only faculty to affirm its jurisdiction to do so. 
The motion additionally outlines the creation of an ad hoc committee within the AFC, composed of representatives from the Arts Undergraduate Society, graduate student representatives from the AFC, and professors. The role of the committee is to establish guidelines for any courses delivered through hybrid, blended, and alternative modes of instruction, and to ensure that student and teaching staff needs and concerns regarding COVID-19 are properly addressed. 
Transition from Emergency Response to Recovery and Resumption
On November 1, an email sent to McGill staff and students announced that the University’s COVID-19 response would no longer be coordinated by McGill’s Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), and instead will now be coordinated by the Recovery and Operations Resumptions Committee (ROR). 
The EOC has been activated since January 2020 to navigate the university through the pandemic. The committee is a component of McGill’s larger emergency management framework. It was originally designed to coordinate the university’s response to emergencies spanning over a period of days or weeks – not a months-long pandemic. The committee was spearheaded by Fabrice Labeau, Deputy Provost and planning chief of the EOC. The EOC reported directly to Policy Group, a subset of the senior leadership to the university, and was responsible for communications, including regular Media Relations Office emails and updates to McGill’s Coronavirus website. 
As of November 1, all COVID-19-related issues and initiatives are led by the ROR. The new committee will be co-chaired by the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) and the Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs), who will oversee “decentralized functional groups.” According to the November 1 email, “these groups, with leads assigned based on their regular roles within the University, will be responsible for specific areas of expertise to help make decisions to move our campus forward.” Within the new ROR structure, co-chairs will report jointly to the Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) and the Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance), who will report to the Principal and Vice-Chancellor. 
In the November 1 email, university administration stated that McGill’s current status of emergency was changed due to several reasons; they cited the announcement that Quebec will lift its state of emergency in early 2022, “a more stable epidemiological situation in Quebec in general,” low case counts on campus, high vaccination rates, and the “successful return of academic activities back to in-person.” The email stressed, however, that this does not mean McGill is returning to normal. “The COVID-19 situation can change very quickly, and our continued vigilance is critical to ensuring the stability of the situation across our campuses,” they wrote. Since the announcement, ten new cases have been reported on campus, compared to zero reported cases the previous week.
“I am generally in favour [of the transition] but do not find it goes far enough,” wrote Richard Gold, Professor in the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine, in an email to the Daily. The mandate to turn decision making over to the EOC at the beginning of the pandemic was rushed and not adequately advised; the EOC had no expertise in public health, and largely ignored experts with which it consulted, Gold alleged. While the end of the EOC’s management represents a return to collegial governance, Gold still has reservations. “I worry that the ROR seems, in many respects, to be the EOC under a different name,” he wrote, “Time will tell if this is the case.” 
COVID-19 Rapid Testing Project
On October 29, McGill announced its voluntary COVID-19 rapid testing project for asymptomatic people. As of November 8, any asymptomatic McGill student, faculty, or staff member will be able to receive a rapid antigen detection test. Participants perform the swab test themselves with guidance from trained staff, and receive results within 15 to 20 minutes. 
According to the press release, there will be the capacity to conduct between four to eight tests per 20-minute period. They underline that “there is a higher likelihood of false positive results” from rapid antigen tests, therefore test results from this pilot project cannot be used as proof of a negative test result for travel or other purposes; no paper or form with results will be given to participants to walk away with. Following any positive result from the rapid antigen test, participants must agree to get a PCR test from an authorized testing site and to self-isolate. 
The project is being implemented months into student demands for increased safety measures on campus, namely an implementation of a vaccine mandate and rapid testing infrastructure on par with other universities. Communications state that “this pilot project is not intended to replace existing health measures for McGill, such as masking and distancing.” 
This testing initiative is open to anyone on campus who is asymptomatic but wishes to be tested. The press release stresses that “anyone displaying COVID-19 symptoms must follow public health guidelines and should not be coming to campus.” 
Testing is available from Monday through Friday, 12:00-17:00 in the cafeteria of the Trottier Engineering Building.

The return to campus presents novel challenges for the office
More students have allegedly been requesting academic accommodations from the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)  due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an email exchange with the Daily, Teri Phillips, Director of the OSD, could not confirm that the increase in requests is due to the pandemic but does acknowledge an increased number of students registering for services this Fall. The office adds that this increase follows the trend of more requests for services yearly.
A student can register with the OSD if they are experiencing academic or physical barriers and have a documented disability, mental health disorder, chronic illness, or other impairment. This does not apply, however, to a student who has contracted COVID-19. If a student needs academic accommodations solely based on concerns regarding exposure to COVID-19, they are to submit their request via Minerva; it is then processed by the Office of the Dean of Students. If a student struggles with long term effects after contracting COVID-19, registration with the OSD may be a possibility. The OSD emphasizes that accommodations are awarded on a case-by-case basis, depending on the student’s situation and medical documentation.
The wait time for an appointment is less than four weeks and is usually closer to around two weeks, per the OSD. Students can decide between booking an in-person appointment and an online appointment – according to the OSD, students generally prefer online appointments. Already registered students are eligible for a same-day drop-in appointment they can book on the booking page.
The OSD acknowledges that email response times are longer this year, as the Exam Centre has recently adapted to offer both in-person assessments and remote assessments which require coordination with instructors.
Typical accommodations the OSD provides can include exam accommodations, note taking support, learning resources, peer-to-peer supports, and assistive technology. The University has made significant cuts to the OSD’s budget, leading to changes related to the accommodations. Since the winter of 2019, students participating in note taking for other students are no longer compensated financially, despite the work being up to ten hours a week. The OSD has chosen to reward these students with volunteer hours and an entry into a draw for one of several gift cards at the end of the semester. Because of this change, there is an alleged shortage of note takers. 
Since the OSD is responsible for academic accommodations, the Office of the Dean of Students makes a point to emphasize the use of “academic considerations” as opposed to “accommodations” to differentiate between the roles of each office. As opposed to the OSD, the Office of the Dean of Students does not require medical documentation to receive academic considerations. According to the Office of the Dean of Students, the student may be “academically considered” with a flexible grading scheme, audio and/or video equipped teaching rooms, zoom recordings, past year recordings of classes, withdrawal from a course or courses, an “incomplete,” or a Leave of Absence. However, with the University reporting 85 per cent of classes being held in person, it remains unclear what percentage of these classes are being recorded. The Office of the Dean of Students cannot guarantee these academic considerations, but notes that they are flexible and other options may be considered. 
McGill has set these academic considerations in place for the Fall 2021 term but has not confirmed a plan for the Winter 2022 term. The University writes that if a plan is needed, it will be developed closer to the start of the term. However, in McGill’s response to questions from the Daily, the University discussed the launch of the Ad-Hoc Advisory Committee in early October. The Committee is mandated with advising the University on COVID-related decisions that affect academic planning and policies, focusing heavily on the Winter 2022 term.
Though there are offices responsible for handling different matters in regard to academic accommodations and/or considerations, students are allegedly being falsely directed in some cases. Student employees often face difficulties extending academic accommodations to their work, and McGill’s Human Resources has been known to direct student employees to the OSD, though its purpose is for academic accommodations. This lack of consistency of where student employees should go for work accommodations has yet to be addressed by the University or its offices.
As for the academic accommodation requests from the OSD, the reason for the increase remains uncertain. However, there are plenty of resources available for students looking for additional aid, whether they are facing an academic or physical barrier. These resources are distributed amongst different offices, and students should be aware of the different specialties they have and which will be most useful to them.

From November 8 through November 13, Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill and SPHR Concordia hosted a series of events for Boycott, Divestments, and Sanctions (BDS) week. 
The week’s events started on Monday evening, with a screening and discussion of the film Grey, Black and Blue by Karam Abu Ali. The screening was held at J.A. de Sève Cinema at Concordia University. 
The following evening, organizers from SPHR McGill, SPHR Concordia, and Palestine Youth Movement led a “Palestine and BDS 101” workshop at Concordia University. Presenters organized the workshop into four sections: (1) defining concepts, (2) the region’s history, (3) contemporary oppression of Palestinian people, and (4) forms of resistance. Attendees were encouraged to ask questions, share ideas, and learn from one another. 
In defining concepts, presenters highlighted the importance of looking at Palestine through a conceptual framework. Specifically, they emphasized that individual atrocities must be examined as part of the larger system of settler colonialism, occupation, and apartheid. Presenters further outlined the importance of language in discussing Palestine – terms like “conflict” and “occupation” used in discussion fail to recognize the unequal distribution of power between Palestine and Israel. Describing Israel’s violence as an act of “ethnic cleansing” and “settler colonialism” is more appropriate, according to presenters. 
Presenters also discussed historical and contemporary definitions of “Zionism,” highlighting the ways in which the ideology is inextricably linked with settler colonialism. In the creation of Israel in the late 1940s, presenters said, evidence of imperialist efforts to select land show a clear intention to dislocate Arab people. They highlighted that this is in line with settler colonialism’s logic of elimination (via confrontation, carceration, and assimilation), which ultimately dispossesses Indigenous people of their lands. 
Presenters then dived into Palestine’s history, starting with the 1947 Partition Plan, which called for the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, and the 1948 Plan Dalet which outlined a plan for the ethnic cleansing of Arab people in the region. Nakba Day in 1948 was then discussed, the day that the state of Israel declared their so-called independence. The “nakba,” Arabic for catastrophe, refers to the consequent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the land and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages, as outlined by presenters. They pointed to a clear difference in the Israeli narrative vs. the Palestinian narrative that resulted from the state’s creation; the former frames the events as a civil war that resulted in independence, while the latter views the events as catastrophic nakba that resulted in ethnic cleansing. Discussion was also prompted by attendees concerning the importance of seeing Nakba not as a historical event, but recognizing that settler colonialism in Palestine is an ongoing process; the nakba continues to this day. The presenters then outlined the 1967 war between Israel and neighbouring states, the subsequent Intifadas, and the Oslo Accords. 
Next, presenters delved into the contemporary systems today used to stifle Palestinian voices and threaten their livelihood. Apartheid, which describes a system of racial dicrimination, is used in the state of Israel to deny Palestianians of many rights. Presenters highlighted the use of checkpoints, which impose control over Palestinian movement; settlements, through which Palestinians are violently expelled in favor of new development; the Separation Wall, which cuts through Palestinian communities; and incarceration, which targets specific individuals and systematically denies them of autonomy. 
Lastly, presenters outlined forms of resistance to the Israeli settler-state, primarily the BDS movement. Part of a long heritage of non-violent Palestinian resistance, the BDS movement is borrowed from the South African model of the ‘80s and ‘90s. Presenters also highlighted the importance of academic boycotts, which for students means boycotting university exchanges, relationships, and joint research with Israeli institutions. Next, McGill’s investment in the Israeli state was discussed, specifically its investment in RE/MAX and Oshkosh, its memorandum of understanding with Technion, and its exchange programs with four Israeli universities. Pro-Palestine activism at McGill is often met with resistance and roadblocks. Notably, last winter the proposed Motion Regarding the Adoption of the Divest for Human Rights Policy was very divisive within SSMU; many were reluctant to pass the motion, seeing as it outlined divestment from many companies profiting from Palestine’s occupation. In a legislative council meeting discussing the motion, it was implied that SSMU cannot support BDS as it is allegedly a “fundamental violation of SSMU’s commitment to leadership in matters of human rights and social justice.” After the presentation, attendees were invited to ask questions and participate in discussion. 
On Wednesday, organizers hosted an event at Abo hadi Restaurant. Attendees were invited to eat Palestinian food,  listen to Palestinian music,  dance, and socialize free of charge. The week concluded with the “Students Speak-out for Palestine” event; see page seven for coverage of this demonstration.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Separation Wall separated the East and West Bank. The article has been updated to be more accurate. 
The Daily regrets this error.
