Winter coat program now managed by International Student Services
McGill Chaplaincy Services has relocated to a new, more visible location as part of the relocation of several student services at the end of the Winter 2013 semester. Staff hope that the new location will be more accessible to the student population at large.
Chaplaincy Services focuses on promoting spiritual and religious well-being among students of the McGill community.
While still located within the Brown Student Services building, it has been moved to Suite 2100 on the second floor, where the Campus Life and Engagement office (formerly known as the First-Year Office) was previously located.
The new location is “smaller but with a lot more visibility,” according to Sara Parks Ricker, Director of Chaplaincy Services at McGill. The new location has already seen an uptick in attendees, according to Ricker.
“Lots of students drop in whereas before nobody came by accident,” said Ricker. This may partially be because the new office features large glass windows, increasing visibility.
The downsizing of the services due to relocation did cost Chaplaincy Services the winter coat program, which provides free winter coats to international students. The program has not been scratched altogether, but is now being run by International Student Services (ISS), which also relocated this year.
ISS is now located on the fourth floor of the west wing in the Brown building – Chaplaincy Services’ previous location. Whereas Chaplaincy Services once had a whole room to store these coats, Ricker said they will now be placed in the hallway.
The relocation of Chaplaincy Services came as part of a larger decision to move services around. “[It involved a] big committee with many different players,” according to Jana Luker, Executive Director of Student Services.
The process began when the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) moved to the foot of McTavish and vacated a large space in the Brown building. The vacated space was then taken up by the Scholarships and Student Aid Office (SSAO), also previously located separately in the Brown building.
Luker stated that it “didn’t make sense” to have ISS sharing space with assistants from SSAO, especially when part of SSAO’s staff was already in its own location. The committee decided to concoct what they called a “win-win situation.”
Since the population of international students increases each year and thus needs more advisors, ISS was in need of a larger space, leading them to take over what had previously been the Chaplaincy Services office. Chaplaincy, looking for increased visibility and accessibility, took over the old First-Year Office, explained Luker.
The money for the move came from the Student Services’ budget, according to Ricker.   The relocations of offices resulted in the merging of two services but no loss of services, according to Luker.
Ricker went on to state that “right now, in the face of budget cuts that are [limiting] McGill services, we’re here to help protect [such needs].”
“[We want to help] all students feel safe and cozy and relaxed to help deal with pressures of being a McGill student.”

Focus on need for accessible transportation for elders
In anticipation of their 120th anniversary in November, the Montreal Council of Women (MCW) held their first General Meeting of the year on September 12. The MCW is a non-partisan coalition aimed at improving social conditions for women within the city. Consisting of 70 organizations and more than 80 members, the meeting stressed a need to connect with the younger generation of Montreal on the subject of accessible transportation.
Maya Cerda, the Convener of Transportation for the Council, explained that one issue facing the Montreal’s elderly population involves the lack of mobility-oriented services. Cerda highlighted challenges such as the lack of benches at bus stops, a shortage of senior shuttles, and the short timespan of traffic lights.
“We need to increase the safety and security of public transportation for our more vulnerable populations,” Cerda said at the panel. “Some bus stops have benches, but most do not. Some metros have elevators, but most do not.”
According to Cerda, this year has seen a 7 per cent increase in demand for the STM’s adapted transportation services. Adapted transportation, or paratransit, offers public transit service by reservation for those considered “a person with a deficiency caused by a significant and persistent disability (impairment), who is liable to encounter barriers in performing everyday activities,” according to the STM website.
“Despite this increase in demand for the service, we see at the same time an unprecedented 25 per cent increase of cases refused,” said Cerda.
Road crossings were also brought up at the panel, where often the time allotted to crossing does not bode well for senior citizens with limited mobility.
“We need longer red lights, especially at major intersections and better management of circulation around crossings,” said Cerda. “Even pavement in the middle of a large artery can made a difference.”
The council brings its concerns to municipal candidates in Montreal, but report having seen little results. One of the issues brought up at the meeting was the disconnect between young councillors and the aging population.
“We want municipal candidates to be educated on some of the priority issues of seniors,” said Karen Urtnowski, the council’s community organizer. “Still, we have a disappointing response from borough politicians. Over and over again I see how many of our city councillors are young and oblivious of what it is like to be old, or have back problems, or arthritis in your hands.”
Some members recounted their experiences with public transportation, particularly the challenge of bus seating.
“A very common problem with taking the bus is the lack of seating near the entrance. A common fear for elderly people is of falling when the bus lurches forward and you haven’t had the chance to sit down yet,” explained Urtnowski.
The MCW hopes the barrier of understanding between younger city councillors and seniors will be reduced once Montreal’s youth and elderly population begin to work together to improve conditions of accessibility.
“Accessibility isn’t just about wheelchairs and wheelchair ramps,” Urtnowski said. “We have a long way to go before public transportation is truly accessible.”
The next council meeting will be held October 3 and will discuss upcoming initiatives for women’s history month.

Union calls for cameras to be installed on late night buses
In a campaign that started September 2, bus drivers of the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) began wearing t-shirts stating “notre sécurité, votre sécurité” (“our security, your security”), in support of their campaign to shed light on the increasing number of attacks on late night bus routes this year.
STM bus drivers are unionized under the Syndicat des chauffeurs d’autobus de la STM, which is a part of the larger Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (SCFP). The union’s campaign aims to pressure their employer into installing cameras in buses across the city to provide for a safer service at night.
Stéphane Lachance, the main spokesperson for the union, told The Daily in French, “Installing cameras in buses is a way of preventing assaults from occurring. The goal is to install them in all buses that circulate after 11 p.m. since all attacks take place after that time.”
In 2006, the STM initiated the Sécuribus program in an effort to provide better safety for bus drivers and their clients. One of the promised measures to prevent assaults included cameras in buses.
Despite the STM’s efforts, Lachance was skeptical of the program. “The [Sécuribus] program did not diminish the number of assaults on buses.” He continued, “In fact, in 2013, we are headed towards a total of 300 attacks, which is huge.”
A highly publicized attack on April 24 became one of the most significant events leading up to the movement, according to Lachance. The Service de la police de la ville de Montréal’s (SPVM) media relations communication officer, Anna-Claude Poulin, revealed a detailed report of the incident to The Daily. “Arriving at the corner of Fairmount Avenue, the driver [of the 363 bus] passes the bus stop’s shelter in which the three men were standing and stops a few feet away from them. The three men, dissatisfied with the bus driver’s conduct, get on the bus and insult him.”
After insulting the driver, the men proceeded to physically assault him.
Despite cameras already installed on that particular bus, Lachance said there is a long way to go.
“Currently, the STM has equipped 900 out of 1,600 buses with cameras. And they simply need to install cameras in 500 of the remaining buses to provide for a safer service at night.”
“The bus driver who had gotten assaulted on that night was not able to go back to work again,” Lachance continued. “Also, the cameras allowed [us] to catch and arrest the attackers. You can now understand the effectiveness of [having] a camera [in a bus at night].”
The accompanying YouTube video of the assault “Le SPVM recherche trois suspects qui ont agressé un chauffeur d’autobus,” with almost 60,000 total views, catalogued the incident.
According to Lachance, the union is fighting for more than just the safety of its bus drivers;  the safety of the public is of primary concern as well. “If the bus drivers are safe, the passengers of their bus will also be safe.”
The union is adamant that it will continue with its movement for as long as necessary. “As long as all the buses of the STM are not equipped with cameras, the bus drivers will continue to wear the t-shirt that denounce[s] the fact that there are no cameras present in the buses for [the safety of] the employees and the citizens,” said Lachance.
Lachance placed the blame on the STM. “If they [the STM] would have installed cameras in the night buses to ensure the security of the bus drivers and their passengers, we would not have begun this strike.” He also remarked, “They won’t do anything about it. It is a lack of willingness on their part.”
The SPVM declined to comment on the union’s campaign to prevent violence against STM bus drivers.

Professors criticize Charter’s move to ban religious symbols for public workers 
As Quebec unveiled its newly-proposed and highly controversial Charter of Values this week, McGill professors have voiced serious concern with the Charter, and plan to stage demonstrations against the proposed plan in the upcoming week.
On September 10, the Parti Québécois (PQ) revealed its Charter of Quebec Values, which would amend the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms to ban the wearing of “conspicuous” religious symbols by public-sector employees, with the exception of small pieces of jewelry.
Along with judges, police, prosecutors, public daycare workers, teachers, school employees, hospital workers and municipal personnel, university employees might be affected by the proposed charter – though universities have the option to “opt out” of the requirements, subject to renewal every five years.
Notably, in an interview with the McGill Tribune on September 12, new principal Suzanne Fortier neglected to say whether McGill would opt out of the Charter’s requirements.
Political Science professor Catherine Lu is among many McGill professors who are concerned with the proposed Charter. She also noted the futility of the opt-out option.
“McGill should not opt out, in the case that the Charter is passed,” she said. “By opting out or asking for an exemption, one is fating others to still an injustice. It makes us complicit in enabling the injustice.”
“A liberal democratic society should respect individuals’ fundamental freedoms and right to expression of religion,” she continued.
On the same day that the Charter was unveiled, Lu and Professor Marie-Joëlle Zahar of the Université de Montréal sent out a letter to their colleagues “calling on all educators and members of the public service to reflect on the fundamentally unjust, incoherent, self-defeating and dangerous nature of the proposed Charter.”
Lu and Zahar’s initiative calls for all educators to adopt and wear visible religious symbols of their choosing in classes and lectures during a Week of Action, starting on September 12.
Some professors participating in the Week of Action noted a perceived unconstitutional or discriminatory undercurrent behind the Charter.
“I think it is a form of institutionalized discrimination that essentially prohibits entire groups of people – those whose religious beliefs involve visible symbolism like a turban, kippa, or hijab – from employment in the public sector,” said Political Science professor Rex Brynen in an e-mail to The Daily. Brynen said that he will be participating in the Week of Action.
“I am vehemently opposed to it, as I think is the overwhelming majority of the McGill community,” continued Brynen.
Others pointed to the need for privacy from an overbearing state.
“I don’t think it’s a matter where I should be reporting directly to a department of the provincial government. That really chills me,” said Religious Studies professor Ian Henderson.
Ellen Aitken, Dean of the Faculty of Religious Studies, says that the purpose behind the Charter is to further a policy of “narrow secularization” of Quebec, by excluding religion completely from the public sphere.
“This should be contrasted with a rich secularism in which a plurality of religious traditions are valued as a part of the pluralism of the state, but where the state is not aligned or supportive of any single religious tradition,” Aitken said in an interview with The Daily.
Others echoed the need to recognize a diversity of faiths, traditions, and beliefs across the population.
“I could look at it and say, I don’t think it makes much of a difference for me, if I don’t wear visible symbols. […] But if I love my neighbours as myself, I want them to have a reasonable chance to have a pious, faithful life as they would understand it,” said Religious Studies lecturer Jon Waind.
“It is unclear to me whether I am a government employee,” Henderson later said. “I have never thought of myself, until this week, as an employee of the state who reports to the state about my individual dress habits.  If it has come to that, what else do I report to the state?”

Looking at physical and financial limitations
When you think about accessibility, said Tanja Beck, the Access Services Advisor at the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), “it’s a different way of thinking […] You have to wrap your mind around [potential] barriers in the environment.”
For many, Frosh is a time for fun, meeting new friends, and getting acquainted with a new city and university. However, for other students, Frosh and other orientation events can be a series of barriers.
Attempts to reform Frosh are numerous, and have been addressed many times. So what kind of progress has been made on ensuring Frosh is accessible to those with physical or financial limitations?
Physical accessibility
According to Beck, 3 per cent of the McGill student population has a physical disability registered with the OSD. Although there are not any clear statistics on how many students with physical disabilities participated in Frosh this year, official Frosh policy aims to be broadly inclusive.
First-years who participate in Frosh and who have a physical disability often choose to tell the coordinators personally, in addition to the online registration option given ahead of time. Sahil Kumar, VP Internal of the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS), told The Daily in an interview that out of 1005 participants in SUS Frosh, only one had a physical impairment – and they were able to participate in all of the activities.
To increase physical accessibility, Kumar said that he and his colleagues made sure, when first checking out the venues for night events, that they “were all wheelchair-accessible, that they all had elevators and escalators […] we made sure that [students] could get to the venue easily as well.”
Beck emphasized the importance of being proactive in integrating accessibility into Frosh. “We slowly want to decrease [the] amount of individual accommodations that we need to make for students, because if you think of accessibility right from the start and build it in, there’s less and less need.”
Beck gave the example of a visually impaired student who participated in Frosh several years ago. According to Beck, Frosh coordinators had not thought ahead about possible barriers, and the OSD was eventually left to hire an attendant.
According to SSMU VP Internal Brian Farnan, the OSD and Frosh coordinators worked together closely to help ensure that no students were left out of Frosh activities, regardless of physical ability. “We had two students who actually needed to use a wheelchair […] As soon as we figured this out, we were in touch with the OSD [who were] an awesome resource the whole week. […] Both students got to participate, which was great,” Farnan said.
“Physical disability is definitely the first step that has to be taken to make the university accessible,” Beck said, but she also added that the next step was to think of students with invisible disabilities, including chronic diseases or mental health problems.
“Frosh should be as inviting as possible to the whole diversity of students,” said Dorthe Eriksson, an Access Service Advisor at the OSD.
Financial accessibility
In the annual post-orientation survey of students in 2012, 32 per cent of students surveyed said they did not participate in a faculty Frosh. One of the many reasons cited was the expense. In fact, even out of those students who participated in a faculty Frosh, 34 per cent of students “strongly disagreed” that faculty Froshes were affordable.
Farnan said that the integration of SSMU and different faculty Froshes helped fund a diversity of events – including events for underage students, or à la carte events, most of which were optional and free. However, it is no longer possible to simply pay for only faculty Frosh. The combined price? Around $110 to $130, depending on the faculty.
This year, Kumar and his colleagues at SUS Frosh decided to implement a bursary that covered the full price – $125 – of SUS Frosh. The bursary, distributed to five students through an online application form integrated into online registration, was a big success according to Kumar.
SUS VP Inclusive Programming and Alternative Events Shannon Herrick said that the bursary was essential to the recipients. “[For them] it was, ‘if I do not get this, I will not be able to participate in Frosh,’” she said, adding that the recipients had a great experience.
However, no other faculties this year offered bursaries. “We’ve toyed with the idea of a fund or a bursary program,” Farnan said. “It’s in the works – how we can do it has yet to be discovered.” Until then, he added, “our best bet is to continue to try to reduce the actual cost of participating” by reducing costs internally.

Leaders seek to implement “culture change” with reforms 
For the second consecutive year, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), in conjunction with various student faculty associations, introduced a number of initiatives aimed at making Frosh more inclusive to underage and non-drinking students.
The changes included revamped elements such as harm reduction teams, “Chill Zones” that offered sunscreen and water, and more all-ages events across faculties.
Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) VP Internal Sahil Kumar and his colleagues also implemented additional changes to SUS Frosh. Kumar told The Daily that the SUS launched a “sober Frosh group” for students who abstained from drinking for any reason.
Another reform in SUS Frosh sought to hold leaders more accountable. “One of the things we encouraged this year was the designated dry leader,” said Sahil.
“[The dry leader] would be as sober as their least drunk froshie.”
The effort to shift the focus of Frosh from drinking has been a persistent target of reforms. Last year, then-SSMU President Josh Redel told The Daily that the reforms were aimed at “changing the culture of Frosh as a whole to make it less of a binge-drinking festival.”
SSMU VP Internal Brian Farnan described this year’s Frosh reforms in a similar fashion. “What we are trying to do is create programming […] where drinking is taking place but [that] is not focused on drinking.”
One such initiative this year was the rebranding of the pub crawl, now dubbed the “Montreal Crawl.” The traditional pub crawl was integrated into a scavenger hunt complete with food stops, to include both drinking and non-drinking students.
“I think that we as organizers are really proud of our [events with alcohol], we think it is very indicative of the culture here in Montreal,” said Farnan. “The majority of students are eighteen when they come to school.”
“We believe that it is important for their safety and independence to treat them as adults as soon as they get here,” Farnan continued. “That being said, we also recognize that not everyone drinks.”
Mitchell Miller, Campus Life and Engagement’s Student Life Coordinator, echoed Farnan and Kumar’s positive stance on the relationship between alcohol and Frosh, but noted, “We still need to work on the leaders to be part of this culture change. I think this year saw a lot of change with the coordinators really taking that ownership.”
However, according to Justin Koh, SSMU Equity Commissioner, these initiatives – while a step in the right direction – have not solved all the problems. “I think [alcohol] is definitely still is a very big component of Frosh, if not the largest component. There were a lot rules that they put in to make sure Frosh was more accessible to everyone.”
“I think drinking culture is this big umbrella term,” said Koh. “Alcohol – yeah, whatever, but what comes out of the Frosh culture is the bigger problem.”
AUS Equity Commissioner Josh Falek’s opinion was similar to Koh’s, stating in an email to The Daily, “I would say that as ever, Frosh is invested in a culture very much about the consumption of alcohol.”
“This year, however, it seemed that the Frosh coordinators tried to replace some of the most reprehensible aspects with temporary fixes to create a sort of ‘transitionary’ [sic] year, so that they could start the process of creating a more equitable Frosh.”

Mental health, representation of student associations both discussed
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) held their first Legislative Council meeting of the year on Thursday, discussing representation at the provincial level as well as the improvement of mental health services at McGill.
TaCEQ speaks on reform and accreditation
SSMU’s first guest speakers both came from its external student lobbying representation, the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ). Both TaCEQ’s Secretary-General, Paul-Antoine Cardin, and Vice Secretary-General Internal and Communications, Guillaume Fortin, spoke at Council.
After trying and failing to work with several other student federations, SSMU joined TaCEQ – in English, the Quebec Student Roundtable – in 2009. TaCEQ’s primary role is to lobby the government on issues such as university funding, legislation on tuition and ancillary fees, and other issues regarding higher education.
Although there are several characteristics that set TaCEQ apart from other associations – such as optional fees, a lack of a self-interested and centralized executive, and non-partisanship regarding provincial politics – it has faced criticism in the past from SSMU councillors. Cardin explained at the meeting that reform was one of TaCEQ’s main and most immediate long-term goals.
Although a congress was scheduled for October to discuss the possibility of reforming TaCEQ, Cardin claimed it was cancelled after the Association des étudiantes et des étudiants de Laval inscrits aux études supérieures (ÆLIÉS) – the graduate student association at Université Laval – claimed that they were not given enough time to think about it.
Cardin said that the biggest problem TaCEQ faced was how to represent their 70,000 members when “people don’t feel that they’re members of TaCEQ.”
The TaCEQ speakers also discussed their upcoming defense of the Act respecting the accreditation and financing of students’ associations. This past January, Université Laval students Laurent Proulx and Miguael Bergeron challenged the Act, criticizing the mandatory student association fees and perceived monopoly of student associations in Quebec. Instead, Proulx and Bergeron argued, students should be allowed to opt out of the fees and membership of the associations.
TaCEQ will go to trial in defense of the Act  – because it “lets [TaCEQ] exist,” according to Cardin – along with the provincial government and the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), another major student union. The date of the trial has not yet been set.
Committee on mental health aims to connect disparate groups and services
VP University Affairs Joey Shea presented a motion to convene an ad-hoc committee – meaning it would exist for only a year – on mental health. The committee, under VP Shea’s portfolio, would be composed of councillors, student executives, students-at-large, as well as representatives from different groups on campus.
“The idea behind the motion was that, right now, there’s a bunch of different mental health groups at SSMU and McGill that are working at similar aims, but are not necessarily connected to each other, or [are not] working well together or efficiently,” Shea said.
To “help make the mental health community stronger,” in Shea’s words, the committee’s end goal would be to draft a mental health policy by the end of the academic year.
According to Shea, improving mental health services at McGill was a key priority of all of the recent campaigns of the current SSMU executive. The committee was created after the motion passed unanimously.
