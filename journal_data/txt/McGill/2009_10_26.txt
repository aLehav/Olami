It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Ville-Marie borough mayor Benoit Labonté. Two weeks ago, reports surfaced that he had accepted over $100,000 from the powerful local construction mogul Tony Accurso. He was later excommunicated from his own party, Vision Montreal.
Labonté and Louise Harel, Vision’s mayoral candidate, both denied the allegations at first and accused Mayor Gérald Tremblay of promulgating rumours of corruption. Behind closed doors, however, Harel asked Labonté to step down as leader of Vision, according to the Montreal Gazette.
Currently, $180,000-worth of contracts doled out under Labonté’s tenure as mayor of Ville Marie are under review, including a $125,000 in contracts to a consulting firm run by Michel Petit, who reportedly served as one of Labonté’s top advisers in the 2008 Vision leadership race.
Labonté decided to go for broke on Thursday and bust the cesspool of Montreal and Quebec politics wide open. A former member of Tremblay’s Union Montreal party, Labonté has since accused both Tremblay and Harel of turning a blind eye to illegal campaign fundraising.
In an interview with Radio-Canada, Labonté admitted that he was lying when he initially denied that he had met with Accurso and accepted funds from him during his 2008 bid for leadership of the opposition party Vision Montreal. Labonté then joined the chorus of pundits calling for a public inquiry into municipal influence-pedalling Thursday, saying, “The system is so poisoned that we need a public inquiry immediately…. The real scandal would be not to have a public inquiry.”
Labonté also alleged that corporate payolas are constantly being funnelled into leadership races and electoral campaigns “in all the parties, municipal and provincial.”

Angry crowds of Montrealers mobilize as former president defends his legacy
Five people were arrested, two American flags were burned, shoes were thrown, and an effigy was beaten to a blaring Wu-Tang soundtrack as Montrealers gathered to protest a talk by former president George W. Bush on Thursday at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.
The protest was organized in part by the George Bush Welcoming Committee, a coalition of many anti-war, anti-poverty, and solidarity groups. They held signs and banners, blew horns, and chanted slogans in French and English, calling the former president a terrorist and demanding that he return to the United States.
“George Bush, we know you. Your daddy was a killer too!” the crowd chanted.
René-Lévesque was shut down between University and Peel, as hundreds of protesters blocked off the street. Dozens of riot police guarded the entrance and street-level windows, one of which advertised the hotel as the site of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s Montreal Bed-In for peace in 1969.
Matthew McLauchlin, who co-chairs the NDP’s Federal Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Transsexual committee, was present at the protest.
“It’s not every day that you get to denounce in person the man who started two wars this decade, ushered in an economic collapse, and did more to disrupt the world treaties and fragile agreements that kept the world at some level of basic decency,” McLauchlin said.
Inside, Bush received a standing ovation at the beginning and end of his talk. He spoke about life after the presidency, Canada-U.S. relations, and the milestones of his time in office – September 11, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the economic crisis – before taking questions from the moderator, John Parisella, the former chief of staff for Quebec premiers Robert Bourassa and Daniel Johnson.
The audience applauded Bush as he defended the U.S. response to September 11.
“When the first plane hit, it was an accident, when the second one hit it was an attack, and when the third one hit it was a declaration of war,” Bush said. “This is a war against ideologues who kill innocent [civilians]. I made the decision that my most important job was to protect citizens…. My mission was to stay on the offensive, and be relentless.”
Bush also commented on how he felt Iraq and Afghanistan were “two fronts in the same war” against “ideologues that spread hate in the name of false religion.”
“Some say Muslims don’t want to be free,” he said. “I believe freedom is universal.”
Bush was paid $100,000 to speak at the private, invitation-only event sponsored in part by the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations, and the prominent law firm Ernst & Young.
Judith Berlyn, one of the main organizers of Collectif Échec à la Guerre, was upset that prominent Montreal institutions had invited Bush to speak and paid for his appearance.
“The Montreal Chamber of Commerce is applying a double standard here. I mean they wouldn’t invite Pinochet. [Bush] should be treated as persona non grata,” said Berlyn. “The war industry flourishes in Montreal, and I personally wonder whether there is a connection with his visit,” she added.
During the question and answer session, Bush stated that if Saddam Hussein were still in power, there would be an ongoing arms race between Iraq and Iran. When asked for his thoughts on his achievements and failures, Bush said he felt his best work was helping to foster democracy in the Middle East, while his greatest mistake was failing to reform social security.
At least a dozen McGill students were present at the protest, and twice as many attended the event after winning tickets raffled by the political science department.
McGill student Sean Simeson, U3 Political Science, reflected on Bush’s faith in his own ideology.
“One thing that struck me was how candid he was. Everything that comes out of his mouth he believes to be true,” Simeson said.
Max Suderow, U3 Political Science and History, had a similar reaction.
“[Bush] frames the world into an ideological debate. I fundamentally disagree with him. The way he was discussing the Middle East seemed very naive,” Suderow said. “He talks about himself as someone who fights tyranny, brings freedom, but he picks and chooses.”
Bush responded directly to many of the criticisms of his administration, occasionally admitting to mistakes. In response to a question on what decisions he would have made differently, Bush pointed to his public image and his administration’s response to Hurricane Katrina.
“I think some of my language sent bad signals. I was a pretty bad speaker and did sloppy work,” he said. “When I think about Katrina, whether I should have sent federal troops, even if it was illegal…. I’ll leave the answer to my book.”
He commented on the financial crisis that escalated during his term in office and criticized the current American government for increasing involvement in the economy.
“I don’t believe the government should lead us out. I believe in the private sector only. Taxes must reward risk. In order to recover, the government needs to get out of the private sector, like autos,” he said. Bush’s prescription for poverty was similar, recommending that free trade was the only way out of abject poverty for developing nations
Ewald Friesen, a political science graduate student commented on Bush’s economic stance after the talk.
“One of the most unsurprising things is that he is unapologetically committed to neoliberalism,” said Friesen. “In many ways he is the embodiment of his brand of neo-conservatism. Trade is the answer to whatever ails you…. In response to the global economic meltdown, on bankers and stockbrokers, he claimed that ‘greedy’ is too strong a word.”
Despite admitting to his own faults, Bush maintained that the U.S. would see Republicans return to power.
“I believe 2010 will be a comeback for our party. The two presidents who picked up seats during their first term are FDR and me,” he said. “American people tend to reject extremes, and pretty soon sober leadership will show up. We’re not very long into the new administration. It’s the beginning of a new cycle, but the environment will change.”
The press was not formally invited to attend, though reporters from Le Devoir and Radio Canada were present.  Claude Levesque, a journalist at Le Devoir, commented that the exclusion of the press may have raised eyebrows.
“The press wasn’t disallowed, but it wasn’t formally invited,” Levesque said. “It may look as if they wanted to hold this behind closed doors without the press.”

On the night of October 15, Radio-Canada aired its investigative radio program Enquête, in which whistleblower François Beaudry – a former senior engineer at the Quebec Transport Ministry – along with construction company owners, revealed widespread tampering with the supposedly closed bidding process for Quebec road construction.
Beaudry alleged that firms now control who is awarded municipal contracts and the prices of those contracts. Beaudry went even further, revealing the forces behind this widespread collusion.
“It’s Montreal’s Italian Mafia that controls what is going on in road construction. They control, from what we can tell, 80 per cent of the contracts,” Beaudry told Radio-Canada.
The “Fabulous Fourteen” were 14 construction firms that would decide amongst themselves who would receive a contract and for how much. The agreement would be communicated through code: “We’ll start on the fourth hole; we’ll be a party of nine,” meant that the winning, lowest bid would be $4.9 million, according to Radio-Canada.
This report also stated that this system of collusion has inflated the cost of road construction in Quebec up to 35 per cent compared to other provinces.
These revelations have ignited a shit storm of accusations and political brouhaha at the municipal and provincial levels, with the top three parties in Montreal’s upcoming election and the opposition parties in Quebec all asking for a public inquiry.
On Thursday it was announced that Quebec was initiating the ominously named Opération Marteau (Operation Hammer), a special Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police squad, to investigate allegations of Mafia influence and widespread corruption. Quebec Premier Jean Charest has rebuffed calls for a public inquiry. The federal government has indicated that it will let the province handle the investigation.
The Montreal Gazette reported that some of the issues of serious concern to the police squad are that a man with close ties to the mafia sat in on a meeting to decide who would repair City Hall’s roof, and that “the Hells Angels have been using the construction industry to launder profits from drug trafficking by muscling their way in as subcontractors on large projects.”
After being up for one day, the Gazette reported that the SQ squad’s corruption hotline has already gotten many tips.

Candidates aim to increase youth involvement
McGill alum – and former Daily editor –  Nicholas Smith and McGill education student Phil Cutler are running for Westmount City Council in the November 1 municipal elections. They are the only two university-age contestants in a race where six out of nine positions are contested.
Young politicians, however, are not a widespread provincial trend. According to Quebec’s municipal affairs and regional elections web site, only 9.4 per cent of councillors elected in the province in 2005 were between the ages of 18 and 34.
Cutler is running in District 2 of Westmount, which has three candidates, the other two of which are senior members of the community.
“It’s the first real opportunity that I’ve had as an adult to get involved in municipal politics,” Cutler said. “I want to take advantage of that.”
“Our generation has been disengaged from political matters, without the involvement of youth. At any age, it’s important that people become aware of what is going on around them, the decisions that affect them,” said Cutler.
Smith is running in District 4 against incumbent councillor Kathleen Warner Duncan, who has only served one term in Westmount. He said the majority of a councillor’s responsibilities involve tackling small projects, such as installing speed bumps and keeping Westmount’s bike lanes open to traffic during the winter.
“I have a lot of interesting goals. We’ll see how naive and idealistic I am, [and] if I’m able to accomplish everything I said,” Smith said.
Though they were still uncertain how their youth might affect their work as potential councillors, Cutler and Smith felt they could offer a fresh perspective to residents who have lived in uncontested districts for longer periods of time.
“There’s a huge demographic that feels a disconnect in politics and I think that having one [young] councillor, and maybe two, would reflect the demographic weight of the age bracket that has tended not to care in the past,” said Smith.
“Once that has started, people will realize that it’s not just a closed-off, elderly branch that nobody knows about. Young people can actually get involved and do something for the better,” said Smith.
 Youth involvement is important, Smith said, because municipal politics have the greatest effect on residents’ daily lives, and smaller, local problems are often easier to fix. More importantly, the youth living in Westmount today are the ones who will feel the effects of municipal decisions, such as the construction of a superhospital on the area’s borders.
A part of their strategy is also to highlight their youth as beneficial to the aging population of the community.
“[The older residents are] looking to the younger generations who are much more competent at developing the next level and taking it to the top in technology,” Cutler said.
Cutler added, however, that some residents took his age as a reason to not take him seriously as a politician.
“People are waiting for you to slip up. You can tell that they’re not going to [say], ‘I want to make decisions with a 21-year-old,’” Cutler said.
“They want wisdom, they want someone who supposedly is an expert, but that doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily the best.”
Neither Cutler nor Smith seems to be deterred by the lack of precedent for young councillors in Westmount, however.
“The only reason I am running is to win; that’s why people get involved in politics. I’m not running a campaign as just a joke. I’m using everything possible to put myself in the best position,” Cutler said.
Westmount residents can vote in Victoria Hall on Sunday, October 25 from 12-8 p.m.; or on Sunday, November 1 from 10 a.m.-8 p.m.

The first shock of this election season was long in coming. On September 23, Mayor Gérald Tremblay cancelled a contract between the City and the private consortium GÉNIeau to install water meters and other expensive gadgets in buildings across the city. The contract’s value ballooned from its initial estimate of $32 million to approximately $355 million, making it the largest contract in Montreal history.
Allegations and consternation over the contract started last April, when it was revealed that Tremblay’s former “right-hand man,” Frank Zampino, had taken a lovely Caribbean vacation on the yacht of construction magnate Tony Accurso during the bid-tendering process. By the time these revealtions surfaced, Zampino was already out of politics and comfortably positioned as vice-president and chief financial officer of Dessau Inc., a partner in the consortium, which included businesses owned by Accurso, that received the water-meter contract.
Zampino resigned from his corporate positions, and following an announcement that some of Accurso’s businesses were being investigated for tax fraud, the water meter contract was “put on ice.”
Montreal’s auditor-general, Jacques Bergeron, was put on the case and announced on September 21 that the water meter contract should be cancelled, and that the City needs to overhaul the way it makes deals, saying that the process was “too fast, too big, too expensive.”
Tremblay announced that the deals were kaput – along with the City’s top two civil servants. But the mayor may have breathed a sigh of relief, as Bergeron blamed no one except a general climate of incompetence for the mishaps. Tremblay owed the situation to “administrative shortcomings” and “procedural oversights,” and played it up as an opportunity to improve.

Quebec Superior Court to hear the case
McGill student Jackie Jones will be heard at the Quebec Superior Court on November 25, after she filed a racial profiling complaint to the Quebec Human Rights Commission (QHRC) in early July, with the help of the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR). Jones, a black woman, was accosted and arrested by five security guards at the Peel metro station in late March of this year.
At the time of arrest, Jones was standing at the top of the stairs of the downtown station with a Hispanic male friend. They were asked by two Société de transport de Montréal (STM) security guards to step aside in French. One of the guards became angry when Jones requested they repeat their request in English.
“They said ‘move now!’ and it was a bit aggressive. I listened and was going to move on, but I told them that there is no need for the aggression. At this point they asked for my ID and were going to give me a ticket,” Jones said. “When I started to question them about why I was receiving a ticket, one of the guards grabbed my arm and twisted it to my back. They called for three more male security guards, who slammed me onto the ground and handcuffed me,” she added.
After a brief discussion with the police who later arrived, and the discovery that Jones was a McGill student, she was released. But Jones felt that she was a victim of racial profiling and asked for help from the CRARR.
According to Adrienne Gibson, a civil rights advocate at CRARR – a Montreal-based non-profit public interest organization – this is not an individual incident,  but is among many other cases that are related to racial profiling.
“We have a number of cases where the police [or metro security guards] target members of the black community, particularly young men and women, but not exclusively. These kinds of incidences happen and it is a systemic problem. It is a larger problem and has serious consequences for communities,” Gibson said.
In August, Jones received court papers citing two criminal charges for obstructing the work of civil servants in relation to the incident and was fined $100.
Jones advised students who have faced similar situations to share their experiences so that the systemic problem can be resolved.
“If there’s anybody who has ever been assaulted in this type of way without any reasoning, if they can share their stories with CRARR, then we can try to attack this situation from a citizen standpoint…and try to see what the source of the problem is,” Jones said.
Gibson felt that a solution would not be possible unless other victims also come forward.
“We think that the only way to stop this is to get people to come forward and to talk about what’s happening so that we can start coming up with some solutions,” Gibson said.

The atmosphere surrounding the approaching November 1 election has quickly soured in recent weeks as numerous corruption scandals have come to light. Recent news reports on the sordid dealings of municipal officials, construction firms, and even the mafia have prompted Montrealers to question whether their City’s government has their best interests at heart. Indictments of Hell’s Angels for laundering drug money through construction subcontracts and the underhanded funnelling of hundreds of thousands of corporate campaign donations into political coffers have begun to define the election season. With the two leading parties – Mayor Tremblay’s Union Montreal and opposition party Vision Montreal – both embroiled in scandal, third party Projet Montréal, led by Richard Bergeron, has been making recent gains in the polls.

Milton-Parc fights against green space redevelopment
Residents of the Milton-Parc community are fighting to preserve a small patch of green space known as “Parc Oxygène.” Montreal recently changed the zoning laws in the area, which would allow small housing units to be constructed on the private land. Many of the residents have said this will be a deciding issue in the upcoming municipal elections.
In the mid-eighties, a small alleyway stretching from Hutchison to Parc, just south of des Pins, was used as a shortcut by taxi drivers and other motorists. Residents complained at the time that it was a danger to the local children.
The land was purchased by Maurice Fattel, who wished to convert it into a parking lot. Local residents were upset with this development and decided to pool their resources to transform the lane into a park.
Norman Nawrocki, a member of the non-profit housing co-op known as the Milton-Park Project, dedicated to maintaining the Parc Oxygène, has lived in the area since 1981. “It was a nice, quiet neighbourhood before developers started to destroy it,” he said.
After complaints to the City went unnoticed, a group of anonymous residents brought flowers and potted trees and began to landscape the area, turning it into a green space.
According to the residents, Fattel did not mind that his land was being used as a park. “In the beginning, we asked the City to preserve it for the long term by purchasing the land. They insisted it was safe, that they didn’t have money to buy the land but we didn’t need to worry since no one would build on it,” Nawrocki said.
Recent zoning changes have left the residents fuming. One resident wrote to the City after he saw a developer surveying the land last month, and he was informed that a zoning change was made in 2008 at the request of the owner. The previous zoning regulation only permitted construction of buildings six to 12 stories high, which would have made building on this 6.6 metre-wide lot difficult. The change permits construction of three- or four-storey buildings.
“The City prides itself on all its green initiatives, so how do they justify taking away a neighbourhood park? Local people invested time and money into the park to keep it green and with one stroke of the pen, all our hard work can be erased,” Nawrocki said.
Michel Prescott, city councillor for the Jeanne-Mance area, said that the best-case scenario would be for the City to purchase the land and allow it to remain as a park. However, he said the City does not have the budget to purchase this area and doesn’t want to set a precedent.
“We cannot buy all the small lands in Montreal and create parks and if we do it for this park, then we will be asked to do the same thing for other areas and we cannot afford that,” Prescott said.
Nawrocki thought this could be a good precedent for the City to set.
“Why is the City afraid of setting a precedent? Set an environmentally friendly precedent. Our park provides a breath of fresh air in this neighbourhood, so for the City to say they have no money is not true. It’s a political decision. They have decided they know better than us, but it is in our best interests to keep this park or we wouldn’t have worked so hard to maintain it,” Nawrocki said.
The City argues that a small housing project is a better alternative than a condominium building, and that the residents will benefit economically from these new developments.
“It’s not a park, but it’s better than a high-rise,” Prescott said.
According to McGill architecture professor Derek Drummond, this is not an environmental issue but a social one.
“These urban spaces that allow citizens to gather and enjoy social interactions are vital to their sense of community and well-being. If the land is in private hands, the community has no right to demand the owner provide the space for public use,” Drummond said.
“What must happen is that the City must purchase the land at a fair price and then devote the space to public use,” Drummond said.
“We’ve transformed a dangerous intersection into a beautiful park, adding to the health of the neighbourhood. Our co-op has won awards for beautifying the neighbourhood. Without this park, it would be a sadder neighbourhood. It’s inhumane to live with concrete and asphalt around you–who wants to live in a city without greenery?” Nawrocki said.

On October 16, Quebec’s chief electoral officer launched an investigation into reports that the owner of a construction firm in the suburban municipality of Boisbriand attempted to bribe two mayoral candidates into dropping out of the upcoming election.
Local construction magnate Lino Zambito discouraged Patrick Thiffault and Marlene Cordato, both municipal councillors, from running for mayor in a meeting with Zambito and Boisbriand mayor Sylvie Saint-Jean last spring. Thiffault and Cordato surreptitiously recorded the meeting, and recently turned a copy of the recording over to Radio-Canada.
CBC reports that Zambito’s Infrabec has won over half the municipal contracts awarded under Saint-Jean’s administration – cumulatively valued at about $50 million.
