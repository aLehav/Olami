After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kevin Parker didn’t exactly vanish from the studio after his group, Tame Impala, debuted its 2012 masterpiece, “Lonerism.” Despite rumblings from side project Melody’s Echo Chamber and vigorous touring, however, Parker’s emergence as one of the most promising rock and electronic figures in music was somewhat stale by the start of 2015. Then Tame Impala—which for all intents and purposes belongs to Parker as completely as the “Pet Sounds” Beach Boys belonged to Brian Wilson—released “Let it Happen,” a stunning, somehow simultaneously accessible and experimental 8-minute odyssey. The track, which succinctly addresses Parker’s recording reclusion, works equally well as an intimate psychedelic exploration and a Daft Punk-esque banger. In short, it’s a stunning reemergence.
While Parker’s verses suggest the pressures of touring, critical expectation, and even disappointing his mother, neither his tone nor the pace is ever panicked. “All this running around / I can’t fight it much longer / Something’s trying to get out / And it’s never been closer,” Parker sings in a disarmingly mellow tenor. Instead of panicking about the necessity to create and impress, “Let it Happen” breezes by, a steady drum beat buoying Parker’s titled refrain. Tame Impala has often operated in muted emotional tones—frantic and angst-ridden lyrics balanced with lilting collages of synthesized and stringed upbeat (or at least not explicitly anguished) instrumentation. The band achieves the same dichotomy here, but it seems even more confusingly natural than on “Lonerism.” It’s clear that, despite the song’s lyrical anxiety, Parker knows he has everything under control.
He would be right to believe this. The song’s backing goes from little more than ancillary for its word-heavy first portion, to central for its percussive middle, to simply staggering for its harmonic fadeout. Most impressive is a section in the middle of the song where Parker incorporates 30 seconds of a single, repeated synth note. The pulsing, percussive reiteration is a far cry from accelerating and self-conscious mainstream EDM drops. When the drums build, the melody darkens and a modulated version of the main synth line bursts forth from the drone without any quickening of tempo. Despite its simplicity, the swell is just as exhilarating as any more complex instrumental coda. The last two minutes of the song, which find Parker harmonizing with himself gorgeously and unintelligibly over an emergent counter-melody, seems like braggadocio. Given his meticulous production and songcraft, its hard to believe Parker can be taking his own meditative advice. If he is simply skating along, however, he may be capable of practically anything.

Kendrick Lamar has already proven himself to be the sort of artist one can take seriously when he proclaims, “Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin’”; 2012’s astonishingly impactful “good kid, m.A.A.d. city” was more than enough to establish him as one of the best rappers active today. Of course, Lamar is far too subtle a writer to sing his own praises so simply—in the same line, and in the track’s title, he refers to himself as “King Kunta,” simultaneously adopting the roles of ruler and slave. This degree of lyrical complexity is characteristic of the album as a whole: Though Lamar abandons the compelling storyline structure of his previous release, he more than makes up for the lack of a central storyline, displaying an even greater command of language throughout “To Pimp a Butterfly.” Even the album’s title, initially jarring, gains a deep significance through a frankly beautiful extended metaphor in the outro of the final track, “Mortal Man.” What’s more, Lamar’s progress since “good kid” is not simply limited to his increasing skill as a writer: Throughout “To Pimp a Butterfly” wend strains of jazz and funk elevate its tracks far beyond anything Lamar has previously accomplished musically. “To Pimp a Butterfly” is artistically exquisite and emotionally profound— Kendrick Lamar is not simply a rapper but an artist of the highest caliber.
The upbeat production of lead single “i” constitutes an apt introduction to the substantial shift in style Lamar has made since his sophomore release. “To Pimp a Butterfly”’s opening track, “Wesley’s Theory,” produced by Flying Lotus, builds on Lamar’s new musical diversity by featuring a funky synth bassline. The backing works with Lamar’s vocals to create a tone that could perhaps best be described as darkly fun—appropriate accompaniment for lyrics that introduce the themes of fame, race, and commercialism that pervade the album. On the following track, “For Free? (Interlude),” produced by Terrace Martin, Lamar raps with astonishing speed over a fully fleshed-out and impressively layered jazz instrumental.
Within the domain of production, however, lies the album’s sole major flaw. Lamar has elected to include a version of “i” on the album that differs from the single release—it is crafted to sound like a live performance, a choice that does have the advantage of giving Lamar the opportunity to interrupt the song to talk explicitly about the importance of retaining a sense of positivity and camaraderie in the black community. The single “i,” however, is so well-composed and effervescent that the album’s “live” version feels jarringly thin in comparison. Especially in the context of such an impeccably produced album, the choice to include a less-refined version falls flat.
But the album version of “i” does succeed in bringing home its message, and in this regard it fits in neatly with the rest of “To Pimp a Butterfly.” Lamar in particular focuses in his [third album][FC] on violence and hatred within the black community, as in “The Blacker the Berry,” where he ingeniously turns what initially listens as a vindication of blackness when he describes himself as a killer of other black men. In “Complexion (A Zulu Love),” he paints himself as a slave “dark as the midnight hour” who cares for his master’s half-black daughter. Lamar’s own work on the track, a verse from female rapper Rapsody, and piano melody-focused production from The Antydote and Sounwave unite both to craft a compelling love story and a moving critique of discrimination based on skin color within the black community—and, arguably, the album’s strongest track.
“To Pimp a Butterfly” is not only an album comprised of 16 impressive tracks: It is a cohesive work, united not only by musical style and poetic lyrics but also by the smooth, sometimes unnoticeable transitions between tracks. Clearly, Lamar has not mastered only the art of the track but also the art of the album. Though he may have been understandably jarred when his album dropped a week early due to a mistake by his record label, his listeners are all the luckier for it—an additional week to enjoy an album such as this is a valuable week indeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester I’ve been conducting a social science research experiment. The subject is me. My professors would breathe a ground-sinking sigh at the size of the sample (n=1), the depth of my literature review (none), the possibilities for replication (ha), and, well, the fact that the researcher and the subject are the same person. Nevertheless, I've moved forward with a sense of all-importance.
The treatment was school. Not just school in the sense that we register for classes, show up to the sections that count for participation, b.s. our way through the sections that count for participation, and do only the readings that are relevant for the paper. Please raise your hand if this resonates with you. (If you are a math, science, or engineering concentrator, you can stop reading now.)
The treatment was school in the way the administration has increasingly hinted that we should be doing it: Keeping on top of the readings, writing papers beyond the standard of “Would-I-be-embarrassed-to-hand-this-in?” and attending the oh-so-neglected office hours. Maybe even go so far as to translate the occasional Latin and German in our very down-to-earth readings.
The message from the University lately, namely after the recent integrity crises, has been clear: Studying and learning in the classroom should come before anything, including extracurriculars. Those of you who are organizational leaders on campus may remember a post-Snowpocalypse email from Associate Dean David Friedrich: “Your help with…the expectation for your membership that they should be prioritizing academic commitments over extra-curricular activities will go a long way as we all work together following these unprecedented circumstances.” As a student in the social sciences, I cannot deny that I felt a pinch.
So this semester, I decided to shake up my priorities a bit. This new sense of initiative was facilitated by the fact that I had retired from almost all of my student activities. Like a decent social scientist (or a bad one that doesn’t know she’s bad), I started out with my primary hypothesis. What would be my reaction to this newfound way of doing school?
H-null: nah
H-1: yeah!
Before I reveal and discuss my results, I’ll discuss my orientation towards school during my freshman and sophomore years. My thought process was that the real learning happens outside the classroom. And I wasn’t exactly wrong. The Jenny that gave up close reading, office hours, and the occasional lecture to attend meetings and speaker events gained a ton of intangible insight and “marketable” skills not available in the classroom.
Needless to say, experiencing things like organizational friction, event planning crises, and engagement with the rules and people outside the Bubble have been especially valuable moments of learning. I was strongly convinced that I am at Harvard for the opportunities, and that those opportunities came more through extracurriculars than classes.
Treatment-me took some time to get used to the new lifestyle. My email inbox is populated by professors and teaching fellows rather than peers setting up student organization meetings. I make an effort to go to office hours and follow faculty to their event lectures. I open emails that I never would have touched before: Ones publicizing screenings of documentaries related to what I study in class. Most significantly, I buy books and actually read them.
I’m still not the best “student” I can be. I write as I sit here with stress burning my brain cells because I have a paper deadline looming too close and I am not prepared. But if you ask me whether I’ve found meaning in my in-classroom studies, I cannot deny that I have.
For the first time in many spring breaks, I found myself gushing details from the books I read for class to a reluctantly listening Mom, rather than organizing a post-break meeting at which to organize another meeting. I told her about the anthropological work that amplified the voices of single moms in the midst of a national debate on inequality dominated by upper-class senators and academics. I told her about a documentary that I randomly hit up because it was related to a class I’m taking. Have you ever thought critically about the fact that Chinese food is cheap everywhere and French food is expensive everywhere?
Being removed from the actuality of what I study has opened up a huge window into the ignorant bliss of what senators, government officials, and even community organizers—the speakers that made up most of my learning outside of class—would call impracticality. And I wonder, as humbly as this thought would allow me, whether that might be the meaning of college and a liberal arts education. If we can’t even sketch an image of efficiency and justice in a thought vacuum void of real world obstacles and the boundaries of “the way things are supposed to be,” how are we supposed to get out there after four years and imagine a better system to replace whatever is broken?
Over my three years here, much of my writing has served to criticize Harvard, its institutions, and its traditions. But I still love this place. Harvard gives you the thing to criticize and the tools with which to criticize it. My experiment this semester has shown me that much of the philosophy that powers my often incomprehensible babble about this place comes from its syllabi, readings, and brilliant professors. So let me know if you want in on round two.

In my dreams, I have a closet full of beautiful high-heeled shoes, each pair a freestanding gem of exquisite ergonomic beauty that reaches the apex of its power only when on my feet, conveying me to the unveiling of my first book, an art-historical research endeavor that explores twentieth century feminism.
Sure, I’ll wait while you re-read that. Take your time, really, I know it’s hard to wrap your head around. I’m a feminist. Yes, my goals are hefty, intellectual ones. But when I envision myself living my dreams, future-me is rocking a head-turning, quirky outfit. Can someone please tell me why those aspirations are incompatible?
My intellectual, book-ish side is an important part of my identity. Ever since I learned to read, I proudly wielded the power it gave me to pick up any piece of literature—be it of repute or of Buzzfeed—and learn. But, I’m often overlooked when I try to start a conversation about sartorial decisions with my more intellectual friends, as if the conversation were too frivolous to entertain.
Could it be that the values of fashion industry—which I find riveting—fly in the face of my values as a self-respecting woman? In the book “Women in Clothes,” hundreds of females of varying fame and fortune agree: It doesn’t always feel like “a good thing to talk about clothes…because people will have the impression…that [we’re] stupid, and [we] don’t have any other things in [our lives] to think of.”
But I’ve decided that I needn’t be any more secretive about poring over Vogue as my friend is when he’s reading his psychology textbook. Because if the point of SLS20 is to better understand how we communicate and relate to each other, he and I are covering the exact same material.
True, the idea of “clothes-shopping” carries with it negative connotations, mostly due to certain celebrities in Hollywood who will buy a million-dollar handbag rather than appropriating their money productively. But dressing isn’t always elitist or merely superficial. I’m with Leopoldine Core on this one, who, in an interview for “Women in Clothes,” said: “We are always asking for something when we get dressed. Asking to be loved…to be left alone, to make people laugh, to scare people, to look wealthy, to say I’m poor, I love myself.”
Clothing as language is an underexplored concept in the realm of politics, education, and business. And as fashion bloggers Jayne Min and Madeline Pendleton point out, no one is exempt from partaking in the conversation surrounding fashion, since it’s our public responsibility regardless of race, status, or gender.
So, let’s start talking!
It should be easy: Clothing is a rather effective tool for communicating, because the language is universal. Kendall Jenner, Hilary Clinton, and your mother all wear the same basic items. Everyone knows how to put on pants and who’s expected to wear a skirt. So even if you only have a basic level of cultural understanding about clothes, you can initiate important discussions simply by curating your wardrobe thoughtfully.
When Amelia Bloomer left caution to the wind and refused to wear her corset, instead opting to be incredibly subversive and wear pants, she empowered women everywhere to assert their right to comfortable dress and heralded a new phase of freedom for the feminists of her time.
More recently, when Lady GaGa stormed onto the set of the music industry wearing outlandish dresses made of meat, traveling in an egg-shaped pod, and cross-dressing on the red carpet, she captivated millions of consumers and eloquently communicated her wholehearted support of free self-expression more effectively than many of her peers.
Many underestimate the power that they wield as they stand before their closets undressed each morning. The fact is, taking advantage of your freedom to dress is as much an act of political uprightness as voting or participating in the Divest Harvard sit-in. You can rebuke dress codes or—if you’re really rebellious—repurpose your dresses as skirts. You have the power to support brands that respect your beliefs—like Stella McCartney, whose line is completely vegan—or withhold your business from conglomerates like Urban Outfitters that are imprudently racist, make light of mental illness, and irreverently reference troubling cultural phenomena.
Think of it this way: If you don’t care enough to give yourself more than a passing glance in the mirror, then how can you expect a prospective employer or lover to act any different? The best kind of person shouldn’t care what you look like as long as you’re happy with the way you look. But for some, it takes thirty minutes, five shirt changes, and a funky purse to fashion the desired effect. If, like me, you’re such a person, then I say unto you: Go forth unabashedly and, please, shop ‘til you drop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Safe spaces on college campuses have recently come under scrutiny for discouraging intellectual discussion, even as some students at the University and even UC presidential tickets have advocated for more safe spaces on campus. There can be no doubt that certain safe spaces on campus can serve a positive purpose, especially when acting as judgment-free zones or havens for marginalized students; however, ones that stigmatize opposing beliefs do not. When a “safe space” becomes synonymous with an environment that works to eradicate controversial viewpoints, it enforces narrow-mindedness and undermines learning. Safe spaces should protect people, not ideas—making the world a more just place requires people to engage with both like-minded and dissenting opinions.
Invoking safety as an excuse to ban opposing perspectives is entirely counterproductive. Recently, student activists at Northwestern University carried mattresses around campus, using Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz’s tactic not to lobby for an alleged rapist’s expulsion as she did, but instead to protest an article that opposed the ban on student-faculty relationships, written by Northwestern Professor Laura Kipnis. The students asked administrators to officially condemn the ideas in the article due to “the violence” of its message, and for such a response to be “automatic” in the future. But there was no “violence” in Professor Kipnis’ article, and for students to ask Northwestern to officially and automatically censure her viewpoints is unjustified.
Sadly, the request and protest at Northwestern was also unsurprising, and representative of a dangerous trend on college campuses of using false attacks on safety to shut down provocative opinions; it is a pattern that contradicts the goal and culture of higher learning, which should instead foster intellectual debate. Repressing ideas that students dislike will only leave them ill-equipped for life after college, where ideas roam free.
While empathizing with upset peers is important, the purpose of an acceptable safe space should be to provide care, not to facilitate the avoidance of contrary opinions. A recent debate at Brown University about campus sexual assault, which featured speakers of various beliefs, prompted the establishment of a safe space during the debate for those who were potentially troubled by certain aspects of the discussion. The initial purpose of this safe space—to protect students—was laudable; on the other hand, when such a space is appropriated as a shelter against dissenting beliefs, as was the case for some students at Brown, it no longer has value. Students—not their ideas—deserve protection.
Places like Room 13, which forgo prejudice and offer tolerance in order to give individuals the opportunity to voice their concerns without fear of judgment, are worthwhile safe spaces. But not all safe spaces are created equal, and some harm more than they help. Colleges that allow students to opt out of conversations involving ideas with which they disagree cannot properly claim that they are promoting the growth of their students or preparing them for the real world. Ultimately, a trend that encourages people to refuse to engage with all but one view of justice is not the way to a just society.

Spring Break is over and there are still seven weeks until summer. Between now and then, there will be midterms, finals, papers, and projects, all while the weather grows warmer. There may not be much to look forward to between now and then, but there is one day that will give many some comic relief—April Fools’ Day.
This year, April Fools’ falls next Wednesday, which means there is about one week to prepare for this special day. If you don’t have a legendary prank in mind, don’t stress! We here at FM came up with some of the best pranks of the year.
THE FIRST MEETINGLet’s face it, folks, with over 400 student organizations at Harvard, no one is going to notice if a new one pops up in the middle of the year. Start by advertising your club’s first meeting. Print some flyers and post them all across campus. Make sure “Free Food” is bolded, front and center. That way it won’t even matter what your organiza- tion is all about. When students show up to your meeting, we’ll let you decide what they’re more disappointed about—the fact that your club doesn’t exist or that there’s no free food.
A REVERSAL OF FORTUNESRegular action admissions decisions come out at the end of March. Fortunately, April Fools’ Day also comes at the end of March, so the timing couldn’t be more appropriate. Grab some of your CS friends, have them find the admitted students email list, and you are in busi- ness. Send them whatever you want: a reversal of their admission deci- sion, a notification that they were actually placed on the waitlist, or, in good Harvard fashion, a notification that their first college paper is due in a week. Whatever you do, make it convincing. Apparently these new admits are pretty smart.
AND NOW PRESENTING...Famous people visit Harvard all the time. We’ve already seen Keegan-Michael Key, Amy Poehler, and President Jimmy Carter, among others. No one will blink if another famous name is added to
that list. Just don’t pick anyone too famous. Otherwise people might actually look into it. Get one of the many organizations you’re a part of in on the prank, and advertise that your favorite celebrity is indeed coming to campus. By the time people realize that your celebrity of choice is still in Hollywood, Washington D.C., or their country of origin, they’ll already be lined up out the Science Center door.
PAVLOV’S ROOMMATEIs your roommate suggestible? Are you in need of a live-in ser- vant? Either way, it doesn’t matter because classically conditioning your roommate is never not a good idea. If they’re messy, try reward- ing your roommate with a snack every time they tidy up their half of the room. Get creative because you can really take this prank in any direction. Who knows, maybe you can petition to get credit for SLS 20 with this home grown psych study.
H-HARMONYPlay matchmaker to all your single friends by helping them get dates this semester! So what if your help is unsolicited? So what if they’ve repeatedly asked you to stop involving yourself in their love lives? Sign those thirsty fools up for Tinder and swipe right for days. Go that extra mile and post personal ads around campus with their phone number on it because you can’t afford to miss out on any demographics. When your friends finally catch on and angrily con- front you, act indignant. You’re just being a good friend!

If you think about it, there are really two states a Harvard student can be in: crying and not crying. Did you think we were going to say Massachusetts and New York? If so, you should start crying from shame.
As we all know, crying is easy and not crying is hard. Many things have caused us to cry in recent weeks: my academic adviser’s criticism, my FM editor’s even more unjust criticism, and that Valentine’s Day box of chocolates we saw someone else eating, just to name a few. Not many people study crying. But we do. It’s not weird. For our research, we ventured into the field to observe criers in their natural habitats. What follows are our findings on where people cry and why. We also give some advice for those not yet experienced in the art of Harvard crying.
LAMONT LIBRARYThe Lamont crier, tears dribbling onto his or her homework, wants to show the whole damned floor how much he or she cares about school. Sometimes the person lets out a soft sob and looks up to see if anyone notices. They’ll sometimes even attach themselves to one of our shoulders. How can we work with a blockmate crying like that, asking for love and support? To avoid these types, go to Widener’s Loker Reading Room, where it’s acceptable to tell people to shut up.
WITH YOUR PROFESSORCrying in front of your professor is kind of fun. A subpar grade always motivates this type of cry. We’ve seen teary-eyed people approach the professor after a lecture, but the prof ducks and weaves, perhaps anticipating the stream of tears about to burst forth. We recommend office hours, because the professor has to sit and stay put. It’s hard to cry for two hours, though. Some people like to bring a backpack full of chopped onions, to really get the tears flowing, but we prefer revisiting tragic personal memories. If you don’t have dark enough moments, too bad for you. If successful, you’ll watch them squirm and pretend to care. They’ll whisper sweet nothings like, “We have professional graders,” or “It’s not you, it’s me.”
ON THE BANKS OF THE CHARLESCrying while sitting on the bench beside the Charles can be tricky. The people that go there are trying to be alone with nature. They want to appear “deep.” Maybe they’ll bellow, a guttural moan shared only between them and Mother Nature. Maybe they just want to catch a peek of their thoughtful reflection in the water. Who knows? When we jog by this type of crier, we have no idea what to do. What, are we supposed to stop and help a stranger? When we run, we’re trying to get our sweat on, not get cried on.
IN A MUSEUMThe Fogg Museum has one piece that will make you cry: this Medieval Chinese “Moon Jar.” There’s always a crowd of about 15 people there, just crying. You’d understand if you’d been there. The jar touches you to your fucking soul. Or it is your soul.
THE DINING HALLThe d-hall is a typical place to cry. You sit by yourself at the back of the d-hall. You try to keep it together but the tears start rolling down your nose and drop onto your mound of peas. You chose to eat the peas because each one used to be in a group of friends, but now is podless.
AT HOMEThe crier immerses his or her head in a pillow and presses hard against the wall. When finished, the crier wipes his or her eyes and looks in the mirror to check that the reflection is happy. The person strolls out to meet the Harvard world with a smile on his or her face. We lied at the beginning. There are three states for the Harvard student: crying, not crying, and pretending not to be crying.

When I thank Applied Biology professor Ralph Mitchell for taking the time to speak with me at the beginning of our interview, he laughs and reassures me that he’s not busy at all. I find this hard to believe, as he is currently in the midst of a race to save the world’s oldest mummies.
Mitchell’s pure passion for applied microbiology is obvious from the start of our conversation—he seems to be on a mission to convince me of how important these microscopic organisms are.
“Even though we can’t see them, microbes are central to everything that happens to humans,” he says excitedly. “In fact, without microbes, the world just wouldn’t work.”
Microbiology has always been the fulcrum of Mitchell’s academic and professional career. “I became fascinated with the microbial world very early on,” he explains. As a freshman at Trinity College in Dublin, he enrolled in an introductory microbiology class. “I was just blown away,” he recalls.
Now, he’s at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, where he has spent over 40 years teaching and conducting research. Mitchell’s laboratory group engages in the study of microbial processes in natural habitats, specifically the role of microbes in attacking non-living materials. Over the years, he has worked on impressive projects in the field, including analyzing decay processes in King Tutankhamen’s tomb and the Apollo spacesuits.
His latest work involves the study of mummies from the Chinchorro people—hunter-gatherers who lived along the coast of modern day Chile and Peru. These mummies are some of the world’s oldest, dating as far back as 5050 B.C. More than 100 of these Chinchorro mummies are preserved at the University of Tarapacá’s archaeological museum in Arica, Chile. However, in the last decade, Chilean preservationists have been noting the deterioration of the mummies at unprecedented rates.
Mitchell became involved with this project about three years ago. His job is to understand and explain the degradation of these heritage materials.
“When we’re talking about the Atacama Desert in Chile, we’re talking about one of the driest regions of the world,” he explains. “But when the climate started to change and fog began to roll in from the Pacific, the mummies that were preserved there began to go black and turn to jelly.”
Over the past few years, Mitchell’s research group has examined the issue of these rapidly decaying Chinchorro mummies. After receiving pieces of the mummy skin from Chile, the team isolated microorganisms from the skin. They then placed these microorganisms onto pig skin they received from the Harvard Medical School, and exposed the new skin to different conditions, like high humidity and temperature.
Mitchell emphasizes the word “opportunist” in describing microbes and the natural decay process. He explains that, given the proper temperature and right humidity, microbes use the skin as a nutrient source.
“In the case of Chile, climate change is facilitating this decay process,” he says. “With these changing temperatures and conditions, you see the mummy skin begin to deteriorate at an incredible speed.”
According to Mitchell, this is the first time that climate change has become such a pertinent and pressing matter in his field. The effects of changes in weather conditions are becoming increasingly serious in his work on heritage materials. For Mitchell, the need to address this issue is urgent: He contends that the matter will be a long-term project for the international scientific community.
“We’re talking about different countries, different priorities, and different materials that may be at a higher risk of degradation than others,” he says.
While Mitchell says addressing the effects of climate change is daunting in scale, he’s also hopeful that the this issue is going to gain the attention it deserves.
“It’s also very early,” Mitchell says. “Learning to understand and resolve this issue of the way climate change affects heritage materials is clearly going to be a national and international discussion over the next couple of years.”

What might help homeless people overcome poverty? The question is one that many have attempted to solve via shelters, food kitchens, and short-term employment opportunities. But three students at the Harvard Graduate School of Education are approaching the problem in a different way.
Cindy C. Yang, Hannah R. Fidoten, and Farhan M. Quasem identified lack of internet access as a crucial hindrance towards locating jobs and long-term housing opportunities. Through their startup, Mobilzr, they seek to provide physical WiFi devices to homeless people in order to improve digital literacy.
I sit down with Yang and Fidoten one morning in lobby of Gutman Library, and they explain their inspiration for the startup.
“What first drew us to it was just the daily commute through Harvard Square and seeing the homelessness,” Yang recalls. At a hack-a-thon last fall, they realized technology’s potential in addressing the issue. “We have an affinity towards technology journalism solutions,” she adds.
While various shelters and food organizations already exist to assist homeless people, there is currently no group that focuses primarily on providing internet access, according to the students. The students believe that, with WiFi devices, homeless people can gain agency in their job searches and lives in general. “We decided to focus on how we could get these devices to them so that they could take advantage of the technology that any of us are so accustomed to using,” Fidoten says.
Though their inspiration came from homeless people living on the streets of Harvard Square, the students explain that they have a different target audience.
“We’re working with individuals in transitional housing programs, so they actually have a place to live at the moment,” Fidoten explains, “but they’re working on finding a better job and housing that they can pay for on their own.” Many of these transitional housing organizations do not have WiFi, and for those that do, many of their occupants don’t have devices to access the internet in the first place.
Along with providing internet-accessing devices, the students are working on a curriculum that will accompany the device. It will provide its recipients with instruction both in general technology use and for specific apps, such as LinkedIn, to help with housing and job searches. Yang tells me about a promising app on the horizon called Micro Employment Opportunities, which MIT students are working on. “A local business might post something like ‘Help me take out the trash’ and then homeless people could get experience or short-term benefits,” she explains.
Mobilizr is in its earlier stages of development; its three creators have not yet filed for non-profit status. They have decided to first test their idea through three separate pilots. In these pilots, they distribute their devices to their target transitional housing organizations and work on educating homeless people there. Their first pilot launched in February, and their second will be in April. They are using an IndieGoGo campaign, which allows the general public to donate any dollar amount, to help fund their second round.
These pilots may vary drastically; the students have discovered that the transitional housing programs have very different demographics from one another. The first shelter the students visited housed many women who may have been escaping abusive homes, while a second shelter housed men recovering from substance abuse. Differing demographics requires tailored, nuanced approaches towards helping each individual shelter, they explain. More importantly, Yang adds,“It’s really just about finding shelters that prioritize finding innovative solutions.”
The three creators of Mobilzr do not have any plans yet for assisting homeless people who have not yet reached a transitional housing program.
“We may not be able to solve the entire homeless situation,” Yang says. “But we just see a need that’s not being met.”

“FLYING FINGERS: STORIES AND WRITING TIPS FROM SEVEN-YEAR-OLD AUTHOR ADORA SVITAK” BY ADORA SVITAK
Published in 2005, “Flying Fingers” defies genre and description. Part short story collection, part writing guide, part autobiography of child prodigy Svitak, this tome is a must-read for struggling Expos enrollees. Even if you don’t need writing help, the book is worth a look for its enthusiastically if poorly photoshopped cover (a grinning young Svitak typing against a backdrop of SAT vocabulary words). You’ll also find gems from the precocious author: “Writing words like ‘oubliette, kirtle, oligarchy and tourniquet’ in my stories helps me remember them. I love to spice up my stories by using new words.” Lamont’s copy is surprisingly well-worn.
“THE ART OF KISSING” BY HUGH MORRIS
Before heading over to the Widener stacks, check out this 1936 pamphlet detailing the finer points and extensive strategy involved in making out. Mildly predatory, the work overflows with pearls of wisdom and helpful woodcut illustrations on everything from different varieties of kissing (including “spiritual,” “eyelash,” and, alarmingly, “vacuum”—“suck inwardly as though you were trying to draw out the innards of an orange”), to a handy guide on “How to Kiss Girls With Different Sizes of Mouths.” Almost graphically detailed in its description of lip contortions and tongue gymnastics, “The Art of Kissing” is sure to add that missing element of paralyzing overthinking to your love life.
“WHAT WAS THE HIPSTER? A SOCIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION” FROM N+1 MAGAZINE
Unsure about the genesis or classification of the elusive turn-of-the-century hipster, or its apparent relegation to the past tense? This book has answers. Read it now, before any of your friends hear about it.
“THE WISDOM OF DONKEYS: FINDING TRANQUILITY IN A CHAOTIC WORLD” BY ANDY MERRIFIELD
There might be an explanation for this unassuming-looking white hardback, but I decide not to seek it out. Perhaps the author of “The Wisdom of Donkeys” would applaud; mine is the kind of attitude which seems aligned with his asinine ethos: “I can’t stop thinking about donkeys, about that donkey LOOK, that donkey FEEL. I hear the wind whooshing in my ears, cooling my body, accompanied by Schubert and the sound of braying.”
“THE CUNNING LITTLE VIXEN” BY RUDOLF TESNOHLIDEK, ILLUSTRATED BY MAURICE SENDAK
This appears to be an extended modern fable, most notable for its title and the deeply creepy illustrations of angry-looking humans dressed in insect and animal costumes. Probably best not to open too late at night.

Sections
Kazuo Ishiguro is a Big Deal, both capitals intended. Following his breakthrough 1989 novel “The Remains of the Day,” he’s kept it up over a career of over two decades with a string of bestsellers. You might remember his last, the heartwrenching “Never Let Me Go,” from its movie adaptation starring the equally heartwrenching Andrew Garfield. His new novel, “The Buried Giant,” is big even by Ishiguro’s standards: It’s his first in 10 years, and expectations are higher than Memorial Church’s steeple.
So when I walk into the church, where the Harvard Book Store is hosting a reading with Ishiguro, the air hums with excitement. There are people of all ages mixed into the audience, although Cambridge’s elderly literati are well represented as always. The couple sitting next to me is having an animated discussion on 1930s radio serials, and ask if I’m familiar with “The Shadow.” (I’m not.) Affronted, they ask if I even own a radio. (I don’t.)
As 4 p.m. draws closer, electricity builds in the church’s carved hollows. The pews fills up fast; people cram themselves in and wait, too excited to push and shove like normal Bostonians. We’re all on pins and needles.
When Ishiguro finally appears onstage, we can’t help but exhale a little. The famous author really is just some guy: average height and wearing all black, with gray hair cut in an unfussy straight line. His interviewer, journalist Robert Birnbaum, shows little flair beyond an unexpected gold earring; he sits peacefully throughout, fiddling with an iPad.
Yet as Ishiguro starts reading from “The Buried Giant,” some of that prior magic starts to return. There’s a careful composure to him that suggests hidden depths, just like his sparse prose. He reads slowly, but as I watch, people’s heads begin to lower in the pews, as if the novel’s first three pages were a sermon all their own.
Watching him, I can’t help think how different he is from the nerdy professor type I had been expecting. In fact, with his all-black getup and effortless cool, he exudes an aged rock-star vibe— and indeed, his first passion was not novels, but songwriting. “I used to sing when I was young,” he admits. “That was a big mistake.” Or was it? Ishiguro may have traded songs for manuscripts, but there’s still a certain measured lyricism to his speech and prose that resembles music.
He’s also modest—almost pathologically so. “I don’t think I have any special insight into the world,” he insists. “I’m not a visionary type of person—just a regular one. And maybe that helps make me more relatable to my readers.” When Birnbaum asks him if he reads his own reviews, he shrugs off the question. “What happens instead is my wife follows me around with an iPhone, reading them,” he chuckles. “And I’m a nervous wreck!”
Birnbaum and Ishiguro make a good team. At one point, Birnbaum flubs his questions and asks the author what it’s like to have been a novelist for 30 decades. “30 decades?” gasps Ishiguro in mock horror, getting some laughs. Later on, when technical difficulties force Harvard Book Store’s staff to euthanize the PA system, the two gamely lean in to share Birnbaum’s shirt microphone.
The PA problems aren’t fixed by the time Q&A is supposed to start. As the Book Store folks freak out, Ishiguro calmly invites audience members to ask their questions from the onstage pulpit mic, which is mounted atop a giant gold eagle. No pressure, right?
One terrified guy stutters out a question about Ishiguro’s use of memory. “The Buried Giant,” set in ancient Britain, deals with an old couple’s quest to regain their memories of past days. “The Remains of the Day” hides tragic recollections of war beneath its smooth depiction of pastoral England. The author seems to return again and again to memory: It lies beneath the surface of his work, a lingering question.
“If we continue to bury big things,” asks Ishiguro, “what are the consequences? When is it better to remember, or to forget?” Although he’s pushing sixty, and by his own admission, is “in his late-stage career,” he seems determined to find the answer. Maybe if we wait another 10 years, he’ll finally share it with us.

Before spring break, representatives from the 12 houses excitedly raced through Harvard Yard to inform their future housemates of their fates. Over 100 freshmen were soon regaled with chants of “Lowell! Lowell!” Most were pleasantly surprised. But the former Harvard president’s name was not always synonymous with welcoming.
When Abbott Lawrence Lowell assumed the Harvard presidency in 1909, Boston Brahmins and alumni of elite boarding schools made up most of the College’s student body. In an attempt to diversify, the admissions committee of the day created the “Top Seventh Rule,” which required Harvard to reach out to boys who finished in the top seventh of their class, regardless of school or location.
The committee issued a report in April of 1923 suggesting that the rule would benefit applicants from underrepresented areas: “While no geographic restriction is contemplated, it is thought that the new opportunity would appeal particularly to rural schools and to those situated outside the regular Harvard recruiting ground.”
Lowell himself, however, attempted to restore Harvard’s traditional demographics by requiring applicants to demonstrate “character” as well as good academic standing through recommendation letters and interviews. An appointed committee stated that these new requirements would help “eliminate the intellectually unfit” and ensure that “the student body will be properly representative of all groups in our national life.” However, Lowell used these requirements to ensure a lack of diversity.
Lowell even attempted to establish a direct quota on Jewish students, who comprised more than 20 percent of the total undergraduate population in 1922. Lowell justified his quota by suggesting that limiting the Jewish population would help eliminate anti-Semitism. “The antiSemitic feeling among students is increasing, and it grows in proportion to the increase in the number of Jews,” Lowell wrote in a 1922 letter to the Class of 1900’s Alfred A. Benesch. “If [the] number [of Jews] should become 40 percent of the student body, the race feeling would become intense. If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, I suspect we should go a long way toward eliminating race feeling among students.”
The Committee of Thirteen, assigned to rule on Lowell’s proposed 15 percent quota, rejected Lowell’s proposal in the 1923 report on the grounds that “Harvard College [must] maintain its traditional policy of freedom from discrimination on grounds of race or religion.”
Lowell’s prejudices did not stop at Jews. In 1922, Lowell expelled all black students from Harvard Yard. “We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together,” Lowell wrote in a letter to the Class of 1902’s Roscoe C. Bruce. “We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.” Lowell’s reasoning in this case was “the colored man [claiming] that he is entitled to have the white man compelled to live with him is a very unfortunate innovation which...would increase a prejudice that...is most unfortunate and probably growing,” echoing what he used to justify his quota.
Lowell also formed the “Secret Court of 1920” to purge gay students from Harvard. The Secret Court, which went unreported until 2002, expelled eight students and fired two teachers as a result of uncovering homosexual activities on campus.

Born to New Yorker parents and raised in Connecticut, I am not inspired by New York City to breathless wonder unlike the millions of tourists who visit every year. Regular childhood visits and frequent dance classes in Manhattan as a teenager have left me too familiar with the City for my own good. But when spring break rolls around, a Californian blockmate comes home with you, and the winter leaves you beachless, you and your friend must flock to NYC seeking adventure and new profile pictures.
During a similar trip to New York City last fall, the same friend and I spent our visit in Midtown, and I showed him the Empire State Building, Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, etc. This time around, we decide to head to Lower Manhattan, see the Statue of Liberty and the 9/11 Memorial, and visit Wall Street like the good Harvard students we are.
The day of our trip, we wake up at my house early but not early enough. I stumble into the shower, rushing to get to the train station as quickly possible. Over the years I’ve learned my lesson: The Metro-North Railroad waits for no man. We get into the car and proceed to drive at exactly the speed limit and absolutely no higher because to do otherwise is illegal and my mom reads my articles. We park in the lot and run to the train—something my sinus infection-hampered body doesn’t appreciate. Luckily we get on the train with a minute to spare.
We arrive at Grand Central Station, where everyone is polite, respectful, and never bumps into you or pushes past you. Still running late for our ferry ride to the Statue of Liberty, we hop onto the subway, which, because of our terrific luck (or lack thereof), is experiencing delays. We then proceed to ride in extended silence—the subway passengers of NYC aren’t known for being chatty. We get off at Bowling Green and make our way over to Battery Park, where we’re able to enter the paradise that is the ferry security check line. This is an oasis of calm where machines beep (loudly), children scream at their parents (“GIVE ME BACK MY COAT!”), and visitors regret having worn that super cute but cumbersome belt (“Yes ma’am, you do have to take that off”).
As we sail out to the Statue of Liberty, the strangest scene unfolds. The ferry has these sliding metal doors you can open to ride on the deck of the ferry—an unpopular option on this day given the low temperatures and bitter wind. One man, evidently much hardier than most, was trying to open the door, but it was jammed. He struggled and struggled, but the door just wouldn’t budge. Out of the crowd, a good samaritan appeared and joined in, but the door remained firmly shut. After several more minutes, the duo is finally able to open the door enough to slip through.
Cool story bro, you say? As soon as that poor soul was able to get the door open, the entire deck burst into applause, clapping and cheering to celebrate this small victory. After the nightmarish morning we experienced on our commute, that random act skyrocketed my faith in humanity.
Embracing the cliche, I shake my head and laugh, “Only in New York.” Spirits restored, we look out the window and continue the journey to Liberty Island.

The first day of spring was this past Saturday, meaning that it is a blustery 30 degrees in Cambridge when I set out to begin my day on Sunday afternoon. Still, it’s 90 degrees somewhere—more specifically, it’s 90 degrees in the exotic locales my classmates are returning from, as they climb off of airplanes sunburned and with an Instagram feed much sunnier than mine (the status of my bank account vehemently vetoed any kind of international or trans-coastal flight). Even though my credit card denied my immediate social media popularity, I’ve decided to opt for plastic, and not paper, in terms of my coffee cups, at least. Post-spring break equals iced coffee weather in my eyes, no matter how tall the snow piles still teeter in the Yard.
Put down the Board Plus (if you still, inexplicably, have any left; have you heard of a midterm?!), forget your Keurig, and spurn whatever sludge can be dug up from the dredges of the d-hall coffee canisters during Brain Break. FM brings you the best way to get the equivalent of a good night’s sleep through a straw for the effort of a few blocks and a few bucks.
Bagelsaurus 
1796 Massachusetts Ave


I venture just beyond the bounds of Harvard Square and into Porter for the first stop on my tour. Situated just a few blocks past the Quad on Mass Ave (see, newly quadded freshman? caffeine abounds beyond the river!), Bagelsaurus offers two of my favorite things: bagels, and dinosaurs, and, um, coffee, of course. Even though I’m pretty sure I share these loves with most of the residents of Cambridge, the small shop is eerily empty for 1:30 p.m. on a Sunday. I approach the counter anyway, where a bearded employee brusquely informs me, “We’re out of bagels,” and begins to turn away. I assume the usual reaction to this information is immediate egress on the part of the customer.
“Oh, that’s fine!” I chirp. “I’d like an iced coffee, please.” He eyes my puffy cheetah print jacket, bursting with a sweater and oversized scarf: clearly, I have asked for the wrong temperature beverage. I squint back at his knitted Bruins cap.
“Okay.”
He shovels some ice into a cup, pours the coffee, and charges me $3.21. 3/21, of course, is the date of the first day of spring. I feel vindicated, and take this as an auspicious sign, like the caffeinated version of Punxsutawney Phil’s shadow. Or is it his lack of shadow? Either way, there are no groundhogs here, or bagels. Just...saurus, and iced coffee. I take my cup and sit at a blond wood bench. There’s no milk out, which is fine because I take my coffee black, like my soul. I scribble all of this down, while various beanied employees continue to turn away hungry Cantabridgians on quests for carbohydrates. The coffee is good, but I refrain from finishing the entire cup: I have to pace myself. By 2 p.m., it’s only me and the staff left in the shop. When they begin to empty the water cooler and garbage cans, I feel weird, and attempt to gracefully see myself out, oversized knitted layers and all.
Dwelltime
364 Broadway


Newly energized by both the coffee and the schadenfreude of watching Sunday brunchers being denied bagels, I make my way from Porter Square to Dwelltime, over by Central Square. It is suppose to take me 29 GMWM (Google Maps Walking Minutes), but I somehow don’t make it to the shop until 2:45, which I blame on the mellow guitar beats of my Ben Folds Pandora station.
Dwelltime lies down Broadway, several blocks past Broadway Market, and that Starbucks you go to only if you live in Dunster swing housing or have a section in CGIS. Despite its (relatively) distant location (from the Quad at least...sorry guys), I am rewarded with a pleasant sensation as soon as I enter the cafe: I fall in love.
If you are ever seeking the quaint hipster coffee shop of your dreams, Dwelltime is better than anything on your Tumblr dashboard. Customers wearing black pants, beanies, plaid shirts, or a combination of the three sit tapping at sleek chrome devices around a wooden bar, or at tables along the sides of the cafe. Most surfaces are adorned with tiny sprigs of purple flowers so cute you could scream (in case anyone asks, I didn’t, I think?). There is even a low table with red chairs for children. A girl sits at one, surrounded by fruit and pastries as she watches a video on what I assume is her personal iPad. I consider joining her, since I am on the shorter side and making my journey alone, but decide that that would be even weirder than sitting alone with an iced coffee at a bagel-less bagel shop.


I go to the counter and spontaneously order a quiche along with my coffee: there was no food to be had at my previous destination, and besides, I’m worth it. The iced coffee is served in a squat glass tumbler, and a teeny corner of the quiche is placed beside it on a square porcelain plate (total: $7.35. #worthit). I take a sip of the coffee as I search for a seat and oh my god this is the best coffee I have ever HAD. Maybe it was my hunger, or the cold, or the previous coffee on an empty stomach, but it is absolutely the most refreshing beverage I’ve drunk in a while. I exit my reverie to settle down at a long family-style table, and bite into the quiche. Any discomfort I feel joining two other lunching parties at the table dissipates; this quiche and this coffee are all the company I need. I am justified in joining a family-style table because I am joined by my significant consumable others. Do you ever get the feeling that something is so cute you just want to eat it? I do, and I did.
Oggi’s
1350 Massachusetts Avenue
I float out of Dwelltime, sufficiently buzzed on my two coffees and somehow resisting the urge to order another quiche (I’m feeling monogamous). I head back to Mass. Ave. and go to Oggi’s, at the advice of a friend. It’s not the first place I would think of to enjoy a pleasant cup of iced coffee, as it’s more known for its food, but I’ve never had their brew and figure it’s worth a try.
The manic-pixie-dream-hipster-caffeine-cuteness-overload I experienced at Dwelltime is greatly diminished as soon as I enter the Smith Center; the concrete walkway always reminds me of the impending dread of visiting the doctor, or the shame of admitting you lost your I.D. card. The iced coffee, fittingly, is bitter, even when I consent to adding a bit of milk. It’s entirely possible that the coffee is great, but that I am not in the correct mood to enjoy it. At this point I have had three coffees in under two hours, walked in a circle around Cambridge in the cold, and experienced love at first sight (that is, bite); I’m pretty jittery, FM seems to stand for “Forever Manic,” and the Smith Center is harshing my vibe (I believe that is what the kids, such as the cool girl with the iPad, say these days).
I leave Oggi’s after just a few minutes, and try to decide what to do with my excess of energy. Perhaps I will channel it into a workout—but only to make room for some more beloved quiche.

I landed in Cancun ready to embrace a cliché. There were no plans except to set aside the haughty, critical coldness of Cambridge and indulge in that undergraduate tropical escape narrative that is Mexico for Spring Break. I had four tank tops and a pair of jean cut-offs—all bought for ironic costume purposes but now ready for full-fledged sunbathing sincerity. I’d never met half the people on the trip, and I’d never felt more bro-“chill” with that. Walking through passport control, I felt fully prepped for the “Spring Breakers” story that has burrowed so deeply in our expectations, fantasies, and language. What I didn’t plan on, though, was just that: language.
The quotes began to accumulate as soon as we landed. Our first “cheers” went to “escaping linear time”: a hedonistic celebration of having abandoned the over-scheduled Google calendar. And for a time zone that, having switched from CST to EST just a month before, would always be one mystic hour ahead of our phones.
Next came the slogan “Life is lost to dreaming; dreaming is lost to becoming,” inscribed on the backside of the shopping mall complex that mysteriously bordered the beach. (To reach the sand you either went through the Chili’s or the liquor store.) Tipsy textual exegesis ensued, but the group remained split: Did the quote encourage dreaming, criticize its excess, or simply state that it passes into action as we age? Two days later, we defined exegesis—then differentiated epigraph, epitaph, epigram, and epithet. We were in a rental car on our way to the nearby Mayan ruins, playing word games while “Jose Cuervo” was passed from passenger to passenger, while “Jerk it Out” and “I’m a Believer” brought us back to middle school.
Over time, these words and phrases developed into a private seven-person language. Repeating simple idioms like “This is the dream” built them into multi-layered mantras. Someone started the trend of making any stand-out action signify that person’s membership in a “Team.” If you wanted a napkin, you might say, “Anyone on Team Napkin?” If you wanted to apologize for spilling water all over the kitchen, you would say, “I’m on Team Flood.” Suddenly, just one shared characteristic or behavior could unite you with someone in a micro-squad.
It’s amazing how quickly community develops when the constraints of (linear) time are lifted. Conversations stretched out over 1 p.m breakfasts, giving language the space to innovate and unite us in separate, special ways of speaking. Though it’s well known that the content of conversations binds people together, Cancun taught me that form can do so just as well: Language itself gives our experiences and inter- actions a meaning beyond what words convey.
When we started calling ourselves orbs—the reverse of bros; pulsating, celestial bodies—it became pretty clear that we’d swapped the clichés for something more far more intimate.
There were still plenty of moments that fit the “Breakers” stereotype: a plastic bottle of sugarcane-alcohol for $1.50; an exploded glass cover on our Airbnb stove; a skinny-dip after rounds and rounds of body shots: “It was more of an experience than a beverage.” But I spent most of that intoxicated time discussing the “neo-colonial authentic” aesthetic of tourism, and our plunge into the ocean featured a cleansing ritual, a communal pee, and a moment of silence.
“Oh, the queen of social justice?” someone yelled on the first night. “I think I left her back in Cambridge.” We laughed with relish at our new, indulgent Cancun identities. But that royal matriarch of responsible criticism couldn’t have been more wrong. When your cab ride to the touristy club is spent discussing sophistry, when drinking game rules foster confession and connection—you start to realize that Spring Break can’t take the Cambridge out of you. When “Team Reading” drunkenly tells “Team Alcohol” its epithet is “just a cultural signifier; we’re not impressed,” you cackle in the warm night air and remember how lucky you are to be both in and out of cliché.

My roommate decided to visit me at home in Philadelphia. It was frigid, and every day we ate sandwiches. My goal: that he would leave with a fuller stomach, significantly closer to heart disease, his face slick with oil.
DALESSANDRO’S
The first cheesesteak is the deepest. My roommate is a restrained type. He eats a brownie with knife and fork. He listens to more vigorous Mozart when he feels excited. He’s learning German.
We’re sitting at a ketchup and sweat- speckled counter, and the waitress sets down a plastic basket with my roommate’s order. My roommate’s inner beast is unleashed, and he falls silent until he slurps up the last hearty wisp of fried provolone.
“Wow.”
PAESANO’S
We happen upon Paesano’s. The sandwich is delightfully overstuffed. We’re out driving. I’m showing my roommate the city, which means showing my roommate miles upon miles of brick row homes and men pushing shopping carts full of copper wiring. I’m like any good parent, though, and leave a treat for the end. Little Baby’s Ice Cream, a pretentious joint staffed by the hipster bearderati that serves fla- vors based on Belgian cookie spreads and corner store hot sauce. The combination of Italian bread and gentrifying waffle cone is a bit much, and we settle back into the car, speechless.
THE RIB STAND
The Rib Stand is a buoy of Amish stability in the frothing sea of Reading Terminal Market, an expan- sive farmer’s market and food court in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. We consume more meat, this time in the form of boneless rib sandwiches. Grease runs down our faces, and we’re seated next to a crazy man playing lounge tunes on a keyboard for anyone forced to listen. We don’t mind. We reach methodically and maniacally for napkins and wipe hot sauce into our skin as exfoliant.
When we head back into the streets, we blink from the brightness and from the fresh, foodless air. My roommate licks his fingers once more.
“I think I like Philly.” Success.

In the most recent Tomb Raider game, the ship that Lara Croft and her ragtag band of compan-ions travel on is called the Endurance; it shares its name with the ill-fated vessel that landed Shackleton in Antarctica, only to get caught in the jagged teeth of polar ice. But Lara is destined for greater things than ever were recorded in history books. She is a myth in the making, the scrappy, ponytailed girl who will become Lara Croft: Tomb Raider—she of the mirrored sun- glasses, double pistols, and quippy comebacks.
In this game, a 2013 reboot of the beloved video game series that began in 1996, Lara is still a bright-eyed archaeology student in search of the lost ancient Japanese kingdom of Yamatai. Pursuing knowledge, fortune, and the immortality that comes with scholarly publication, Lara urges her captain to steer them into the heart of the Dragon’s Triangle (the Pacific’s answer to the Bermuda Triangle). It is in these storm-plagued waters that the Endurance is wrecked, leaving Lara and company to find their way back to “civilization” as they know it.
I downloaded the game one bleary-eyed evening when I allowed myself a structured break from working on my senior thesis (a rare occasion). Tomb Raider was one of the first results under the “female protagonists” tag on Steam, the popular online retailer of computer games. For $4, I couldn’t say no. From the first moments of the game, I was hooked, drawn in not so much by the game’s (convoluted) plot as by the way it made my heart race, its relentless pace, and the mood of utter desperation it evokes.
Time and again, the narrative tears Lara away from her companions. In the opening sequence, she leaps across an impossible gap on the splin- tering ship to grab hold of an outstretched hand. For a moment, she catches it and then loses her grip, dropping into the whirling abyss of the sea. She washes up safe and sound on a nearby beach and spots her shipmates over the lip of a cliff. But before she can reach them, some shadowy stranger grabs her from behind. When she wakes, she is suspended from the ceiling of a cavern, bound up as though in a chrysalis. Her only possibility for escape is to swing towards a nearby flame, wriggling free from her ties as they catch fire and begin to burn.
Each ensuing twist of fate ensures that Lara is on her own again. Over the course of the game, she learns to fend for herself—and to believe that she can do so.
“A survivor is born.” That is the slogan with which Tomb Raider was marketed. It’s also a succinct summary of the game’s story. Lara, a clever but cosseted child of privilege, must withstand the most punishing of circumstances. The woman who lands on the island shivering, scared, and calling for help leaves it a gun-toting superhero. She becomes the Lara Croft we’ve known all along, the one Angelina Jolie played with a swinging braid and a blithe indifference to the challenges hurtling towards her.
When the 2013 iteration was released, critics leveled attacks against the game’s interpretation of Lara as a floundering, fearful naïf. Perhaps if I had grown up on the original games, I would have shared their skepticism towards this origin story. But meeting Lara this way for the first time, I felt a kinship with her I could not imag- ine sharing with the unflinching heroine of the earlier games. This Lara is human, comprehensible—if extraordinarily resistant to an endless bevy of attacks from both the unsteady environment and the island’s lurking enemies.
Lara’s internal monologue—made external, as she mutters to herself for the player’s benefit— consists of the stuff of motivational speeches or Hallmark cards. “I can do this,” she tells herself, as she reaches off a precarious branch to grab hold of a corpse that dangles just out of reach and the makeshift longbow strapped to its back.
Speaking to her over the two-way radio that is the only mode of communication for much of the game, Lara’s grizzled mentor-figure Conrad Roth urges her to “just keep moving.” And Lara does. She never stops, come hell or high water. When the ground gives way beneath her boots, she flings her body onto the nearest patch of stable land and then sets off running again.
She repeats these simple affirmations throughout the game, and one feels that by asserting her capability, she enables her own success. This might seem like an absurdly basic lesson, like self-help for the pre-K set. But it’s one I, at least, too easily forget. In the face of terror, it is essential to remind yourself of your ability, whether what scares you is writing a conclusion to your thesis or cauterizing an abdominal wound on the fly. Sitting under the fluorescent lights of my dorm room as I fumbled through Tomb Raider, I heard Lara’s words and I felt their importance.
Games sometimes move me in ways that other artistic mediums do not. When I press the spacebar, Lara jumps. When I move my mouse, her head swivels. There is a tangible and direct relationship between me, the player, and Lara, the protagonist, that does not exist in a play or a movie or a book.
Beginning the game, I could barely manage the controls. Consequently, Lara slipped off ledges, lost her way in the woods, and spent an hour doggedly chasing down a deer (her only source of food) with a bow and arrow. Lara loosed arrow after arrow towards the fleeing deer, striking to wound but not to kill. The final shot felt more merciful than cruel. When Lara knelt before her fallen prey and uttered an apology, I shared her guilt and sorrow, not just for killing the deer, but for so badly mangling the job. As I played, though, I got quicker with keyboard and mouse, and Lara got stronger, more nimble.
I went back and re-did the deer hunt recently, and Lara took out the creature with a single shot to the head. She was back at her campfire with dinner roasting on a spit before her hunger could begin to seem urgent. But I’m glad that the first time I played, I bungled the controls, because my confusion over the mechanics mirrored Lara’s inexperience with her weaponry.
Maybe that sense of actually being Lara, rather than just watching her, made me pay attention to advice that I am tempted to ignore when it comes from a friend or my worried mother, calling to check in on my progress. The words of encouragement that Lara spoke rang true and direct. Lara wasn’t the only one learning to survive—I was, too.
Weeks later, pulling yet another all-nighter to put the finishing touches on my thesis, I remembered Lara’s refrains of “you can do this” and “just a little bit further.” They felt, somehow, like words coming from within me, not from without.

William F. Morris IV ’17 describes his hometown of Maysville, Ga., as having “more cows than people and more pickup trucks than college degrees.” The first from his high school to enroll at Harvard since 1973, Morris was excited to experience an environment completely different from his home in Georgia. Much of Morris’s life in Cambridge, however, has been characterized by Southern stereotyping on the part of his peers.
During the first week of school, Morris says, he was asked which side he would take “if the Civil War happened today.” A classmate of Morris’s, referring to his distinctive accent, once asked Morris’s friend how somebody who sounded “retarded” could have been accepted to Harvard. After he was asked how many slaves he owned at a final club punch event sophomore year, Morris left out of frustration.
“I’m vegetarian, I’m not religious, [I’m] liberal,” Morris says. “But people hear my accent and automatically think, ‘Oh, Southern Will, he’s Southern.’”


Morris credits his thick, Southern accent—which he claims has faded somewhat since freshman year—with eliciting some of the stereotyping to which he has regularly been subject to at Harvard. His Georgia flag hangs proudly from the wall of his Pforzheimer House bedroom, and Morris says Cambridge often still does not feel like home.
With an undergraduate population nearly four times the size of his hometown, Morris’s tenure at Harvard has tested him in multiple ways. Students from underrepresented areas often say the transition to Harvard comes as a culture shock both socially and academically. They report that they know very few Harvard students upon entering freshman year compared to peers from areas like Boston and New York.
While enhanced recruiting efforts and financial aid initiatives in recent years have created the most diverse student body in the school’s history, Harvard’s geographic numbers are still unrepresentative of the United States as a whole. In the Crimson’s freshman survey of the Class of 2017, fewer than 12 percent of respondents identified as coming from Georgia and the rest of the Southeast region, while 41.1 percent of students called the Northeast home. The College’s Admissions Office does not have plans to create proportioned quotas for states or geographic regions, and representatives say they engage in regular recruiting efforts to form a regionally diverse student body as part of its ongoing goal to enhance students’ experience at Harvard.
But despite those efforts, undergraduates from parts of the country that do not often send students to Harvard say that they face challenges when they arrive in Cambridge, from culture shock to trouble adjusting academically and navigating an unfamiliar social network.
Diversity—racial, ethnic, or geographic—was not often a word used to describe Harvard College during its first few centuries. In 1922, former Harvard President
Abbott Lawrence Lowell ’77 proposed a quota capping Jewish students’ enrollment at 15 percent of the class. The incoming freshman class in 1950 had just four black students, and it wasn’t until 1970 that administrators undertook “the great experiment” to eventually make the Harvard housing system co-ed.
While Harvard today is far ahead of the Harvard of years past in terms of diversity, imbalances persist in the undergraduate population with regard to students’ geographic origins. According to enrollment data from the Office of Admissions provided by Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, 51.5 percent of the non-international students who enrolled in Harvard’s Class of 2018 hail from just four states: New York, New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts. In contrast, those states make up only 23.2 percent of the U.S. population, according to 2014 projections—the latest available—based on the 2010 U.S. Census.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is the greatest example of Harvard’s regional imbalance. Massachusetts’s 6.7 million residents constitute about 2 percent of the nation’s population, according to 2014 projections based on the 2010 Census. In contrast, 15 percent of current Harvard freshmen hail from the Bay State.
While 231 current freshmen hail from Massachusetts, Louisiana sent just two students to Harvard this past year, a small number considering its population of 4.6 million, according to 2014 Census projections. Of those two, Christopher C. Higginson ’18 attended the Groton School, an elite private boarding school in Massachusetts, while Luke Z. Tang ’18 is a graduate of Benjamin Franklin High School, one of New Orleans’s premier magnet schools.
Amongst the seven high schools that were most represented in Harvard’s Class of 2017—Boston Latin School, Phillips Academy in Andover, Stuyvesant High School, Noble and Greenough School, Phillips Exeter Academy, Trinity School in New York City, and Lexington High School—five fall in the New England region and two in New York City, according to data from the Freshman Register.
In total, 310 students in the Class of 2018 are New England natives. Though the six New England states represent 4.6 percent of the U.S. population, they represent 21.3 percent of the non-international members of the current freshman class. The Mid Atlantic region, covering the six states and Washington, D.C., that stretch from New York to Maryland, represent 15.9 percent of the U.S. population and 27.2 percent of non-international students in the Class of 2018.
According to the Admissions Office’s data, students who attended boarding school in Massachusetts are counted as coming from their home states, rather than their boarding schools’. Therefore, regional imbalances are likely even steeper than the data suggests.
As co-master of Cabot House, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana embraces the important role that geographic diversity plays in House life and the individual student experience. “As a House master, I think that geographical diversity, like many other diversities of our experiences and lived experiences, enriches the Harvard College experience,” Khurana says.
In an attempt to create a geographically diverse incoming class, the Admissions Office has employed a myriad of programs, including direct email, letters, a new digital initiative called the Harvard College Connection, and exhaustive joint travel trips with colleges like Princeton, the University of Virginia, and Yale. In 2012, representatives from the Admissions
Office made visits to all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. By their estimates, they saw almost 50,000 students and 3,000 high school guidance counselors.
“Wherever you are, whatever kind of background [you come from]...we’re going to be at you with a variety of outreach efforts,” says William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, with a distinct Boston accent, reflective of his childhood in Weymouth, Mass.
Despite an abundance of outreach efforts, Harvard saw only modest gains this year in the number of applicants from underrepresented areas.
“In every one of these geographic areas, they’re almost identical to last year,” Fitzsimmons, referencing the Class of 2019 applicant pool, said in an interview in February. “I could try to puff it up and say there’s a 16.1 percent [increase this year] versus an 8.1 percent change in Mountain states [last year], but that’s from 1,277 to 1,483 applicants. It’s not a big jump.”
Fitzsimmons and the Admissions Office are upfront and realistic about the challenges they face in terms of evening out these disparities in regional representation. According to Fitzsimmons, “80 percent of students will go to college within 200 miles of their homes, and 90 percent will go to college within 500 miles of their homes.” Fitzsimmons says this has been the case for decades and is a problem of which he and his office are aware during their outreach efforts.
Currently, the cornerstone of the College’s outreach stems from PSAT scores and contact information provided to Harvard by the College Board. From PSAT scores and other self-reported information, the Admissions Office sends mailings, both physical and digital, to students encouraging them to consider Harvard. According to Fitzsimmons, 63 percent of students in the freshman class, and 81 percent of minority students, were originally on the search list. “It’s a pretty good list, actually,” he says.
Despite their utility, Lucerito L. Ortiz ’10, an admissions officer who recruits and reads applications for Los Angeles, Southern Texas, and Latin America, says PSAT scores are an imperfect way to recruit students.
“The information that we have on students is very limited, because all we can go on really are PSAT scores,” Ortiz says. “It’s hard to find additional data on students.”
One aspect of Harvard’s outreach efforts that, according to students and admissions officers alike, draws a high number of applicants from underrepresented regions is its generous—and effectively marketed—financial aid program. Minnesota native Luke R. Heine ’17 credits the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative with prompting him to consider applying. Students from Heine’s hometown of Duluth do not regularly apply to Ivy League schools, as a perception of these colleges as preppy “Abercrombie Fitches,” as Heine puts it, is deeply entrenched.
“For me, the only reason I applied to Harvard and these Ivy League schools was that, being a pragmatic Midwesterner, I saw that the financial aid was very good,” Heine says. “I think that’s the best way to get people to even consider applying to these schools.”


Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who worked as an admissions officer from 1969 to 1973 before eventually transferring to the Freshman Dean’s Office, says he remembers covering parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, and New York. In some of these states, recruiting applicants proved challenging.
“You’re out in the Black Hills in South Dakota, and so you work really hard to draw interest, and you find that someone who you think is a good applicant, and then that person doesn’t make it in the competitive process. And [when] you’re out in the Black Hills the next year there isn’t a friendly reception at the high school,” Dingman recalls.
Despite the Admissions Office’s attempts to level out the regional imbalances present in the current undergraduate population, administrators are quick to state that there is no quota of any sort for any particular background.
“This kind of outreach is really about finding people of excellence wherever they might be. There’s no quota for states; there’s no quota for countries, for that matter,” Fitzsimmons says. “A person from Kazakhstan will be competing against the person from Fargo when it goes to full committee. When the committee is actually making its decision, it’s really all about the excellence and the diversity that the student can bring, broadly considered.”
Perceptions abound, however, that an applicant from an underrepresented region will have an advantage in the admissions process.
“People used to laugh that the way to get into Harvard was to move from Boston to Wyoming,” Dingman says.
For his part, Jordan T. Colman ’15-16 has little doubt that being one of the few applicants from Wyoming was helpful.
“There’s this rhetoric that everybody has something that puts them over the top, right? And so, in some sense, I do feel like being from Wyoming is one of the things,” Colman says.
Eva A. Guidarini ’15, the former student president of the Institute of Politics, agrees. Despite moving cities frequently as a child, Guidarini attended George Washington High School in Charleston, W. Va., a place that she now calls home, both in her mind and on paper.
“It’s easier to stand out as an academic student in West Virginia than it is in Michigan, or in California, or any of the other places that I had lived [before moving to West Virginia],” says Guidarini. “I definitely am here because of West Virginia.”
Still, despite perceptions that coming from an underrepresented area can present an edge in the admissions process, there are other obstacles that these students face before they even fill out the Common Application.
Colman, a graduate of Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyo., was one of these coveted applicants from an underrepresented region. Colman estimates that only roughly 330 of the students in his class of 450 graduated. His road to Harvard reflects the challenges that Harvard currently faces when trying to recruit students from underrepresented regions.
“There was hardly an Ivy League culture at all,” Colman remembers.
Colman says Natrona County’s academic counselors heavily encouraged him to apply for the Hathaway Scholarship, which provides funding for students to pursue post-secondary education within Wyoming.
“It was preached and put on a pedestal, like the ultimate opportunity in higher education, and when I first talked to my counselor about wanting to apply to Harvard in particular, he wasn’t super into the idea,” Colman says.
The contrast between college counseling at a traditional New England feeder school like Groton, for instance, and Natrona County High School is quite stark. According to Colman, only one member of the team of counselors at his high school focused on college admissions and split his time between two schools. While Colman’s lone college counselor had over 3,000 students to advise, Groton has a team of three devoted to fewer than 400 students spanning grades 8 through 12. Of these three counselors, one serves on the board of the ACT, and another spent five years as an admissions officer at Georgetown.
According to Megan K. Harlan, Groton’s head of college counseling, every year four or five Harvard alumni make the trek out to Groton to interview applicants from Groton and surrounding schools. While Natrona County High School and Groton represent two ends of the spectrum, students like Colman say schools from underrepresented regions are less equipped to prepare students to apply to Harvard through its early action program. Last year, 992 of the 2,023 eventual admissions offers were extended to those students who had applied early.
Because Colman, like the majority of his high school classmates, didn’t start considering college applications until the fall of his senior year in high school, he says the early action program’s reinstatement for the Class of 2016 has put students from  backgrounds like his at a disadvantage. (Colman entered the College with the Class of 2015.)
“Early action really favors kids who have a college counselor working with them one-on-one...and in my opinion, disadvantages kids like me from a state where you only go to public high school, where your college counselor is serving 3,300 students, where the scholarships in state are really, really good,” Colman says.
In an interview in October 2013, Fitzsimmons acknowledged the disparity in early admissions and said it would likely “continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.”
But in an interview for this article, Fitzsimmons strikes a brighter tone regarding the diversity of recent early action applicant pools.
“I think we’re winning the battle because you can see that early [action] now is much more diverse economically and ethnically than it was [in previous years],” Fitzsimmons says. “But it still isn’t reflective of what regular action is like.”
When Morris arrived on campus for his freshman year, he remembers only vaguely knowing two students on the entire campus, who were friends of friends. He says he remembers seeing students who seemed to already be a part of pre-set social groups. His first semester of freshman year was lonely and, at times, he felt overwhelmingly isolated.
“It’s very hard at the beginning [to make a friend group] and sometimes that can really set you out for a bad trajectory,” Morris says.
Today, midway through his sophomore spring, Morris says he has adjusted to social life at Harvard. Still, he remembers the difficulty in forming an entirely new friend group out of nowhere during the opening weeks of freshman year after moving from an area where he attended the same school and knew the same people since kindergarten.
Morris’s early experience on campus stands in contrast to peers from more heavily represented parts of the country like New York or Boston.
Nicholas P. Heath ’18, for example, estimates that he knew between 10 and 20 classmates from New York before coming to Cambridge and recalls spending significant time with these acquaintances during Opening Days.
“That was the easier thing to do,” says Heath, a graduate of the Collegiate School in New York City. “Why not hang out with people you already know?”


Mark S. Staples ’17 from Fargo, N.D., remembers viewing students like Heath from the outside. Staples is only aware of one other student from Fargo in his class, and they did not meet until they reached Cambridge. Staples remembers feeling surprised to find that some students already knew each other. “That was...a strange thought to me,” Staples says.


Administrators, for their part, try to mitigate social inequities through rooming assignments. Dingman and his staff at the FDO view the task of finding lodging for students from numerous countries and all 50 states as an opportunity to create diverse rooming assignments. Through a five-week process, Dingman’s office takes geographic origin, amongst other factors, into account while formulating rooms and entryways by hand.
According to Dingman, some students request roommates from similar geographic origins—a Southerner may asked to be paired with another Southerner. While they try to form rooms that are geographically diverse, they sometimes try to fulfill students’ requests through special arrangements, like placing a student from a rural area in an entryway with a proctor or Peer Advising Fellow from the same region.
Despite the FDO’s efforts to create geographic diversity in order to enrich the rooming culture of freshman year, disparities in experiences still play out in student life once a new class has moved into the Yard. For students coming from rural areas, the adjustment to life in Cambridge is often described as a disorienting.
Luke J.M. Murnane ’18 is probably the closest thing Harvard has to a real-life cowboy. Sporting a cowboy hat and a massive belt-buckle, Murnane, who grew up on a ranch in Montana, describes the transition from rural Montana to urban Cambridge succinctly.


“It’s terrible,” he says with a chuckle.
Although Murnane says he is satisfied with the fast friends he made through the First-Year Outdoor Program and his entryway in Apley Court, he continues to criticize city life. In an effort to simultaneously escape the bustle of Cambridge and stay in touch with his equestrian roots, Murnane joined the Harvard Polo Club, which practices an hour away in Hamilton, Mass.
Both Staples and Heath say that as their freshman years progressed, social life became less tied to geographic areas of origin. Although Heath says he has noticed that a lot of blocking groups are “New York heavy,” most of them have at least a few students from other places.
According to Dingman, many blocking groups form from individual entryways, which inherently include much of the geographic diversity originally drawn into the rooming assignments.
But the transition to Harvard from an underrepresented part of the country is challenging during more than just the first few weeks of freshman year. Just as Staples’s transition from rural Fargo to urban Cambridge was difficult, Morris’s adjustment from high school to college academics was similarly challenging. According to Morris, his alma mater was more “focused…on athletics” than academics. His high school and middle school often weren’t able to afford new textbooks, leaving the students to make do with insufficient, outdated resources.
Tessa A.C. Wiegand ’15, a former columnist for The Crimson, hails from Morgantown, W. Va. While Wiegand took the maximum number of Advanced Placement classes her high school offered, she was surprised by the access that her Harvard peers had had to college level classes such as multivariable calculus. Though Wiegand finds that Harvard does a good job of providing a wide range of course levels, administrators are considering adding more programming to support students who had fewer academic opportunities in high school.
Wiegand, who is now an applied mathematics concentrator, overcame her personal academic setbacks, but says that much of her experience as a West Virginia native at Harvard was defined by social stereotyping. Wiegand often finds that negative assumptions about West Virginia affect her introductions to new classmates.
“I mentioned in the article that somebody apologized for me being from West Virginia,” says Wiegand, recalling an experience she discussed in an op-ed she wrote for The Crimson in 2013. “That was in an introductory conversation, like, ‘Hi, I’m Tess, I’m from West Virginia.’ And the response was, ‘Oh, I’m sorry.’”
Guidarini, who also calls West Virginia home, adds that professors have made comments about the state in class that she has found offensive.
“Friends tease everyone about everything, so a close friend teasing me about West Virginia bothers me zero,” she says.“I think it’s the professorial reactions that bother me the most.”
On one instance, Guidarini says, she remembers a professor asking how much money her “poor coal mining friends make.”
Preconceptions cut both ways. Some students from more established feeder communities and high schools say they also face being stereotyped as privileged or elitist because of their high school backgrounds.
“When you tell people you’re from New York, they immediately develop a certain sort of perception of who you are, your background and privilege, that sort of stuff,” Heath says. “There does exist a New York stereotype, and when you tell people you’re from New York, you do run the risk of them instantly assuming that that stereotype applies to you.”
“I’ve worked at Andover, St. Paul’s, and Groton, and so I think that’s something that the school has to combat,” Harlan says. “That’s something that the students that graduate have to combat.”
Even after the initial college transition, there are disparities between the experiences of students who hail from different parts of the country. When students look to join one of the College’s hundreds of student organizations, they make the friends that will come to define their time at the College. Some groups cater disproportionately to groups of students from highly represented regions like the Northeast or New York, though, and some students from other areas are looking to create their own to combat that influence.
The Hasty Pudding Club, a co-ed social club that begins to recruit students their freshman fall, has drawn criticism for a membership that favors students from certain geographic areas.
In the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770’s 2014 annual report, undergraduate Hasty Pudding Club President Matt G. Wardrop ’15 addressed the organization’s strides in reaching a diverse range of students in their annual fall punch. “Much like Harvard College, we view diversity as being at the very core of the Pudding experience,” Wardrop wrote, citing a membership base ranging from Cambridge to “as far as Australia’s Gold Coast.”
The numbers tell a different story. Data from the HPC’s fall 2013 punch class, detailed in a critical Crimson op-ed last fall and crossreferenced with data from The Crimson’s Class of 2017 freshman survey, show that 77 percent of HPC punches hail from the Northeast region, compared to 41 percent of students who identified as such in the entire class. Furthermore, 85 percent of HPC punches attended private school, according to the data, compared with 39 percent of the Class of 2017 as a whole.
Wardrop did not respond to requests for comment.
Though the Hasty Pudding Club nears its 250th birthday, its membership does not reflect the same trends in diversity as does the larger student body at Harvard. Outside of the club’s walls, undergraduates have found alternative ways for underrepresented students to socialize.


Ashford L. King ’15 of Versailles, Ky., is only two months from graduating from Harvard, but his tenure as an undergraduate has been marked by a consistent trend that he plans to address before leaving. King says he has been meeting peers from Appalachia since freshman year, but has had no real way of getting together and forming a community on campus. He’s currently forming a club for students from Appalachia.
King says the formation of the club is the optimal approach to combatting the geographic stereotyping he has encountered throughout college.
“I figured, why not start an organization that on one level serves a social purpose and just provides a forum for us to get together and talk about what it’s like to be Appalachian at Harvard,” King says.
While King waited until his senior year to get the Appalachian Club started, Heine first had the idea of starting a Midwest Club during his freshman year.
By last fall, the club was in full swing, and it’s already popular; more than 200 students have signed up for the email list. “Because so few Midwesterners come to Harvard...there’s a real camaraderie in these communities,” Heine says. Heine acknowledges, however, that despite the Midwest Club’s success, it suffers from a lack of resources. Unlike some other undergraduate clubs at Harvard, the Midwest Club does not own real estate or have consistent access to a meeting space. Large parties have been out of the question so far, and the club’s dinners in the Leverett House’s small dining room must be lotteried due to space constraints.


“It’s antithetical in some regards to the Midwest Club because the Midwest is an inclusive space, and it really sucks to have to lottery that and make it seem exclusive,” Heine says.
When Guidarini graduates from Harvard in May, she will not be returning to her beloved hometown of Charleston, W.Va. She loved living in West Virginia, she says, but she can’t see herself moving back there for now. “There just aren’t the opportunities that I want there,” she says.
Guidarini is not atypical. While slightly more than 40 percent of members of the classes of 2017 and 2018 who participated in The Crimson’s annual freshman surveys reported that they are native to the Northeast, more than 70 percent said they want to live there after graduation. And while 11 percent of Class of 2018 respondents identified as coming from the Midwest, only 2.3 percent envision themselves living there after
For some undergraduates who hail from outside the highly represented Northeast, returning home is inevitable—“The second I graduate, I’m going back out West,” Murnane says—but others realize after struggling to adjust to life at Harvard that their hometowns may not offer the same opportunities, in the workforce or otherwise, that Harvard graduates come to expect in New York or Boston.
Harvard’s incoming classes represent a skewed map, and that trend does not stop after graduation. Sixty-four percent of graduating seniors who responded to The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2014 last year reported plans to live in New York, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., or California after graduation. Just 39 percent of respondents, however, came to Harvard from those places.
Colman describes his desire to return home to Wyoming after Harvard as an obligation to contribute “some social good” to his home state. Still, he recognizes the issues inherent in moving back to an area that may not offer all the professional opportunities a more urban environment affords.
“I don’t know that Wyoming has everything I would want,” Colman says. “I imagine the way that I’ll compromise between my obligations and my hope for more opportunities is that I go back West...but it may be in a city out West—in Denver or Salt Lake.”

Perhaps If I had grown up in Michigan I would have fallen in love with the New York City skyline, the tops of buildings glimpsed in small square segments from a plane. But I lived commuting-distance from Manhattan, in a suburb where the stone walls of colonial pastures lined the road to the train station. And so I met the city from the ground up: the smooth blue of the Hudson to the raised tracks over Harlem, only then to the skyscrapers in the distance.
Before I learned the names of the stops on Metro-North I marked the entrance to the city with the sighting of the giant, painted blue letters that spelled “New York College of Podiatric Medicine.” I did not know what “podiatric” meant, and so I imagined that the school taught some sort of futuristic medical practice, something to do with “pods,” sleek and silver like the rest of the city.
The ritual of city-going, reserved for weekends when rain cancelled muddy soccer practice, always began in Grand Central Station. I would stand with my mother under the bright green ceiling in the main concourse, and look for the twin cherubim figures who represented my astrological sign; my mother remembered where they were but I insisted on finding them myself, every time. No matter how many times we did this I could not memorize their exact location on the ceiling; I lost them, always, in the crowd of rushing tourists.
We ate lunch at the Oyster Bar, a bowl of clam chowder and a salad between the two of us, me mostly consuming the crackers from packets piled on the counter. And then we went to the Met.
I thought it must have been the biggest building in the world. The typeface on the exhibition advertisements that hung between columns looked larger than the blue letters of the New York College of Podiatric Medicine. The lobby reminded me of Grand Central Station—the customer service desk in its center like the station’s giant clock—only better, for gleaming staircases stretched from it to infinite heights. At a time in my life when I lost so many dolls that my mother stopped letting me take them out of the house, I kept every round “M” pin I received at the museum’s entrance. I wore them like Girl Scout badges, three or four on my collar, whenever I visited the museum.
My mother had studied art history in college, and so she walked slowly through the museum, examining each painting carefully, with what seemed to me like secret, mystical knowledge. I never wanted to listen to her explanations, and so I ran through each room three or four times while she completed her tour; if she understood the artwork, I got to know the physical layout of the museum, its staircases and nooks and crannies.
The place with the best nooks and crannies, of course, was the Egyptian wing, just to the right of the main lobby. I insisted on visiting it every time we went to the museum—no matter what new collection of photography or medieval manuscripts my mother wanted to see. Each time I thought I had found a new tomb passage; I placed my hands on the cold stone walls and spread my legs so that each foot touched the wall. I traced my fingers in the grooves between the stones, convinced that I might discover a trapped door.
Most of all, I loved the room of the exhibit that holds a free-standing temple on a marble platform, behind a clear, coin-filled pool. Something about the texture of the floor made footsteps sound soft and soothing there, perfectly tuned against rustling water. Sunbeams fell through the skylights in even planes, and I would sweep my hands through them, watching my palms grow bright.
Maybe I liked the exhibit because my mother knew nothing about Egyptian art. I imagined myself as an expert—my elementary school did a unit on Egyptian history and I bought picture books and kits (“Make Your Own Mini Mummy!”) at the museum’s gift shop. When my younger cousin visited from New Jersey, I begged my mom to let me give her a tour of the Egyptian wing. I cried when my cousin wanted to go to the Toys “R” Us in Times Square instead.
Not long after, I watched When Harry Met Sally with my father. I didn’t really understand the movie and my mother shooed me out of the living room when Meg Ryan faked her orgasm, but my parents wanted me to see the scene that takes place in the Egyptian wing. I think they thought I would love the reference to my favorite place, but I didn’t; I imagined it as my place and I was angry that someone else found it special enough to put in a movie. I thought I had discovered its romantic potential, too—I once saw a couple kissing beside the water.
As I grew older school field trips made me realize that I could not be the lone appreciator of the Egyptian wing in the Met Museum. In tenth grade my world history teacher packed sixty of us in a bus and through those giant columns; he wanted us to view the new Byzantine artifacts, but everyone raced toward the mummies the second he let us go.
Around the same time, I stopped strolling through the Egyptian wing on every visit; I saw new collections reviewed in The New Yorker and learned to walk through the museum as slowly as my mother.
Once, the summer before my junior year of high school, we visited the museum on the last day of the Alexander McQueen fashion exhibit, the one that drew six-hour lines. It was the hottest day of the summer, too, the kind of day where pavement seems to roll in waves under the sunlight and the whole city smells like hot dogs. The line, which normally stretched outside of the building, had been moved into the air-conditioned building. It snaked around the entire museum, across continents, through centuries. I had brought a book in preparation for the six hours but I quickly put it in my bag; I saw things I had never known the museum held, a real zen garden and large white Buddhas that held my stare, sparkling gold trombones in glass cases, small rooms meant to mimic the chambers of medieval Cathedrals. The line weaved and wound so much that afterward, I could not remember where I had seen anything—my memory of it felt like the memory of a location in a dream, a set in a movie I had seen long ago. To do this day, no matter how many times I search the East Asian wing, I cannot find the zen garden. I look for it every time, as I once searched for the twins on the ceiling of Grand Central. I realized that I did not know the museum at all.
Over spring break this year, I visited the Met with a few friends, one of whom grew up in Wisconsin and had never been to the museum before. She took photos of every turquoise hippo and crocodile-falcon god in the Egyptian wing, and I finally got to give my tour. I remembered none of my elementary Egyptian history, but I showed her every passage in every tomb; I could still feel my way through the exhibit blind, hand against cold stones.
Another friend of mine, who also grew up in a suburb of the city, had visited the museum many times before. But when I mentioned the room to her, she frowned at me—she had never seen it. She didn’t even remember the scene in When Harry Met Sally. It’s the most beautiful place, I promised, and it’s just down this hallway, just here. She had a sore ankle and I told her she could sit down there, beside the fountain. I told my other friend that she must enter the tomb.
We arrived in the room, heard the soft sound of water, but the tomb had been closed off—someone had reserved the space for a private event, set up round pink tables on the tomb’s marble platform. Aproned waiters arranged centerpieces and silverware, their hands passing through planes of light.

UPDATED: March 25, 2015, at 8:57 p.m.
British pop artist Jessie J will headline this year’s Yardfest, the College’s outdoor music concert scheduled for April 24, the Friday of Visitas weekend.
The College Events Board, responsible for planning the event, announced the news via their website at noon on Wednesday. The online announcement featured a mash-up of Jessie J video clips that was set to one of the artist’s most popular songs, “Bang Bang.”
According to Dakota D. Santana-Grace ’16, College Events Board co-chair, Jessie J was the Board’s top choice during its artist selection process. He said the group is thrilled to welcome her to campus in April.
Yardfest will take place on a Friday this year, unlike some previous years, when the concert was held on Saturday or Sunday. The event also takes place the same weekend as Visitas, the College’s visiting weekend program for accepted students.
This year's unorthodox scheduling is mainly a result of Jessie J’s performance schedule, according to Santana-Grace. He added that while the CEB is cognizant of the potential conflict with Visitas programming, the visiting weekend does not officially begin until the day after the concert.
The 26-year-old pop star first topped charts in the United States with her song “Price Tag,” and since then has peaked at No. 6 on Billboard’s “Hot 100” record chart with her song “Domino." She has collaborated with numerous other artists throughout her career, including Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, Taio Cruz, David Guetta, and Queen.
Jessie J will also headline Spring Fling at Yale on April 25, the day after Harvard's Yardfest.
Last year, R&B and soul artist Janelle Monáe headlined the concert, and in 2013, rap and hip-hop artist Tyga was the headlining performer. The CEB’s selection of Tyga sparked controversy from various students who criticized his music's lyrics as “misogynistic." In response, the Office of Student Life requested Yardfest organizers to reconsider the choice, though Tyga still performed in the show.
This year, students said they look forward to Jessie J’s performance.
“She's supposed to be a phenomenal live act, and I think she'll bring great energy to Yardfest 2015,” Holly W. Breuer ’18 said. Breuer is a member of the CEB’s artist selection committee.
Two student groups will open for Jessie J, according to Breuer. Auditions for student openers will take place in Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Radcliffe Institute fellow V.V. Ganeshananthan ’02 discussed the process of writing her upcoming novel about Sri Lankan politics at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Wednesday afternoon.
Her novel "Hippocrates," which is set in both Sri Lanka and New York from the 1970s through 2009, focuses on the recent civil war in Sri Lanka. At the Radcliffe reading, she read excerpts from her novel and then discussed the process of researching and writing about Sri Lankan politics.
Ganeshananthan, a former Crimson managing editor, said she made a conscientious effort to avoid a common pitfall in writing about politics what she described as mischaracterizing the viewpoints presented in public discourse as binaries.
“I see persistently narratives that construct politics along two party lines, binaries, and in other parts of the world, that’s often inaccurate,” Ganeshananthan said.
Ganeshananthan said she strove to find a fair balance between maintaining the accuracy of multiple political perspectives while still offering her own angle on the subject of the Sri Lankan civil war.
“I don’t think that the novel needs to pretend to objectivity,” Ganeshananthan said. “I’m not interested in neutrality. I think that would be fake.”
Ganeshananthan explained that research was integral to her writing process for "Hippocrates," since publicly accessible information on the Sri Lankan civil war is often incomplete.
“I actually don’t assume that Sri Lankans have all the information,” she said. “I know that I often don’t.”
When one audience member mentioned that works of historical fiction like "Hippocrates" are often classified as postcolonial literature, Ganeshananthan said her work should not be read solely with that kind of focus.
“I studied postcolonial literature and theory here [at Harvard College]...If that is the exclusive lens that a reader uses to look at my work, I find it really problematic,” Ganeshananthan said. “On a broader level, my work is just basically about morality… how people behave under pressure.”

Following controversy surrounding her role in an online video, Robin Steinberg, a New York public defender whose invitation to a Harvard Law School event was rescinded earlier this year, will deliver the inaugural “Trailblazer” lecture there in April.
The “Trailblazer” lecture is hosted by the Criminal Justice Institute, directed by Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan. Efforts to bring Steinberg to Cambridge began after pushback against the decision to rescind her initial invitation.
“We felt that it was only fair that she had the opportunity to speak,” Sullivan said. “Ms. Steinberg has made significant and groundbreaking contributions in the area of criminal law.”
Steinberg, who serves as the executive director of the Bronx Defenders, was initially slated to be honored as part of the Women’s Law Association and the Law and International Development Society’s International Women’s Day, an annual event that celebrates women both in and out of the legal field. But the two Law School student groups rescinded the honor last month because of Steinberg’s role in an online video “Hands Up.”
The YouTube video was controversial for what some claimed was an endorsement of the killing of white police officers in retribution for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two unarmed black men who were killed by police officers last year. Steinberg came under fire because the video featured two attorneys from the Bronx Defenders. A New York City investigation revealed that Steinberg did not check the content of the video before allowing her employees to take part, and, as a result, she was suspended from her job.
Soon after Steinberg’s first honor was rescinded, other Law School students started planning to recognize her in a different capacity. Sullivan said efforts were made to bring Steinberg to campus in midst of the controversy.
He said that while the Criminal Justice Institute hosts many different lecturers each year, Steinberg’s will be the first “Trailblazer” lecture, which will take place on April 10.
Steinberg will also participate in the conference that “Unbound: Harvard Journal of the Legal Left” hosts each spring, according to Rebecca N. Chapman, a third-year Law student and editor of the journal.

The Harvard School of Public Health will launch in June a new master’s degree program that for the first time will be offered largely online, with a small residential component.
Students enrolled in the trial program for a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology will complete around 10 hours per week in online coursework over the next two years, as well as come to campus for three weeks of residency in June 2015 and June 2016, according to Katie L. Vale, the School of Public Health's director of digital learning. At the end of the two years, the 55 students in the trial program will return a final time in May to complete capstone projects and graduate, she added.
Vale said this blended approach will target individuals who already have experience in public health who may be inconvenienced by a move to Cambridge.
“There are people who are out there doing good work already in the medical and public health arena,” she said. “What we heard from them is that they would love a way to further their public health education but not give up the good work they were doing around the world.”
The trial program will use Canvas, a Web interface currently used by many Harvard courses. According to Vale, the decision to use Canvas over other platforms like edX, a digital learning venture founded by Harvard and MIT in 2012, was motivated by the enrollees’ status as Harvard students.
“We really wanted them to be on the same footing as actual Harvard students because they will be actual Harvard students, as opposed to students signing up for HarvardX on the edX platform, where they could be anywhere in the world,” she said. “This is for a residential course, and it made sense to have it be Canvas.”
Justin Reich, a HarvardX research fellow, said online learning interfaces have more or less the same technical capabilities, and the choice of platform for any program is based upon the teaching needs of the courses.
“There’s half a dozen [platforms] that would be totally suitable, edX one of them, for hosting course content and learning interaction,” he added.
The School of Public Health has already developed several courses for HarvardX. Joshua M. Kim, director of Digital Learning Initiatives at the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, said the distinction between MOOCs and online programs offered by universities is often confused.
“The edX program is built to go to scale and serve thousands and tens of thousands of lifelong learners, whereas the education you get at Harvard, or our students at Dartmouth get, is really about the relationship between you and the faculty,” he said. “That can’t be scaled or go beyond a certain size.”
According to Vale, the School of Public Health's new online program will cost the same as the brick and mortar program. Joshua S. Goodman, professor at the Kennedy School of Government who is currently conducting research into Georgia Tech’s online master’s degree in computer science, said that despite the similar costs in tuition, the program may still be a better alternative for users who have been out of school.
“Separate from the price, the flexibility that an online degree offers is hugely attractive to people who are at stages of their life where they can’t simply stop what they are doing and go get a degree full time,” he said.
Yale is also planning its first full-time online degree for 2016, a master of medical science, which will also cost the same tuition as the brick and mortar program at the Yale School of Medicine.

Due to severe weather conditions that University President Drew G. Faust described as “the snowiest winter on record,” athletic teams have been forced to remain inside longer than usual for practice and conditioning this season.
The Harvard Athletic Department decided to keep the Harvard Stadium “bubble” open for an extra week, according to varsity softball coach Jenny L. Allard.
Men’s varsity heavyweight crew coach Charles S. Butt compared the severity of this winter to the winter of 1967 when the team only began outdoor practice March 28. Although Butt acknowledged that such a late outdoor start could pose a disadvantage to his team earlier in the season due to a lack of “river miles,” he said it could also offer a competitive advantage later on in the season because of the increased time spent conditioning.
“What’s clearly a disadvantage in the early competitive season can turn radically to your favor as conditioning takes hold and you get more miles,” Butt said.
Patrick J. Wales-Dinan, assistant coach of the varsity track and field team, said the extended indoor period can physically challenge student-athletes, resulting in a change in training practices.
“[The indoor track] puts a little more stress...on your musculoskeletal system,” Wales-Dinan said. “I’m coaching the middle distance and distance runners, so we’ll probably decrease the volume of training we do based on that.”
Wales-Dinan added that while winter weather has not significantly affected practice intensity, it has forced him to be more creative. “We try to adapt, do a little bit more cross training, get in the pool, get on the bike, things like that, and hopefully we can still do a good job training the athletes,” he said.
Some athletes have also expressed frustration toward the prolonged winter weather.
“We’re all getting anxious to get back out there as we have been out only four times since our Florida training trip at the end of winter break in January,” said Christian T. Kardish ’18, a member of the heavyweight crew team.
Track and field athlete Randall R. Raymond ’18 echoed Kardish’s sentiments. “My main event is the 400 hurdles, which is outdoors. The snow and cold weather have limited my opportunities in getting out and training for that race,” Raymond said.
Despite the extended indoor training period, Wales-Dinan remained optimistic about the upcoming season.
“I think everyone is healthy and in a good position moving forward,” Wales-Dinan said. “That’s kind of all you can hope for to go into the outdoor season with health and be in a good place to train hard.”

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Imperial College of London, along with other colleagues, have developed the first mathematical model that works on a global level to predict an individual’s risk of cardiovascular disease.
The project, spearheaded by first authors Kaveh Hajifathalian and Peter Ueda, compiled data from eight preexisting cohort studies and aims to improve allotment of resources and disease treatment in low-income countries, according to the first authors.
Peter Ueda, a post-doctoral researcher at the School of Public Health, said several variables determine cardiovascular risk, and the new model incorporates major contributing factors to achieve a high level of specificity.
“The risk pattern is different across countries and populations,” Ueda said. “Even if you have the same risk factor levels, the same blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes, depending on which population you belong to, you will have [a] different risk of cardiovascular disease.”
Ueda added that without this specificity, cardiovascular risk estimates can be inaccurate. According to Goodarz Danaei, an assistant professor of global health at the School of Public Health, most estimates for developing countries tend to run high, meaning resources are over-allocated to these populations. The new model hopes to decrease this margin of inefficiency, Danaei said.
The researchers decided to use risk factors that correlate most strongly with the development of cardiovascular disease.
“We chose the risk factors that were readily available in low income settings: blood pressure, cholesterol, age, gender, smoking, and diabetes,” Ueda said. The new model takes into account all of these variables and also allows for population-specific calibration.
The accuracy and benefits of the new model will also be readily accessible to the public. According to Danaei, a website will list risks of cardiovascular disease in countries all around the world later this year.
Ueda said he hopes this model will be able to help the rapidly growing number of cardiovascular disease patients.
“Cardiovascular disease is increasing rapidly in low income countries, and up until recently, most attention has been focused on infectious diseases,” Ueda said. “But noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, are the leading causes of death globally.”

As the College readies for a fall rollout of its first honor code, undergraduates on the student-faculty body that will hear cases of academic integrity have begun their training, which included signing a confidentiality agreement.
Once it begins hearing cases, the body, called the Honor Council, hopes to eventually release statistics comparable to those the College’s Administrative Board currently does, according to Interim Ad Board Secretary Brett Flehinger, who will serve as secretary of the Honor Council in the new Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct next academic year.
Earlier this month, the College published the names of 26 College students who will comprise the undergraduate affiliates of the Honor Council—12 members who will hear cases and 14 who will serve as “academic integrity fellows” to assist students in the case and discipline process. Both groups have begun attending a two-hour weekly training session each Monday, led by administrators and students including Flehinger, soon-to-be Ad Board secretary Lauren E. Brandt, Resident Dean of Freshmen for Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen, and Olivia Z. Zhu ’15, a member of the  Academic Integrity Committee, which drafted the honor code.
The fully-staffed Honor Council will also include 12 non-undergraduate members, whom Flehinger said administrators have not yet appointed.
A large portion of the training thus far has focused on studying sample cases, although members have been approaching their discussions as if the cases were real, Flehinger said. For that reason, the members have already signed a confidentiality agreement and are expected to keep details of mock cases private, according to Flehinger. In the future, the Office of the General Counsel, according to Flehinger, will specify their legal obligations for confidentiality.
“Everything is confidential from the beginning,” Flehinger said, referring to the case materials.
Undergraduates on the Honor Council praised the training thus far. They said it features collaborative interactions and discussions with students, faculty, and administrators about readings and cases.
“I feel much better that I’m sharing the burden with other people,” Honor Council member Matthew J. Vegari ’17 said.
While some members readily acknowledged that determining sanctions for fellow students might be challenging, they emphasized what they perceived as their prominent role beyond the honor code or Council in shaping a broader attitude towards academic integrity at the College.
“I anticipate that doing this will not always be easy,” said Lien E. Le ’17, a Crimson associate arts editor who will serve on the Honor Council. “I’m doing this not because I think I’m going to enjoy it, but because I think it’s really important.”
Nathaniel R. F. Bernstein ’17, who is a member of the Academic Integrity Committee and the Honor Council, stressed the “leading role” he said students are serving in the rollout of the honor code and ownership of conversations surrounding academic integrity.
“You can't make any kind of argument anymore that there is some kind of outside force and it’s sort of bearing down—it’s all [of] us, and we have to be able to own that,” Bernstein said.
Administrators and students said their work as members of the College’s first true student-faculty disciplinary board will not be limited to only hearing cases, but will also include efforts at broader outreach to the College.
According to Flehinger, the students may meet with classes as well as with student groups and academic departments, with an emphasis on reaching out to the Class of 2019 beginning at this year’s visiting weekend for prospective students, Visitas.
Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, a member of the Council as well as the Academic Integrity Committee, said he sees his role as being an “ambassador of the code and the Council in many ways.” Additionally, he said students would serve as pivotal actors in helping to “serve the community” including by hosting events related to issues of integrity.
“A bigger challenge is going to be how we communicate their work and the work of the [student academic integrity fellows] to the community,” Ranen said.
Next month, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is expected to vote on a proposal for the affirmation of integrity portion of the Honor Code. If approved in its current form, the mandate would require students to sign a statement acknowledging their awareness of the Honor Code prior to final exams, as well as final papers and projects.

Undergraduate Council leaders have created a new position, UC communications director, whose main responsibility will be to ensure "prompt" email responses from UC representatives to their constituents.
Oak Yard representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 will serve in the new position.
In an email to undergraduates on Tuesday, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 encouraged students to notify the communications director if their emails were not responded to in a timely fashion.
“I'm hoping to help the UC seem more approachable and helpful to students that might otherwise be disillusioned,” Gonzalez said.
According to Goyal, the position did not arise in light of a particular incident or representative, but is instead part of a broad strategy to hold the UC more accountable and responsible for its individual constituents.
Also in the email, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal publicized an open forum that the Council hosted with University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana that was held on Tuesday.

Wednesday’s second annual Harvard Thinks Healthy event featured a wide range of topics, including the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and undergraduate mental health at Harvard.
During a 90-minute event in Emerson Hall, three Harvard affiliates and a public health expert addressed a roughly 40-person audience in a panel format, a departure from last year’s seminar-style event on intuitive eating.
University Health Services Director Paul Barreira discussed the findings of a study on the impacts of exercise on mental health and a new experiment intended for the incoming freshmen class.
Gita Bhattacharya '16, the co-president of the Harvard College Health Advocacy Program who served as the main event coordinator, hoped to inspire Harvard affiliates to take an interest in health research taking place on campus.
“The inspiration for this event actually came from events like Harvard Thinks Big and Harvard Thinks Green, and actually at Harvard Thinks Big this year, there wasn’t a single health researcher invited to share their research,” Bhattacharya said.
In addition to Barreira, the event featured Medical School professor David R. Vago, Biology professor Kiran Musunuru, and John Welch from the non-profit Partners in Health.
Nayoung K. Yang ’18 came to the event because of the people involved. “What really garnered my attention was having Joia and Kiran as featured speakers,” she said. “I’m also really interested in stem cell and regenerative biology and cardiac health and want to pursue health in the two fields, so the topic really caught my attention.”
The program also intended to inspire general interest in Harvard affiliates, Bhattacharya said.
“This event is voluntary; it’s not a class requirement, so I really just want to spark interest,” she said. “For students who are interested in going into health, this could be advice on what they might do in the future, and for other students it could just be information.”
As part of this goal to spread health awareness among the general student population, HAP invited other student groups, including Stressbusters, HealthPals, Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, and others to partake in the reception following the event.

A University Health Services study on the impact of exercise encouragement on mental health found no difference between control and treatment groups, UHS Director Paul J. Barreira said in a talk on Wednesday.
The study came after results from a College-wide survey revealed a “dramatic correlation” between mental health problems and frequency of exercise, Barreira said.
A quarter of the roughly 3,000 students who responded to the survey recorded zero days of moderate exercise in the past week, defined as 20 minutes a day. Twenty-five percent of those students said they had significant depression, and 32.7 percent reported general anxiety disorder. Barreira said moderate exercise was correlated with “better overall health, better sleep, [and] greater satisfaction.”
After collecting this data, administrators at UHS worked with the Athletic Department to design an experiment to test the effects of daily exercise on undergraduate mental health.
“Athletic Department got excited, College got excited, and UHS got excited,” Barreira said. “So, we came up with a pilot project.”
The study involved some students in Dunster and Kirkland Houses. Dunster residents were encouraged to exercise through fitness programs and literature, while Kirkland residents constituted the control group. After a semester of the project, a follow-up survey revealed no difference in mental health between the two groups, Barreira said.
Seeking to design a more effective experiment, Barreira has partnered with the Athletic Department as well as Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, Biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman, and Business School professor Paul A. Gompers.
“This time we got even more ambitious,” Barreira said. The new study is targeted for non-varsity athletes in the incoming freshmen class and will notably add a mandatory exercise component to the previous experimental design.
“We had a hypothesis: Coercion in this case is good, and will lead to better results,” Barreira said. “So, the coercions have to do with: If you don’t meet your mark, we will donate to the organization that you hate. If you do meet your mark, you will get certification signed by the president that states you’ve reached a certain fitness and completed this program. That’s the basic design.”
Barreira’s comments came during his talk at the second annual Harvard Thinks Healthy event, organized by the Harvard College Health Advocacy Program. Sponsored by Harvard’s Department of Health Promotion and Education and the Wellness Center, Harvard Thinks Healthy 2015 aimed to showcase current research on issues of health conducted by Harvard faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 28, 2015, at 5:55 p.m.
“The Hunting Ground,” a documentary that scrutinizes how sexual assault is handled on college campuses and heavily features Harvard, misrepresents statistics on instances of reported sexual assault at Harvard, calling the rigor of the film’s fact-checking process into question.
The film, which opened in Boston on March 13, chronicles what it describes as the “epidemic” of sexual assault at schools including Harvard. Opening with a sequence of video clips showing prospective students gleefully learning of their college acceptances, the film presents a stark contrast between the excitement students feel when they enter college and what it depicts as the dangerous climate that awaits them there.
The film focuses heavily on the testimony of victims of sexual assault and what they say was a lackluster response from administrators at their respective schools. A former Harvard Law School student describes her experience reporting an assault, and former Harvard associate professor Kimberly Theidon—who is currently suing the University for allegedly denying her tenure in response to her advocacy on behalf of sexual assault victims—is also interviewed. “The Hunting Ground” is largely critical of Harvard, which was one of the main schools chronicled in the film.
The project aimed to draw attention to the issue and create “activity for change,” according to Kirby Dick, the film’s writer and director whose previous work has been nominated for an Academy Award. Since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the film has drawn national attention and received a number of favorable reviews. A New York Times review called the film a “must-watch work of cine-activism, one that should be seen by anyone headed to college and by those already on campus.” The Boston Globe gave it three and a half stars.
The film, however, presents at least some information about Harvard inaccurately.
In one sequence, a series of slides lists various schools and the number of sexual assaults reported there in a given time period compared to the number that led to expulsion. The film lists that from 2009-2013, Harvard College saw 135 cases of reported sexual assault, but only 10 expulsions.
Those numbers are misleading. According to Dick, filmmakers arrived at the 135 number through criminal statistics made public by Harvard as required by the Clery Act, but, contrary to what the film states, those numbers do not necessarily represent only incidents at Harvard College. The Clery Act statistics available specify on which campus at Harvard various crimes occurred, and whether they happened in a campus, residential, off-campus, or public setting, but they do not break down offenses by individual school.
Harvard College has roughly 6,400 students, while Harvard University as a whole includes about 20,000.
According to Dick, filmmakers based its report that Harvard College saw 10 expulsions for sexual assault in this time period on case statistics published on the website of the College’s Administrative Board, which hands down sanctions in sexual assault cases. According to five-year statistics that are currently available online, the Ad Board required 10 students to withdraw from the College between the fall of 2009 and the spring of 2014 in disciplinary cases under the general category of “social behavior - sexual.”
Those students, however, were not necessarily expelled, but rather required to leave the College temporarily with the possibility of readmittance. In fact, the Ad Board cannot expel students. Only a vote of the Faculty Council can, and it happens rarely.
Furthermore, cases listed under the broad “social behavior - sexual” category are not necessarily sexual assault cases; the case statistics are not so specific.
Dick, for his part, acknowledged the numbers’ lack of specificity in an email. "Since Harvard College is not transparent about its number of sexual assaults or their adjudications, these are the available numbers that Harvard reports that convey the extreme gap between the number of assaults and number of severe sanctions," Dick wrote.
The statistics are not the only misleading part of the film. The sequence with students’ reactions to their college acceptances includes at least one short clip that is fake, taken from a prank video posted to YouTube last year purporting to feature a student vomiting after learning of her Harvard acceptance.
The student in the film, Nicole C. Hirschhorn ’16, was a sophomore at Harvard when she acted out the scene for campus comedy group On Harvard Time. After viewing that segment of the film, she confirmed that the clip in “The Hunting Ground” is from the prank video. She called the video “definitely fake.”
The short clip is included in the film with no indication that it is not authentic. Darren DeLuca, a publicist representing Dick, did not respond to a request for comment on the film’s fact-checking process or the YouTube video.
But when asked whether the film was meant to be a “truthful, journalistic documentary take on the issue,” Dick said, “Yes, absolutely.”
Media experts interviewed said films billed as documentaries must pass a high bar for accuracy. Speaking generally about documentaries but not specifically about “The Hunting Ground,” Alex S. Jones, the director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard, said if a film “call[s] itself a documentary, it has to be the truth—otherwise it's advocacy or propaganda; it's not a documentary.”
“I would hold them to exactly the same standard as I would an article in The New York Times,” said Jones, who previously worked for the Times as a journalist.
Former Dean of Columbia Journalism School Nicholas Lemann '76, for his part, suggested that factual inaccuracies undercut the credibility of a documentary film. “Just on moral grounds and on practical grounds, you're trying to build trust,” said Lemann, a former Crimson president. “Once you get something wrong, it’s very hard to stand your ground and say, ‘But everything else is right.’”
Still, others suggest that the film accurately portrays the experiences of students on college campuses. Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center who appears in the film, said the film accurately portrays what she has found in her own work with survivors of sexual assault. Filmmakers contacted her about the project almost two years ago, she said, and spoke with her for at least eight hours.
“I think that they did a great job representing victims and representing the typical response from a college,” Bruno said, adding that she has seen an outpouring of support since the film’s release.
“The impact that it’s having on people is that they want to act after they see this movie, and that, I think, is going to be the film’s legacy,” Bruno said.
Still, the film has also drawn criticism from at least one university official, Florida State University President John Thrasher, who said his school was not given an adequate amount of time to respond. Dick said he believes that filmmakers reached out to University President Drew G. Faust “at least a couple of months before we finally locked picture.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the President’s Office received a generic interview request in late November 2014. Faust declined to comment, and filmmakers were informed of that decision on Dec. 15, according to Neal. The film screened at Sundance in January.
Harvard College is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for allegedly violating anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. Harvard Law School entered a resolution agreement with the government after it was found in violation of the law in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst the dramatic backdrop of rain and hail, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team got into a frantic, back-and-forth shootout against the No. 10/9 University of Albany. In a game that showcased the potent offensive attacks of both teams, the Crimson (4-4, 0-2 Ivy) led the Great Danes (5-1, 2-0 AE) for the entirety of the first half before the Albany offense took control to end the game Wednesday night at Soldier Field lacrosse stadium. Although Albany put the game away late in the fourth quarter, the Crimson battled to close the goal difference to a respectable score of 21-18 at the final whistle.
Although the Great Danes ended Harvard’s unblemished 3-0 record at home at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium, the final score was still considered a victory compared to the previous meetings between the two teams – the Crimson fell to Albany 8-14 last season.
“We definitely prepared to play against those guys and we did a very good job,” said junior goalkeeper Bryan Moore. “ We did execute our game plan, [but] he (Albany attackman Lyle Thompson) and their whole team is just very good. ”
Thompson – the reigning Co-Tewarraton Trophy and Turnbull Award winner and a player for the Great Danes – has been recently named a midseason All-American and racked up 24 shots and 9 successful goals in this game alone.
“Obviously he’s [Thompson] as good as there is out there and as good as we’ve ever seen,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ‘96. “We had a number of different things that we tried but he did a great job against us.”
Although the Crimson put up a valiant fight, Albany dominated on the ground, especially in the third and fourth quarter, as the Great Danes secured a 19-9 and 14-8 advantage in groundballs. Albany also out-shot Harvard 57-39 while claiming 24 of the 42 face-offs.
“We wound up being behind in the face-offs and for a while during that game it was whoever won the face-off was going to score,” said Wojcik. “You give a great team that many chances on offense, they’re tough to stuff. If you give them second chances, they’re going to hurt you.”
Although Thompson and the Great Danes put on an incredible offensive display, the Crimson offense did not disappoint either. Harvard started the game off by scoring two goals within 15 seconds of each other. Freshman attackman Tim Edmonds and junior midfielder Michel Keegan netted two unassisted scores for the Crimson’s first two tallies of the game. Later in the first quarter, freshman midfielder Joe Lang stormed past two defenders to increase Harvard’s lead, while junior midfielder Ian Ardrey stretched the scoring gap to 4-1 with a close range goal.
Albany would return each Crimson goal with markers of its own all throughout the second quarter but Harvard clung to its lead throughout the first half with standout athletic performances. Junior attackman Will Walker managed to find the back of the Albany net despite being knocked to the ground in the front of the goal; this was closely followed by Edmonds finding a gap in the defense after a run down mid-field and netting in an un-assisted seventh goal even though the Crimson was playing a man-down.
The second half saw Albany take the lead for the first time with the score at 10-9 but Harvard continued to score on fast transitions. The Crimson opened the fourth quarter with a similar performance as in the first: with two players netting goals within a few seconds of each other. One goal was scored directly from face-off with Keegan slicing through the defense and slotting in Harvard’s second goal of the final quarter. Even though the Crimson had bursts of momentum, it ultimately was unable to shrink the gap in the score.
“We went out against a very, very solid team and put up 18 goals – offensively that’s great,” said Moore. “A lot of guys enjoyed playing today and [we] didn’t feel like we were under a lot of pressure…like we have been in the past couple of games. Now we get to take a step back…to prepare for Cornell, reset our minds and then close out our Ivy stretch.”

Breaking news that I’m sure was highly anticipated by the Harvard student body: Dictionary.com has released a list naming the most searched word at colleges across the country. Ranging from some of my personal favorites such as “sociopath” at the University of South Carolina, “gag” at the University of Wyoming, and “cauliflower” at Boise State University, the most-searched words clearly run the gamut.
Here at Harvard, our most-searched word was “sustainability.” Now while Heather Henriksen, the director of the Harvard Office of Sustainability stated that she regarded this as “just one great example of the level of interest and passion for this issue at Harvard, and the fact that everyone has a role to play in addressing sustainability,” I’m not just going to accept this so easily. What exactly motivates a Harvard student to search “sustainability” on Dictionary.com? I’ve brainstormed a few possible scenarios:
1. Following the trend set by Drew Faust herself:
President Faust’s recent climate change talks at Tsinghua University in China very well could have sparked some interest in the topic on campus. Naturally, of course, leading to a sudden burst in people searching “sustainability” along with “China”, “climate”, and “change” on Dictionary.com. Anything to channel your inner Drew Faust.
2. Frequent Tealuxe Patrons:
What exactly is this “sustainabiliTEA” and how can I get some? I’m always looking to expand my tea horizons!
3. Pure Curiosity:
What is this sustainability movement I keep getting emails about? What are those trucks with the green Harvard seals that I always see around the Yard? How does one even spell “sustainability”? I know where to begin, by looking up the definition of sustainability!
4. Needing the actual definition of sustainability:
Whether it’s for the opening sentence in an EPS essay or a strongly worded email by Divest, if you look hard enough, you can (probably) find a use for the definition of sustainability.
For anyone else looking to engage with Harvard’s environmental activism, a great place to start is by taking a look at the awesome Office of Sustainability’s Sustainability Plan. Or of course by keeping with the trend searching “sustainability” on Dictionary.com...

In case you missed it, the College Events Board announced that Jessie J will be headlining Yardfest this year. Even if you don’t know who Jessie J is, you’ve definitely heard “Bang Bang” being blasted at one of those too-crowded “dance” parties that ran out of Rubinoff at 10:30 p.m. We’ve all been there.
So if you’re one of those people who knows her as “the one in that song with Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj,” here’s a quick study guide to help prep you for #Yardfest2015.
1. Bang Bang
We’ll start out easy for you: If you don’t already, just know this song. It’s her most popular song recently so she’s probably going to play it. It got nominated for a Grammy and debuted very high on Billboard’s Hot 100 too!
2. Domino
Another big song that I know fondly as “the one that comes up frequently on my workout playlist,” this song will probably bring you back to the good old days of 2011.  According to the YouTube comments, many thought this song was actually by Katy Perry, but unfortunately, the CEB will not be gracing us with Katy’s (or her left shark’s) presence.
3. Price Tag
I may only know three Jessie J songs, but props to her because those three are songs that pretty much everyone has heard. “Price Tag” serves as another nice #tbt to high school, and the video is hilariously 2011. What’s going on with these outfits? What does she say at the beginning– coconut man? Moonheads? And is she really dancing in front of a money tree?
4. Burnin’ Up
I hadn’t heard this song until I started making this study guide, but I’d be okay with getting down in Tercentenary to it. It features 2 Chainz, and the beat sounds a little like Pharrell’s “Come Get It Bae,”neither of which are necessarily a bad thing.
5. Wild
This track, off of her second album, features Big Sean rocking a ridiculous mustache in the artsy, black-and-white video. Bonus points to this song for being incredibly repetitive– after a couple of seconds, you’ll know enough of the song to drunkenly shout along.
And if you’re wanting a little more from your girl Jess, she just dropped a new album at the end of 2014, and two Harvard acapella groups have covered her songs. And, she can sing with her mouth closed, which is pretty cool.
And @Yale, Spring Fling may be great and all, but we get her first.

If you’re seeing this now, you’re too late. But rumors are true that President Barack Obama’s eldest daughter, Malia, was indeed on Harvard’s campus today, and we have the selfie to prove it.
A current junior at Sidwell Friends School, the President’s daughter is on her college search game. She’s recently been spotted touring Princeton, Yale, Wesleyan, and Brown, and apparently already toured UC Berkeley and Stanford last summer, followed by NYU and Columbia in February. Clearly, though, unless she plans to bear the frozen tundras of Dartmouth and Cornell next, Malia saved the best for last, as she marveled at the breathtaking Widener Library and majestic John Harvard statue this afternoon. We hope her tour guides, who looked College student-aged, warned Malia about rubbing the shoe.

Congratulations, it's Thursday! You’re almost done with the first week back from break and the weekend is at last in sight. I’d say this calls for celebration, don’t you? Well, turns out President Faust agrees too! Spend your Thursday afternoon from 3 to 5 p.m. snacking on s’mores and sipping hot chocolate in the Science Center Plaza to celebrate the snowiest winter this city has ever seen. Looks like we have ourselves a thirsty Thursday in the realest sense.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREWith temperatures reaching the 50s for the first time in about as long as I can remember, it seems like Spring has finally sprung! Unfortunately, this lovely high of 54 degrees is also accompanied by 72% humidity and an 80% chance of rainfall that's expected to accumulate to a quarter of an inch. On the plus side, maybe the rain will wash away the remaining snow? Here’s to wishful thinking.
