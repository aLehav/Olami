After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I felt the sweat. It was taking over my body. Trickling down my calves, welling up between my shirt and spine, dripping down my face and neck. However, I could care less. I was in Italy. Gone were the storms and the perpetual rain showers of Germany. Hello sun. Hello summer. Hello Rome.
Forty minutes later, my smile began to fade as my facial muscles rearranged themselves into a confused grimace. I shot a furtive glance left at my teammate Marion. She seemed equally perplexed as her gaze extended past the open window of the taxi and towards an all-too-close mountain village. Just a guess, but I’m pretty sure we will not be finding a polo field up here. But, maybe I’m wrong; the Italians do have their own way of doing, well, everything. Driving, that is for sure. I hadn’t been on an auto adventure like this since my first chaotic ride through Buenos Aires. Guess the Italians took that tradition straight down to South America when they emigrated.
“So, unfortunately, we only have five horses for you guys to stick and ball today. George definitely gets two since he didn’t get to play yesterday. That means you girls will have to sort it out amongst yourselves who gets stuck with one pony today.” Marion and I scowl at each, but quickly follow up with a good-natured smile. Of course it didn’t really matter, but in the world of polo, every horse is a new and valuable experience, especially the day before a match on new horses. Marion begrudgingly consented to allow me the extra horse, but was promptly rewarded for her good deed when one of the London players showed up late, allowing her to steal his mount.
Just as practice was about to begin, jovial Peter bounded toward us, literally leaping off his bike, leaving a fellow schoolmate to deal with the trepid combination of mallets and a tipping motorcycle. “How did you sleep? Did you get to the field all right? This is my friend! Have you sorted out horses? You excited? Oh this is so great!” Eventually, the fellow from King’s pealed himself off the Moped, carefully manoeuvring Peter’s precious paraphernalia out of harm’s way as he dismounted. From behind dark Ray Bans and a looming figure, a strong hand stretched towards us. Voice proper and sharp with British schooling, he introduced himself as the London captain. A question or two later revealed his origin, none other than that enigmatic city in the UAE. Manners flung aside, I felt an aggressive eye-roll coming on as we were presented with our very own polo prototype, or rather, our stereotype.
Post-game chitchat with the late arrival from the Netherlands expanded the cultural reach of our party. Dinner conversation roamed through unchartered territory as we debated, in true Ivy League style, on a myriad of topics. Watch out, the water you drink daily could have lasting effects on your health and, gasp, your sexual orientation; the EU commission is just another prime example of the one percent taking over the world, one Swiss bank account at a time; and if it isn’t already blatantly obvious, the TSA is pretty much an unnecessary and irrelevant component of air travel.
Traversing the side streets of Rome, battling it out on a perfect polo pitch, and watching the sun rise, I couldn’t have been more pleased by the our trip’s diversity. Cambridge, London, Harvard, and Sapienza bonded on and off the field as we enjoyed the beautiful weather, sights, and sounds Italy and our gracious hosts, the Elser Family, had to offer. Discourse flowed in and out of countless languages as we all took our best shot at Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch, French, and of course, various versions of the English language. All I can say is, when in Rome, do as the Romans do and you will have the time of your life.

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSSETS—Sadly, my life isn't particularly interesting.
From what I understand, most of my fellow Crimson postcard-ers have found themselves in all sorts of cool locales that are on my bucket list of places to visit.  If you thought this postcard was about a vicariously sexy, exotic experience in Europe, Asia, or even in non-Massachusetts America, then I'm sorry.   I'd advise you to stop reading and find something else to waste time on at work.  This three-postcard series is just my pseudo-blog for documenting my average summer life in Boston.
Since the end of freshman spring, I've wandered a solid three miles or so from the third floor of Canaday E to the fourth floor triple of Pi Lambda Phi on Beacon Street.  For those of you who don't know, PLP is an MIT frat.
You may find this kind of funny, especially if you have previously met me, arguably the definitional opposite of what we might call a “frat bro.”  The word “frat” itself carries certain connotations that register immediately in people’s minds (see Dartmouth).  But living at PLP has actually been pretty chill and pretty awesome, for lack of less vague terminology.  I thought at first that it might be some slightly bizarre, regrettably memorable experience, but there’s been nothing to warrant those initial suspicions.  Or at least, nothing yet.  I’m living with one of my best friends from high school and one of my other best friend’s best friend in college (yes that’s how I phrase it when I tell people), so rooming has gone very smoothly.  In my first month or so in Boston, I’ve also met cool people, gone cool places, wasted time in a cool manner (I’ll admit, I’ve been playing a lot of League of Legends lately).
Frat life, at least at MIT’s PLP, has been mostly indistinguishable from normal college life in a dorm, except maybe a little messier.  It’s certainly not “Animal House.”  Although, we do actually share our room with the occasional mouse or two—they’re incredibly cute, especially when you see them run by, but I know not everybody shares my sentiments.  Maybe it was inevitable.  On a bad, or really a normal day, our room looks like a small jungle (one of my roommates described it as an “ecosystem”).
So basically, not much has changed for me.  It’s still the same old dorm-style living, the same old hanging out with college-aged people, the same old awkward under-21 phase of American life.  But that doesn’t mean it can’t still be a good time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ZAMBIA--“In-ko-ko,” I say, pointing to the beautifully feathered fowl that has just walked past our cooking site. The four older Zambian women sitting around the campfire break out in laughter and applause. They are making nshima, a type of corn porridge that has been described to me as “the national dish of Zambia”. Colorful chitenge are wrapped around their waists. Like wearable kaleidoscopes, I have yet to see two of the same patterns.
Rule number one of exploring rural Zambian villages— if you laugh too, then everyone is laughing with you and not at you. In the two hours that I’ve been here, I’ve managed to learn just two words in Bemba, the local language. Not an impressive rate, but people seem so ready to help, explain and, yes, laugh, that it makes the process enjoyable.
Coincidentally, the chicken that I’ve just correctly identified in Bemba, the local language, is the same one that I bought for my hostess in a traditional gesture of gratitude. Just half an hour ago I tried to hold it near a roadside fruit market and succeeded in dropping it and almost getting the poor thing run over. Why did the chicken cross the road? To commit suicide by eighteen-wheeler truck, apparently.
Rule number two— if you are giving someone a farm animal as a gift, try to get it to them alive. The eagle is officially the national bird of Zambia, adorning the upper right-hand corner of their green, red, black, and orange flag. It is the humble chicken however, that truly deserves the title, symbolizing sustenance, prosperity, and dinnertime for millions of Zambians.
“Muli-shani!” Back at the cooking site, one of the younger women greets me and then gestures towards the fire. She hands me a large wooden spoon and proceeds to explain to me the proper technique for stirring nshima. I try and mimic her motions—side-to-side and then upwards— and manage some crude imitation. The smoke from the campfire stings my eyes behind my glasses, and the muscles in my arms begin to ache after two stirs. Stirring corn porridge is a little like mixing sidewalk cement.
Rule number three— if you have a chance to participate in some important life activity, eagerly do so and try to make friends in the process. I manage a few more stirs before handing over the spoon to the woman on my left. She actively sets to work with impressive purpose. It’s an important job she’s doing after all, cooking food to feed two dozen of her closest friends and family. Sitting near this campfire with these four women who have welcomed a complete stranger into their lives, I feel an immense and unexpected sense of privilege.
The greatest privilege of all is the chance to experience a lifestyle different from your own. For me, this is the joy and the necessity of travel— the chance to place yourself into another set of circumstances and to live differently from the way you know. There is no better way to learn about the world around you or about yourself.
