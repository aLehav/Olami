After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bryce Aiken slammed the ball to the ground in frustration, as the normally level-headed Coach Tommy Amaker yelled at the official, “You’re better than that!”.
Trailing at the time by a 43-39 score midway through the second half, Harvard thought it had secured a steal and a transition bucket, but a referee signaled for a late jump ball — a questionable call that palpably intensified the atmosphere within Lavietes Pavilion, and spurred the Crimson to a nail-biting, come-from behind 64-59 win over Dartmouth.
“Coach [Amaker] always expressed you never know when that 20 minutes might be to turn that ship around again and the momentum for the rest of the season,” junior guard Christian Juzang said. “It all instilled a sense of urgency in us, basically that every game is not just another game. It means everything with a standing in the [Ivy League] tournament and so forth.”
Two weeks after suffering an 81-63 defeat in Hanover at the hands of the Big Green (10-8, 1-1 Ivy), Harvard knew it had to lock down Dartmouth’s three-point shooters, and feed off of the home crowd at Lavietes Pavilion to avoid an 0-2 start to Ancient Eight play. A loss would drop the Crimson to the bottom of the Ivy League standings, and afford the Big Green its first sweep of Harvard since the 1998-1999 season.
But strong ball security, and clutch free-throw shooting down the stretch from Aiken helped the Crimson move to .500 on the young Ivy League season.
Despite the urgency present for Harvard entering Saturday’s contest, both teams got off to a slow start offensively, struggling to knock down shots with consistency. Despite holding a seven-point lead early in the half, the Crimson entered the intermission trailing 26-25, facing a crucial second-half test. Harvard struggled to corral Dartmouth’s freshman Taurus Samuels, who finished with a career-high 13 points for the Big Green.
“At halftime that we thought that the next 20 minutes could potentially have an impact to defining our season,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “Not that you want to put so much pressure on 20 minutes or one game, but certainly the position we're in…you felt there was a lot riding there.”
The junior guard was once again a focal point of Saturday’s contest, in his first home game in almost a year. The Randolph, N.J., native struggled through much of the first half, and finished with 14 points on just 4-of-14 shooting, but banked home a key basket and nailed four consecutive free-throws in the dying seconds to help secure the Harvard win. The return of the former Ivy League Rookie of the Year has helped the Crimson to two consecutive wins over Howard and Dartmouth. 
“It was a tough game, we had to grind one out,” Aiken said. “I just want to help in whatever way I can. It ultimately led to being more aggressive down the stretch. I took away the offense gave me my teammates trusted me to make plays and that's what I did.”
As clocked ticked down under three minutes at Lavietes Pavilion, #11 took over the game, like his teammates and coaches were accustomed to. Driving through contact, Aiken banked home a layup to give Harvard a 60-56 lead. Then, with the Crimson clinging to a one-point lead in the final 20 seconds, the junior was sent to the line for two consecutive 1-and-1 situations. After rattling the first free-throw home, Aiken’s next three swished through the hoop to seal an important win for Harvard.
“He can become that kind of player for us even in spurts or moments,” Amaker said. “His timing and he’s still rusty in different areas, but he has enough that it can certainly help our team and he showed that this afternoon.”
The ball security that the Crimson demonstrated throughout Saturday afternoon’s contest, was as big a story as any individual statistics. For the first time all season, Harvard committed fewer than 10 turnovers, only losing the ball nine times, and winning the turnover battle. Juniors Christian Juzang and Chris Lewis played crucial roles in anchoring the Crimson’s attack, finishing with 19 and 16 points respectively. Juzang chipped in five assists while turning the ball over only once, as Lewis secured eight rebounds to help the hosts to a 40-33 advanage on the glass.
“Letting it come in the flow of the game, not trying to force anything, I think that's when I’m at my best,” Juzang said. “Down the stretch of the game, just picking your pockets when making the play, giving to the ebb and flow of the game.”
The Tarzana, Calif., native has been one of Harvard’s steadiest players all season, and the return of Aiken has allowed Coach Amaker to play both guards together, creating a dynamic backcourt for the Crimson.
“Personally, me and Bryce have been talking about playing together in the backcourt since freshman year,” Juzang said. “To have him out there, playing off each other and creating plays is the most exciting thing ever.”
A much improved Harvard defense protected its home court Saturday afternoon, allowing 22 fewer points to Dartmouth than it had two weeks ago. Neutralizing the shooting of the country’s leading three-point shooter, Brendan Barry, was a testament to the team’s selfless and group-oriented defending. While the Big Green nailed three after three two weeks ago, Dartmouth failed to knock down a single triple in the final four and a half-minutes.
The Crimson will hope that a mini-win streak, and the return of Aiken, will help catalyze the team as the Ivy League season continues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night where the Crimson won its fifth consecutive game and its second straight against Dartmouth, the star of the show was none other than junior sharpshooter Katie Benzan. Leading the team with 22 points tonight, Benzan became just the 20th player in Harvard women’s basketball history to score 1000 career points.
The Wellesley, Mass. native came into Saturday night’s contest against the Big Green sitting at 991 career points, needing just three of her signature triples to convert to reach that mark. It took no more than two quarters for Benzan to do so, knocking down one from deep in the first stanza before converting on three more in the second quarter.
“1,000 has never been on my mind,” said Benzan. “I’ve always just focused on doing whatever the team needs me to do in order to win.”
Similar to her first two years donning the crimson, Benzan has been an indispensable offensive staple for coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s roster this season. She leads the team with just under 15 points a game and has shot 37 percent from beyond the arc on almost 10 attempts a game.
Benzan has been relentless in her effort on both ends of the court this season. She also leads the team with 1.7 steals per game averaging a team-high 35.3 minutes per game in 15 contests.
Benzan played an integral role in the Crimson’s 73-57 victory tonight giving them the offensive spark they needed in order to seize momentum on the road. Her shooting touch was on display early as Harvard started its scoring with a steal at half court that led to a deep triple by Benzan. The play was symbolic of the the team’s ability to capitalize on defensive plays and its strong shooting.
With a win on the road tonight, the Crimson continued their winning streak and currently sit at the top of the Ivy League. By beating Dartmouth both home and away, Harvard has shown its potential as a legit contender for the Ivy League title even with Penn and Princeton awaiting in mid-February. Benzan, as much as any player on the team, believes in the Crimson’s prospects to avenge its semifinal loss from last year and take home the chip.
“I think it’s a big statement to the league, that it’s a different Harvard, a stronger Harvard, one to worry about,” said Benzan. “These two wins are definitely confidence boosters because it’s tough to beat the same team twice in a row in a week. It’s also really nice the games weren’t nail-biters. That extra boost in our step helps so much going into next weekend and the following weekends.”
Harvard will have four more road games to play before returning to the comfortable confines of Lavietes Pavilion. Next weekend, the Crimson will travel south on the I-95 with contests at Yale and Brown and look to get one step closer to Ivy League glory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team saw its chance to nab a four-point weekend and hit the ice running. It took the Crimson just 1:34 to find twine against St. Lawrence, and the hosts scored two more goals in the next three minutes. And that was only the beginning of an offensive effort that powered Harvard to its first weekend sweep.
Seven different goal-scorers aided in the Crimson’s (10-6-3, 7-5-2 ECAC) resounding defeat of the Saints (3-20-1, 1-10-1), by a score of 7-3. The contest saw all three of Harvard’s goalies split time in net; at the other end of the ice, senior net-minder Arthur Brey was yanked after conceding three goals on four shots. All this came in co-captain Michael Floodstrand’s 100th appearance for the Crimson, and the senior forward also nabbed a tally for his efforts. The win comes with a valuable two points as the ECAC race grows ever tighter.
“Anytime you can win a game this time of year, you’re happy about it,” head coach Ted Donato said. “...We had a great week of practice and we’ve had a great weekend. Hopefully we can follow it up and keep going.”
St. Lawrence, already in last place in the ECAC before Saturday’s game, was further hobbled by the loss of a few players to injury. Harvard shot out of the gate to start the contest and didn’t let up its pressure, resulting in a first period in which the hosts outshot the visitors 14-3 despite being up by three goals. The first tally was courtesy of rookie forward Casey Dornbach, who fired low inside the blue line to beat Brey. Dornbach’s tally is just his fourth goal of the year, but he leads all freshmen in per-game points (1.16) and assists (0.95).
His classmate, defenseman Jack Rathbone, followed soon after, skating around a Saint and taking advantage of the partially screened goaltender. A minute later sophomore Jack Badini won a battle at the corner and tucked the puck to junior Nathan Krusko, who roofed it over Brey’s shoulder. That put an end to the net-minder’s night. Brey was replaced by rookie Emil Zetterquist (4.57 GAA, .879 SV%).
“It was pleasant surprise,” said Dornbach when asked about the team’s solid start. “We just came out and tried to play our game, play hard and get some pressure on early, and we were lucky to get a couple bounces.”
The quick pace — especially on the rush — continued for the Crimson to start the second period, and it wasn’t long before Harvard capitalized on its chances again. Frédéric Grégoire sped up the left wing, shooting into Zetterquist’s pads. The net-minder stopped his attempt, but the rebound found Floodstrand for the tap-in. Just 23 seconds later, junior blue-liner John Marino picked the top corner on a feed from co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage, bringing Harvard’s lead to 5-0.
The Crimson had been unsuccessful on its power play chance at the end of the first period, but with the momentum firmly in hand, the team was given another try as St. Lawrence rookie Andrew McIntyre was whistled for kneeing. It took only 13 seconds for the nation’s best man-advantage squad (35.9%) to find the back of the net. Junior Adam Fox teed up the shot for fellow defenseman Reilly Walsh, who then fired the puck from the right circle. Walsh’s goal is his second of the weekend after a scoreless spell. For his part, Fox’s two assists put him back atop the country’s blue-liners in points per game (1.42) and assists per game (1.05).
With the safety of the six-goal margin, senior goaltender Michael Lackey was given a rest in favor of junior Cam Gornet. Lackey finished the night with a spotless record, having turned away all nine shots he faced. Gornet would end up playing 26:29, with the remaining few minutes given to rookie Derek Schaedig.
“Michael Lackey has continued to get better and better for us throughout the year, and has given our team a lot of confidence,” coach Donato said. “It was a chance to give him a break; we have important games coming up…. Nice chance to get some other guys some time.”
If Harvard had hoped to escape the game unscathed, that was not to be. Early in the third period, rookie Wyllum Deveaux took a trip to the penalty box on a five-minute boarding major. The Saints scored not once but twice on the ensuing power play courtesy of rookie linemates Zach Risteau and Kaden Pickering. Deveaux got one back at the very end of the third period on another power play; a last-minute St. Lawrence tally from sophomore Eddie Pavlini was too little, too late.
The victory rounds up the Crimson’s first weekend sweep of the season. The four points could not have come at a better time — Saturday’s win boosts the team to second place in the ECAC, tied with No. 10/9 Clarkson. Only one point separates Harvard from the teams tied for first place. The Crimson has played more games than the other top three squads, but that difference will be made up when Harvard shifts its focus to the Beanpot in February and skates in fewer conference matchups.
All in all, the team can look back at this weekend as a success: solid performances in net, 40 percent efficiency on the power play, and goals from multiple contributors. Of course, carrying that forward will be essential for the Crimson’s second-half run.
“We knew coming into the year that we were going to be a second half team,” Floodstrand said. “We have so much young talent, especially those guys up front, a couple guys on the back end as well…. We’ve just got to keep rolling in practice.”

Shopping week is a time to explore Harvard’s extensive course offerings, but as it turns out, you don’t have to stop at Harvard. Whether you are just curious at the prospect or want to be able to say you went to both Harvard and MIT, MIT Cross-Registration is for you! Be sure to check out these unparalleled, fun courses just down Mass Ave:
MIT 6.00: Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python
If you missed the CS50 bandwagon in the fall, catch MIT’s version, offered in both the spring and the fall. “Python and the practical approach of the course made it easy to learn coding,” says Michael Gritzbach ’18. Although this course has a steep learning curve, some students prefer a more in-depth approach to one language over CS50’s six.
MIT 21G.012: Exploring Globalization through Chinese Food
Explore global developments in migration and transnational business through the lens of Chinese food. The class’s main project is maintaining a blog, so record your findings by perusing cookbooks, taking a walking tour of Boston’s Chinatown, and concluding the semester with an authentic Chinese cooking workshop!
MIT 2.00B: Toy Product Design
Get a chance to work the MIT Mechanical Engineering Department’s fun toy design lab! After learning the theory behind what makes a toy click, you can design, construct and market a toy in groups. Give playsentations (play presentation) iat the end of the term! Embrace your inner child, and remember that it doesn’t have to be plastic to be a toy.
MIT 6.163: Strobe Project Laboratory
Use high-speed cameras to capture some of the coolest videos you’ll ever see in your life. The goal of this class is to “learn the application of electronic flash sources to measurement and photography.” Though you’ll need the equivalent of MIT’s Physics II as a prerequisite, being in this laboratory is bound to be worth it.
MIT 12.011: Archeological Science
This one-semester course at MIT considers the ecology at various stages in prehistory, man-nature interactions, and case studies on ancient technologies. This course is open to students at many Boston universities.
Even if you’re already sMITten, there are a few keep in mind when cross-registering:
Be ready before the earlier registration deadline and Add/Drop date (This year, it’s February 1 and February 11).
Going to office hours every day for extra help may not be an option since MIT is even farther away than the quad (a shocker, we know).
Think twice about cross-registering during senior spring. Since MIT’s term ends after Harvard’s, grades may not be available in time for graduation.
If you need to drop a class, be sure to follow Harvard’s procedures (Harvard will inform MIT).
