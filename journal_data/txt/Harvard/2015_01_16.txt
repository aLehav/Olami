After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School professor emeritus Paul A. Vatter, remembered by his former colleagues as a gifted teacher to both his students and coworkers over his nearly 40-year career at the Business School, died Jan. 4 after a decade-long battle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 90.
Vatter, who taught a managerial economics course that centered on statistical analysis and decision-making while at Harvard, is best remembered for explaining challenging concepts in an understandable and engaging way.
“He was the department’s best teacher and was the only one able to teach our material to executives with any success,” said Business School professor David E. Bell.
After earning a master’s degree and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 and 1954, respectively, Vatter joined Penn’s department of economic and social statistics. Once he arrived Harvard in 1958, he served as an assistant dean of the Business School until 1962, chaired its doctoral program from 1967 to 1970, and directed executive education and corporate relations from 1987 to 1988. He retired in 1995.
Colleagues and students affirmed the impact Vatter made in his administrative and professorial roles. Business administration professor emeritus Steven C. Wheelwright recalled that as a new faculty member, he would sit in on Vatter’s classes to learn his teaching methods.
“Paul was always happy and positive and clearly loved teaching and the work he was doing with faculty and students,” Wheelwright said.
Although Vatter held numerous leadership positions, Bell said that Vatter’s friendliness and generosity led him to consider Vatter a friend despite their 25-year age difference.
“He was always approachable, always had a smile on his face, always willing to have a chat,” Bell said.
Wheelwright echoed the sentiment that Vatter consistently offered assistance to students and faculty regardless of his own workload.
“Paul was always willing to take on additional assignments and go the extra mile whenever it was needed,” Wheelwright said.
Vatter is survived by his daughter, Katherine Foucault of Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, and five grandchildren, according to the Business School website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kennedy School of Government’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy announced on Tuesday the six recipients of its Shorenstein Fellowship who will join the center for the spring semester, among them a radio host and a New York Times reporter.
The four Joan Shorenstein Fellows—former Center for Public Integrity executive director William E. Buzenberg, New York Times national correspondent Jackie Calmes, NPR host Michele Norris, and philosopher David Weinberger—will research and write a paper on a media- or policy-related issue. They will be joined by the two first Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellows, former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra and former U.S. deputy CTO Nick Sinai ’98.
Joan Shorenstein Fellows are chosen in a “highly selective” application process, whereas the Walter Shorenstein Fellows are selected by invitation, according to the center’s fellowship program manager, Katie Miles.
A former fellow at the Institute of Politics, Buzenberg said he will explore digital-era journalistic collaboration during his time at Harvard, drawing from past experiences at NPR and CPI. He highlighted the pooling of journalistic resources both nationally and internationally as “the new way journalism works,” a modern way for the media to mount massive investigations.
Calmes said that she will focus on the power of partisan media during her fellowship, particularly among conservatives.
“I’m intrigued by the extent to which the conservative media...are able to assess and define the agenda for Republicans here in Washington so much more so than the mainstream media ever has done for either party in power in my time,” she said. She pointed to the unexpected opposition to John Boehner’s re-election as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives as an example of the influence of talk show hosts and conservative pundits.
Sinai and Norris will also each lead their own study groups at the Shorenstein Center. Sinai wrote in an email that he intends to “research, write, and speak on the idea of data as public infrastructure” with former colleague Chopra, covering in particular the technology and innovation of the Obama Administration in his study group.
Norris said she will examine “how shifts in race and cultural identity influence politics and policy and pop culture,” using her work on “The Race Card Project,” a website that aims to foster dialogue about race through user-submitted six-word essays, as “both a mirror and a window” for the study group.
The fellows also expressed a general excitement for the change of pace and collaboration that will take place on Harvard’s campus in the spring.
“There’s always something left in your notebook,” Norris said. “And so it’s a really good opportunity to just take a step back and dive in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a humbling loss to archrival Yale, the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (10-2-2, 6-1-2 ECAC) will look to rebound as it resumes conference play at the Bright-Landry Center this weekend against Clarkson and St. Lawrence.
The Stakes at Hand
While Harvard sits in second place in the ECAC, Clarkson (7-10-4, 4-3-2) and St. Lawrence (9-10-2, 5-4-0) lurk closely behind, as both squads are tied for fourth place in the conference. While the Crimson cannot surpass No. 12/12 Quinnipiac this weekend to move into first, the team is in danger of sliding down if it doesn’t come away from the weekend with at least one point.
The game also marks only the second time this year in which Harvard is coming off a loss. The Crimson won, 2-0, against Dartmouth, which ranks 10th in the ECAC, after the squad’s first loss to Yale on the year. This time, the task could be harder against a team with a realistic shot at earning a bye in the conference tournament.
Rediscovering Harvard’s Offensive Prowess
Harvard’s one goal output against the Bulldogs at Madison Square Garden was not indicative of the success the team has had on the year. In its last four conference games, the squad has averaged just under five goals per game.
The Crimson boasts two of the top ten goal scorers in the conference. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey finds himself tied for second with 11 goals on the year, despite having played seven fewer games than the other two players who have notched the same total. Sophomore forward Tyler Moy’s seven goals on the season has him tied for 10th in the conference.
Golden Knights’ Lost Momentum
After earning seven points in four straight ECAC games, Clarkson has dropped its last two conference tilts against Cornell and Colgate. In those two games, the Golden Knights found the back of the net only once after averaging more than two goals per game during their aforementioned four-game unbeaten streak.
But the team’s defense has played strong over those past six conference games, as the defensive unit led by sophomore goaltender Ville Runola has conceded an average of just over a goal per game.
Balanced Saints Attack
While Harvard has four of the 16 leading point scorers in the conference, St. Lawrence has to rely on a whole team effort, lacking a top-20 point scorer on its roster. The Saints’ leading point-getter, junior forward Brian Ward, is tied for 23rd in the ECAC. But despite the lack of superstar offensive players, St. Lawrence has managed to put up an average of 2.76 goals per game, good for fifth in the conference.
Stopping the offense isn’t the only adversity that faces the Crimson. St. Lawrence is anchored by freshman Kyle Hayton between the pipes, who owns the league’s third best save percentage of .934.
