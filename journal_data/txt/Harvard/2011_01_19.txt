After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This admissions cycle, Harvard received a record-breaking number of applications: nearly 35,000, a 15 percent increase from last year. Applications from Southern states, Midwestern states, Mountain states, and the Pacific region, and abroad are up, accompanied by increases in the number of Black and Latino student applicants. We are encouraged by this increase in applications, particularly because it includes a higher number of applicants from underrepresented geographic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
The diversity in the applicant pool reflects the successful outreach effort on behalf of the College, which we applaud. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 credited part of increase to the growing awareness of Harvard’s financial aid program, which has become even more attractive to many during the recent economic downturn. Some have also credited the University’s efforts to develop the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences for attracting more students to this particular school. In addition, the ongoing efforts of the Harvard Financial Aid Initaitive, Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, and targeted high school visits also likely contributed to the increased size of the applicant pool. These programs reflect a robust and strong commitment to continue to inform underrepresented students of the opportunities Harvard has to offer and which are available to them regardless of financial need.
We value geographic, racial, socioeconomic, and other types of diversity because they create a better campus climate, with more informed and socially conscious students. Discussions around the section table and in dining halls are more satisfying when they are truly contentious and include differing opinions, backed by a variety of real-world experiences. As long as this more diverse applicant pool actually translates into a more diverse incoming class, the Class of 2015 promises to be the best yet in this regard.
Socioeconomic diversity especially is welcome, because students from low socioeconomic backgrounds benefit the most from a Harvard education. The experience of a Harvard education is most distant from that which these students would have experienced, had they not gone to Harvard. Harvard exists, at least to some extent, to provide for the public good in ways like this.
However, the increase in applicants is not entirely positive. Despite the fact that applications have increased by more than 50 percent over the past four years, Fitzsimmons says the size of the freshman class will remain the same. This is good, in that it guarantees that the class of 2015 will receive the same high quality education as classes before them. Yet, this also means that the acceptance rate is likely to plummet.
One must pause to wonder what a Harvard with a six percent acceptance rate would look like. Further, as competitive institutions become more competitive, applicants are incentivized to apply to more schools in order to be assured acceptance into any. This makes the applications process even more stressful and demanding on high school students than it already is. That the number of students applying to seven or more colleges has doubled from 1999 to 2009 is only an example of this vicious circle.
Regardless, the benefits of an increased applicant pool outweigh the negatives. The benefits of diversity in our undergraduate student body are many and diffuse, and we are all enriched by the presence of truly different opinions and backgrounds in our academic and personal lives at the College.

I have a weakness for Double Stuff Oreos. Whenever I eat one, my worries are swept away in a sea of sugar. Nonetheless, each time I prepare to dive into a pack of Oreos to escape a particularly abysmal workload, the number of calories in a single Oreo stops me in my tracks.
Similar to the Boston winter, the “freshman fifteen”—so named for the number of pounds a freshman usually gains during their first year of college—strikes when least expected, despite multiple warnings from friends. Although a night of stress-eating Oreos might cause a higher-than-expected scale reading, this weight gain should not alarm anyone. The freshman fifteen should be embraced and controlled, not feared. Rather than indicating a truly dangerous weight gain, it represents a sign of emerging responsibility in fledgling adults.
Unsurprisingly, college creates a perfect environment for adding pounds. Nearly every student organization promises tasty yet unhealthy food as an incentive to attend their events. The dining halls neither limit the amount of times you can swipe nor the amount of food you can eat. Late-night snack runs and skewed sleep schedules only augment the problem. Because many students come from backgrounds where they were not in charge of their diet, they are ill-prepared to handle the flood of options crowding their plate.
The increased freedom in dietary choices and time management opens wholly unexplored windows. When freshmen navigate the complex labyrinth between sleep, schoolwork, and extracurricular activities, food becomes fuel as nutritional concerns are often left by the wayside. Likewise, although students walk significant distances to get to and from class, cardio-respiratory athletics—activities of which many partook in high school—are forgotten or deemed less important. Freshmen eat and exercise less consciously and gain weight as a result.
The freshman fifteen—sometimes more honestly renamed the freshman five—embodies these liberties. Combating this weight gain requires active assumption of responsibility. Yes, the frozen yogurt in Annenberg is convenient, but that doesn’t mean six visits per meal are necessary. Because a standard deviation of five pounds is unlikely to tip someone into obesity, the concern at hand here is how to deal with the added weight of freedom, not how to regain one’s lost health.
For most people, college represents the first time attempting to take charge of their lives. In this process, the freshman fifteen is both collateral damage and a tangible indication of increased responsibility. In the end, go ahead and eat that Double Stuff Oreo. Go to Falafel Corner at two a.m. when the munchies hit you. The helpful freshman fifteen opens your eyes to the flip side of every decision and the trade-off of every bite.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To inaugurate the 112th Congress, Republicans reintroduced liberals to something they seem to have long ago forgotten: the Constitution.
Liberals responded in predictable fashion by accusing conservatives of having a “fetish” for the Constitution. One Time columnist wrote a piece entitled “The Cult of the Constitution” and Salon attributed Tea Party constitutionalism to “neo-Confederate ideology.”
But the reading was a much needed, if perhaps superficial, reminder that Congress does not wield unlimited power. Far from it, the Constitution granted Congress a finite list of enumerated powers. And therein lies liberals’ inherent animus towards the document: It limits what good they can inflict through Congress.
To liberals, government is capable of perfecting society (or coming close). Whereas conservatives see in the Constitution a necessary constraint on inherently selfish and limited human beings, liberals see an obstacle to the nation’s brightest decreeing the end of injustice in America.
The problem for liberals, however, is that Americans, both in 1787 and 2011, deeply distrust unrestrained central government. We fought a war over being governed without our consent.  So Americans created a national government to handle defined national affairs. Its power would grow only when three quarters of the people’s representatives agreed to an amendment.
The result was that the federal government created by the Constitutional Convention was a very limited one. The powers of Congress, for example, are specified in Article I Section 8, and they do not include many liberal schemes, such as enforcing workplace diversity requirements or cap-and-trade. All other powers are reserved the states and the people.
Alas, liberals found a way around the pesky Constitution. Congress and the Supreme Court have stretched the interpretation of “interstate commerce” so far as to cover virtually any action undertaken anywhere in the U.S., and if Obamacare’s individual health insurance mandate survives the Supreme Court, “interstate commerce” will now extend even to inaction in the health insurance market. If Congress can force a citizen to buy a product from a private company, what can’t it do?
The Constitution has become so irrelevant to liberals that when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked, regarding Obamacare, where in the document Congress is granted the power to force people to buy health insurance, she asked incredulously, “Are you serious? Are you serious?”
Whenever confronted about the constitutionality of their proposals, liberals also reflexively point to the general welfare clause.
James Madison addressed this very argument in The Federalist Number 41: "Some . . . have grounded a very fierce attack against the Constitution, on the language in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed, that the [Constitution's] power . . . ‘to provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States,’ amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare.”
Sound familiar, Nancy?
What follows is a statement that tears the Constitutionality of many of Congress’s laws of the past century to shreds.
"Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution than the general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection might have had some color for it . . . But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?"
There you have it. The general welfare clause was not, as liberals believe, a carte blanche for the federal government to do anything proclaimed to be good for the country. It was a general term alluding to specific objects: the enumerated powers. The other oft-cited “necessary and proper” clause permits Congress to make all laws necessary to carry out these powers, no more.
Admittedly, the federal government has done significant good through its extra-constitutional activity (Social Security, Americans with Disabilities Act, etc.), but because both Republicans and Democrats impatiently bypassed the amendment process to expedite popular proposals, and the Supreme Court abetted the mischief, Congress now has the ominous “unlimited commission” to do anything allegedly good for us. If an idea truly is good for Americans, it should not be difficult to get three-quarters of them to agree.
Liberal accusations of conservative “fetishism” of the Constitution and the Founders expose their fundamental misunderstanding of why conservatives have rallied around the document. Few conservatives believe the Constitution was perfect in 1787 or that the Founders were demigods. They do believe the power of the federal government should only be increased by the people’s consent through the proper channel the people agreed on: the amendment process.
Few of the framers thought a Bill of Rights was necessary to include in the Constitution, for, as Alexander Hamilton phrased it in the Federalist Number 84, “Why declare things should not be done which there is no power to do?” If only the Founders knew how badly the Constitution would be interpreted.
What conservatives are expressing when they wave pocket Constitutions in air is their indignation that the principle of limited government in the U.S. has been so disrespected, endangering our freedom. They see a government that long ago grew beyond the boundaries the people had given to it, a government that no longer draws its power from the people by their consent, but from itself, through its own successive misinterpretations of the Constitution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a time when the raising of tuition fees is forcing many students to consider outrageous lives in American universities, Prince William and his future wife have saved British higher education by proving to the world’s middle-class social climbers that they can actually achieve something at university—a royal marriage.
Ah, the engagement of Wills and Kate.
It’s no surprise that the youth of our era have nicknamed Prince Charles’s eldest son—Prince William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor—“Wills,” after the spectacularly British Jack Wills, a clothing brand one uses to not-so-subtly add the “crumpets” to one’s tea and crumpets, or the “boarding” to one’s school.
The fact of the matter is that kids these days, or, to be more specific, Cambridge undergraduates, don’t see the forthcoming marriage as the drama-fuelled fairytale of William’s parents, Charles and Diana, whose wedding drew in one of the biggest television audiences of all time. Perhaps this is because there is no Queen forcing a union of feigned love; perhaps it’s because of the relaxed jokes and laughter of this new, fresh couple (“I'm extremely funny and she loves that,” William quipped in a Telegraph interview last November).
This is a story of real love, unopposed and uncontroversial. It’s a fantasy rather than a drama, and the lack of controversy involved is driving the world’s press into a crazy stupor. Minutiae about April 29th, the day of the impending nuptials, are making front-page headlines; the smiling face of Kate Middleton and that blue Issa dress are becoming as ubiquitous as the tabloids worshipping them.
Such obsession is rampant in Cambridge, a world where social climbing seems to play a stronger role than in other educational institutions. Not social climbing in the sense of the typical quest for the “coolest” or the most fashionable. Over here in Merry Olde England, you see, what makes someone worthy of having desperate grovellers clinging to their every inch of skin is little more than their background. The important questions: Who went to school where, who knows which member of the Royal family by name, and who spent this past New Years’ Eve in Kensington Palace (because Buckingham is generally too unrealistic and not quite alternative enough)?
Such an attitude is strongly encouraged by the backdrop of 800-year-old buildings and cyclists on their way to dinners, dressed in heavy black gowns that wrestle with the wind. In a world where people point to arched Gothic windows and claim that their great-grandfathers went here, it’s almost impossible to avoid competitive discussions about one’s family history.
In England, where most exchanges are shaped by forced pleasantries surrounding the pressing issue of the weather, the Prince’s engagement provides a topic for real conversation and, in a sense, a template for aspiration. One would be denying brute fact if  she were to assert that discussion about these two St Andrew’s graduates didn’t form the forefront of debates during Cambridge dinners, which are held in halls once eaten in by the groom’s royal ancestors. One would also be lying out of her teeth if advantageous girls didn’t look to the Pitt or Bullingdon Clubs (Oxbridge societies of public school-educated young gentlemen) in desperate search of a potential aristocratic husband. After all, William and Kate met in such hallowed University halls, in the same sort of place where we all scramble to find dates to the annual white tie balls. Why, then, can’t some other young, underwear-modelling student find her prince there, too?
What’s ironic, however, is that this isn’t really as much a story of social climbing as is often supposed. That the media presents it as such suggests not only a misconception of reality but an obsession with class transgression. Kate attended Malborough College, a prestigious boarding school set in the charmed Old England of Wiltshire. It’s the same establishment that Eugenie, the Prince’s first cousin, attended—a world where girls never drop the plums from their mouths, and boys regard polo as an average afterschool activity. Yes, definitely shocking social movement here.
One can, of course, give slight credit to the judgemental hype—Middleton’s family is one of new money, not old. She didn’t necessarily have the titled ancestors smoking aristocratic pipes out of their Oxbridge windows or a hundred-year-old family estate. Her family fortune and standing are recent developments, and her parents played with their new-found wealth by sending their daughter into a world of grandeur and inbreeding. She may not be a pedigree, but she’s certainly always been a valued and deserving contender in the same dog show, to continue the analogy. But what would the story be if the future princess were to come from a “more appropriate” class?
People look to the story of Kate and William as one of hope and endless potential. Becoming a princess is the quintessential dream of every Barbie-doll childhood, an aspiration cruelly reserved to those of the most exclusive upper-class circles. But this love, however, suggests a revision to that age-old maxim of royals marrying royals.
A (wealthy, well-educated, socio-economically advanced) girl can always find her prince (at a prestigious, exclusive university).

To the extent that a worm smaller than a pinhead has a mind, Harvard scientists working at the intersection of neurobiology, computer science, physics, and optogenetics have shown that they are capable of controlling it.
A study published Sunday in Nature Methods revealed that with the use of newly designed software and precise laser technology a team, including researchers at Harvard’s Center for Brain Science, successfully induced Caenorhabditis elegans worms to perform activities such as reversing direction, changing speeds, and laying eggs.
The researchers controlled a worm’s behavior by shining a laser on specific neurons. Depending on which neuron was targeted by the laser, the worm would perform a different action.
For years, scientists have been able to observe neurons one at a time, but an understanding of how neurons work together has proved elusive.
“Up until now most experiments had to be done on immobilized worms,” said study co-author Andrew M. Leifer, a researcher in the laboratory of physics professor Aravinthan D.T. Samuel ’93.
In pursuit of a deeper understanding of neural circuits, Leifer and others began work on what they called the CoLBeRT system—Controlling Locomotion and Behavior in Real Time. The “MindControl” software Leifer developed directs light with such speed and precision that it can activate or inhibit specific neurons in a moving C. elegans worm—allowing scientists to observe the worm’s subsequent behavior.
“This is an exciting tool because it potentially allows us to go in and poke around inside the nervous system of a living organism,” Leifer said.
Joshua R. Sanes, director of the Center for Brain Science, described an understanding of the relationship between neural circuits and behavior as a “holy grail,” which could connect neurobiology and psychology.
The C. elegans worm is an ideal subject, Leifer noted, because it is transparent, easy to manipulate genetically, and has only 302 neurons. By comparison, humans have about 100 billion neurons.
In the near future, Leifer plans to explore decision-making and primitive types of learning in C. elegans.
“A basic understanding of neural circuits in simpler creatures like worms and flies may eventually help us understand the human brain,” wrote Christopher M. Fang-Yen, another author of the study who is now a bioengineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, in an e-mail.
Assistant Professor of Chemistry, Chemical Biology, and Physics Adam E. Cohen said his lab is interested in developing optical tools to watch an impulse propagate, and that he hopes to couple the CoLBeRT technology with his own in order to work out exactly how circuits function.
“The ability to stimulate nerves is an amazing capability, but the only way to observe the effect is behavior—we’d like to know what’s going on at all those intermediate levels,” he said.
Leifer cautioned against interpreting the name of his software (MindControl) too literally—the technology only works on animals that are transparent and very small, so “there’s no need to wear a tin foil hat,” he joked.

Economics Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff received further recognition for his best-selling analysis of financial crises in early January when he was awarded the fifteenth annual TIAA-CREF Paul A. Samuelson Award for Outstanding Scholarly Writing on Lifelong Financial Security.
He won for his 2009 book, “This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.”
Rogoff shares the award with his co-author, Carmen M. Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington D.C. Their book, published in the wake of the financial crisis, identifies similarities among a variety of financial crises through the ages.
“The whole (ironic) ‘This Time of Different’ theme speaks to how so often in the run-up to a crisis, everyone is convinced that financial crashes only happen to other people at other times in other places,” Rogoff, who is on leave for the current academic leave, wrote in an e-mail.
“Importantly, we aimed to write a book that was quantitative and not simply qualitative. We worked on the book for almost seven years. We were certainly inspired by the 1963 book by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwarz, ‘A Monetary History of the United States,’” Rogoff wrote.
“Ken and Carmen take the global financial crisis, that to some appeared to be an incomprehensible novelty, and show how we can understand it as a particularly widespread example of an established historical phenomenon,” wrote Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell.
Campbell, who himself received the award in 2002, congratulated his colleague.
“I have been proud to win this award in the past, and am delighted that Ken Rogoff won this year with such an important book,” Campbell added.
The award, named after economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul A. Samuelson, is given annually “in recognition of an outstanding research publication containing ideas that the public and private sectors can use to maintain and improve America’s lifelong financial well being,” according to a TIAA-CREF press release. A $10,000 prize is awarded to the winner.
“Reinhart’s and Rogoff’s fascinating book provides realistic tools for future prevention of societal financial crises through the identification of critical recurring precipitating events,” Stephanie Bell-Rose, head of the TIAA-CREF Institute, wrote in the press release.
“This year’s winning book provides a vivid reminder about the lessons of history
“It is a great honor,” Rogoff wrote. “I was also happy because I took a class from Paul Samuelson back in graduate school, and benefited from occasional comments, ideas and thoughts he sent me over the years,” Rogoff wrote in an e-mail. “He is widely regarded as one of the greatest economists who ever lived.”

At 5’2”—and with a newly minted Harvard diploma in hand—Loren Galler Rabinowitz ’10 isn’t the typical beauty queen. Galler Rabinowitz is one of those Harvard grads with an anxiety inducing resume—she is a former star figure skater and a classical pianist. She wrote a book of poetry as her senior thesis and has plans to attend medical school. Add to that her most recent title—Miss Massachusetts 2010.
Though she did not make it past the semi-finals, Galler Rabinowitz took to the stage at the national Miss America Pageant in Las Vegas last Saturday.
Crowned Miss Massachusetts 2010 last June, she joined 52 women from all fifty states—and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—to compete for the national title.
Galler Rabinowitz is relatively new to the world of posing in swimsuits and evening gowns—the former English concentrator entered her first pageant last spring when she discovered that the Miss America Organization is one of the world’s largest providers of academic scholarships to women. But she is far from a stranger to the spotlight.
As a competitive figure skater, Galler Rabinowitz placed fourth at the 2003 World Junior Championships and third at the 2004 US Senior Championships with her ice dancing partner David Mitchell. She kept skating during her time at the College, giving lessons and skating in exhibitions for charity. She also volunteered at Mount Auburn Hospital, tutored students, and wrote a book of poems for her senior thesis.
“We knew her well in Adams House. She was one of those people who had what you would consider an unbelievable resume. You look at what she did and think ‘Oh no, this isn’t possible,’” said John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, co-master of Adams House where she lived as an upperclassman at Harvard.
Galler Rabinowitz said she wants to be a pediatrician and raised nearly $24,000—more than any other Miss America contestant—for the Children’s Hospital in Blades & Balloons, a charity figure skating show and silent auction that she organized in November at the Skating Club of Boston. That won her the Miracle Maker Award, a $5000 academic scholarship, at the Miss America Pageant last weekend.
“Blades & Balloons was a real highlight for me as Miss Massachusetts,” Galler Rabinowitz wrote in an e-mail. “My job as Miss Massachusetts is not simply to be a leader in rhetoric, but to lead by example. In organizing Blades & Balloons, I was able to rally the support of nearly fifty individuals, all of whom, in addition to their volunteer duties that night, served as role models to me.”
But after winning the state pageant, Galler Rabinowitz has herself become a role model.
“As Miss Massachusetts, you’re in a position where so many people look up to you—all these kids out there that can be so inspired,” said Danielle Galler Rabinowitz ’14, Galler Rabinowitz’s younger sister.
And in her role as Miss Massachusetts, Galler Rabinowitz has reached out to children in need, throwing, for example, a princess tea party for thirty cancer patients from Children’s Hospital.
“One girl, wearing a pink tiara, pulled on my gown and said that she knew I was a real princess because I made her feel like one, and that when her hair grew back, she hoped it would be just like mine,” Galler Rabinowitz wrote. “That moment truly affirmed my desire to enter pediatrics.”
But for someone who has been wildly successful at more or less everything she has tried, she still has that ability to connect.
“She talks more about things she hasn’t been successful at. That really resonates with people, especially teenagers. One of the things that I think surprises people about Loren and especially the fact that she comes from Harvard is how approachable she is,” Brett M. Kalikow ’09 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has often had a distant—and contested—relationship with the neighboring community in Allston, but on Monday, 16 students participating in a service project at the Institute of Politics crossed the Charles to spruce up a reading room at the Gardner Pilot Academy.
After touring the school and meeting its administrators, students cleared out a cluttered basement storage space—which had not been cleaned in 12 years according to IOP President and event organizer Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12. Participants decorated some of this new found space with a lively rug and books along the shelves.
Several participants said that the IOP’s community service event and the following discussion with Harvard’s Senior Director of Community Relations, Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, gave them greater insight into the relationship between the University and Allston.
“I’d heard about Harvard’s expansion into Allston of course, but this event put a face to the neighborhood,” said Peter M. Bozzo ’12, a member of The Crimson’s editorial board. “We got to see the surrounding community—which is right across the river—but I hadn’t ever been.”
Following the halt of construction on the Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009, the University has embarked on a series of community projects to mitigate the consequences of putting the development on hold, including the construction of an ice skating rink and mini golf course.
Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Christine M. Heenan noted that the event highlighted the University’s relationship with the Allston community in addition to Harvard students’ dedication to public service.
“The IOP students’ time at the Gardner Pilot Academy on MLK Day is their second such service effort this year and reflects both the commitment and public spiritedness of our amazing students and Harvard’s commitment to the GPA and to the community,” Heenan wrote in an e-mail. “Service is key to the mission of the IOP, and Allston is key to the University, so the connection is natural.”
The service day at the GPA was the product of the IOP’s previous involvement with the school. In December, the IOP along with the Harvard Democrats, International Relations Council, and several other campus groups organized a carnival for 350 GPA students.
Harvard has also collaborated with the GPA through the Harvard Education Portal, a resource center at which Harvard undergraduates have mentored several GPA students, and the Harvard Achievement Support Initiative, which offers funding and professional development to Boston schools and students.
Solnet said that the community service project, which drew long-time IOP members as well as newcomers to the organization, fulfilled the purpose of the Optional Winter Activities Week—to allow students to explore extracurricular organizations they have not found time for during the semester.
“This event emphasized the dual mission of the IOP and its commitment to both politics and public service,” Solnet added. “And there’s no better time to help the community than MLK day.”

Thomas G. Cavanagh ’05—a star ice hockey player during his time at Harvard who went on to play for the San Jose Sharks in the National Hockey League—died on Jan. 6. He was 28.
Growing up in a family of hockey players, Cavanagh, whose father and uncle both played for the Crimson, saw the most professional success in the sport of anyone in his family, playing 138 games during his four-year Harvard career and scoring 117 points.
“I always thought of Tommy as being very stoic and determined and someone I had complete confidence in—in trying the best at whatever he did,” said Joseph V. Cavanagh Jr. ’71, Cavanagh’s father.
During his senior year at Harvard, Cavanagh tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during practice.
But Cavanagh, a team captain, played 19 more games before finishing his college career that year.
“It’s playable,” Cavanagh said at the time. “Players have played with it. You can play hockey with a torn ACL.”
“He had a tolerance for pain,” his father said. “He was a very quiet boy, so no one would really know what was going on. No one understood the extent of his injury.”
He added that his son had been suffering from mental illness at the time of his death.
Throughout his time at Harvard, Cavanagh was viewed as a role model for his teammates.
He was always top five in points scored every season, according to Harvard teammate Timothy D. Pettit ’04, but Cavanagh never let the accolades go to his head.
“He was more of a silent leader, but on the team everyone knew how talented he was,” Pettit said, adding that Cavanagh had an admirable work ethic.
Those who knew him spoke repeatedly of Cavanagh’s dedication to the sport and commitment to being a team member.
“He was one of my favorite players I have ever been around in any facet of hockey, whether playing or coaching,” Ted Donato ’91, the current Harvard men’s hockey coach who coached Cavanagh for part of his Harvard career, told The Providence Journal. “He was just a very unselfish, hard-working team guy who played his best in big games.”
But Pettit also said he remembers the funny friend that Cavanagh was off the ice—once you got to know him.
“He would always have something funny to say that was never malicious,” Pettit said. “Everyone on the team always saw him as a good brother.”
Cavanagh is survived by his parents and eight siblings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team took down George Washington last Saturday, 67-62, with its top two scorers ailing on the bench. Thankfully for the Crimson, it looks like junior co-captain Keith Wright and sophomore forward Christian Webster will not remain on the sideline for too long.
“We’re hopeful for Saturday,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of each player’s return. “Right now, they both are going through the process of getting treatment and trying to rehab their injuries.”
After Webster scored eight points in 14 minutes in a homecoming of sorts (his father played for George Washington in the 1980s), the D.C. native took a shot to the hip that left him immobile. The injury, which is being described as a hip pointer, kept him out of the remainder of the contest.
Wright, who is averaging a team-best 14.5 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, was also banged up in Saturday’s contest. After a blow to the ribcage, the big man experienced trouble breathing and missed the final 15 minutes of the game.
“They’ve been out of practice thus far,” Amaker said. “[But] we’re hopeful that they’ll be able to play.”
The bigger concern for the Crimson might be one of the heroes from Saturday’s win: freshman Laurent Rivard. Though the forward mustered 16 points in the second half, he was battling an ankle injury that has relegated him to a walking boot off the court.
“He’s had an ankle and an Achilles issue all year,” Amaker said. “The only thing that’s going to be able to allow it to heal is to take complete time off.”
Given Rivard’s increasingly important role as a sixth man on the Crimson (the freshman has reached double figures in eight of his last 10 games), the possibility of a break is remote.
“He’s been nursing it all the way through,” Amaker said. “He’s a tough kid. He’s been able to play through pain, and we anticipate he’ll continue to do it.”

Carol Moseley Braun, whose career includes a term in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois and a stint as U.S. ambassador to New Zealand, clearly has an impressive record of achievement behind her.
One accomplishment that she can't claim, however, is having graduated with a degree from Harvard. Be that as it may, Braun did just that in a radio interview on a Chicago radio station last Wednesday, but Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune quickly caught the glitch.
Braun, currently a candidate in Chicago's mayoral election, was speaking about the city's finances before changing the topic to education and saying:
"I'm a product of the Chicago Public Schools. I walked to school in the neighborhood in which I lived. I got a quality education that took me on to a law degree from the University of Chicago and advanced degrees from Harvard."
To make matters worse, later in the show a caller remarked that Braun's achievements impressed him, specifically citing her claim that she "went to Harvard." Braun let the comment pass without clarification.
Though she never received a Harvard degree, Braun does at least have some connection to Harvard. She was a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics in 2007.
Braun’s campaign later issued a statement saying Braun "misspoke."

CORRECTION: JANUARY 20, 2010
An earlier version of the Jan. 19 Flyby post "Braun Falsely Claims Harvard Degree" misquoted Braun as having claimed to have "an advanced degree from Harvard." In fact, Braun said that she had "advanced degrees from Harvard."
