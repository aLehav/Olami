After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The titular track off Cut Copy’s “Free Your Mind” opens with a lilting electronic beat and an odd voice urging the listener to “free your mind.” The song quickly takes off into a wild and psychedelic high of energy, techno hooks, and vocals reminiscent of ’80s pop music—a high that the album never manages to come down from.
After surfacing in 2004 with its debut album “Bright Like Neon Love,” the Australian band Cut Copy established itself as a popular indie electronic group. “Free Your Mind” is the band’s much-anticipated fourth album, following the Grammy-nominated hit “Zonoscope.”
This latest album is a complete departure from Cut Copy’s previous releases, enough so that it is difficult to discern whether it is a breath of fresh air or an overdone, hyperactive mess of electronic pop—with the scales tipping to the latter. In “Free Your Mind,” Cut Copy fail to live up to its hype as a leading electronic rock band, offering up a sound too generic to be separated from the latest Daft Punk hit or house music beat now frequented on the radio.
“We Are Explorers” is the album’s early standout track, but its upbeat and energetic vibe is unable to make up for the mediocrity of the tracks that follow it. A quirky beat from a tambourine in the background interacts oddly with Cut Copy’s signature keyboard and electric guitar. The lyrics are hopeful, as with most others on the album, and exemplify the eccentric mood of the album: “We are explorers when beat goes on / We're on a journey to the morning sun,” lead vocalist Dan Whitford murmurs during the chorus.
Whitford continues to throw back to the ’80s with his vocals, much like in the band’s previous albums, and his singing is definitely this album’s highlight. This time around, however, the stellar vocals feel completely out of place amidst the confusion that is the blend of keyboard, guitars, and a slew of other instruments.
Yet, there are moments in which the unfitting vocals can be refreshing and even add to the intended eccentricity of the album. “Dark Corners & Mountain Tops,” the only laid-back song on the album, is bolstered by thought-provoking, hopeful lyrics. “Without you, I wouldn’t care at all,” Whitford repeats for much of the song in a truly haunting way. Riding on Whitford’s artfully garbled vocals, the song is both uplifting and powerful.
The album’s major downfall is that all the songs sound too similar to one another. It is almost impossible to distinguish where one song ends and another begins, especially since each one leads seamlessly into the next. This does not seem to work as well as intended, instead making the album feel like an exercise in monotony . “Meet Me In a House of Love,” with its galloping tempo and stinging synths, sounds too much like “Take Me Higher”—which in turn sounds too much like “In Memory Capsule.” Because of this, the album is more of a 55-minute amalgam of indistinguishable vocals, over dance-worthy techno beats than a collection of distinct songs. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with these components in moderation, they become stale and lifeless over the course of the album, failing to build or evolve towards any larger aesthetic statement.
Cut Copy’s latest release is an imperfect mix between danceable electronica and typical 80s pop music vocals. For a band that prides itself on its eccentricity, the album sounds too similar to other indietronica music. Though replete with the interesting vocals and upbeat melodies that Cut Copy is known for, “Free Your Mind” never aims high enough to surpass clichés of its genre, and is relegated to being another generic brick in the wall of electronica.

Fourteen student groups showcased their cultural cuisines and talents to a packed audience at the Asian American Association’s Feast in Quincy dining hall Friday night.
The annual event brought together members from the entire Harvard community in a display of pan-Asian and Asian American culture through traditional dishes—such as banh cuon, pakoras, and gyudon—and performances ranging from traditional Chinese and Philippine dances to rap battles and hip hop medleys.
The night began with attendees sampling food from booths hosted by different Asian cultural organizations on campus, including the South Asian Association and the Harvard Vietnamese Association.
Afterwards, audience members viewed live performances of taekwondo and beat boxing, with Claudine S. Cho ’15 and Kevin Liang ’16 serving as the night’s emcees.
“It was really exciting,” Robert S. Deng ’17 said. “The Asian American culture at Harvard is so diverse so if someone like me wants to connect back to my roots, it's very easy to through events like this."
The enthusiasm of the crowd was matched by the energy of the performers.
“It’s totally exhilarating,” said Hanling Petredean ’15, who is a member of Wushu, a club devoted to contemporary Chinese martial arts.
In the two weeks leading up to the event, Petredean said Wushu practiced their routine three times a week.
“It's so much fun to share all of your hard work in a community as diverse as this," she added.
Initial planning for the feast began in the summer and picked up speed as the Asian American Association's cultural co-chairs Shannen D. Kim ‘15 and Dominick Zheng ’16 reached out to organizations and individuals a month before the event.
“A big challenge was finding the individuals and asking them to come out and perform,” Kim said.
According to Kim, the group strived to represent the diversity of all the Asian countries during this year’s event.
“What I’ve noticed is that cultural groups are really good communities within themselves, but sometimes they can become insulated, and they don’t have much interaction with other cultural groups on campus,” Kim said. “Asian American Association, as the umbrella organization for all the Asian organizations on campus, is in the position to unite the whole Asian community.”
Zheng echoed Kim’s remarks and said that he hoped to see more involvement from the cultural groups themselves in the future.
“A lot of the cultural groups provided food and support, but it would be pretty great to see these groups talking to their members, encouraging them to perform and discover their own talents,” Zheng said.
However, with nearly 250 people packed into Quincy dining hall, Kim and Zheng said that they were extremely pleased with the outcome.
“When you’re actually there at the event, seeing all the people you’ve been emailing and calling…on stage, with the music right, [and] with the crowd completely enthralled, it’s an amazing feeling,” Zheng said.

The Food Literacy Project and the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers will provide students with a variety of bee-pollinated foods at a series of Food Future Study Breaks over the next two weeks to raise awareness about the role that bees play in our sustainable food supply.
“The study breaks are a perfect way to disseminate information through delicious food to a large portion of the undergraduate population,” FLP coordinator Louisa Denison said.
Organizers say the study breaks are intended to inform students about a recent unexplained decline in bee populations, a phenomenon which scientists are calling “colony collapse disorder.”
“Despite the fact that [colony collapse disorder] has been getting a lot of media coverage, it is an unknown topic for a lot of people,” Denison said.
A report authored last year by Harvard School of Public Health professor Chensheng A. Lu identified possible causes of the colony collapse disorder. Although scientists have not yet come to a final conclusion regarding the factors contributing to the decline in the bee population decline, Lu’s study focused on the use of insecticides on farms as a potential cause.
According to co-head of the Beekeepers Li E. K. Murphy ’15, maintaining a healthy bee population is critical to developing a sustainable food supply for the future.
"There is a natural connection between bees and food futures," Murphy said.
According an FLP flyer, over one-third of our food supply—including common household foods such as apples, squash, broccoli, and berries—is dependant on the honey bee.
Denison also cited almonds as one of the most dramatic examples of the importance of the honey bee. Eighty-five percent of almonds are grown in California’s Central Valley, all of which are pollinated by honey bees brought in from around the country.
The study breaks will also discuss the more general effects bees have on our food supply. By pollinating food for farm animals, Murphy said bees play an important role in meat and dairy production.
"You can't have breakfast without bees," Murphy said.
Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers, which was founded last spring, currently has one beehive located on top of Pforzheimer House, but will be installing more hives around campus soon.
“We are by no means experts,” Murphy said, “but we are excited to learn more.”

Moral philosopher and Princeton professor Peter Singer described what he called a “momentous revolution in thinking” regarding animal welfare during a talk in the Ames Courtroom at the Harvard Law School on Friday.
During the event, entitled “Ethics and Animals: Where are We Now,” Singer described the economically-driven processes of factory farming and mass-fishing and the laws that the European Union and United Kingdom have implemented in the past decade to strictly regulate the treatment of animals during those practices.
But, Singer cautioned, while the world has come a long way, outlooks surrounding the ethics and the treatment of animals have not been pushed as far as he thinks they could.
“Animals have interests,” Singer said. “When these are similar to ours, or their pain is on a similar level, why give them less consideration?”
Singer cited the Bible, in which God grants the humans dominion over the animals, as the first documentation of humanity’s obligation to animals. He said that he thinks “dominion” has come to be interpreted as the right “to do as we will,” rather than as responsible stewardship.
“The question is not ‘Can they reason?’ nor ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’” said Singer, quoting the logic used by nineteenth-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,
Bentham’s ideology has also been applied to discussions about slaves, infants, and those with cognitive disabilities.
The case for animal consciousness and the need to acknowledge their interests, Singer said, is evidenced by the similarities between animals and humans—anatomically, physiologically, and behaviorally. He also pointed to the shared evolutionary history between the two.
“We are animals,” Singer said, citing Darwin’s theory of evolution.
Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton and the University of Melbourne, is the author of the controversial book Animal Liberation, which asserts that animals’ interests should be given equal weight to those of humans. The book drew criticism upon its release in 1975.
Friday’s talk was part of a series sponsored by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at the Law School. Singer also spoke later in the day in the Science Center about effective altruism—a utilitarian stance on how best to affect change in the world.
“If God were a utilitarian, Singer would be his patron saint,” Law School professor and Petrie-Flom Center co-director Glenn Cohen said in his introduction.

The Harvard Legal Aid Bureau commemorated 100 years of service and debated possible avenues for the organization’s future at a conference at Harvard Law School this weekend.
Alums of the HLAB convened in the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall for most of the conference, which encompassed events spanning from a gala dinner and a cocktail party to panels discussing some of the issues within public interest law.
The Bureau is the oldest student-run, non-profit legal aid firm in the nation and provides welfare, family, wage, and housing services in order to combat economic disadvantage and poverty, according to the group’s mission statement. Lerae Kroon, the communications director at the Bureau, said that throughout its history the organization has served as a learning and service institution.
“It was really remarkable at the time that this group of law students from this very privileged school wanted to work on this particular issue,” Kroon said. “I think that’s sort of shaped how we’ve gone forward as an organization, and married the educational aspect…and serving the community itself.”
The anniversary celebration kicked off with a welcome reception on Friday evening, during which alumni and current members were able to connect and reflect on the firm’s rich history.
Panels commenced early Saturday morning, with topics ranging from representation in low-income communities to justice beyond legal services. A wide range of attendees, including both first-year law students and practicing professionals—contributed to the analysis of the challenges currently facing the legal field.
One of the panels focused on the need for clinical experience in the legal education system, debating the necessity of HLAB-style programs in elite learning institutions. While some attendees prioritized the Law Review experience as key in preparing young lawyers for work, most participants said they preferred the experience providing by working in the Bureau, which had given many of them their first taste of legal action.
“I spent two years on Harvard Legal Aid, and I think that it provided me with some of the most valuable skills that I use in private practice,” Michael L. Luskin ’73 said.
Fueled by the discussion amongst amongst a wide array of individuals who had worked in the legal field, the event underscored the positive impact the Bureau has had for the past century. The organizers of the event said they hope that the HLAB will continue its strong presence in the next 100 years.
Diane Downs, an HLAB alum, said that even though the the Bureau has to focus on “small cases” in order to be student run, its actions are important to the individuals they serve.
“It really wasn’t small for the person who got unemployment insurance benefits….[or] for the person who obtained disability in a back payment of ten years of fighting that disability,” Down said. “For our clients, it’s life-changing.”

Harvard students and faculty gathered in Sever Hall on Friday afternoon for a mixed debate on whether Harvard should continue to financially invest in fossil fuel companies.
Divest Harvard, which co-sponsored the forum along with Perspective Magazine, selected a diverse panel of speakers to analyze the arguments for and against divestment. Panelists at Friday’s forum included geology professor Daniel P. Schrag, English professor James Engell ’73, Harvard Business School professor Rebecca Henderson, and Divinity School student Tim M. DeChristopher.
“We made sure the panel would be evenly distributed,” Joseph G. Lanzillo ’16, a member of Divest Harvard, said. “We wanted to have a different mix and different perspectives from people of varied fields of expertise.”
According to members of Divest Harvard, University President Drew G. Faust had previously declined an invitation to speak at a public forum on the topic of divestment.
Harvard alumni presented Faust with a letter in September requesting her appearance at a public forum, but Faust responded in early October by issuing a statement affirming Harvard’s anti-divestment position.
“We felt [the letter] kind of missed the point of having an open dialogue in public,” Divest Harvard co-coordinator Alyssa L. Chan ’16 said. “She didn’t agree to publicly discuss [divestment] or be a part of the conversation that’s happening on campus, and so that was a little disappointing.”
Despite Faust’s absence, Henderson said that the forum marked a positive progression in the divestment dialogue, but emphasized the role of individuals rather than institutions in supporting fossil fuel companies.
“We use fossil fuels all the time,” Henderson said. “In the general run of things, a fossil fuel company is giving people what they want at a price they say they want.”
Most of the panelists agreed that education is the first step to engaging with the question of divestment. Both Schrag and Engell expressed interest in introducing a new General Education category on environmentalism to teach students about the implications of climate change.
Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who moderated the discussion, reaffirmed the UC’s commitment to divestment nearly one year after its referendum urging the University to cease its investment in fossil fuel corporations passed on the 2012 ballot.
“The purpose of the debate [was] to really help build awareness and educate the student body as well as community members about what divestment from fossil fuels would actually mean in a conceptual, but also a practical sense for Harvard,” she said.
Leaders of Divest Harvard also said they hoped that Friday’s forum would open the dialogue for the divestment movement.
“It doesn’t really matter where it begins or what topic it begins on, but what matters is strong people who want to talk about how Harvard can solve climate change,” Lanzillo said. “That’s as important as the divestment movement itself.”

Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan unveiled Edraak, an online education website for the Arabic-speaking world, during a visit to Harvard on Thursday.
A collaboration with edX, the virtual education platform founded jointly by Harvard and MIT, the new initiative will be the first massive open online course platform in the Middle East.
The new program will be under the supervision of the Queen Rania Foundation for Education and Development. In addition to developing new courses taught by top Arab professionals, Edraak aims to increase the accessibility of online courses by translating existing edX courses into Arabic.
Al Abdullah said in a press release that Edraak will help educators reach the growing group of “intellectually hungry Arab youth.”
MIT professor and edX president Anant Agarwal said in a press release that edX is honored to join Al Abdullah in bringing the online learning experience to the Arab world.
“EdX was founded on the belief that education should be freely available for everyone, like the air we breathe,” Agarwal said in the press release. “We share Her Majesty Queen Rania’s vision to bring opportunity to those who need it most through education.”
EdX, founded in 2012 when Harvard and MIT pledged to spend $30 million each to develop a new virtual education initiative, has since grown to include over two dozen other institutions of higher learning.
This May, the edX network expanded into Asia for the first time through partnerships with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean universities, expanding the edX network to four continents and more than doubling the number of participating schools. Edraak marks edX’s first partnership in the Middle East.
According to Sami M. Alkyam, an Arabic preceptor at Harvard, Edraak is particularly important for the development of the Middle East.
“A project like this is the most needed in the Arab world and by Arab youths...amidst their crisis of dictatorial and post-dictatorial Arab States,” he said.
Alkyam said that problems in the Middle East require “ambitious risk-taking, effective partnerships, and the most efficient use of sources of knowledge,” all of which he said he believes Edraak will cultivate.

Social entrepreneurs, Harvard affiliates, and students from across the United States convened in Northwest Labs on Saturday for the Igniting Innovation Summit, a conference meant to spark student interest in social entrepreneurship through a series of events.
Hosted by the student group Harvard College Social Innovation Collaborative, the conference sold out for the first time since its inception four years ago.
Nishin Nathwani ’15, director of the summit, said he thought the large crowd reflects a growing interest in social enterprise on campus, as well as the rise in prominence of social ventures nationwide.
“Social innovation at its core is finding new ways to address old social and environmental issues,” Nathwani said. “It’s about the theory of change that underlies your enterprise.”
Speakers, who were social innovators in fields ranging from health to finance to green energy, exposed participants throughout the day to a diverse array of social ventures and visions for impacting change through a series of talks and panels. Many also spoke about their unlikely trajectory to a career as a social entrepreneur.
Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, CEO and co-founder of Social Finance US and a keynote speaker at the conference, said she decided to dive into social impact financing after years working in traditional finance and consulting firms.
“I asked for the very first time the very important question: What are my values? What is education for? Am I ready to take the path less traveled?” she said.
Andrew Yang, CEO and founder of Venture for America, discussed his own switch from a traditional career path to social entrepreneurship during a TED-style talk in the morning. Yang said he thinks most new graduates lack exposure to fields beyond law, medicine, finance, and consulting.
Once a corporate lawyer, he now runs a company that matches accepted fellows with start-ups, in order give new graduates exposure to careers in social entrepreneurship and the skillset to start their own company.
In addition to hosting events aimed at educating participants about social innovation, the conference’s organizers ran workshops on key entrepreneurial skills such as public speaking and funding. An innovation showcase at lunch allowed participants to visit the booths of various social enterprises, many of which offer internships and volunteer positions to undergraduates.
Nathwani said that in an effort to inspire attendees, the conference also hosted for the first time the finals of the Social Venture Challenge—a four-tiered competition meant to encourage participants to brainstorm and implement solutions to social issues worldwide. On Saturday evening the winning undergraduates were awarded mentorship and seed funding to implement their ideas.
Kushal Choxi, a junior from the University of Maryland, said that although he started his own nonprofit in high school, he was “blown away” by the speakers at the summit.
“They really developed my thinking on the ideas of social entrepreneurship,” he said.

Activists from the student group Responsible Investment at Harvard solicited Undergraduate Council support for its new initiative for Harvard to adopt a “set of principles of ownership” for companies that Harvard wholly owns at the UC’s general meeting Sunday night.
“The UC played a huge role in helping us win our first campaign last year,” activist Samuel F. Wohns ’14 said. “We’re here because that was always part of a much larger goal of ours to push Harvard to become a more socially and environmentally responsible, transparent, and accountable investor.”
The new campaign, called the Responsible Ownership Campaign, focuses on companies that Harvard entirely owns through its investment.
“Since Harvard owns them outright, Harvard can play a stronger role in making sure that they’re not only positive for our endowment growth, but also positive for the local community they’re operating in,” said Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, another member of Responsible Investment.
Bayard mentioned two examples of alleged mismanagement in Harvard-owned firms, one involving the alleged deterioration of wetlands by two timber plantations in Argentina and another involving the unionization of workers at the DoubleTree Hotel in Boston. All three companies are wholly owned by the University.
The representatives from the Responsible Investment group said that the UC could help in reaching out to the student body on these issues.
The Council has supported the efforts of Responsible Investment in the past, first when it endorsed the Fair Harvard Fund last spring. Additionally, it adopted the position of advocating for the University to create a social choice fund last fall after a strong majority of students who voted in a referendum question indicated support for this position.
UC representatives also unanimously approved eight different pieces of legislation at Sunday’s general meeting. Most notably, the Council approved an amendment to its constitution that overhauls the mission statements of all six committees that make up the Council.
The mission statement changes, which stemmed from discussions held at last Friday’s Rules Committee meeting, are part of a larger internal effort in the Council to modernize its rules. Last week, the Council voted to make structural changes to committees through changes to its Bylaws.
In addition, the Council voted in favor of setting aside $5,000 from its grants budget for a Freshman Life Fund in an effort to encourage programming events for the freshman class.
The creation of a fund supporting freshman programming remained in limbo earlier in the semester because of the lack of “roll-over funding” from UC funds unused from last year. According to UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, a deal with the Office of Student Life, in which it would provide half of the $20,000 of funding for Wintersession grants, freed up money in the grants fund to provide money for the Freshman Life Fund.

In 'Quotes of the Week,' The Back Page will look each weekend at the five best quotes of the week, providing context for the five best moments from the past seven days in Crimson sports.
 “The players were in tears after the match. The coach was in tears after the match. This was the first win [against Yale] since 2004. We have worked so hard to be the top of the Ivy League, and this just proves that we are the best team in the Ivy League” – co-captain Natalie Doyle ‘14 
Having bested Brown the previous day, the women’s volleyball team took down Ivy-leading Yale in a back-and-forth five-set match that propelled Harvard to second place in the Ivy standings. Yale entered the match with a 23-match Ivy League win streak. The Crimson victory places Harvard within two games of Yale for the overall conference lead.
 “I felt the kick leave my foot, and it just felt good. There was no doubt I was going to miss that.” – Andrew Flesher ‘16 
A week after missing a would-be game-winning field goal, backup kicker Andrew Flesher sealed the Crimson victory against Dartmouth with a 23-yard field goal at 48 seconds remaining. The win brings Harvard to 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the Ivy League.
 “Talk about saving the game. Our goalies were like Supermen back there—they saved the game. So many times they get their hands on balls that I can’t even imagine, and they keep us in [the game].” – Margaret Purce ‘17
For the fourth time in six years, players of the Harvard women’s soccer team secured their places as Ivy League champions. A 2-1 final score extends the Crimson win streak to 13 games, the team’s longest since 1999.
 “Coach told me to get up front and kind of relax and chill as much as I could, and then just take the race over when I felt like I could strike it home. At 5K, I felt like I could speed up and I wanted to take it over, so I did that, and the Dartmouth guys just couldn’t keep up.” – Maksim Korolev ‘14
After leading the Harvard men’s cross country team for the entire season with fellow co-captain James Leakos, senior Maksim Korolev produced a blazing 23:28 8k to finish first and take the individual title at Princeton’s Heptagonal Championships. Korolev’s overall time–which translates to 4:43 per mile–beat the previous Ivy record by 13.6 seconds.
 “It was amazing when that final whistle went today. To look back at where we were in August and where this Harvard Radcliffe team has gone to now is just amazing. It gives us so much hope for our spring season and for the future. Everyone is just so happy right now.” – co-captain Xanni Brown ‘14
In the last game of the Harvard’s first season for varsity women’s rugby, the Crimson won the Ivy League title with a 29-0 victory over top-ranked Dartmouth. A previous loss to Dartmouth was the only Ivy defeat for the Crimson in its first year as a varsity squad.

This past weekend, Harvard had one of its strongest showings of the year with an Ivy-clinching victory by the women’s soccer team and a big win by the football squad. As Harvard tried to carry its momentum into this week’s docket of games, The Back Page previews a few especially noteworthy contests:
 
Harvard Invitational, Women’s Tennis
In its last competition of the calendar year, the women’s tennis team hosts the Harvard Invitational. Freshmen Monica Lin and Spencer Liang look to follow up their impressive showings at the USTA/ITA Northeast Regional Championships, where they finished in the quarterfinals and the round of sixteen, respectively. The competition will last from Friday to Sunday in the Murr Center.
CPWA Northern Div. Championships, Harvard Men’s Water Polo
After finishing 11-1 in conference play on the season, the No. 18 Crimson looks for its regular season success to carry over to the CWPA Northern Division Championships. Brown handed Harvard its only conference loss of the year in late October and could potentially avenge its defeat this weekend in Blodgett Pool.
 
Women’s Volleyball v. Penn
After defeating Yale for the first time in 10 years, the women’s volleyball team hopes to carry some momentum into its tilt with Penn this Friday in the Malkin Athletic Center. The Quakers sit one spot below the Crimson in the standings and, with a fifth straight victory, could pull into a tie for second place in the Ivy League with Harvard.

Harvard men’s basketball has been on an incredible rise over the last couple of years, but recent recruiting efforts indicate the best years are still far out in front. Symbolic of the good times to come is Zena Edosomwan, the 6’9” bruiser of a power forward who was Harvard’s first-ever top 100 recruit. Although it’s still a little bit difficult to determine what role he’ll exactly have on the team, one thing is clear: he’s an absolute beast on the court. Built like a young stag, he’s the type of player who will try go through you rather than go around you.
The first time I remember hearing of Zena was when I saw him in his very own BallIsLife mixtape. The biggest question after watching this video is whether he can really dunk, right? The mixtape, however, isn’t purely a highlight reel of alley-oops and one-handed jams. At 0:19, Edosomwan displays a pretty sick up-and-under move. At 0:13, he displays a turnaround jumper, perhaps inklings of a budding varied post game. Surprisingly, at 0:29 you even see Zena hit a long-range jumper.
That this is Zena’s only shot outside of 10 feet tells me that he’s probably not going to be a Kyle Casey-esque power forward who can stretch the defense out to three-point land. The best play, with no doubt, and the one that gets me the most excited, is the last play in the entire highlight reel. At 1:45, Zena absolutely throws it down two-handed on an unsuspecting defender. Number 13’s Deandre Jordan-type face shows it all: surprise, discomfort for his teammate, and a little bit of awe.
The BallIsLife mixtape’s a little outdated, however, as Zena spent his last year at NMH, as so many players do, doing a post-high school graduation year at a prep school. NMH catalogs the highlights of all their players, and this mixtape shows his improvement over the past year. In the first play of the mixtape, he puts a defender on his back by simply backing him down. He then goes on to show a little finesse at 0:51, where he lets both defenders fly by and then lays the ball up nicely with the left hand, though he probably could have dunked it. At 1:46, we see a vastly improved jumper from the BallIsLife reel. Rather than a set shot, he is able to drive right, step back, and pull up, which for righties is very difficult to do successfully.
Probably one of the best gauges to show both his strength and skill is this last mixtape, where there are numerous clips of him performing at the Pangos All-American Camp, a three day invite-only camp for the best high school players in the nation. Zena was still able to complete an impressive array of dunks, but what was the most exciting about this highlight clip was the host of post moves in his arsenal that he displayed against these taller, but probably not stronger, players. It’s easy to think that a 6’9” power forward might be a little undersized to play in a team that could be potentially ranked in the top 25, but his athletic ability and basketball finesse indicate that he should have no problems.
It’s no surprise that Zena received 39 total offers from schools such as UCLA, Texas, and Wake Forest. These videos indicate why Harvard basketball fans are incredibly excited to see what he’ll bring to the team this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not often is there a basketball player referred to by his fans by purely his first name. But at any Harvard home basketball game, one can hear the students roar "STEVEEEEE" as their favorite Cameroonian power forward throws down vicious dunks.
Moundou-Missi has always been aided by the star point guard play of Brandyn Curry and Siyani Chambers, yet a dig into his past reveals all the other sick point guards he’s played with. The investigation also reveals that he’s essentially a super-nerd, but hey, we’re all Harvard students, so is that not to be expected?
The most informative video on his high school experience is a YouTube series called Soar With the Eagles. Steve’s section starts at roughly 3:36, where his coach starts talking about Moundou-Missi’s past athletic and academic career. There were numerous surprises here in this part of the video: he went to Montverde Academy, one of the best basketball prep schools in the entire nation, and he only entered the US early in high school and has only lived in the US for roughly six years. The tape reveals that Moundou-Missi chose Montverde Academy over the number one academic school in France. It makes it all the more fitting that he dominates here at Harvard, both academically and athletically.
In the first actual highlight reel of Steve playing in a little pick-up with his former high school players, we see him doing things we’re used to him doing. Although the film only includes three of his plays, they are, in order, him throwing down an alley-oop on an unsuspecting defender, him blocking Kasey Hill—arguably the best point guard in last year’s recruiting class starting his freshman year at Florida right now—and taking off with two feet just outside the key, cocking it back, and throwing it down with some force. Ugo Okam, a former Harvard varsity basketball player who is currently dominating against law students and undergrads a couple feet shorter than he is in pick-up games, makes a little appearance at 0:50 running the pick portion of the pick and roll.
The final highlight reel is a real treat in itself – it’s a video of Steve during his AAU years in 2010, taken on a grainy, super-janky video recorder that’s well past its prime. The video, however, is definitely not all about Steve. His team also features New Orleans Pelicans 2012 first-round pick Austin Rivers, Dallas Mavericks 2013 first-round pick Shane Larkin, and UNC commit and recent Peach Jam winner (top high school basketball tournament) Joel Berry. Due to the quality of the video, or lack thereof, I can’t quite tell who Steve is, but I’m going to guess he’s number 51, purely based off of his face shape.
At 1:01, he has a strong rebound and left-handed finish. Right after, he faces up the defender in the low post and is able to back him down for a tough bank shot off the glass. At 2:00, we see a relatively weak dunk by Moundou-Missi, so it seems like he’s put on a little muscle and hops since then. We see Moundou-Missi get himself into a tough situation at 2:11, where he gets stopped as he tries to drive one way and spin back for a hook shot. Steve’s able to calmly put a shoulder into the defender to create some separation and flip the ball off the glass with a right handed scoop shot, not something you see all that often from any power forward.
We basketball fans here at Harvard would love to see a little more of that Moundou-Missi post game. We already know the value he creates as a rebounding energy man who gets a lot of easy inside shots, but it’d be interesting to see if he, Kenyatta, Zena, and Kyle Casey can form some sort of dynamic in which they get a lot of high post-low post action going. There is not too much athletic height in this league, and Steve could play an integral part of a decimating interior for the Crimson in this coming year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a great time of year to be a Harvard sports fan. For most teams, the final week of the season is approaching, and the stakes have never been higher. The women’s soccer team and the women’s rugby team have already brought home Ivy League championships, and several other teams are looking to do the same. The men’s soccer team has an opportunity to win a title with wins in its last two games. In two weeks, the football team could have more than just bragging rights on the line against Yale with a potential Ancient Eight crown within reach. If all that is not enough, the men and women’s cross-country teams will be heading to the NCAA Regionals next week, and the highly anticipated start of basketball season has finally arrived.
In addition to all this action on the field, Crimson athletes have been active off the field on social media and Twitter. We at The Back Page would like to share some of our favorite posts from the past week with you.
6. Colton Peppelman, a freshman wrestler, has competed hundreds of times on the mat, but his toughest opponent is his favorite candy.
"You don't know what struggling is until you've tried to open a starburst in the dark."
All that matters is the end result.
5. Blockbuster’s announcement that it will be closing all its stores has taken a toll on
junior tight end Tyler Hamblin.
"S/O to ‪#Blockbuster for the memories. Ill always remember the overpriced candy"
The only thing that Blockbuster had that Netflix couldn’t stream.
4. Harvard’s Assistant Director of Athletic Communications, Michael Black, is next on our list with a proposal for the MBTA.
"I'd probably pay $5 more a month if the MBTA struck a deal with like Febreze® or Glade® for a once-every-five-minutes puff of freshness."
A man can only dream.
3. When he signed up for Ec10, freshman tight end Jimmy Martter knew that Greg Mankiw would be an insightful professor, but this probably isn’t what he had in mind.
"'We think of Harvard as a great school, and it is, but it's also the best mating system - Potential for high household incomes' -Greg Mankiw"
Mankiw may have gotten his PhD in economics, but you can also call him the doctor of love.
2. Colby Knight, another freshman wrestler, had a pun to share with his followers.
"I'm not alarmed that they're getting rid of clocks that make noise every second. It's about time. They were really starting to tick me off."
Everyone loves a good pun. There’s a reason why we ranked him second.
1. It was bad enough that Hayley Moore, assistant coach of the women’s hockey team, had to be up at the crack of dawn to catch a flight, but things got worse.
"Bad things that can happen on the way to the airport at 4am: ‪#mycabdriverfarted"
Never a good strategy if you’d like to earn a tip.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The goal for the Harvard women’s soccer team going into its final game of the regular season against Columbia was simple: perfection. After clinching the program’s 11th Ivy League title last week with a 2-1 win over Dartmouth, the team needed just one more win to finish with a perfect conference record.
The Crimson did not disappoint, as they continued their roll through the Ivies with a 2-1 road win over Columbia to go undefeated in the league for the first time since 1999.
“It’s a special feeling,” senior co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “It’s something that we’ll never forget. Winning the Ivy title is one thing, but then also knowing that you had a season where on every day you came out and you gave it everything and came out with a win is another. Just having no regrets about any game is a really nice feeling and hopefully gives us confidence moving forward.”
Despite the fact that Harvard already had the league title wrapped up, Columbia refused to make it easy for the Crimson women to come out with the win. While Harvard dominated the first half, taking eight of their 9 shots on the net and scoring both of their goals before halftime, the Lions refused to go quietly and ramped up their efforts after the break.
With the Crimson up, 2-0, Columbia senior Beverly Leon took advantage of a penalty kick just five minutes into the second half to bring the Lions within one off her ninth goal of the season. After challenging Harvard for most of the second half, Columbia’s best chance to tie the game was answered by freshman goalie Lizzie Durack, who made a save at point-blank range with less than ten minutes remaining to retain the lead for the Crimson.
“It was a really hard-fought game by both teams,” Johnson said. “I think we played really well in the first half, but give Columbia a lot of credit, the second half they just never gave up. They made us fight for every minute and we managed to hold on, which is what counts for the result sheet.”
Senior captain Elizabeth Weisman started the scoring early, blasting a shot from the penalty area just 14 minutes into the contest. It was the senior’s sixth goal of the season and gave the Crimson a lead they would never relinquish.
“Since there’s been a lot on the line [the past few games], it’s been very tense,” Weisman said. “Now that we have the title under our belt, we’re more calm and focused on playing well, and the goals still came with that.”
Junior midfielder Meg Cascells-Hamby added to Harvard’s tally just before halftime off an assist from classmate Lauren Urke. Urke passed the ball on the right side to Cascells-Hamby, who then kicked the ball just above Columbia netminder Grace Redmon to put the Crimson up 2-0. It was the last time anyone on the Harvard team would score, but the defense stepped up in the second half to keep Columbia from overtaking the Crimson on the scoreboard.
“Our back line did an exceptional job, especially [junior] Erika Garcia and [sophomore] Alika Keane,” Johnson said. “They’ve really been rocks for us all year. We were really under a lot of pressure in the second half, and they just kept turning away Columbia attack after Columbia attack. I think so much of our success this season, especially in narrow wins like yesterday, comes down to those two.”
It was a group effort for Harvard in net, as junior Cheta Emba, Durack, and junior Bethany Kanten all saw time in net for the Crimson. All three goalies played their part in the victory, as each made two saves to give the Crimson the win. Durack in particular stepped up, turning away two shots in the final ten minutes.
With the Ivy title securely in the Harvard women’s possession, the next stop is the NCAA tournament. While the Crimson’s last attempt ended relatively quickly, with a 3-0 loss to Boston University in the first round, the Harvard women are currently riding a program-record 14-game winning streak and will bring with them the confidence that comes from that perfect record.
“It’s something that you dream about doing, especially as a senior,” Weisman said. “I know the other three seniors feel the same way. It’s amazing. It just really shows the hard work we’ve put in over the course of an entire year has paid off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An undisciplined final frame caught up with the Crimson as the Harvard men’s hockey team fell to No. 16/15 Clarkson, 2-1, Saturday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
With just over two minutes left in regulation, Golden Knights center Allan McPherson stuffed the game-winning goal past a scrum in front of the net during Clarkson’s third power play of the third period.
“I think we competed really hard, but we just took way too many penalties,” sophomore forward Brian Hart said. “They were just in our zone the whole period.”
Clarkson (9-2-1, 3-1-0 ECAC) held on to sweep its weekend double on the road, while the Crimson (2-3-1, 1-3-1) completed its four-game home stand on a three-game losing streak.
Harvard’s penalty kill had turned away Clarkson’s first seven power plays, including two 5-on-3 advantages. But a boarding penalty to junior defender Mark Luzar with three minutes left in regulation proved to be the difference.
“We did a good job killing penalties,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Ultimately, with all the great chances [Clarkson] had, they end up getting a bounce, but when you take four penalties in the third period, you’re asking for trouble.”
The home team came out stronger than it did in its 3-1 loss to St. Lawrence a night earlier, but Clarkson received an early opportunity to assert itself in the Crimson zone with a pair of penalties to defensemen Luzar and Dan Ford spaced 38 seconds apart midway through the first.
The Golden Knights power play unit failed to convert, but James De Haas gave the visitors’ the lead less than a minute after the expiration of Ford’s minor. The Clarkson defender found the back of the net from the point off a failed Crimson clear attempt.
Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey provided his second power play goal in as many nights to tie things at one just over a minute into the second frame. The play was reviewed for a crease violation after Vesey redirected a fluttering puck in the air past Clarkson goaltender Greg Lewis, but the goal stood.
The middle frame was Harvard’s best of the night, but Clarkson managed to limit most of the Crimson’s opportunities to the outside.
Clarkson earned its second 5-on-3 of the night more than halfway through the final frame after Harvard was whistled for a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty and sophomore defender Desmond Bergin was sent to the box for slashing less than two minutes later.
But the Crimson survived the challenge with multiple blocked shots by Ford and key stops from junior goalkeeper Steve Michalek.
Following McPherson’s game-winner on the power play, Harvard spent the last 40 seconds of the night 6-on-4 with a power play and an extra attacker. The Crimson controlled the Clarkson zone for the final minute but could not come up with the tying goal.
Despite the loss, Donato said he was pleased with the adjustments Harvard made after Friday night’s loss.
“We spent way less time in our zone,” Donato said. “I thought defensively we cleaned up a lot of things.... Overall, it’s a tough pill to swallow because I think our guys really battled and competed, but it’s something we’ll learn from.”
Crimson skaters contributed 25 blocked shots, and Michalek finished with 31 saves. Despite strong showings in each of his first three starts, the junior goaltender is 0-2-1 on the year.
Saturday was Harvard’s first full game without first-line center Alexander Kerfoot, who dislocated his shoulder in Friday’s 3-1 loss to St. Lawrence. The freshman appeared to be in good spirits watching from the stands in a sling, but Donato could not provide a timetable for his return.
With Kerfoot out, the Crimson was unable to dress five of the nine NHL draft picks on its roster for Saturday night. Forwards Colin Blackwell and Petr Placek are also on the injured list, and junior defensemen Marshall Everson and Patrick McNally may return next weekend from the suspensions that resulted from their withdrawals from the team last year.
“Hopefully we’ll continue to get some guys out,” Donato said. “We got a third of the team sitting on the sidelines not capable of playing, and that’s not an excuse—everybody’s got different things they’re fighting—but hopefully we can get closer to having a full lineup.”

With its sixth win in seven games, a 2-0 result over the Columbia Lions (8-5-3, 1-2-3 Ivy), the Harvard men’s soccer team (7-7-2, 5-1-0) moved one game away from the Ancient Eight title. It was the team’s first win all year by two or more goals and broke a six-game streak of games decided by one goal.
“Columbia is one of, if not the most, talented team we have played this year,” senior midfielder Kevin Harrington said. “Overall a great performance, and I am very happy with the team.”
Harvard quickly broke a 0-0 tie at half with a 50th minute goal from Harrington, who took a pass from sophomore defender Mark Ashby and rocketed a shot into the top left corner of the goal. The team capitalized again two minutes later, as junior midfielder Matt Sheeleigh took a corner kick from senior midfielder Ross Friedman and knocked it into the back of the net. The team’s defense, which surrendered only five shots on goal all game, held steady.
“I think we put together a good, hard-fought 90 minutes,” sophomore Mike Klain said. “Every game in the Ivy League is tough, and it will be a battle every time we are out there. Every guy fought for all 90, and we were able to get the result we wanted, but it was about the intensity that we brought and the fight that we brought. It is hard to get points on the road against a good team, but we played hard, stuck together, and got the result we wanted.”
Afterwards, Friedman praised the play of sophomore goalie Evan Mendez, who maintained his undefeated season with his sixth win in seven outings. Friedman said that the team’s pressure defense is reliant on an aggressive goalkeeper willing to come off the line. Mendez’s aggressiveness and communication since taking over the starting job, Friedman said, have allowed the team to find its aggressive defensive identity.
“Evan has been great for the team,” Friedman said. “He brought a lot of calm to our back line and our play. He has a clear mind and an ability to press the game. That’s what a lot of people don’t think about when they think about a goalkeeper, he has got the intangibles, and he has the communication aspect of it, which is great.”
Harrington credited the team’s recent resurgence to the philosophy of coach Pieter Lehrer. Since day one, Harrington said that the coach has emphasized that the team’s improvement will be a process and that each game the focus has been on improvement and belief.
“Since he was able to trust his process and strategy for the entire season in all those losses, he was able to make us all buy into that strategy and process,” Harrington said. “The biggest change he has made is that people have the belief that we will win games. Even if we are down one goal or two goals, we still believe we can win. Even if we lose, we come to practice thinking that we can make the changes to win the next one.”
Klain concurred with Harrington, saying that the most valuable lesson that the coach has taught the team is how to commit to its goals. The sophomore said that the team’s mentality under Lehrer is completely different from what it was under previous coach Carl Junot.
“He has really done a great job of putting together a process that we stick to every single day,” Klain said. “It has affected how we approach soccer and other aspects of life as well. We have gone about accomplishing our goals, and it has been really helpful for us on the field.”
However, the sophomore said that the team—which continues to take the season game-by-game, even with the title a game away—has yet to cross off the goals it set for itself this year.
“We are in a position to do now what we set out to do and a lot of it is thanks to the process that we have laid out in terms of how we approach every moment in our life,” Klain said. “[However,] we have a ways to go to accomplish our goals. But if you have 11 guys that fight hard and do their job, then that’s the way that we are going to win game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Amidst a star studded cast, a player usually left a supporting role shone brightest of all.
Junior forward Jonah Travis came off the bench less than three minutes into Sunday night’s contest and provided the offensive spark the Harvard men’s basketball team needed to pull off an 82-72 win in its season opener against Holy Cross at TD Garden for the Coaches vs. Cancer Tripleheader.
Travis was a force on both ends of the court, notching his third career double-double with 10 rebounds and a career high 20 points against the Crusaders. Though the junior fouled out with two minutes to play, his mobility in the paint and 12 first half points kept the Crimson in the contest when its defense could not.
Coming into its season opener, Harvard was figuring out how to manage a group of talented players that have never shared the court. Sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers and junior wing Wes Saunders—who led the team in scoring last year—joined co-captain guard Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey on the court in their first game since taking a yearlong leave of absence last fall. Though the expectations were high, the four—considered the players to watch coming into the season—started slow and combined for only 25 of Harvard’s 45 points before the break.
Travis outmatched the Crusaders’ low post defense and shot 7-10 from the field and 6-6 from the line in his 22 minutes of play.
“I know my job—to provide energy for the team—and if that helps them get over the hump and slow starts, that’s what I do,” Travis said. “If they need me to grab rebounds, score points, or set screens, [then] that’s what I will do. I know what coach [Tommy Amaker] expects of me, which is to come in there with energy and a bang.”
Holy Cross opened up a quick eight point lead five minutes in, but after overcoming the deficit in the first half, Harvard played with the lead for the majority of the contest and was up, 45-39, at the break.
A 25-point effort by Holy Cross senior forward Dave Dudzinski meant Harvard could never open up a comfortable lead. Dudzinski was the only Crusader to score in double digits, and 20 of his points came in the first half. The senior proved his versatility with two threes, but he cramped up in the second and had to sit for long stretches.
“He has lit us up before and we know what he is able to accomplish,” Travis said. “In the first half, we didn’t play as well before he got the ball, and I felt if we stepped it up when he got the ball and denied him as many touches then we will have more success against him.”
Though Dudzinski could not step up in the second half, the Crimson struggled to contain a persistent Holy Cross offense down the stretch. Harvard held its first-half lead for 14 minutes in the second despite a 15-5 run by the Crusaders. As the clock wound down, Holy Cross came storming back with a three pointer before junior forward Malcolm Miller earned a free throw on the next possession to tie the game. The foul was Casey’s fifth of the game, and he was forced to the bench with only four points on the night.
All tied up with six minutes to play, the Crimson looked to Chambers. Though he had been silenced in the first half, the sophomore rallied to chip in seven straight points for Harvard. Playing with another true point guard for the first time in his Harvard career, Chambers had been somewhat overshadowed by Curry in the first half.
But not when it mattered. After hitting a one-and-one to put Harvard up by one, the sophomore turned and hit a fade away jump shot before sinking his only three pointer of the evening in transition off a Travis rebound. Chambers added two more free throws down the stretch and finished the night with 11 points. Saunders chipped in 18 and co-captain Laurent Rivard led the Crimson at the perimeter, going 3-6 from deep.
After playing from behind for the first 12 minutes of the game, a three pointer by Saunders set up the Crimson’s comeback. Travis picked up a steal on the other end, and fought off a defender down low to tie the score at 23. The Crimson would not fall behind in the first half again, as close play through the next five minutes eventually opened up the score in Harvard’s favor and Saunders pushed Harvard’s lead to six on a three-point play layup in transition with 44 seconds to play.
Holy Cross was ultimately unable to overcome the balanced offensive onslaught, even as many of the Harvard players took the court together for the first time.
“There is always uncertainty,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Until you play and suit up, you are wondering. I like the fact that we have so many people who can step forward and give us what we need from night to night to win. This group is still trying to find itself. It is evolving and it will be a process.”

For senior guard Jasmine Evans, 45 seconds was all that was necessary to extend Harvard women’s basketball's lead against California Polytechnic.
With seven minutes left in the game, Evans forced the issue for the Crimson, taking Harvard’s one-point advantage to seven with two quick treys.
In the second game of the DePaul Maggie Dixon Classic at McGrath-Phillips Arena in Chicago, Harvard (1-1) faced off against Cal Poly (0-2) Saturday evening and came away with an 83-76 victory.
“In the second half, we came out of a time out and had a run,” junior co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “Jasmine hit two threes in a row… We really gained the momentum back early in the second half, so that was key and helped us finish the game strong.”
Evans was not the only one leading the Crimson’s offense. Co-captain Christine Clark scored 22 points, to go with seven boards and five assists in 37 minutes.
Junior forward Temi Fagbenle had her eighth career double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while junior forward Erin McDonnell chipped in 13 points and 9 boards.
“We knew that they were drivers and they had a few shooters, so we were going to try to contain the drive and just take care of the ball and play our defense and execute on offense,” Dinkins said. “They’re very up-tempo and run everywhere to try to get you on your heels and off balance. We knew we were just going to have to take care of the ball and execute and play our basketball, rather than playing to their tempo.”
The Crimson went out early with a 12-3 lead, but Cal Poly quickly took advantage of a series of Harvard mistakes and found itself ahead 27-26.
“I think that the reason it was a closer game was more because of our errors than them being better,” Clark said. “Defensively and offensively we have things to work on and once we take care of those things that we need to work on and are able to implement them in a game situation, [then we’ll be fine].”
The first frame ended with the Crimson holding a slight advantage, 41-40. Harvard capitalized on the momentum generated by Evans’ threes to go up by 12 with six minutes remaining.
“I thought that it was a great team win and it feels really good to have that win under our belt,” Clark said. “With that being said, I think that we learned through this tournament about what we need to improve on and we’re still striving to play our best basketball, which we haven’t played yet.”
While Harvard came out on top, the team still totaled 29 turnovers compared to Cal Poly’s 13. The Mustangs converted 27 points off of the Crimson’s mistakes.
Cal Poly guard Jonae Ervin and center Molly Schlemer tallied 23 and 21 points, respectively.
“There’s a lot of growing room and we learned that for this game, but we haven’t reached our potential yet and we have to keep working hard every day in practice,” Dinkins said. “Overall, happy with the win, but definitely not satisfied.”
The Mustangs broke down the Harvard defense during the first half, making four of their 14 long-range attempts. The Crimson only shot five times from outside three in the first 20 minutes. However, Harvard’s total field goal percentage of 54 percent still trumped Cal Poly’s 38.6 percent.
“We’ve learned a lot, and we know that we’re better and our best basketball is yet to come,” Clark said. “We’re excited to play at home with the home crowd and keep the undefeated streak going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes in basketball, there is nothing a team can do to slow down an opponent’s offense as it watches each shot fall through the basket, one after another.
Such was the case for the Harvard women’s basketball team on Friday night in Chicago.
Propelled by sharpshooting guards who knocked down 11 first-half three pointers, DePaul (2-0, 0-0 Big East) handed the Crimson (0-1, 0-0 Ivy) its first loss of the season, 99-75, in the first round of the DePaul Maggie Dixon Classic.
“We are a little disappointed,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We are capable of much better.”
Trailing from the beginning of the game, the Crimson was able to keep the deficit manageable for most of the first half.  But with less than seven minutes left in the first frame, the Blue Demons went on a scoring surge, tallying 16 points in less than four minutes to extend their lead to an insurmountable 25 points. Junior guard Megan Rogowski led the charge for DePaul during this onslaught, knocking down three of her four treys within four minutes.
Harvard was unable to slow down the Blue Demons’ offense before the game was out of reach. Led by senior forward Jasmine Penny’s 15 first-half points, DePaul managed to amass 61 points in the first 20 minutes of the contest.
Penny was not the only player that DePaul relied on for scoring. Five Blue Demons registered double-digit points during the tilt. This balance also extended to beyond the arc, as six players converted from three-point land, including a team high four from Rogowski.
The Blue Demons had an imbalanced shot selection over the first 20 minutes. The team took five more three-point shots than two-pointers in the first half. But DePaul was able to shoot over 47 percent from beyond the arc, making the three-point heavy offensive attack effective.
“We knew they were going to run and shoot threes quickly,” Delaney-Smith said. “We thought we were ready for that, but we didn’t start well.”
With the Blue Demons’ lead over 30 for most of the second half, the Crimson managed to rally towards the conclusion of the game. The team ended the game on an 11-4 run to cut the final deficit to 24 points.
This is the third straight opening game that Harvard has dropped. The squad last won its season debut against Maine in 2010.
Junior forward Erin McDonnell and sophomore forward AnnMarie Healy led the offense for Harvard, each registering 13 points in the contest. That mark is a career-high for Healy, who had not reached double-digit scoring with the Crimson during her freshman year.
“AnnMarie stepped up big,” Delaney-Smith said. “She played at a level we knew she could play at, but hadn’t been able to do so consistently. She brought it last night.”
Harvard did not experience the same success as DePaul from deep, shooting just 5-for-23 from beyond the arc in the contest. Senior guard Jasmine Evans and freshman guard Taylor Finley were each able to knock down two three-pointers apiece.
“Our performance from three against DePaul wasn’t indicative of how well we can perform,” junior guard Ali Curtis said. “In order to get good open threes, we have to move the ball around, reverse the ball, get everyone involved.”
Turnovers hindered the Crimson attack all night. The team turned the ball over 20 times over the course of the game, which led to 24 Blue Demons points.
“We knew that they were going to pressure us,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s what they do…but they put us back on our heels unfortunately.”
DePaul also struggled with turnovers, losing possession 16 times in the game. But the Blue Demons were able to limit the damage, holding Harvard to only 10 points off turnovers in the contest.
Co-captain Christine Clark led the Crimson with four assists on the night, while senior combo guard Melissa Mullins grabbed a team-high nine rebounds in addition to her eight points.
Harvard never held the lead in this game. DePaul started off the game on a 12-1 run, capped by a layup from junior guard Megan Rogowoski. The Blue Demons did not look back from there.
“It was the season opener at their home court against a very good team,” said Delaney-Smith. “You don’t roll over and die from this. You look to the next game and learn from this one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past four years, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has only beaten Princeton twice. The first was a 3-0 sweep in Princeton, N.J. on Oct. 19 and the second was on Friday night at the Malkin Athletic Center, again in straight sets. The win was Harvard’s sixth straight at home.
“Last time, we shut them down,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “It was our goal to so the same in our house this weekend.”
While the Crimson (13-8, 8-4 Ivy) steadily held the lead throughout the entire first and second sets to take them 25-19 and 25-18, respectively, winning the third didn’t come quite as easily.
The Tigers (9-13, 5-7 Ivy) jumped out to an early lead, but the tides began to turn as a kill by Harvard sophomore Kathleen Wallace set the Crimson on a five-point streak.
“We stuck to our system and our outsides were just on fire,” Doyle said. “We just played steady and effectively blew them out.”
Wallace and freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst led the team in kills, with 10 apiece. Just behind them was freshman setter Corinne Bain, who proved just as formidable from the backcourt as she is as the net, chipping in seven kills. Bain had her twelfth double-double of the season, with 20 assists and 15 digs. Bain split duties at the net with sophomore Hannah Schmidt, who had 14 sets on the night.
“Our setting is a pretty strong setting combination we have between Hannah and Cori,” Wallace said. “They’re very good at making strong decisions because they keep our opponent guessing in terms of who will be set next.”
The two teams continued to trade the lead 10 times until Harvard sealed the deal under Weghorst’s serve. A block by junior Caroline Walters and senior Erin Cooney brought the game to match point, and a service ace by Weghorst gave the Crimson the ‘W’.
Harvard effectively used blocking systems at the net to shut down two of the Ivy League’s top three leaders in kills per set—Princeton’s Kendall Peterkin and Cara Mattaliano. The Tigers attack unit hit at just .149 while the Crimson held an advantage with a .330 hitting percentage.
“I think our team is a very strong blocking team, but we are especially good in the middle,” Wallace said. “[Sophomore Caroline] Holte and Walters are forces to be reckoned with in our team.”

The Harvard women’s volleyball team saw its six-game home win streak come to an end as Penn (14-9, 8-4 Ivy) outlasted the Crimson (13-8, 8-4 Ivy) over five sets on Saturday.
The loss allowed the Quakers to grab ahold of second place in the Ancient Eight, splitting the position with Harvard. Yale locked up the league title with a sweep of Princeton, also on Saturday.
“Penn was definitely a disappointment,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “It was one of those matches where you can’t point to one thing you did wrong. Penn scouted us really well.”
After headlining the attack unit on Friday night in a win over Princeton, freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst and sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace both drilled 13 kills each.
“I really admire in Grace and [freshman setter] Cori [Bain] that they are very aggressive in their attacks and that takes a lot of courage,” Wallace said.
Bain notched her fifth triple-double of the season just a day after getting her twelfth double-double this fall. She hit a team-high 14 kills and added 25 assists and 13 digs.
“We played well and we fought hard,” Doyle said. “They had a really solid block and we weren’t able to adequately counter that. The fight was there, the chemistry was there and the team spirit was unwavering.”
The Crimson traded set wins with Penn over the first four sets, with the Crimson taking the first and third frames and the Quakers taking the rest.
After a fourth set in which Penn took the reins for a win, 25-13, the two teams played a tight final stanza. Harvard played four different match point opportunities before a timeout by the Quakers allowed Penn to regroup and rattle off three straight points to capture the overall win, 18-16.
“One thing we can take away from this match is our need to be able to adapt quickly to our opponents when they are doing the same to us,” Wallace said. “Penn’s blocks got better as the match went on and their defense was very scrappy.”
The game was the final homestand for seniors Doyle, Erin Cooney and Teresa Skelly. The team has not reached eight Ivy wins since 2004.
“As a team it’s the best season we’ve had in several years,” Doyle said. “Right now we’re tied for second so our goal for now is to win out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Streaks are meant to be broken, and the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (0-1, 0-1 Ivy League) saw two impressive winning streaks come to an end in its loss against Columbia (1-0, 1-0 Ivy League) on Saturday: a 14-meet winning streak against Ivy League foes stretching back to January 28, 2011, and a perfect 28-0 record against Columbia since the first contest between the two teams in 1985.
The close 163.5-136.5 loss might seem disheartening to Crimson fans. After all, over the past two years, Harvard women’s swimming and diving had been a dominant force in the Ivy League and the region. The Crimson went undefeated in a perfect 9-0 season in 2012-2013 and maintained a 7-0 record against Ivy League opponents in 2011-2012 with its only losses coming against non-conference powerhouses Northeastern and Iowa.
For the Harvard swimmers themselves, however, the positive takeaways from Saturday’s meet easily outweighed the significance of a loss on record and broken streaks.
“Yes, we may have lost the meet, but this came off of a very tough week of training,” sophomore Danielle Lee said. “On the other hand, Columbia came out ready to race, and they swam very well today. The fact that we broke six pool records and swam as competitively as we did under such conditions speaks a lot to the amount of talent on our team.”
Several newcomers to the team made their collegiate debuts in style, clinching individual wins and brightening their prospects for the years ahead. Freshman diver Elina Leiviska, a member of the Finnish national diving team, easily captured both the 1-meter (279.15) and 3-meter (285.16) diving events, while sprinter Victoria Chan dominated in both the 50-yard (23.54) and the 200-yard freestyle (1:46.80). Distance specialist Ashlee Korsberg opened up her collegiate career with a bang, winning the 1650-yard freestyle in 16:40.24, the sixth fastest time in the country.
“We had several freshmen really step up,” sophomore Kendall Crawford said. “Breaking pool records and swimming nationally ranked times—I think the entire team did a phenomenal job today, but the way the freshmen swam in their first collegiate meet was absolutely fantastic.”
Upperclassmen also put their experience and talent on display, their efforts spearheaded by Lee and senior Sara Li. Li, who swam in two individual events and two relays, won the 100-yard freestyle in 52.05 seconds and helped the 400-yard freestyle relay to a first place finish along with junior Sarah Sumner, freshman Daniela Johnson, and Lee (3:27.25). Lee, who also competed in four events, clinched individual victories in the 100-yard (54.54) and 200-yard backstroke (1:58.88).
As the narrow differential of 27 points shows, the two teams went back and forth throughout the meet. Leiviska kicked things off for the Crimson by taking the first event, the 3-meter dive, and Columbia immediately responded by going 1-2 in a highly competitive 200-yard medley relay event. Harvard’s “A” team of Lee, junior Stephanie Ferrell, Crawford, and Chan finished a close third in 1:44.34.
“I think the 200-yard medley relay was when things swung in [Columbia’s] favor,” Lee said. “But we managed to return the favor by breaking their pool records in the last event, the 400-yard freestyle relay.”
These first two events set the tone for the rest of the meet, with Harvard catching up to Columbia with a string of individual victories only for the Lions to surge ahead in the following event. Consecutive victories from Korsberg, Chan, and Lee pushed the Crimson back into the thick of things, but Columbia’s back-to-back 1-2-3 finishes in the 100-yard breaststroke and the 200-yard butterfly put some distance between the two teams.
Overall, the Crimson picked up nine event wins against the Lions’ eight, displaying the competitiveness of its top swimmers; Depth seemed to be the missing piece of the puzzle as Harvard only managed 19 top-3 finishes on the day to Columbia’s 32.
Rather than mull over the loss, however, the team remains poised for success in the upcoming meets.
“We have been pushing ourselves very, very hard throughout the training season,” Crawford said. “Our focus is on the big meets that matter, such as the Texas Invitational in December. We might have lost the first meet, but there is nowhere to go from here but up.”
Streaks are meant to be broken, but broken streaks are meant to begin anew.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Brown sophomore Ammu Mandalap on Sunday afternoon, Harvard captain Hannah Morrill finished her Harvard Invitational with an unblemished record. Not only did the senior earn three wins in singles play on the weekend, she also partnered with freshman Monica Lin with the duo winning all three of their doubles matches on the weekend.
The Harvard Invitational, a three-day round robin style tournament, featured players from Harvard, Brown, Illinois, and Boston University. The tournament is the last of the fall season for the Crimson, as Harvard will shift gears into team match play for the spring season.
“Playing in a mock dual format is always fun because you get the feeling of a spring dual tournament,” coach Traci Green said. “We competed very well as a team this weekend, but there are still some individual things we need to work on. Overall, I am very glad that our freshman got a chance to get their feet wet in the spring dual format.”
Harvard started the weekend with strong play across the board on Friday, following three doubles wins over BU in the morning with five wins in singles play. Freshman Spencer Liang and sophomore Amy He earned the first win of the day for the Crimson in doubles play as they knocked off the Boston University pairing of senior Leonie-Charlotte Athanasiadis and sophomore Johanna Hyoty 8-7(4).  Morrill and Lin then cruised to an 8-3 win over the Terriers’ sophomore duo of Lauren Davis and Madison Craft. Sophomore Amanda Lin and freshman Danielle Mirda rounded out the day for the Crimson pairs, defeating rookies Barbara Rodriquez and Iris Lin of Boston University.
On Friday afternoon, Mirda was the only Harvard player to not face an opponent from Illinois, earning a 10-8 victory in a third-set tiebreaker to take the match over Craft from Boston University. Monica Lin, Morrill, Amanda Lin, and Liang all defeated their Fighting Illini opponents with Monica Lin winning a tightly contested match with freshman Jerricka Boone, 6-2, 3-6, (13-11).
Saturday brought doubles matches against conference rival Brown and singles matches against BU for the Crimson. The doubles teams’ success against the Terriers on Friday did not carry over to Saturday morning, as Harvard dropped two out of three matches to the Bears. The lone win on the morning for the Crimson came from the duo of Morrill and Monica Lin.
“I think Hannah played very well and fought really hard,” Liang said. “She came out focused and intense; she showed a lot of leadership in her attitude this weekend.”
Harvard faired better against BU in the singles matches Saturday afternoon as Liang, Monica Lin, and Morrill all notched two-set victories. Amanda Lin, meanwhile, fell 6-2, 6-2 to Rodriquez of BU, whom she had beat just a day earlier in a doubles match.
Sunday morning saw Liang and He bounce back from a loss on Saturday with an 8-3 win over the freshman Illinois doubles pair of Boone and Louisa Kwong. Meanwhile, Morrill and Monica Lin continued their winning ways with an 8-2 defeat of Fighting Illini junior Julia Jamison and sophomore Emily Barretta.
“Coach Green is mixing up the [doubles] teams a lot because we are still getting to know each other both on and off the court,” Liang said. I think Amy and I are a very good team. We had some ups and downs this weekend, but I love playing with her.”
On the singles side, Brown got the better of the Crimson on the day, winning three of the five matches between the two squads. Mirda took down fellow freshman Victoria Traynor of Brown in a close match, 7-6(4), 3-6, (10-8) to go along with Morrill’s win.
Morrill is one of two seniors on the team, and with the Crimson missing multiple players this weekend the captain stepped up.
“Hands down the overall best performance from our team came from our senior captain Hannah Morrill,” coach Green said. “Hannah has been really leading by example all semester and has been coming in for extra work. It was great to see all that hard work pay off for her this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
None of the individual stats are impressive. No Harvard football player had 60 receiving yards, 80 rushing yards, or 200 passing yards Saturday at Columbia. Junior quarterback Conner Hempel completed less than 60 percent of his passes, went a second straight week without a touchdown pass, and threw his fifth interception of the year.
But then you look at the score.
Even without any of its big guns firing, the Crimson still had plenty of firepower to blow by the Lions, 34-0.
In the first 17 minutes, Harvard scored three touchdowns while Columbia punted on its first seven possessions. The Crimson took its foot off the gas after that, but those first three drives were some of Harvard’s most impressive of the year.
Hempel was 7-for-9 during the stretch. Sophomore running back Paul Stanton collected 78 yards on just three rushes. Senior Scotty Miller had his longest punt return since he started fielding them fulltime. On the corresponding three Lions drives, Columbia accrued just five yards combined without getting a single first down.
A year after Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he “felt badly” that his Crimson obliterated the Lions, 69-0, Harvard clearly slowed itself down after taking the 21-0 lead. Murphy pulled Stanton to protect him for next week, and Hempel was left to work with what amounted to the second team offense.
The Crimson did not score again until the fourth quarter, but after its hot start, it did not need to.
CLEAN UP SONG
Harvard committed 11 penalties against both Dartmouth and Princeton over the last two weeks.
Saturday, the Crimson cleaned up its act, committing only two penalties all day.
Harvard did so with a great number of bodies rotating onto the field. Eight players recorded a rush, and seven caught at least one pass while 25 defensive players recorded a tackle.
With receivers Andrew Fischer and Seitu Smith and tight end Cameron Brate out due to injury, the blowout gave Hempel an opportunity to work with several wideouts he had not played with before.
The defense also got to work with new personnel packages. With defensive linemen Nnamdi Obukwelu and Jack Dittmer sitting out, and Obum Obukwelu leaving the game early with an injury, senior Danny Frate stepped up, tallying 1.5 sacks, and Murphy called more blitzes to put pressure on Columbia quarterback Trevor McDonagh.
“We didn’t have three of our top four defensive linemen so sometimes you need that extra guy to get pressure,” Murphy said.
A year after Harvard tallied eight sacks, the Crimson still managed to accrue five sacks despite the injuries and substitutions.
“The kids that played, whether its new running backs, whether its new receivers, whether its new tight ends, whether its new offensive linemen—and we had all of the above today—I thought those kids did a very solid job,” Murphy said. “It was really good to get them some work.”
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS
Harvard’s stats Saturday were impressive, but that was somewhat expected. Columbia averages less than 10 points a game this year, and had given up more than 34 points in all but two of its games coming into Saturday.
Though the Lions were more competitive this year than last year, the game’s result was never really in doubt.
“The future is bright [for Columbia] but it’s not like you are just going to show up and win eight games next year,” Murphy said. “It’s just going to take time.”
At the same time, the Crimson does not control its Ivy League destiny, meaning its play will only impact the conference leaderboard if Princeton slips up.
Saturday, the Tigers did not. Though they trailed Penn in the third quarter, the Princeton offense eventually prevailed, scoring 21 straight points to end the game up, 38-26.
Harvard has to hope that Princeton trips up against Yale or Dartmouth, while also working to avoid a second loss that would knock the Crimson out of contention all together.
“We are going to enjoy the win today, tomorrow,” Hempel said, “And then turn our focus to Penn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A lot of things have changed in the past 100 years, but the wrestling program at Harvard has remained the same. The beginning of the 2013-2014 season marked 100 years of Harvard wrestling.
The Crimson opened its centennial season on Sunday at the John Kaloust Bearcat Open at Binghamton University in Binghamton, N.Y. After losing senior co-captains Steven Keith and Walter Peppelman at the end of last season, this year’s team is calling upon some young talent in order to continue its trend of winning seasons. 
With seven freshmen joining the squad, the opening match of the season was a chance to become acquainted with the differences between high school and college wrestling. 
“The first tournament is always a big shocker, but we had a really strong performance out of some of the young guys,” senior co-captain Cameron Croy said. “A lot of guys really stepped up, which was something not a lot of us were expecting.” 
Two of the key contributors were freshmen Eric Morris and Tyler Grimaldi. Grimaldi, who wrestled at 157, advanced to the quarterfinals before being taken down by Cornell’s Brian Realbuto, who has been a national qualifier multiple times in his college career and was ranked No. 13 in the nation in the weight class. After battling the entire match, Grimaldi fell short by one point, 11-10.
“I’m a freshman, and he’s a senior so he has a lot more experience than I do,” Grimaldi said. “I just came out and kept pushing him and pushing him to his breaking point which felt good. That’s definitely a win I’m looking to pick up later in the season.”
Morris came close to finishing in the top three in the 174-pound weight class but fell to Cornell’s Jesse Shanaman, who was ranked No. two in the country in the weight class, in the consolation championship match. 
“They’re wrestling at a very high level,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Now we know where the bar is set…. When it comes to January and February their improvement is going to be huge. I’m more excited about that than how they wrestled today.”
Although Sunday was only open tournament, allowing each team to enter as many wrestlers as it chooses without having points contribute to the overall team score, Weiss believes that the season has started on a positive note. 
“These tournaments are different,” Weiss said. “I don’t want to say that results don’t matter, but right now what’s most important is getting guys matches. We don’t look at it as how many guys placed, we look at the performances.”
 For Croy, who has seen many of his teammates go through the up and downs of the season over his four years at Harvard, this start is something the team can be proud of.
“We did really well today,” Croy said. “It was the first tournament of the year and overall we had a really strong performance out of a lot of our guys and our key players really came through.”
Sophomore Jeff Ott, who came in second last year when he wrestled at 125 pounds, entered this year’s tournament in the 133-pound weight class. Ott did not repeat the success he found last year as a freshman, and after winning his first two matches of the day, fell to Penn State’s James Gulibon.
 Fellow sophomore Devon Gobbo also won his first two matches in the 165-pound weight class.  but Jake Kemerer of Lock Haven was able to defeat Gobbo, 7-6, in the third round of the tournament. 
Other key contributors to the team’s performance included Ryan Osleeb, who had two shutout matches in the 141-pound weight class before being defeated by Lehigh’s Will Switzer, 5-1, and Colton Peppelman, who was able to advance to the third round of the 174-pound weight class before losing to Princeton’s Ryan Callahan, 15-0. 
A few members of the Crimson sat out of Sunday’s tournament due to injuries. This included senior co-captains James Fox and Cameron Croy. 
“Looking at the whole thing, seeing that we haven’t been able to compete since last March, this performance was good for the team,” Weiss said. “The biggest thing we got out of this is that we got a lot better today.”
For Grimaldi and other newcomers to the team, the future holds extensive opportunities to improve.
“This year we have a really great young team that we want to take to a whole new level,” Grimaldi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team closed its fall season on a high note this weekend, placing two singles players and a doubles team on the all-tournament team at the Tribe Invitational, which was hosted by William and Mary in Virginia.
Junior Shaun Chaudhuri and freshman Sebastian Beltrame earned singles honors, while the duo of sophomore Nicky Hu and freshman Brian Yeung earned accolades for doubles.
“Overall, it was a great tournament to wrap up the fall season,” junior Alex Steinroeder said. “We did very well against William and Mary and Old Dominion, not losing any singles matches…. Nicky and Brian did a great job in doubles going undefeated against some good doubles teams.”
The tournament marked the team’s last action until January, when it will host a spring season warm-up event.
So far this fall, the Crimson has had to deal with the loss of graduated Andy Nguyen ’13 while incorporating three new freshmen into the lineup as it gears up for a run at a third straight Ancient Eight crown.
This weekend, Harvard showed that it has high hopes for matching, and surpassing last season’s heights. The tournament featured players from the Tribe, Penn State, and Monarchs. The invitational was divided into seven singles flights and three doubles flights.
On Sunday, the Crimson closed the tournament strong by going undefeated in both singles and doubles. In flight 1, Hu and Yeung took down the hosts, John Banks and Ben Hoogland, 8-6, to close out their undefeated weekend. Junior Christo Schultz and Beltrame won, 8-3, in flight 2, and co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Conor Haughey came out on top in the third flight, 8-5.
In singles, Beltrame finished up his strong weekend with a 6-4, 6-5 win over Hoogland. Classmate Yeung blanked William and Mary’s Damon Niquet, 6-0, 6-0. Freshman Andrew Ball and Schultz won in straight sets, and Steinroeder and Haughey both took three-set wins to cap the Crimson’s unbeaten day.
On Saturday, Harvard had some success in both singles and doubles.
In the first flight, MacMaster and Beltrame won, 8-6, and Yeung and Hu notched their second win of the weekend by the same score. In another first-flight match, MacMaster, playing with Steinroeder, lost in a tiebreak.
In second-flight action, Ball and Schultz lost, 8-6, to a Tribe team, but Schultz and Beltrame pulled out an 8-5 win over a Nittany Lion duo.
In singles, the Crimson notched a 4-3 record. Harvard picked up three wins in lower-flight action, with Yeung, Hu, and Haughey all prevailing.  Chaudhuri beat Penn State’s Mike Reilly in Flight 2 singles, 6-4, 6-4. But Steinroeder and Ball lost in third and fourth singles, respectively, and Beltrame lost his only match of the weekend, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3.
The team started off the tournament right on Friday by going 5-1 in doubles and 7-0 in singles. In first flight doubles, Hu and Yeung easily took down two different William and Mary duos. On court 2, MacMaster and Beltrame took an 8-6 win, and MacMaster and Steinroeder cruised, 8-1. Chaudhuri and Ball also won, 8-6, in third doubles. The only blemish on Harvard’s record was Schultz and Haughey’s 8-5 loss.
“I was glad to see Christo Schultz back in action coming off a shoulder injury most of the fall,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “Casey MacMaster played the role of doubles tutor this weekend, pairing with Steinroeder, Beltrame, and Haughey.”
In singles, the Crimson had players win in all seven flights. At the top, Chaudhuri outlasted the Tribe’s Aaron Chaffee, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4. Beltrame, Steinroeder, and Ball each won in straight sets. Hu cruised to a 6-1, 6-4 win, and Yeung and Haughey each won in three sets.
Harvard seems to be moving in the right direction as it now breaks for the winter in anticipation of the spring season.
The fact that two freshmen took home all-tournament honors indicates the Crimson’s strong position heading into the spring season.
“Our freshman are up and coming, and are beginning to step it up and learn a lot from our more veteran players,” Hu said. “Our doubles are also strong, and even though some of us are playing with different partners, our hard work with [assistant coach] Eric Butorac has really come through.”
The team believes that it has laid a solid foundation this fall to build on in the spring.
“Our goal was to compete well no matter how well we were playing, and I think we did a great job of that,” Steinroeder said. “We are all going to work hard over break, and are excited for the spring season to start.”

There are plenty of different types of girls at Harvard, and sometimes it can be overwhelming to remember them all. We've decided to help everyone out. Using a complex process of taxonomy, we have identified ten major categories of girls that you might run into in the next couple of years.
1. The LamonsterTough luck if this is the girl of your dreams. She spends over 23 hours a day in the dark depths of the library, only venturing out to feast on Annenberg prey (chicken and squash). You may see this committed student once every full moon. Although she may be appealing in an unconventional way, she’s probably more in love with her Math 55 textbook than she is with you. She may be wonderful, but she has very clear priorities, and finding love is not at the top of the list.
 
 
2. The Secret StudierA distant relative of the Lamonster, this species of girl has come to hide her obsessive study habits. She makes college look effortless and it may seem like she has it all—the parties, the grades, the extracurriculars, and, most elusively, the sleep—but beware. The “five minutes” she put in for her big midterm may have been closer to five hours.
3. The Girl from “The City”You can spot this girl from a mile away. She is attractive, fashionable, and has a little bit of an edge that you may find appealing. She travels in the same pack she did in high school and is rarely without companions from The Big Apple. If you don’t have a New York driver’s license, your chances with this girl are greatly diminished.
 
 
4. The Hipster ChickFully equipped with the glasses, the boots, and the skinny jeans, this girl missed her true calling at Brown or NYU. She rejects American consumerism, reads Jack Kerouac, and prefers to talk about bands that you have never heard of. If pressed, of course, she’ll never admit that she’s a hipster. She may find true love with another hipster, but then again she may also find love with a football player. It’s all about being non-conformist.
5. The ActivistYou’ll find this girl protesting outside the Dean’s room or handing out flyers on Mass Ave. She cares more about causes than classes and wouldn’t be caught dead using a non-biodegradable napkin. She’s the most likely to change the world for the better, so it wouldn’t hurt to be her friend. But if you drive a Hummer, chances are you’re out of luck.
6. The Facebook CelebrityYou know this girl’s name even though you’ve never seen her in real life. Before coming to school it seemed she would be a dominant force, a social juggernaut. She may have even caught your attention with her prom pics (yeah, we know you looked). Her excitement was uncontainable on the Web, but she is rarely seen in the flesh. If you’re interested, try establishing contact via an old school poke war—she feels more comfortable in her native cyber environment.
 
 
7. The AthleteGenerally good looking and almost always fit, this girl may catch your attention early on. She travels to Dartmouth on the weekends and goes to bed early most nights. If you're not a member of a varsity team it may be hard to catch up with her because she’s always at practice. Non-athlete suitors may have to wait for the offseason to begin courtship.
8. The Super A-TypeIt’s hard to chat with this girl. Not because she’s hiding but because she’s perpetually running to a different club or section. She’s involved in 30 different programs at PBHA, is already a Senior Fellow at the Kennedy School, and has her sights set on the White House.
9. The InternationalThe accent makes her sound so smart. And so sexy. Hailing from some far corner of the globe—or just Canada—this girl has made a huge transition to life in the States. All things considered, she has adapted very well, but occasionally is still shocked by American culture. If you want to get her attention, pick up Rosetta Stone and really impress her.
10. The One You Fall In Love WithMaybe she caught your attention during Opening Days. Maybe she started out as a friend and your little crush has turned into something bigger. You like this girl more than you want to and it's scary.

Given the fact that we have shaken hands with over a hundred guys since setting foot at Harvard, we feel as though we’ve gotten a thorough first impression of all of you. Here’s a list of our favorite categories for the lads—try to figure out which mark you left on us ladies.
 
 
1. The Budding AlcoholicThe stench of vodka wafts to you from at least seven feet away. You look up and see him stumble slightly. This guy hasn’t had a sober night since he arrived here. He’s probably even made a few pit stops at UHS, but it’s really a point of pride for him. If you can’t fall asleep Thursday night because of the shouting outside, it’s likely his fault.
2. The HermitChances are he’s signed up for CS50, Ec 10, Gov 20, and Math 55 without realizing what he got himself into. You saw him at the occasional entryway meeting during Opening Days, but now he's holed up in his room and his HSA laundry has been sitting in front of his door for the last week. Even his roommate has no idea when he eats.
3. The Club Sport AthleteThis guy talks about his sport all the time. He loves it, he’s proud of it, and he wants you to know it. But somehow, he always forgets to mention that he’s only on the club team…
4. The Recruited AthleteNever without an entourage, this boy lives and breathes his sport. He needs his team and his team gear like we mortals need air. If you confront him without his equally tall and muscular teammates, he’s a deer in headlights who’s simply lost. It’s a cult, people. Embrace it.
5. The Preppy KidOh my. Where to begin? As Jennifer L. Armentrout once said, “Beautiful face. Beautiful body. Horrible attitude. It was the holy trinity of hot boys.” The epitome of the Harvard stereotype, he belongs in a Ralph Lauren ad. With his popped collar and snide look, this ultra preppy guy takes the cake. He’s so preoccupied with figuring out how to get punched that he probably won’t notice you waving at him.
6. The Guy Who’s Three Years Older Than EveryoneWhere have you been? What have you been doing with your life? Somehow, his gap year turned into a couple of years…but you keep him in your contacts because he can buy alcohol and you can’t.
7. The Guy Who’s Three Years Younger Than EveryoneAt first you probably thought he was a late bloomer—until you found out he’s actually just fifteen. Somehow, his brain just developed a lot better and faster than yours. You make sure to watch your language in front of him and might even feel the need to teach him about the birds and bees. The sad thing is that he’s better at math than you are; he’s even taking the harder class.
8. The Score DropperCould he be any prouder of his SAT score? At the drop of a hat, this boy will recite his scores better than most people can say the Pledge of Allegiance. Not to mention that he has his resume always on hand and business cards stuffed in all his back pockets. As soon as you meet, he rattles off his four classes and proceeds to drone on about how difficult his four p-sets were last night. No one cares, man. No one. We’re all in the same boat, so please find a new topic before we cast you adrift.
9. The ForeignerHe has the best accent and you hate that he keeps asking you questions, because all you want to do is hear him talk. He could talk about quantum mechanics and you would feign interest so that he doesn’t shut up. It’s cute that he thinks his country is superior to America, because chances are you think so too. Somehow, he knows about American politics, while you can’t name the president of Germany—that’s what they have, right? You also can’t help but treat him like a museum exhibit—“This is called ketchup. Do you have that where you’re from?”
10. The Nice GuyHe’s no more of a genius than you are. He hates working out as much as you and has just the right amount of weird you look for in a friend. When you’re around him, you fall into your niche and forget the fact that you met just two weeks ago. He’s pretty immature, which is great because you think the word “penis” is funny too, and you don’t have to hide that fact even though you’re in the great institution of Harvard.
In the next four years, you’ll date a few of these—probably the preppy kid because he was cute and because you friendzoned the nice guy. You’ll also find out that these are the ten boys you meet in sophomore, junior, and senior year—they’re just a little taller and dress better.

Already it is time for the second most important showing of democracy in this fine country (after electing the U.S. president): the election of the president and vice-president of the Undergraduate Council at Harvard University. 
The UC announced this week the three tickets who will be vying for election this month, and all the election talk got us thinking. We’ve compiled a list of potential pres/vice-pres tickets that could blow any of the current candidates out of the water.
1. David Ortiz and Tom Brady 
Though “we” at Flyby are equally loving of all regions and countries, the author of this post is still riding the wave of the 2013 World Series. He would rig the election on this one, and it would be amazing. This ideal ticket’s platform would include instituting penalties not saying “wicked” enough, expanding Crimson Cash to work at Dunkin’ Donuts, serving clam chowder in every dining hall, every day, and airing every Boston sports event in every common room on campus.
2. Shakira and Rebecca Black
People always say they want more honesty and transparency in government. Well, that explains why Shakira could sway so many voters. And Rebecca Black is the perfect representative for college students’ social interests. Gotta get down on Friday, indeed.
3. N. Gregory Mankiw and Walter White
This ticket would make sure to protect the sound financial stability of our endowment… by taking care of anyone (send them to Belize, for anyone who’s caught up on “Breaking Bad”) who decides that protesting divestment entails chanting loudly at inconvenient times. This ticket would bring the UC brains and… well, more brains, but brains that are willing to hire brawn—the perfect combination.
4. Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx
We’re sorry, but this is Harvard. You know it’s going to happen.
5. Drake & Josh
Our clear winners. We can only assume that these fictional brothers (not the real-life buddies, though they certainly would have made this short-list as well) would provide the perfect mix of representation for our esteemed student body. Drake would obviously be all over scheduling concerts, social events, and pool tournaments for the students, while Josh would adopt responsible goals like reducing the campus’s plastic waste by providing bottle-filling stations and institute open forums for students to voice their concerns directly to administrators.

For those of us who need a reprieve from red chicken and turkey burgers, or simply do not want to stand in line for a bagel at brain break (seriously—it shouldn’t take an hour for you to put cream cheese on your bagel, people...), HUDS’ cereals are a shining beacon of hope for the hungry.
However, the many cereal options can make it tough for the average snacker to decide.  Should you go for the Cracklin’ Oat Bran or the Marshmallow Mateys? What exactly are these Frosted Mini Spooners?  Will Optimum Power really give me the power I need to finish this CS50 problem set?
We at the Flyby hope to make this life-altering decision a little bit easier with our recommendations.
Best in Show: Toastie O’s.
These crowd favorites work for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The versatility of the Toastie O lends itself to perfect pairing with milk, yogurt, fruit, or even chocolate.  As if this impressive resume wasn’t enough, Toastie O’s (or, you know, their Cheerio counterparts) are clinically proven to help people lower cholesterol and live longer. By eating these little golden rings you’re not only satisfying your hunger, but also taking care of yourself. Your family physician would be so proud.
Best Guilty Pleasure:  Marshmallow Mateys.
With a main ingredient of straight up sugar, (not even disguised on the label as high fructose corn syrup) this combination of marshmallow and crunchy cereal bits will be sure to spike your energy levels, keeping you up long enough to finish your problem set. Disclaimer: may cause you to fall into a sugar-induced coma at your desk around 2 a.m.
Best Study Buddy: Apple Zings
These colorful rings are, to put it simply, a party in your mouth. While not quite as sugar heavy as our beloved Mateys, these apple-y flavored treats are addicting and perfect for continuous snacking. Grab a bowl (or three) of these along with your Gen Ed readings, and you are all set to buckle down for the long haul. Apple Zings get bonus points for fitting the fall mood everyone seems to be in lately.
Worst Cereal: CRISPY RICE
First of all, why is the name of this cereal in all capital letters?  Why does CRISPY RICE get to take all the credit for the job that Oaty Bites is doing just as well?  Besides being angered by CRISPY RICE’s clear lack of regard for the feelings of other cereals, we at the Flyby think this cereal is simply a poor substitute for the original Snap, Crackle, and Pop of our childhoods. Too bland to be eaten alone, and not versatile enough to be paired with other foods, CRISPY RICE simply falls short, and should be served only in CRISPY RICE TREAT form for the rest of its days.
Before we conclude things here, we want to make one thing clear.  From best cereal to worst cereal, it is impossible to really appreciate the flavor of each one with the tiny plastic bowls available at Brain Break. We recommend wearing running shoes and stretchy pants to this nightly event in order to prepare yourself for the multiple trips you will be making as you try to get your cereal fix.
Whether you are a cereal connoisseur, or simply like to dabble in the cereal sector, we invite you to form your own opinions on these HUDS specialties.

Far away from the comforts of home, many of us are flabbergasted when confronted with the basic requirements of acting (and looking) like civilized human beings. This guide will serve as a roadmap to navigating the challenges of taking care of yourself in Cambridge.
In the final installment of this four-part series, we will be covering delis and markets for those days when you just can’t stomach another variation of d-hall chicken.
Broadway Marketplace468 BroadwayBoasting a wide variety of specialty foods, organic groceries, gluten-free treats, tasty desserts, and daily hot meals, Broadway Marketplace is an excellent place to shop if you are looking for foods that aren’t shrink-wrapped in basement vending machines. Show your Harvard ID on weekends and save 10% off of your purchase.
Sarah’s Market and Café200 Concord Ave.With the combination of a cute checkered floor and more wooden wine racks than you’ve seen in a long time, Sarah’s offers a surprisingly down-to-earth atmosphere in addition to its selection of foods and snacks. With breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus that seem to stretch on longer than your coursepack readings, you can be assured that Sarah’s has something to satisfy your non-d-hall dietary needs.
Cardullo's Gourmet Shoppe6 Brattle St.A quaint, if somewhat illogically structured little shop, Cardullo’s sells deli meats and sandwiches and a wide variety of foreign and specialty treats (some of which will remind you of your Grandma, if you know what we mean). Be sure to check out their assortment of fancy crackers and cheeses for when you want to throw a classy party in your dorm.
CVS1426 Massachusetts AveOkay, we understand that you’ve probably been to CVS at some point during your stay here at Harvard. The convenience translates to higher prices, but let’s face it: very few places offer so much in so little space. Make sure to sign up for an Extra Care card to snag some additional savings and earn money off of future purchases.
Market In the Square60 Church St.Rivaling CVS with 24/7 hour service, Market In the Square offers both hot and cold food bars in addition to a limited assortment of pricey grocery goods. For all of your late night hankerings for food, you can go out well past Noch’s and Felipe’s closing times and try one of Market In the Square's Boar’s Head sandwiches. See how to handle this freshman-15-inducing temptation here.
