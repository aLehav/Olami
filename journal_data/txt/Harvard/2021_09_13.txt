After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1869, essayist W.E.H. Lecky wrote optimistically about the ‘expanding circle’ of human morality — at first including “merely the family, soon … a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity.” (Not unlike the spread of a pandemic, I hear you say.)
Covid-19 has reshaped the world, causing untold suffering and upending the norms we took for granted. When the history books are written, I feel that the most remarkable part of the story will prove to be the spectacular research and manufacturing success that has granted the world multiple highly effective vaccines against Covid-19, a pathogen that did not exist this time two years ago. This is incredible. At Harvard, vaccines are the reasons why students are back on campus at last. In Ireland, where I’m from (as was Lecky, as it happens), the roll-out is proving hugely successful.
However, what remains to be determined is whether this particular chapter of future history books will feature a deeply depressing footnote — namely, about vaccine stockpiling.
As of Sept. 11, 2021, the United States has administered 112.8 doses per 100 people in its population; the European Union, 121.8 doses; and Africa, just 8.7 doses. At the outset of the pandemic, rich nations understandably but selfishly rushed to protect their populations and preemptively bought many more vaccines than needed. We now are faced with the appalling prospect of discarding billions of unused and expired vaccine doses. As reported by the British Medical Journal, the U.S. is projected to have 1.8 billion surplus doses due to expire by the end of 2022. The E.U. is on course for a surplus of 2.8 billion in the same period. Greed has been compounded by unexpectedly low uptake in certain communities and highly cautious three-month expiry dates for several jabs, resulting in a stunningly inequitable global distribution of these precious vaccines.
This is gravely wrong. In particular, it is grotesquely unethical that rich countries continue to procure supplies to commence large-scale booster campaigns for already-vaccinated, healthy adults, while medically vulnerable people and frontline healthcare workers contract and die from Covid-19 in large numbers in the rest of the world. As World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has declared, “We cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it.” Dr. Ghebreyesus has called for a moratorium on booster shots.
In the months preceding my move to Boston, I volunteered as a doctor with a medical charity in Tanzania. Covid-19 was everywhere. Patients and staff alike were contracting it, though deficiencies in testing meant the number of cases was impossible to quantify. I remember a colleague telling me in a quiet voice that several doctors had recently died in another region’s hospital. I was fully vaccinated. He was not. I felt ashamed.
In the U.S., the Biden administration has made some statements of intent to address this inequity, such as a plan to donate over half a billion vaccine doses in the coming year. However, the pace of delivery since that announcement suggests that target will not be met — particularly as a federal plan to offer booster shots to healthy adults is unveiled. The cynic in me wonders if such pledges are mainly concerned with keeping up with China.
For two reasons, this injustice should trouble Harvard students. Firstly, as members of a prestigious and truly international community, Harvard students should appreciate better than most that the gap between domestic concerns and global issues has never been narrower. The urgency of this truly global problem speaks for itself.
Secondly, on a more self-interested basis, we must realize that vaccine stockpiling is not only deeply wrong, but self-defeating. Gains made in this pandemic — exemplified by Harvard’s campus coming to life with the arrival of students for in-person teaching — are fragile, reversible, and inextricable from global instability. Covid-19 transmission rages unchecked among billions of unvaccinated people in poor regions of the world and these are almost precisely the conditions most conducive to the emergence of an escape variant capable of evading the defenses of our current vaccines, landing us back at square one.
So — as Albert Camus’s protagonist Dr. Rieux exhorts the townspeople of Oran — the only way to fight the plague is with decency. The only way to eliminate the threat of Covid-19 anywhere will be to eliminate it everywhere. For reasons of both ethics and self-interest, we cannot permit billions of people to be left behind. If you agree, contact your local representative and tell them as much. Even better, donate something to Gavi and the COVAX initiative.
In this strange world of mask-wearing and elbow-bumping, we have realized that the welfare of those around us, even those we do not know, is inextricable from our own. Of course, as Lecky would remind us, this was true all along.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today’s horoscopes are as follows. Cancer: This is a period of restlessness and change. Don’t forget yourself and where you came from. You are stronger than the waves ahead of you. Virgo: Remember that the people you love feel the same for you, even if it doesn’t always feel like it. Leo: You are meant for great things. You will achieve what you set out to do this week.
If any of that made you groan and roll your eyes, you’ve got company. Seventy-one percent of adults in the U.S. don’t believe in astrology. The reasoning for this disbelief varies. Some think horoscopes are purposefully vague, generic statements designed to make naive foals go, “Oh my god, so me!” Some think star signs are fun but ultimately braindead trivia for the backs of gossip magazines. Some simply don’t think the planets above have anything to do with the rocky molding of a personality on Earth.
I used to be one of these people. As a prospective Computer Science concentrator, I was ferociously proud of my perceived utter rationality. With my objective, analytical mind, I quickly denounced astrology’s resonance as mere law of large numbers.
But I am not a fully rational person — no one can be. We are living, breathing flesh, with minds full of weird ticks and idiosyncrasies. I roll rings around my fingers to calm myself; I duck around open ladders in doorways and open umbrellas indoors; I manifest good days by looking myself in the mirror before I leave and mouthing to myself that it’s going to be a good day.
It’s hard to admit, especially at Harvard, that not every one of our actions is Game Theory Optimal, the computed best response to all the given input. We think we have to be these pictures of logical, ice-cold intellect to be here, presenting ourselves with the same formality that we lay out argumentative essays and mathematical proofs. Of course we don’t believe in astrology.
But maybe we should take a moment before immediately dismissing astrology. People have attached divinity and prophecy and meaning to the stars since the second millennium BC, and today we throw away the practice in the span of seconds. We need to go back to the basics before making final decisions on the validity of astrology in our lives.
Forget all the surrounding narratives of pseudoscience and New Age beliefs. At its core, all astrology does is tell you about the sky as a snapshot of the moment when you were born. Where was Pluto, or Saturn, or the Moon? What constellation was peeking out over the horizon? From the meanings ascribed to these celestial objects and their relationships with each other, astrologers can begin to divine a sense of your selfhood.
It’s not necessary that every interpretation an astrologer makes regarding your birth chart is true. But learning about your natal chart, about these planets that are thought to map out potential challenges and ways of being, teaches you about yourself in the same way that a conversation with a friend reveals a parallel between your experiences, or a coin toss forces you on one side or another of a difficult decision. You look to the external and the unchanging as a steady hand with which to address the turbulence inside of you. Astrology is no different — its objects are just farther away.
On top of self-awareness, astrology teaches self-love. When you remove your line of sight from the immediacy of yourself and take on the space and perspective that astrology provides, you treat yourself with the kindness you afford struggling peers or older relatives. In the stars’ eyes, you are just a speck — but you are a significant one, created with intent, with every planet aligned just so at your birth. There is a powerful interplay between innateness and agency woven into astrology that allows you to remain secure in yourself while making positive change.
Look up into the night sky. Even if one star is in the wrong place, there are still millions more that might tell you something meaningful about yourself. Suspend your disbelief. Ignore the over-rational voice in your mind that throws in the towel at the first inconsistency. And run away into the stars with me, into the lovely starry night of you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July of 2019, Harvard disciplined Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. with a two-year administrative leave for sexual harassment — the consequence of his abhorrent treatment of his female employees.
Now, two years have passed, and Fryer is back.
Precipitating his dismissal, female staff and researchers in EdLabs — the think tank Fryer directed — accused him of creating a hostile environment and engaging in years of unwelcome sexual conduct. Fryer denied these allegations, but the University’s decision made it clear they found otherwise.
The upshot? Fryer’s return to the esteemed position of professor sends the message that Harvard is a university that permits a culture of sexual harassment.
Ideally, sexual misconduct — verbal or physical — should be grounds for removing a faculty member from Harvard and revoking their tenure. Instead, Fryer is back in the classroom, teaching undergraduates; the two-year suspension is but a slap on the wrist.
Harvard has an obligation to protect its students. Instead, it is allowing a faculty member who it has found “violated University sexual harassment policies” to educate its undergraduates. This undermines the University’s Title IX policy — and the training it has us complete every year to understand it — ultimately sending a message of hypocrisy to its students. Women in the Economics department now must decide whether or not they wish to take a class from a professor who allegedly “objectified and sexualized” his female employees.
This is an unfortunate side-effect of tenure-related decisions that contradict the interests of students they serve. In an environment where one in three undergraduate women have attested to experiencing “some form of nonconsensual sexual contact,” the safety and education of students should be at the forefront of all hiring (and firing) decisions. The University should have a very high bar for the professors it expects us to take classes from and interact with, and at a very minimum, that bar should be safety and nondiscrimination.
This is all not to say that perpetrators cannot change and become restored in their community — they can. But this instance is a matter of students’ safety and comfort under the skewed power dynamic of a professor-student relationship: Fryer should not return to Harvard classrooms. Since, to our dismay, Fryer will be teaching this fall, Harvard should notify students in Fryer’s course of the findings of their investigations against him. He should not be allowed to interact with students alone, in office hours or any other spaces.
We do not make this ask lightly: The loss of Fryer as a trusted educator and mentor at Harvard is a heavy one. His history of misconduct prods at the spirits of those who have been following his work and accomplishments for years. In 2008, then 30-year-old Fryer became the youngest Black professor ever to earn tenure at Harvard — that’s massive. But Fryer’s actions of sexual harassment have turned what was once a source of hope into a collective disappointment, distributed and carried amongst all of the students who once looked up to him. Students of color, especially, have been stripped of a role model. Fryer could have been an excellent advisor to students eager to tackle the economics of inequality — an immensely important area of research — but students have been denied this opportunity, and the world is worse off because of it.
Students will have exceptional trouble looking elsewhere for mentorship and guidance, namely because Fryer’s expertise and background is somewhat one-of-a-kind at Harvard. This speaks loudly to the deeply rooted problems of exclusivity within the University’s hiring process. It is simply unreasonable that only one professor had dominated the Department of Economics at Harvard.
But while Fryer’s research, mentoring, and teaching are important to Harvard students, his actions have made the decision easy. Fryer cannot stay here if the University’s position on sexual harassment is to be tenable.

In the past 18 months, Harvard Square has undergone an extensive transformation, with new shops opening during the pandemic, as well as long-established stores closing for renovations or leaving the Square for good.
Here’s what’s changed in the Square.
Family-owned eatery Café Pamplona closed its doors in May 2020 after 62 years in the Square. Nina S. Hovagimian, the cafe’s owner, cited Harvard’s decision to send students home as the primary reason behind the store’s closure.
Playa Bowls, which sells açaí bowls, opened its first Cambridge location in August 2020 on Mt. Auburn Street. Store owner Dana S. Nentin said opening the shop amid the Covid-19 pandemic was a “challenge,” but Playa Bowls has since worked with Harvard student brand ambassadors to expand the shop’s campus presence.
Farm-to-table pizzeria Source opened in November 2020 on Church Street, originally the site of the city’s first fire station. According to Daniel P. Roughan, the owner of Source, the restaurant prides itself on sourcing the majority of its ingredients from local distilleries, breweries, and farms. Roughan also said Source frequently makes adjustments to its menu depending on the availability of its locally sourced ingredients.
The Harvard Coop temporarily closed its 1400 Mass. Ave. flagship store for renovations in December 2020. This past weekend, the Coop celebrated the reopening of their newly renovated store – and its 140th birthday – with an authors reception, as well as a celebration on Palmer Street.
Spyce, a fast-casual restaurant that uses automated kitchens, opened its second Boston-area location in January 2021, taking over the 1 Brattle Square space formerly occupied by Chipotle. Last month, salad chain Sweetgreen – which also has a location in the Square – acquired Spyce with the intention of incorporating its robotic technology into its own stores.
After 34 years in the Square, Border Cafe shuttered its doors permanently in February 2021, in the aftermath of a two-alarm fire in December 2019. Border Cafe loyalists reacted in shock to the news, with Denise A. Jillson – executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association – saying she would miss the “loud, boisterous, wonderful music” played at Border.
The Charles Hotel terminated Benedetto’s lease in April 2021, less than five years after the restaurant debuted in the hotel. Bar Enza – a collaboration between Michelin-starred chef Mark R. Ladner and the Lyons Group – is set to occupy its location in the Charles Hotel in September 2021, offering “good, honest, simple, local Italian-inspired cuisine,” according to Ladner.
In July 2021, Lovepop, a specialty card retailer, opened its largest brick-and-mortar store at 18 JFK St., which previously housed stationary chain Papyrus. The business was established by Harvard Business School alumni Wombi S. Rose and John P. Wise, who created their concept in a basement and went on to appear on the television show Shark Tank.
Japanese ramen brand Menya Jiro – which first originated in Ibusuki, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan – opened its first Boston location at 57 JFK St. in July 2021. Known for its customizable ramen bowls, Menya Jiro joined Santouka, another Japanese ramen brand, in the Square.
After more than two decades in the Square, Thai restaurant Spicies will close its doors in the coming weeks, with Boston Ramen Co. set to occupy the store’s 24 Holyoke St. space. Spicies’s departure will leave Nine Tastes as the sole source of Thai food in the Square, while Boston Ramen Co. will join Santouka and Menya Jiro as the third option for ramen in the area.
Seniors who moved back to campus for the first time after one and a half years noted how different the Square had become. Ryosuke Takashima ’22 wrote in an email that the scenery around campus has “changed a lot.”
Tram Nguyen ’22 noted that large chains have replaced many mom-and-pop shops.
“[The new businesses] are so expensive, and they seem more like chains, instead of locally-owned stores,” she said. “So I am a bit disappointed, but it still adds a lot of variety to the options in Harvard Square.”
“Support local businesses!” Nguyen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, an FAS panel overseeing the College curriculum, plans to vote Tuesday on a proposal to eliminate shopping week for the Spring 2022 semester.
The proposal — put forth by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office — suggests hosting an early course registration period ahead of the spring term, citing public health concerns.
In the proposal, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote that the “rapid increase” in Covid-19 cases at the beginning of the fall 2021 semester served as a motivation for the move to an early course registration model next semester.
“Characteristic overcrowding of classrooms during shopping will contribute to an unsafe environment,” Burke wrote. “We would also be unable to contact trace positive cases if students were not required to register for classes until the fifth day of the term according to the traditional Spring term schedule.”
“Last academic year, the peak of positive COVID cases occurred following move-in during the first week of classes in Spring term,” Burke added, referring to the 2020-21 school year.
Under the proposed registration system, there would be a virtual course preview period and undergraduates would have until Jan. 20 to register for courses before the spring semester begins four days later.
Students have rallied to support shopping week this term, with more than 1,300 Harvard affiliates signing a petition to “bring back shopping week,” the traditional period at the start of the semester during which students can browse classes before finalizing their schedules. For three semesters in a row, the FAS has instead hosted a virtual course preview period.
The Undergraduate Council voted last week to launch an undergraduate-wide referendum on shopping week and officially campaign to “save shopping week, stop early course registration.”
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, a UC representative for Quincy House, encouraged undergraduates to participate in the referendum, which begins Tuesday.
“Shopping week might never come back if we don’t speak up in this referendum,” Cheng said.
Cheng said he wishes the College would “just be transparent” about their discussions around shopping week.
“As far as we’re aware, there haven’t been any listening sessions about shopping week yet,” Cheng said. “There hasn’t been an administrative survey or anything.”
At the committee meeting, administrators will also discuss allowing undergraduates to take Harvard Summer School courses online for credit at the College, as well as instituting a pandemic exception to allow students to take term-time online courses for credit if instructors have been permitted to teach remotely.
The EPC will also discuss forming a subcommittee that would develop a proposal to allow double concentrations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Labor activists at Harvard have renewed their calls for permanent residency for individuals with Temporary Protected Status after the Department of Homeland Security announced extensions for recipients from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan on Thursday.
TPS allows certain foreign nationals to stay in the United States if they are unable to return safely to their country of origin. The extension will last for 15 months and will automatically apply to all recipients.
Before the announcement, recipients from the six countries were set to lose their statuses on Oct. 4. The extension is the result of two injunctions and one stay from federal district courts, according to the announcement. All three cases were filed after former President Donald Trump’s administration moved to restrict or terminate TPS for a number of countries in the first years of his presidency.
The Harvard TPS Coalition formed in early 2018 after then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen announced the TPS designation for El Salvador would end Sept. 9, 2019.
Doris Reina-Landaverde, a custodian and one of the five co-founders of the Harvard TPS Coalition, said she was “so happy” about the extension but ultimately will continue to “put pressure” on President Joe Biden and his administration to provide permanent residency to recipients of TPS.
“We continue to put pressure, but now TPS holders feel release because we are thinking about if we don’t have answers, we can lose our job and lose everything,” Reina-Landaverde said. “Now, 15 months, we’re happy, but it’s not what we want; we still put the pressure.”
Reina-Landaverde is a TPS holder from El Salvador. Along with Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers member Genevieve Butler, UNITE HERE Local 26 member Edward B. Childs, custodian Julio A. Perez, and dining employee Martha I. Bonilla, Reina-Landaverde co-founded the coalition to advocate for protecting the TPS designation from possible termination.
According to coalition members, the Harvard Coalition will join the National TPS Alliance on Sept. 20 to march on Washington D.C. to call for green cards for TPS holders, Dreamers, and essential workers. Democrats in Congress are currently pushing for immigration reform through budget reconciliation.
“Our demand to Congress has always been permanent residency,” Perez said. “We still have to wait, probably until the end of September, to hear an answer: who stays in the reconciliation bill and who does not stay?”
Perez, who is also a TPS holder from El Salvador, added he is tired of “false promises” from Congress and is determined to win permanent residency for the more than 300,000 TPS recipients. That includes approximately 200 working at Harvard, he said.
On Saturday, the coalition held a teach-in outside the Phillips Brooks House and painted signs for the march reading “Harvard TPS Coalition,” “Home is Here,” and “Harvard Workers Are United.”
Sonia M. Acosta, a custodian and a former TPS recipient, said in an interview at the teach-in that she would like others to understand the importance of efforts to maintain TPS and obtain permanent residency for holders.
“I would like them to know more about TPS and try to help and support the people who are fighting for this, because that’s very important not only for Harvard, because Harvard has many custodians that have TPS,” Acosta said. “It’s important for the whole United States.”
The cause has received formal support from Harvard. In 2018, then-University President Drew G. Faust penned a letter to Congress, calling on lawmakers to protect TPS holders from deportation.
Last December, University President Larry Bacow wrote to Biden to encourage him to extend TPS status for immigrants in countries affected by conflicts and disasters. He also wrote to U.S. senators in 2019 to call for further protections for those with TPS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A trip to Taiwan. A Covid-19 research project in Cambridge. A worship program in Wisconsin.
Nearly 20 percent of students chose to take time off upon learning that Harvard would continue virtual instruction and only invite select classes back to campus for the 2020-2021 school year.
With the return of all undergraduates this semester, many students who took a gap year said they are returning to campus with a changed perspective on life and new goals for their time at Harvard.
May N. Moorefield ’23-’24, who is interested in pursuing medicine, said she spent her gap year conducting research at the Harvard Gender Science Lab and Massachusetts General Hospital.
“Getting the opportunity to really study the pandemic as it was occurring — especially along gender axes which are often neglected — that was really special, and I think it was almost a form of coping with what was going on,” Moorefield said.
She added that she felt “uncertain” about her decision to take time off at first.
“Losing that identity as a student at first was kind of uncertain like, ‘Oh my gosh, was this the right decision?’ But then as time progressed, it really ended up being exactly what I needed,” Moorefield said.
For Eileene J. Lee ’23-’24, the prospect of a gap year meant that she could travel to Taiwan to visit her grandparents and take Chinese classes at National Taiwan University, while also working on gaining Taiwanese citizenship.
“My biggest takeaway is that I really do love my family a lot,” Lee said. “Spending time all together has just made me want to call them and talk to them more often.”
Though she spent her gap year in an academic environment, Lee said she has found certain aspects of transitioning back to Harvard to be difficult.
“Now, coming into sophomore year, I have to declare my concentration,” she said. “I feel like I’ve been away for so long that I kind of forgot how to do things here.”
Other students said they chose to take time off to hone hobbies and explore interests outside of academics.
Wildman “Wiley” Schubert Reed ’21-’22, who is studying physics, said he spent his gap year working on his music to pursue a career as an indie rock artist.
“Although I never would have taken a gap year had we not gone online, being able to actually have a reason to stop and think about why I might want to do that was great and gave me lots of really, really committed music time that I never would have gotten,” Reed said.
Though Reed said it feels a “little weird” to return to campus, he said he believes there has been a shift in campus culture.
“For some reason, I think people feel a lot nicer now,” he said. “I don’t know if that’s just because everyone’s been through a lot and kind of recognizes that everyone else has been through a lot or because everyone is just grateful to be back.”
Some students reported their gap years serving as a much-needed respite from the rigor of academics.
Henry Xuan ’25, who spent his gap year between high school and Harvard at a Christian program in Wisconsin, said the time off gave him time to relieve stress from high school.
“I think the gap year just gives you the time you need to really rest — and not resting in terms of sleeping more, but spiritually resting, mentally resting, psychologically taking a break from all this stress that has been building up throughout high school,” Xuan said.
Alexander E. Chan ’23-’24 said he wanted to take a gap year after realizing he did not enjoy virtual classes.
“I decided to do the Summer School, which was actually a terrible decision because I realized that Zoom classes weren’t it for me — I did not thrive academically,” Chan said.
In lieu of Zoom classes, Chan said he opted to volunteer for the Biden campaign, learn French, and, once vaccinated, travel. Having returned to campus this fall, Chan said he believes the past year has helped to normalize taking time off.
“I don’t really feel like class years matter anymore,” Chan said. “I also think maybe it’s kind of taken away a little bit of the stigma of taking time off.”
“[Harvard] is a very high pressure environment that I feel like a lot of times people think there’s a certain path that you have to take. I think this has kind of shown that you can do something a little bit different and you’ll end up just fine,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard College students returned en masse to campus this fall, they were eager to reunite with friends, join extracurriculars, and explore Harvard Square. But some had a more pressing obligation: finding employment.
According to Harvard’s Financial Aid Office, senior survey data “consistently” shows that 75 to 80 percent of undergraduates work a job at some point during their time at the College. As students return to somewhat normal life on campus, many must search for employment — a task that students interviewed said has proven especially challenging this fall.
Jailene Ramos ’24, who is a first-generation, low-income student, said she always knew working outside of the classroom would be a part of her college experience.
“Before I even committed to a college, while I was even in the application process, I knew one of my extracurricular activities during college was going to be part time jobs,” she said.
At Harvard, she said, earning a salary has enabled her to “keep up socially.”
“If you don’t get a job here you’re forced to be alienated because you don’t have the financial means,” she said.
This fall, Ramos said she has had difficulty finding employment. Though she continues to hunt for more jobs, she said she was only able to find opportunities via email.
“I heard all about these from different emails — like I really live in my inbox, because I know that there’s no real centralization of information at Harvard,” she said. “So reading my emails is the only way I can stay on top of things.”
Jordan Barton ’23 said he felt supported by Harvard and its Student Employment Office as he searched for a job his freshman year. As he hunts for employment this semester, however, Barton said Harvard has not been as supportive, citing the discontinuation of in-person employment fairs and “un-updated” career websites.
The pandemic forced the SEO to modify its operations, such as moving its job fair online to accommodate students who were dispersed throughout the world.
To try to further support students during Covid-19, the SEO contacted employers to “advocate” for more remote positions so students could continue working away from campus, Financial Aid Office director Jake Kaufmann and associate director Jen Amaya wrote in a statement. Preparing for a full student-body return this fall, Harvard “increased outreach” to all employers who previously advertised jobs with the SEO, they wrote.
Aparna Gopalan, a bargaining committee member for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, which also represents undergraduate teaching assistants, said she believes information about working on campus “could be better centralized.”
“I want for Harvard College to make working at Harvard to be just a very recognized part of being at Harvard,” Gopalan said.
The SEO offers employment resources through various initiatives, such as a jobs database, the Faculty Aide Program, which pairs students with faculty who are conducting research, Federal Work Study, and monthly newsletters, per Kaufmann and Amaya.
Barton explained that his need to sustain an income while at the College has reduced his ability to focus on academic learning.
“If one doesn’t have a firm or stable base economic security – like most FGLI students like myself do not have — the emphasis moves away from studies towards work,” Barton said.
Tenzin Y. Dadak ’25 is continuing her job as a virtual debate coach during her first year at Harvard. Though Dadak, who is a FGLI student, is already employed, she said she feels the “weight of having to work” as a freshman navigating classes and extracurriculars.
“I can already sense the challenge,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard became entangled in a feud over olive oil earlier this year when the California Legislature moved to regulate how the commodity is labeled — in part in response to the business practices of a company previously owned by Harvard Management Company.
The measure, which requires producers to label their product with the percentage of olive oil sourced from California, passed in the state Senate on Aug. 30 and the Assembly on Sept. 1, and now awaits the signature of Governor Gavin Newsom.
The controversy stems from the business decisions of Chico, Calif.-based California Olive Ranch, the country’s largest extra virgin olive oil producer, during the three years HMC had a significant ownership stake in the company.
In 2017, HMC acquired a multi-million dollar stake in COR. The purchase has never been confirmed publicly by HMC, but several people affiliated with the state’s olive oil industry said it is an open secret in California.
One of those people — Brady Whitlow, CEO of Corto Olive, a competitor company — said in an interview that he met with HMC officials in 2017 to discuss its deal with California Olive Ranch.
The next year, olive ranchers across the state suffered a historically poor harvest season due to unusual weather patterns, leaving farmers with no product to sell to distributors. In response, COR decided to launch a “global blend” series, outsourcing some production to countries like Argentina, Chile, and Portugal, all while still maintaining the California Olive Ranch label.
That decision allowed COR to preserve their space within domestic retailers and supermarkets and prevented widespread losses for the company.
Since then, COR’s change in business strategy has sparked backlash from smaller growers who allege COR’s move misled customers into thinking they consumed olive oil 100 percent produced in California.
Those olive ranchers are behind a legislative effort initially aimed at prohibiting ​​any reference to “California” on olive oil products sold that do not contain 100 percent California-sourced olive oil. That effort resulted in a bill in February — Assembly Bill 535, penned by state Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry — that proposed amendments to existing food labeling code.
Samantha Dorsey, president of the McEvoy Olive Ranch in Petaluma, Calif., alleged that as a result of blending their product with imported olive oils, COR sells their olive oil at a significantly lower price point, which undermines smaller-scale producers and the integrity of the domestic market.
“There’s multiple companies in the category that I think do California farmers a disservice with their labeling, and one of those companies is California Olive Ranch,” Dorsey said.
Michael Fox, the CEO of California Olive Ranch, wrote in a statement that the company has “very transparent” labels and is trusted for its “commitment to quality.”
“Our extra virgin olive oil regardless of source meets the strict standards for quality and purity we have here in California,” Fox wrote. “The supporters of the original measure have never shared a single data point supporting their claims.”
“We have shared numerous facts that show the California olive oil market is doing very well at retail,” he added.
The battle over AB 535 led some in the industry to allege that Harvard was partially behind COR’s shift toward using foreign olive oil, as well as more recent lobbying efforts against the bill that would undermine the strategy.
“​​HMC sat on the board when the decision was made to import foreign oil and deceptively market it under the name California,” wrote Alan Hilburg, chief of the California Coalition For Truth in Olive Oil Labeling, a political organization that supported the initial iteration of AB 535, in an email. “Those practices are why AB535 was initiated.”
Harvard spun out its natural resources team in October 2020 — including its stake in COR — to a new investment management firm, Solum Partners. HMC remains a limited partner in Solum Partners, meaning it is indirectly exposed to Solum’s investment in California Olive Ranch, though it retains little involvement in Solum or California Olive Ranch’s day-to-day management.
Patrick S. McKiernan, a spokesperson for HMC, declined to comment on its previous investments in COR or Solum Partners, citing its policy not to comment on individual investments. Joshua Clarkson, a spokesperson for Solum Partners, also declined to comment.
Hilburg wrote that California Olive Ranch far outspent its small competitors in lobbying around AB 535, in what he described as “a classic David and Goliath scenario.”
According to state records, California Olive Ranch spent approximately $81,000 in lobbying fees against the bill, while Hilburg’s coalition only spent $13,000.
The contentious fight culminated with a compromise. The legislation was amended so that companies like California Olive Ranch would still be able to use “California” on their labels, as long as they disclose the percentage of olive oil sourced from the Golden State. Fox said in his statement that COR is now neutral on the legislation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates with military backgrounds came together Saturday to honor the 20th anniversary of 9/11 at a barbeque hosted on the lawn of Harvard Business School that included remarks from University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
The event — which was co-hosted by the Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization and Bacow — featured speeches from Bacow, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, and Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization president Everett Spain. All speakers recounted their personal experiences of when the planes crashed into the towers and dedicated time to honor the people who died on that September day.
Spain led all attendees of the program in a moment of silence for the veterans and servicemembers who have died since 9/11.
In Bacow’s remarks, he traced the University’s military history — from the commandeering of the president’s mansion by George Washington on April 19, 1775 when shots were heard in Lexington and Concord, to the creation of Memorial Hall in honor of alumni who died in the Civil War.
“These spaces and many more around our campus I think are constant reminders of the connection between two of this nation’s most enduring institutions, and they give us glimpses of our past,” Bacow said.
Bacow remarked on the enduring impact of Sept. 11 on the national consciousness.
“Many of us remember exactly where we were at the moment that we got the news of the horrifying attack on our country,” Bacow said. “The impact of that day still reverberates. Today, we are still coming to understand what it meant and what the consequences are for all of us going forward.”
Though Khurana implored attendees to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks, he also recognized how 9/11 galvanized people to serve in numerous ways.
“What happened on that day, also spurred a commitment to public service for many, whether that is in the military, government, or community activism. For some, events drove a passion for saving lives, for medicine, or research,” Khurana said. “And for others, experiencing that day led to the pursuit of protecting the innocent, for advancing peace, and understanding in our world.”
Abia S. Khan ’24, a member of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps who attended the event, said she believes 9/11 impacts her day-to-day life and informs the way people perceive her and other Muslim-Americans.
“I was born into this, so I kind of took it at face value. I was like ‘Oh this is normal,’” Khan said. “[But] this is not normal. I should not be treated like this. My parents should not be treated like this.”
Eric H. Deng, a student at the Business School, said the 20th anniversary of 9/11 provides an opportunity to recognize people who continue to serve their country.
“I think it’s definitely a period of reflection. I think one of the good things about this event is that it’s bringing together this community, where we can kind of come together and reflect and kind of recognize the events from 20 years ago, recognize the sacrifices that some of our community members have made,” Dent said. “It is a continuous line of service.”

Disclaimer: Author’s housing peaked during the first semester of her freshman year
This year, as I hauled all of my stuff up to my fourth-floor walk-up in Eliot House, there was one thing that I was sure of: I was glad not to be on the fifth. In fact, between offering cookies and a night of board games to the poor boys who happened to be in our vicinity when the rest of our furniture arrived, offering words of encouragement to my fifth-floor neighbor going down to do his laundry, and obsessing over tea with my resident tutor, I have already made more of a community here than I did all of last year as a COVID first-year.
So imagine how upset I was to learn that in spite of the happiness I have found, first-years are still better off than I am. Behold, Maple Yard. Yeah.
The new yard, which is composed of literal apartment complexes and former hotels, was created in order to house the record-breaking class of 2025, and man, does it seem like they’re getting compensated for something. Or maybe I am just salty that despite my relative seniority, I am in a double with one of my roommates.
On further reflection, I am way too lazy to use any of the kitchens in DeWolfe, and before I heard of the mystical land known as the Quad, I made fun of people living in the Union Dorms. In any case, in terms of quality of housing, I have less to complain about than the class of 2023. As a freshman, I got placed into a Dunster suite with two floors, which one of our lovely former Flyby chairs admitted was her top choice until Harvard dashed her hopes of returning to campus. The room was truly lovely: I could observe people make fools of themselves outside my window, watch rats run across the Dunster entrance en route to Mather, and we only had one spider visit us, leaving my bottle of Raid unused. The nicest part was my large, roomy single! If only I had known that I had peaked then.
A few cockroaches (one of which my friend posthumously named Marty) and other run-ins later, I have come to terms with my room at Harvard. Sure, it isn’t perfect, but now that the libraries are open, I can sleep there instead of my dorm room whenever I lose myself in my psets. Yes, I’m upset that the freshmen have nicer housing than I do, but they will peak this semester and then go through the same housing lottery that we all went through. Yes, I am sad that I will never have a room as nice as the one I had in the first semester, but the isolation of that semester is something I never want to live through again. Yes, Harvard housing should be… Better in general for the amount of tuition that we are paying. But at the end of the day, it’s not about whether you have a single or whether there’s a mouse under your bed, it’s about the memories that you make with your time here. :)
