After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The winningest football coach in Harvard history has another accolade to add to his growing resume. Having surpassed his Crimson predecessors in the record books, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy now sets out to lead his peers as the 2012 president of the American Football Coaches Association.
After serving as first vice-president last year, Murphy was elected to replace Rob Ash of Montana State University at the 2012 convention in San Antonio last week. Traditionally, the association’s first vice-president assumes the role of president the following year.
“I am honored and humbled to be named president of the American Football Coaches Association,” Murphy wrote in an email. “I will do my best to provide leadership in the best interests of college football.”
As president, Murphy will lead the Board of Trustees and formulate the issues that he believes the AFCA should address. He will be aided by first-vice president Tommy Tuberville of Texas Tech University, second vice-president Mike Welch of Ithaca College, and third vice-president Mack Brown of the University of Texas.
“It’s the greatest honor for a coach to become the president of the AFCA,” said Dartmouth football coach Buddy Teevens in an interview last November. “The guys on the committee are leaders and respected leaders who care a lot about the game.”
Teevens felt that Murphy was deserving of the distinction.
“He’s surely respected nationally,” Teevens said. “People listen to him. He’s very reasoned, very considerate, and very thoughtful. He is well respected in coaching circles for his expertise and ability as a coach.”
For the next 12 months, Murphy will lead an association of over 11,000 coaches from every level of college and high school competition. The AFCA’s goals range from maintaining “the highest possible standards in football and the profession of coaching football" to providing “a forum for the discussion and study of all matters pertaining to football and coaching."
Murphy, a former linebacker from Kingston, Mass., now enters an elite group of football coaches who have reached the summit of the organization. Since Charles Daly of the Military Academy served as the association’s first president in 1921, legends like Woody Hayes of Ohio State, Paul Bryant of Alabama, and Bo Schembechler of Michigan have assumed the post.
During that time, four different Harvard coaches have led the organization. No other school has contributed as many presidents. The last Crimson leader before Murphy was his predecessor, Joe Restic, who served in 1988. Over the last 20 years, only two other schools have had two representatives serve as president: the University of Tennessee and the University of Washington.
While being elected president is one of the highest honors that the association can give, Murphy has been recognized by the AFCA before. After leading Cincinnati University to its first winning season in 11 years in 1993, the head coach was named the AFCA Regional Coach of the Year.
Eight years later, Murphy won the award for a second time after his Harvard team finished 9-0 to record its first unbeaten, untied season since 1913.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
Last week, we went through each of the individual matchups. Now, it’s time to reveal the winners. First, we take a look at two first-round men’s matchups.
Check back all this week as we go through our selections.
Josue Ortiz v. Walter Peppelman
While Peppelman had a stellar year on the mat, it’s tough to match Ortiz’s dominance. He changed opposing teams’ game plans; no coach could figure him out, and even double teams could only slow down the 450-pound bench presser so much. With the exception of Princeton, no team could run the ball on Harvard, largely thanks to Ortiz, unequivocally the D-Line’s stalwart.
What’s more, Ortiz and the football team went 7-0 and ran away with the league title. The strong play of the Harvard defense helped the offense have consistently great field position, one factor in the team’s record-breaking 374 points during the course of the season.
But Peppelman is certainly on the rise. After receiving national attention as a sophomore, the grappler has looked sharp early in his junior campaign, currently boasting a 13-3 record.
WINNER: Josue Ortiz
 
Matt Jones v. Keith Wright
Both Keith Wright and Matt Jones had monster years in 2011. Jones tallied an eye-popping 332 kills, and in the second half of the season, Wright averaged nearly a double-double, taking over contests with his inside presence.
But in the end, Jones’ volleyball team went a dismal 1-7 in league play, and the then-junior at times proved inconsistent, earning a hitting percentage below .100 eight times. By comparison, Wright elevated his play in the crucial second half of the season. The league MVP, Wright helped make history in 2011, helping Harvard capture its first Ivy crown and putting the squad just seconds away from earning its first NCAA Tournament berth.
WINNER: Keith Wright

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After trailing for nearly the entire game, the Harvard women’s basketball team had a chance to tie the score in the final seconds.
Down 60-57, sophomore Christine Clark threw up a three-pointer with five seconds left on the clock. But the shot did not fall, giving North Dakota (9-9) the victory over the Crimson (8-7, 1-0 Ivy) Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
The Harvard defense struggled throughout, especially in the first half, allowing UND to shoot a season-high 50 percent from the field during the game.
“I’m really disappointed in the first half,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It’s too late in the season for us to be so soft defensively and disconnected defensively. No excuses. We have to make an adjustment or we’re not going to be ready for the Ivy League.”
Particularly in the first half, the visitors put pressure on the Crimson’s offense, often forcing Harvard to take shots near the end of the shot clock. This pressure seemed to cause problems on the defensive side of the ball as well, where Delaney-Smith noted communication was an issue.
“Because they were pressuring the ball, playing the dribble, and jumping in the passing lane, I thought it set us back on our heels offensively,” Delaney-Smith said.
North Dakota jumped to early 5-0 lead to begin the game, then went ahead 12-6 with 14:49 remaining the first half following a three-pointer from guard Nicole Smith, who led the visitors with 12 points on the night.
Harvard battled back, eventually knotting the score at 16 after a three by Lippert, ending a 10-4 UND run.
But UND responded with an 8-2 run, putting the visitors up, 24-18, before junior Emma Golen knocked down a three.
As the first half came to a close, UND freshman Brianna Williams retrieved her own rebound off a free throw and tossed up a shot that fell as the buzzer went off, capping a 7-2 run to put UND up 31-23 heading into the break.
At the beginning of the second half, UND grabbed its largest the lead of the night after a quick 5-1 run the visitors up by 12.
Back-to-back threes by Lippert and sophomore Missy Mullins fueled an 11-4 run for Harvard, pulling the Crimson within five, 35-40, with 12:03 to play.
Harvard’s deficit soon shrank to four, as the Crimson responded to a UND three with a jumper from Lippert, who shot six of eight on the night, and a pair of free throws by captain Brogan Berry.
But UND answered with a 7-0 run that was finally ended with a Golen three at 5:19 mark.
With less than two minutes remaining, junior Miriam Rutzen hit a fadeaway jumper and Lippert knocked down a three to bring the Crimson back within four, 56-52.
But UND responded with an offensive rebound and put-back layup by center Emily Evers to go back up by six, a lead that proved to be too much for Harvard.
The Crimson managed to pull within three, 60-57, after Berry knocked down a layup off an inbounds pass coming out of a timeout, but that’s as close as Harvard would get.
The Crimson got a chance to even the score, but Clark’s three-pointer with five seconds remaining was off its mark.
On the night, the Crimson shot 40 percent from the field. Berry struggled in particular, finishing with nine points on two-of-nine shooting.
“There weren’t any shots I wouldn’t want her to take,” Delaney-Smith said. “Those are going to fall. that’s not going to happen again to her.”
Going forward, Delaney-Smith hopes the Crimson can improve its defensive toughness and bring a more consistent effort as it heads into the Ivy League portion of its schedule.
“I think at this point of the season we shouldn’t be losing games like that,” Lippert said. “But it’s definitely a gut check going into Ivy League play that we really need to bring everything.”

Collier Winters v. Dean Gibbons
In his final season with the Harvard lacrosse team, Dean Gibbons made his mark on the Crimson record book, breaking into Harvard’s all-time top 10 in points and earning a unanimous first-team All-Ivy nod. But fellow senior Collier Winters went one step further, coming back from injury—and QB controversy—to become the third ever passer to throw for at least 400 yards as well as the third to connect on five touchdown passes in a single game.
And there’s something to be said about leading a team to a perfect record in Ivy League play—the highest achievement possible for a football team ineligible for postseason action. After a loss to Holy Cross in the first game of the season, Harvard was untouchable, winning nine straight matchups by at least 10 points to close out the year. Winters finished his 2011 campaign with an impressive victory in the oldest college football rivalry in the nation, The Game, while the lacrosse team just missed out on an Ancient Eight title with a 15-6 loss to Cornell in the championship.
WINNER: Collier Winters
Gary Power v. Andrew Campbell
Although both Gary Power and Andrew Campbell fared well on the national stage in 2011, Campbell was much more dominant. While Power earned a No. 7 national ranking on the squash court, Campbell was honored as the 2011 US Rowing Man of the Year. The sophomore rower earned victories at Elite Nationals and the U23 World Championship Trials. And the matchups weren’t even close. Add a sprinkling of international achievements to all of that, and Campbell has a clear edge over his competitor from the squash team.
Power entered his first season of college squash with big shoes to fill after the graduation of Colin West ’10—the 2010 CSA Individual Champion. And the then-rookie was able to help a young Harvard team maintain its status as the fifth-best team in the nation. But Campbell’s bronze medal in the lightweight single at World Championships as well as other international accolades set him apart.
This season, the Harvard squash team looks to contend for the national championship for the first time in at least a decade, with Power currently holding the No. 3 spot on the team. Campbell is currently one of the top five lightweight rowers in the world.
WINNER: Andrew Campbell

This year Stanford's campus-wide tradition of selecting annual house themes has produced "Marvard University," an attempt by student dormitory Mars House to replicate Harvard through building decorum and party themes. Fake ivy is draped over the columns on two sides of the house entrance, while two Harvard-style crests with the parody slogan "Feritas" are displayed above the main doorway.
Sara Grossman, a Stanford senior who serves as Community Manager for the house, said she and four other student staff members came up with the idea of Marvard. Grossman explained that while Stanford's other houses are built in a Spanish style, Mars is one of the oldest dormitories on campus and has an East Coast look.
When students arrived on campus in September, they were invited to attend a Marvard University admissions party with wine and cheese. Grossman photographed each of the students dressed in their best Marvard attire, posed with wine glasses and croquet mallets. The pictures were then printed in black-and-white and posted on students' doorways.
"Obviously, we don't know what it's like to live at Harvard," Grossman said. "All we know is the button-up shirt, old-money stereotype—that's what's in the movies."
Despite playing up the elitist perception of Harvard, Marvard chose to put a different spin on Harvard's motto, Veritas. Grossman explained that "Feritas" means savage and uncivilized in Latin, and that therefore Marvard is about recognizing old traditions and rebelling against them.
"We'll have a 'Keep off the Grass' sign, but then we'll drink beer around it and frolic on the lawn," she said, referring to parties that the house has held on "Marvard Yard."
Grossman said she has enjoyed the process of creating a world within Mars. Yet reactions to Marvard have been "a mixed bag," with some residents telling her, "If I wanted to go to Harvard, I would have."
