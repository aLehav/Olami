After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lizzy Fitzhenry, a freshman on Radcliffe heavyweight crew, was recognized on Tuesday for her pre-Harvard success.
Fitzhenry’s Saratoga Junior Women’s Pair was voted 2011 “Crew of the Year” by row2k.com, one of the world’s most heavily trafficked rowing websites.
As high school seniors, Fitzhenry and her partner Kristina Wagner, currently a freshman at Yale, won the Junior Pair, the Under 23 pair, and the Championship Pair at the Canadian Henley.  They also came in second place at the USRowing Elite Nationals.
“We were so excited and surprised,” Fitzhenry said regarding the poll results. “But we trained really hard over the summer and had a strong finish to our season.”
Row2k welcomes “Crew of the Year” nominations from its readers, seeking crews who have had particularly exceptional seasons or have overcome obstacles to achieve victory.  From the reader-nominated crews, row2k chooses 10 finalists.  The winner is then selected by poll voting.
Over 8,500 total votes were cast this year, resulting in a very tight finish for the “Crew of the Year” title.  Fitzhenry’s crew only narrowly defeated last year's Cal Freshman Eight by 1.2% to win the vote. The Golden Bears were nominated by virtue of their undefeated season in which they won the freshman eight event at the IRA national championships and won the Temple Cup at Henley Royal Regatta while setting a course record in the event. Cal and Saratoga traded leads throughout the voting period, but a final push gave Fitzhenry and Wagner the win.
“We were so thankful for all of our friends, families and teammates who voted for us,” Fitzhenry said.
In addition to Fitzhenry, other Harvard rowers were also recognized by row2k.  The US Women’s Eight, with Radcliffe crew alumna Esther Lofgren '07-’09, was selected as a finalist in the competition based on its sixth straight World Championship, and the Harvard men’s freshman eight received a nomination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It truly is the most wonderful time of the year. On Dec. 25, we all shared in a gift that is way better than any Christmas sweater or box of chocolates. Yep, professional basketball is back. To ring in the good times, we at The Back Page have set out to find the best NBA match for several of Harvard’s own ballers. Which NBA player is most like each Crimson star? Keep reading to find out.
Brandyn Curry - 6.7 PPG, 4.8 Assists, 1.9 Rebounds, 2.1 steals (2011-2012 season)
The North Carolina native was recruited for his poise and leadership and was ranked as the second best high school point guard in the state behind some guy named John Wall. Suiting up for the Crimson for the first time in 2009, Curry made an immediate impact, taking home two Ivy League Rookie of the Week awards.
So far this season, Curry, now a junior, has continued his ascent. At November’s Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, Curry’s leadership was lauded by Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. The point guard shut down Utah’s biggest offensive threat in the opening round and then hit a crucial three-pointer to ice a close contest against then-No.22 Florida State. So which professional comparison did that performance earn him?
Derek Fisher, L.A. Lakers – 6.8 PPG, 2.7 Assists, 1.9 Rebounds, 1.2 steals (2010-2011 season)
In his 16th year in the NBA, Derek Fisher is far from a playmaker, and, like Curry, he has never been the main scoring threat on the floor for his team. Neither Fisher nor Curry has an impressive field goal percentage by any stretch of the imagination. Yet, both point guards always come up big in the most pressure-packed spots and can be counted on to make the smart play. Fisher also has shown the ability to play physical defense although he isn’t the most athletically gifted.
Honorable Mention: Kyle Lowry (HOU)
Check back tomorrow for the next Crimson Crossover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After four Olympic appearances with the U.S. Women’s Hockey National Team, former Harvard hockey star Angela Ruggiero ’02-04 announced on Wednesday that she is hanging up her skates.
Ruggiero, 31, retires as the all-time leader in games played for the national team. In her 256 career contests, Ruggiero amassed 208 points, with 67 goals and 141 assists.  The defender won a medal in all four of her Olympic showings, including the gold in the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, when she was a still a senior in high school.
Success followed Ruggiero to Harvard, where she helped the Crimson win the NCAA National Championship in 1999.  During her collegiate career, the Simi Valley, Calif. native scored 96 goals, giving her the sixth highest total—and the most among defenders—in program history.
In all four seasons, Ruggiero was selected as an All-American and as a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, which honors the top player in Division I women’s ice hockey.  She won the award her senior year in 2004.
Off the ice, Ruggiero has authored an autobiography and is heavily involved in advancing the sport of women’s ice hockey.  The founder of the All American Girls Hockey School, she is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athlete’s Commission, which acts as a liaison between athletes and the IOC.
The former Harvard standout is also known for her appearance on the popular reality television show “The Apprentice,” where she was offered a job by Donald Trump after being eliminated.
"Angela has been a tremendous ambassador for women’s ice hockey,” said Katey Stone, who serves as both the Harvard and U.S. Women’s National Team coach, in a statement.  “We want to wish Angela the very best as she takes this next step in her life and thank her for her unrelenting dedication to USA Hockey. She will be missed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—It was about as bad a start for the No. 23/24 Harvard men’s basketball team as Boston College could have hoped for.
Less than six minutes in, the Crimson trailed by 11, 14-3. The Eagles, led by seven-footer Dennis Clifford, were having their way in the post, and Harvard junior Kyle Casey was sipping water on the bench after picking up two early fouls.
But the Crimson started making it rain from beyond the arc, shooting 5-of-6 from deep over a nine-minute stretch beginning midway through the first half to reverse the fortune of the game.
And riding its hot shooting stroke, the Crimson (11-1) came out on top, defeating the Eagles (5-8) at Conte Forum Thursday night for the fourth straight season, 67-46.
“We didn’t start off well, but we’re really happy that we played well defensively and ended up hitting some shots,” said co-captain Oliver McNally, whose squad finished the contest shooting 10-of-20 from deep, its second best percentage of the season.
Meanwhile, the Eagles finished the game with just three made three-pointers—their fewest on the season—connecting on just 3 of 11 attempts.
“I think Harvard does a very good job of chasing you off the line,” Donahue said. “They’re so aggressive on ball screens that when you get the ball moving, you’d think that they would give up an open three. But what they do is they chase you off that line. They fly at you.”
Sophomore Laurent Rivard led the way for the Crimson, scoring 18 points—matching his second highest output of the season—on 7-of-12 shooting. Rivard, who scored 15 points in the first half, was especially deadly from deep, knocking down four of his eight attempts.
“He’s a terrific shooter,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of Rivard. “We’ve always tried to tease him a little bit about how we think he’s the second best shooter in this town and the first one happens to be Ray Allen.”
But Rivard wasn’t the only one with a hot hand for the Crimson. Freshman Corbin Miller chipped in with 12 points, going 4-of-5 from deep in the second half. Junior point guard Brandyn Curry added 11 points, five assists, and five steals.
Boston College was led by a pair of rookies—Clifford and Patrick Heckman—who notched 14 and 13 points, respectively.
“Clifford is a terrific player,” Amaker said. “We know how tough [BC is] going to be as those young guys grow and develop and get better.”
Clifford fueled the Eagles’ opening run, scoring five of Boston College’s first 14 points off a free throw and a pair of right-handed hook shots.
After Harvard started the game 0-of-8 from the field, junior point guard Brandyn Curry notched the Crimson’s first field goal of the game with 13:58 to play, attacking the basket off a screen and notching a short jumper.
The point guard followed by getting to the free-throw line on the Crimson’s next two possessions and then found co-captain Keith Wright (eight points, 11 rebounds) for an easy two on Harvard’s next trip down the floor, pulling the Crimson within five, 16-11.
“I just figured that we had to get something going and the easy way to do that is just to get to the free throw line,” Curry said.
While it was Curry who started the Crimson’s comeback, it was Rivard who completed it. The 6-5 forward notched back-to-back treys off the dribble, pulling Harvard within one, 20-19.
After a Heckman layup extended BC’s lead to three, Rivard found McNally open on the perimeter and the senior drained the three to even the score. McNally returned the favor moments later, picking Heckman’s pocket on the ensuing Eagles’ possession and sending a pass ahead to Rivard. The forward caught the pass in stride and finished the transition layup, giving the visitors their first lead of the game, 24-22.
The Crimson’s lead only grew from there, as Rivard added two more layups and another three-pointer over the next 3:31. A Christian Webster three-pointer with 1:16 to go in the first half put Harvard up by 12, 40-28.
A late BC run brought the Eagles within seven by halftime, but that’s as close as they would get. A pair of early layups from Webster and Casey put Harvard up by 11 less than two minutes into the second half, and the Crimson’s defense did the rest, holding BC to just 13 second-half points.
“It started on defense,” said Rivard, whose team faces a tough St. Joseph’s squad on Saturday. “We got stops and that gave us momentum on the offensive end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last game of 2011, the Harvard women’s basketball team was bested by another non-conference opponent, falling, 72-61, to the University of Hartford in West Hartford, Conn. Thursday evening.
The Crimson (5-6), which was coming off of a 63-56 home victory over St. John’s on Dec. 22—its first win against a Big East squad in eight years—was unable to carry its momentum into its matchup with the Hawks (9-4), who maintained their perfect record at Chase Family Arena.
“[Thursday’s result] was a pretty disappointing game for our team,” said co-captain Brogan Berry, whose squad turned the ball over 24 times and trailed by 12 at the end of the first half.
Harvard utilized the holiday break to prepare for the contest, but, according to Berry, failed to execute its strategy.
“We knew their strength was their offensive system,” Berry said. “When it came down to it, we knew what they were doing. We just had breakdowns in our defense and weren’t able to counter.”
Hartford capitalized on the Crimson’s defensive lapses, scoring 72 points—its highest output of the season—on 22 assists.
“We weren’t mentally ready for the game,” Harvard coach Kathy Delany-Smith said, “Every single one of [our players] was disconnected.”
Scoring on its first three trips up the floor, Hartford put its opponent on its heels early. And while the Crimson players struggled to get their heads in the game, Hartford’s Nikkia Smith took over.
“[Smith] definitely had a phenomenal game,” said Berry of the Hawks’ forward, who finished with 25 points. “I don’t think we were expecting it from her, and that might have been a weakness of ours. We weren’t able to stop her as a team as we had planned.”
In Hartford’s last outing against Harvard on Dec. 3, 2010, Smith—then a sophomore—put up 10 points, the first double-figure scoring performance of her collegiate career. This time around, Smith took on an even greater scoring role, notching a career-high 25 points.
“[Smith] is a very, very good player, but you never let anyone score 20-whatever points,” Delany-Smith said, “If someone scores points on you, you have to go ahead and do something, and we didn’t.”
Hartford also received solid performances from Smith’s classmates, Daphne Elliot and Ruthanne Doherty, who posted 14 and 13 points, respectively, and five rebounds apiece.
Hartford outshot the Crimson in Thursday’s contest, going 49.2 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from beyond the arc, compared to Harvard’s clips of 42.9 percent from the field and 23.5 percent from deep
Facing the Hawks’ offensive heat, Harvard found itself behind for the entire game, trailing by 15 with 4:42 to play in the first half.
“Instead of coming together as a team and believing in themselves like in the St. John’s game, [they] became more disconnected,” said Delany-Smith of her players.
The Crimson went on to rally in the second half, outscoring Hartford, 32-31, in the frame, but wasn’t able to overcome its 12-point halftime deficit.
“Halftime was kind of a wake-up call for us,” Berry said, “We knew what we were doing wrong. We just had to regroup and re-attack the game.”
With 7:44 remaining, Berry sunk a pair of free throws for Harvard to make it a six-point ball game.
Harvard’s regular contributors helped narrow the gap, with four players scoring indouble figures. Sophomore guard Christine Clark led the Crimson in both scoring and rebounding with 15 points and nine rebounds. Close behind Clark were junior forward Emma Golen (12 points and eight rebounds), junior forward Victoria Lippert (12 points and two rebounds), and Berry (10 points and four rebounds).
"We definitely started picking it up on defense and that led to some easy baskets on offense,” Berry said. “At the end of the game we just took it one possession at a time”.
But ultimately, the gap proved too sizable for the Crimson to overcome, and the Hawks cruised to a comfortable 72-61 victory.
“We dug ourselves a big hole, and we couldn’t climb out of it,” Delany-Smith said. “If [they] had played the first half the way they played their second half it would have been a totally different outcome.”
