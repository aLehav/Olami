After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will delay the opening of its new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston until spring 2021, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III announced in an email to SEAS affiliates Friday afternoon.
The complex has been under construction for nearly five years. The Allston SEAS campus was originally slated to open for classes in fall 2020, and faculty planned to move into the new building throughout the summer.
Doyle cited the City of Boston’s suspension of construction projects and broader challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic as causes of the delay.
If construction is allowed to resume this summer, Doyle anticipates faculty will begin moving into the building this coming fall, with classes beginning in spring 2021. At this time, however, no definite dates have been set for the resumption of construction or the building’s opening, Doyle said in an interview Friday morning.
“All this depends on both the pandemic and its progression, as well as the construction suspension order for the city of Boston,” he said. “So when that gets lifted, that activates the process, and then we can begin to forecast with greater accuracy.”
Doyle added that a spate of top Harvard administrators — including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay — were among those involved in making the decision to postpone.
Asked about next steps, Doyle said the delay of the SEC’s opening would lead to “very careful and complicated revisions to our timeline.” Those revised plans will include working out “new schedules for lab and office relocations, course and classroom scheduling, and adjustments to plans for transportation and dining services,” he wrote in his email to students.
“We had a very carefully orchestrated sequence of things that would be triggered by getting an occupancy certificate in May. So now we've got to rethink,” Doyle said in the Friday interview. “We've got to put together some scenarios that have flexibility, that are able to be modified.”
He added that the delay will allow for more planning and an extra semester to solidify the transition to Allston — a silver lining amid the complications and the uncertainty posted by the ongoing public health crisis.
“There were parts of the decision-making that will probably benefit from having a little more time planning. So I think it'll be you know, a bit of a mixed bag,” Doyle said. “We'll have to come up with a brand-new plan, but we will also have an additional semester to think through the transition process.”
He said it is “too early to tell” whether the changes to the University’s plans in Allston will have financial ramifications.
“Obviously the industry will have to recover from this,” Doyle said. “But I would say at this point, there's nothing that's been brought to our attention that suggests any unfortunate financial consequences.”
While he expects some disappointment among SEAS affiliates, Doyle said he hopes that disappointment will be “balanced with people understanding the greater good.”
“I spoke to a lot of the sophomores in particular, who were quite eager to have their first full semester, their full academic year as juniors in the new building,” Doyle said. “But I think there's tremendous understanding at all quarters. This is all about the health of our community, global health — we're taking our cues from health officials.”
Ultimately, he called the postponement “simply a delay.”
“We got to within two months of the finish line, which means that we're very nearly complete, we're incredibly far along in this,” Doyle said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is unable to cover its budget for Fiscal Year 2020 after incurring more than $30 million in “unforeseen expenses and lost revenue” due to the coronavirus pandemic, FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in an email to faculty and staff Friday.
“The financial impact of the pandemic on the FAS was immediate, is growing, and will be significant,” Gay wrote. “With the decision to de-densify the campus and support our students through the transition, the FAS incurred over $30M in unforeseen expenses and lost revenue, resulting in the inability to fully cover our FY20 budget. We anticipate continuing pressure on revenue sources, even as new needs may present themselves in our community, including greater financial aid for students whose families have been affected by the global economic slowdown.”
“It is inevitable that as a community and as individuals we will be called on to make sacrifices, and we will bear them as equitably as possible, while continuing to invest in mission critical areas,” she added.
Financial and higher education experts have said COVID-19 will leave the University’s endowment in a “grave” financial situation. Though alumni have offered donations in support, experts say their generosity may not last.
FAS, meanwhile, was already operating on “infinitesimal” margins despite raking in a $13.6 million surplus during the 2019 fiscal year, FAS Dean of Finances Leslie A. Kirwan said at a September 2019 faculty meeting. The surplus represented less than 1 percent of FAS’s annual budget, which is close to $1.6 billion.
In that meeting — even before COVID-19 shuttered most of Harvard’s operations — Kirwan forecasted an “ominous” financial outlook for FAS, citing uncertain federal research funding and the endowment tax that took effect last year.
In her Friday email, Gay outlined four principles that will guide FAS’s decision-making as it weighs the “tradeoffs that will be necessary” in light of the pandemic: prioritizing health and safety, protecting the “academic enterprise,” leveraging breadth and diversity, and preserving access and affordability.
She wrote that, above all other goals, FAS will prioritize the protection of human life and follow the advice of medical experts and public health officials to manage the effects of the pandemic.
FAS’s next most important goal, Gay wrote, is to maintain the caliber of its teaching and research. FAS ordered all of its affiliated laboratories to ramp down research to only essential functions in early March.
“We must remain a research active community to the extent possible, and be ready to scale up research activities as soon as conditions allow,” she wrote.
Gay reiterated FAS’s commitment to diversity, writing that “the unparalleled breadth of disciplines, perspectives, questions, and approaches of our academic community cannot be a casualty of this virus.”
She also wrote that FAS would remain committed to providing competitive financial aid. FAS spent $200.9 million on the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative — its largest expense — in fiscal year 2019.
Gay told faculty and staff she will provide more specific information about how FAS will address the financial impacts of the pandemic in the coming days.
“In our long history, Harvard has never faced a challenge as all-encompassing as this one,” she wrote. “And yet, we must adapt.”
Correction: April 11, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that FAS posted a surplus which represented less than 0.1 percent of its 2019 annual budget. In fact, the surplus represented less than 1 percent of the 2019 FAS annual budget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adorned in festive shirts and boasting House-themed Zoom backgrounds, hundreds of upperclassmen crowded into one of twelve virtual sessions to welcome members of the Class of 2023 to their newly assigned dorms Friday.
In the absence of a physical Housing Day — a spirited annual tradition during which upperclassmen “dorm-storm” freshman rooms to inform them of their housing placement for the next three years — this year’s freshmen logged onto Zoom this morning to receive the news.
The virtual Housing Day comes just one month after Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke announced the event would be postponed indefinitely due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus — a decision that sparked widespread disappointment among the freshman class. Last Friday, the Dean of Students Office notified freshmen about the new date and procedure.
Virtual Housing Day joins a slew of other College operations — including classes, extracurriculars, and administrative offices — that have turned to the video-conferencing platform Zoom to continue their functions.
Spearheaded by the DSO — which oversaw most of the logistical coordination — faculty deans and house committees say they worked to produce a virtual Housing Day that matched the excitement of the in-person tradition.
Dunster House Committee Chair Dylan Zhou ’22 said nearly 100 Dunster residents participated in the house’s Zoom dorm-storm. He added that though the novel Housing Day setup was “hectic,” he believes Dunster residents brought the same spirit as in previous years.
“I think there was a similar level of enthusiasm coming from the House,” Zhou said. “The House spirit was still the same in how we communicated it with the first-years.”
Brian Ma ’23 said he enjoyed the anticipation leading up to learning of his and his blockmates’ housing assignment.
According to Ma, he was “positive” that he and his blockmates were going to get a River House until they entered the Zoom waiting room.
“When I hopped onto the waiting room for the Zoom call, it said Housing Day 9,” Ma said. “That number, for some reason, gave me Quad vibes and made me a little bit anxious.”
Ma added he was “pretty satisfied” when he learned that he and his blockmates were sorted into Leverett House, a top three choice on his personal housing ranking.
Meiyi Yan ’23, who was sorted into Quincy House, said she thinks faculty deans and house committees did a great job at building excitement for Housing Day among freshmen.
“Given the circumstances, they did a pretty good job. There was definitely some anticipation building up,” Yan said. “I liked virtual Housing Day because you could see all the participants and everyone else who was in the House.”
Jenny J. Yoon ’23 said she first realized she was placed in Leverett when she recognized the House’s Housing Day song — a parody of “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish — playing in the background of the Zoom call. She added that though she was disappointed by the changes to this year’s event, she is still looking forward to her upperclassmen years on the river.
“It’s sad because all the upperclassmen I know always say that Housing Day is once in a college kind of event, but I'm trying to look on the bright side,” she said. “When I'm an upperclassman, I get to still participate in Housing Day. I'll be on the other side, but it'll still be fun, and I have three years to do that. So it'll be good.”
