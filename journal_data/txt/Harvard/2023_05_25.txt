This was the year we were finally done talking about Covid-19.
For the past three years, the pandemic dominated our lives, and, in turn, it dominated these pages. Now, pandemic restrictions lifted, we have the blissful freedom to forget. And forget we have: These same pages no longer know of a pandemic.
Forgetting, though, does not beget learning — veritas doesn’t emerge from the void. Covid-19 cases still occur today, and we are all grappling with the pandemic’s aftereffects. Rather than disregarding the last few years and picking up exactly where we left off in 2020, we must acknowledge the cavity that Covid-19 left us in, to fully appreciate our current flourishing.
Harvard is not merely a collection of red-brick buildings. It’s a campus, where students, teachers, and administrators come together in community. Our campus is not stagnant: Each year, as new freshmen cycle in and tutors swap Houses, its culture is molded by a slightly different set of hands.
For us undergraduates, Harvard is home for just four disarming, uninhibited, formative years. Yet our past four years have been wracked by discontinuity. This is only the second year of a full in-person campus, and the first entirely without Covid restrictions. Only the current graduating class has even witnessed the pre-pandemic era.
We’ve been attempting to figure out what Harvard’s campus should look like, without any reference point. Sometimes, unable to rebuild from blueprints we can no longer access, we’ve had to build anew.
This new beginning, like any, comes with near-limitless potential.
Harvard is a university drenched in history, influenced by a chain of traditions, norms, and practices stretching back centuries. The pandemic’s blip on this record has torn us away from institutional inertia — leaving the trajectory of our campus unusually and delightfully unbounded.
In this absurd yet joyous new normal, options branched out before us. We could have found comfort in an inheritance of old habits. We could have fallen into new routines without questioning their origins. Or we could have actively rethought what Harvard should look like, and taken intentional steps towards defining a better normal.
It would be a cliche — and plain wrong — to say that we chose to fundamentally transform Harvard’s culture; that, because of us, post-pandemic Harvard no longer reeks of elitism or institutional failure. But over the past year, we have made strides worth celebrating to improve our campus.
Since the Covid-19 era, we’ve gone from grab-and-go meals to moshing at Yardfest, from pinning each others’ boxes on Zoom to seeing the lower half of our peers’ bodies, and from living across dozens of time zones to residing in a single dozen of Houses. Students have come together, embraced their proximity (literally and figuratively), and harnessed their collective energy to cultivate a new campus culture.
Over the past year, this Editorial Board has been spellbound witnessing the ceaseless fight for a better Harvard — a fight driven by students, rather than the administration we’d expect to be steering.
As our fellow undergraduate course assistants and teaching fellows were undercompensated and overworked, it was students who reported and followed up on their plight. As non-tenured faculty faced untenable working conditions, it was students who supported their quest for unionization. As one of our residential Houses carried the name of two of slavery’s greatest enablers in colonial America, it was students who mounted a denaming campaign.
And so forth beyond campus grounds: As the nation’s gun violence epidemic only worsened, it was students who leveraged the Harvard name to advocate for justice. As a third of Pakistan went underwater, it was students who fundraised, in common areas and dining halls. As people across China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet called for liberty, it was students who echoed their calls.
And they did it all without institutional backing.
To be clear, the administration is not some tyrannical oppressor. As affirmative action awaited a gavel drop, students and administrators alike flocked to Washington, D.C., and vouched for race-conscious admissions.
Tension between students and administrators is how the relationship is supposed to be. Bright-eyed students dream of sweeping reform tangible within their four-year Harvard lifespans, while seasoned administrators know firsthand the disinclination of a hundreds-year-old institution with more than a dozen separate schools to change. The two parties are locked in an age-old tug of war, apparent even today.
All year, the administration has set up unpopular restrictions for students to operate within, such as the Dean of Students Office’s ridiculous rules around club naming and potential freeze on club creation. But we found a path forward by continuing to tug: pushing for the changes we wish to see from Harvard and refusing to let administrative disagreement hinder our aims.
This steady tug captures exactly what makes this campus home: students, hand in hand, taking charge to construct precisely the campus they want. Protesting and criticizing, advocating and leading, students this year have unrelentingly fought — even against the administration — for the best possible post-pandemic Harvard.
Improving Harvard is no easy feat. As students, we chip away at the daunting task of building a campus we’re proud to call home with the best of intentions. But sometimes, in the midst of this complex process, we get it wrong.
From a student transferring thousands of dollars in club funds to her personal bank account, to an astoundingly dysfunctional student government election, there was no shortage of avoidable student error on our campus this year.
But this margin of error is no reason to curtail student freedom and usher us along predetermined safe paths, as some administrators might believe. Mistakes are the natural mechanism by which our community of students can keep itself in check. We must be allowed to make our own blunders, so that we can learn and grow from them.
This authentic growth is needed so that we as students can engage with the intractable yet fundamental problems of living in community. These are problems the administration alone couldn’t solve even if we wanted it to. Ensuring that our campus culture does not tolerate bullying, for example, requires more than University-wide policy; it requires students striving to support one another.
Sometimes, the solutions are less clear. Within this politically polarized nation, our campus has grappled without resolution over how to best support free speech. This Editorial Board has taken a very particular stance on free speech, leading us to cast suspicions over student petitions and academic councils that seem to simply throw the phrase around as a shield from accountability. Others may disagree, finding us too severe on unconventional beliefs or too lenient on dangerous ones.
While this particular debate is far from finished, we have firm faith in the ability of our student body to come to a conclusion on our campus’s biggest challenges, as long as we put in the work to collectively renegotiate community norms.
We’d prefer an administration that gives us more space — not less — in this delicate rebuilding process. We know that students can beautifully revive campus from the ashes of pandemic; we just need the administration to trust us — even if there are a couple hiccups along the way.
Despite our best efforts to revitalize campus outside of the administration’s static perspective, we students are still dealing with some unsavory administration-enabled remnants of pre-pandemic Harvard, one pandemic later.
The beginning of this year gave us an unpleasant welcome back in the form of professor John L. Comaroff returning to the classroom after being accused by multiple graduate students of sexual misconduct. This administrative choice endangered students at the campus they had so painstakingly turned into their home.
The ensuing year has seen walkouts, occupations, and campaigns against Comaroff aplenty. Students have made clear their determination to see Comaroff removed from his post, and we couldn’t be prouder of their collective organizing to reshape our campus. Indeed, our Harvard can do better.
But the fight isn’t over until Comaroff is gone for good. We’re ending this year with Comaroff still disappointingly employed, the administration deaf to our calls otherwise.
More disheartening administrative silence comes in the statistics they won’t share: on the socioeconomic diversity of the College’s accepted classes. Despite its messaging of accessibility for low-income students, Harvard skews grossly, disproportionately wealthy.
This is not the Harvard we want. The bastion of privilege and wealth that the school represented during its founding should be left in the past, alongside Comaroff’s tenure. Harvard should capture diversity across every axis, bringing in new students from all kinds of backgrounds.
It’s a new era of Harvard, redefined since the lapse provided to us by the pandemic. We refuse to allow antiquated standards of student protection and diversity to persist.
The upcoming year will present a clear symbol of Harvard’s new era, with Claudine Gay assuming the presidency. We hope Gay’s tenure will represent a more progressive relationship between students and administrators, but we will by no means stop holding the administration accountable or defining campus culture as students.
For centuries, students lived on Harvard’s campus and shaped its culture. Now, the University’s history fractured by the pandemic’s hard reset, we can create anew the culture that will define its next few centuries.
This year saw students at the helm of developing our new culture. Next year, as affirmative action appears poised to fall, we worry that a Harvard without its current breadth of student diversity will be a campus that no one can call home. We’ll need all hands on deck then — students, faculty, and administration — to uphold our collective culture.

As our graduating seniors smile in cap and gown, bidding adieu to their Cantabrigian lives, it is hardly difficult to imagine how change has been central to their Harvard experiences: From moving to online instruction just months into their college careers to this year’s introduction of double concentrations, much has evolved for the ’23 ton — including long-held notions of what it means to graduate with a Harvard education.
This past school year, our first without the widespread restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic, was no exception to this trend. Just like the lives of our graduating seniors, education at Harvard and beyond has transformed rapidly over the past year.
With such changes, we have been forced to reconsider not only what models and forms of knowledge are valued at America’s oldest university, but also which faces embody — both literally and figuratively — a Harvard education.
Harvard, in large part, is constituted by the experiences, worldviews, and scholarship of its students. In recent decades, a diverse student body has offered perspectives that are reflective of the kaleidoscope of knowledge within the United States and the global community. Accordingly, future changes in the demographics of the student body will inevitably change the knowledge pursued and valued at Harvard.
With the years-long case against Harvard’s affirmative action policy set to come to a close this summer, the conservative court’s ruling will likely overturn decades of precedent and make prioritizing diversity a Sisyphean task for the University. With this ruling, a Harvard education will lose something consequential and ineffable — the perspectives that underrepresented students bring, and with those perspectives, the drive to act on them.
These perspectives often push Harvard to uphold its commitment to veritas, provoking us to ponder: Whose histories, figures, or vernaculars do we find important to uplift in the pursuit of knowledge?
Filipino languages and Ethnic Studies provide two of several novel answers to that question. This past year has seen more Ethnic Studies “cluster” hires, expanding the reach of a historically marginalized yet critically important field of study. The decades-long push for an instructor in Filipino languages has also finally come to fruition, bringing Harvard closer than ever to giving Southeast Asian studies the recognition it deserves. Together, such student-driven victories open up new possibilities to include, offer, and reimagine the knowledge embedded in Harvard’s storied curriculums, marking positive steps towards cultivating a university worth its motto.
Yet these steps in the right direction are just that — discrete, preliminary steps. With the impending judiciary ruling against diversity in higher education, more work needs to be done to protect threatened perspectives at both Harvard and the national level, especially when knowledge about the experiences of marginalized communities is under blatant legislative attack.
Should Harvard fail to act decisively, the depth and breadth our curriculum has enjoyed from student diversity will be reduced over time to the mere residue of an ephemeral dream.
Like students, faculty contribute to Harvard’s pursuit and dissemination of knowledge, constituting the other literal “faces” of a Harvard education.
Yet despite their centrality to the University’s academic mission, many faculty — especially those not holding tenure-track positions — report that they often fail to receive adequate institutional support, facing precarious pecuniary and working conditions as a result. This year’s drive for unionization by non-tenure track faculty marked a positive step towards alleviating such pressures, hopefully leading to greater protections for some of the University’s most influential and generative academic workers.
This year also revealed the struggles of other educators who form the logistical bedrock of a Harvard education — namely, course assistants and teaching fellows. Given the precarity of this CA and TF-led model of education, where non-tenured faculty perform much of the daily work of engaging with students with little pay or security, the University should give CAs and TFs the support they need, and compensate them commensurate with the duties they perform.
However, financial stability and job security for educators are just the first steps in protecting knowledge generation at Harvard.
As faculty push the frontiers of scholarship through their research, the issue of academic freedom — and the chilling effects of its culling — loom large over their pursuits. We remain steadfast that encouraging rigorous on-campus debates is important for academic discourse at Harvard and that such efforts prove more productive than decrying a simplistic, inaccurate dichotomy of liberal versus conservative faculty.
Furthermore, we continue to be wary of a conflation between freedom of speech and freedom from accountability, and of new faculty-led initiatives that appear to encourage such an elision. While we applauded the principles motivating the recent creation of the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard, we were disquieted by the group’s seemingly one-sided view of academic freedom – particularly as some notorious members advanced dangerously incorrect scholarship yet were allowed to remain steadfast in both their academic positions and their falsehoods, while former professors like Cornell R. West ’74 and Lorgia Garcia Peña were denied tenure at Harvard seemingly on the basis of their advocacy.
In due course, our changing conceptualization of what constitutes academic freedom — and not only the types of inquiry, but also the very figures and faces that should be protected under its terms — will inevitably shape the knowledge advanced, approved, and valued by Harvard, creating ripple effects at the faculty level that we have yet to fully comprehend.
Changes to the faces of Harvard’s students and faculty also coincide with changes in Harvard’s reputation — the outward face of Harvard to the public.
Emerging from a pandemic wherein the nuts and bolts of education were radically reimagined, this school year has forced us to reconsider: What does it mean to receive a Harvard education, one that many revere as a prized possession — and to what extent is the value of that education tied to the prestige of the Harvard name stamped on our diplomas?
The choices of Harvard Medical School and Harvard Law School to drop out of the U.S. News ranking system this year reflected a symbolic break away from a system that prioritizes the patina of prestige over substantive education. This move suggested that the value of a Harvard education should not be tied to the elitism that comes with it — and that perhaps even the College itself should do away with ranking systems that motivate perverse incentives.
Yet ranking systems weren’t the only public indicator of Harvard’s name-brand reputation that made headlines this year. The recent $300 million donation by Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 — and the subsequent choice of our University to rename the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences after a Governor Ron DeSantis megadonor — reflected how our campus infrastructure has been controversially altered by the pretty penny of well-monied donors.
As Harvard makes alumni, and in turn, alumni remake Harvard, we cannot turn a blind eye to the undercurrents of money and prestige that guide each one’s engagement with the other, nor to the material effects this entanglement leaves on the meaning — or even the very name — of a Harvard education.
Ultimately, it is up to each new batch of soon-to-be graduates to ensure that their engagement with the world under the Harvard name is guided by values beyond the moneyed exclusivity that has become synonymous with our University’s public face, and to demonstrate that bastions of elite knowledge are not valuable simply for being elite.
Aside from changes in the figures and explicit elements that make up a Harvard education, the abstract purpose of pursuing knowledge at our University has evolved in the post-pandemic world, forcing us to reconsider a nearly four-century old question: What is the ideological “face” of Harvard?
The College’s oft-stated mission suggests that a Harvard education is meant to educate citizens and citizen-leaders and help them learn how best they can serve the world. In today’s precarious economy, however, the pursuit of prestige and security has increasingly pushed Harvard students into fields like big tech, which often appear to place a higher premium on the company name of an internship than a commitment to doing lasting good in the world.
The purpose of a liberal arts education is seemingly moving from the pursuit of public service towards the cultivation of economic efficiency — a shift in the ideology behind a Harvard education that has only been reinforced at the institutional level through decisions like the elimination of Shopping Week, which restrict students’ ability to explore alternative fields in favor of the safe or the comfortable.
In some ways, this increasing trend of funneling graduates towards finance, tech, and consulting suggests that our precious liberal arts education is being hollowed out to optimize for individual financial success.
However, even as older purposes of a Harvard education have faced challenges in recent years, novel ideologies of knowledge generation have also emerged, offering interdisciplinary approaches to tackle emerging global issues. We celebrate that through an increasingly “blended” model of education, we can have our code and eat our Camus, too, and find that the blown-out-of-proportion frenzy around the “death of the humanities” belies a functional misunderstanding regarding both the purpose of humanities and of STEM. Both fields, inherently ambiguous and multifaceted, offer possibilities to advance the public good as the demands of global citizenry evolve in accordance with increasingly interdisciplinary challenges to human society.
One such emerging issue is the rapid integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives — including the transmission, evaluation, and generation of knowledge at Harvard. With the rise of generative AI models in the educational realm, students and educators have been presented with fundamentally new ways of learning, adding a not-quite-human face to a Harvard education whose contours and influence we have yet to fully comprehend.
This year’s launch of ChatGPT — an AI chatbot that can summarize papers, produce snippets of code, or write entire essays — forced us to reflect on the value of completing knowledge-related tasks instead of outsourcing to convenient open-access tools. Like others, we have been cautious of the effects of machine learning models such as ChatGPT on our generative abilities, believing that while these tools seemingly mimic the work done by humans, the value and cultivation of human creativity is lost in the process.
Furthermore, the ability of such faceless chat models to create human-like responses raises far-reaching questions about what it means to be a bearer of knowledge and intelligence altogether. The boundless extent of AI systems’ potential capabilities, paired with a lack of comprehensive oversight on their development and deployment, also makes serious ethical concerns about their disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities all the more urgent.
The AI face of education is only nascent, making it difficult to offer a conclusive judgment of its effects at Harvard and beyond. Yet grappling with the impact of AI on how we learn — and who we are to call ourselves learners — will be a generation-defining task.
To meet this uncertain moment, each figure within Harvard’s multifaceted model of education will need to face one another and work in tandem, producing a kaleidoscopic vision of our University’s future in which all students, affiliates, and graduates — present company included — may see themselves accurately reflected amidst ongoing change.

As a former Harvard College instructor and in my current role at the Harvard Language Center, I try to stay abreast of essential innovations in artificial intelligence — for instance, the current marvelous ease of cheating.
I therefore asked ChatGPT for a circumscribed assist with this piece: 50 words of advice for the class of 2023. It obligingly gushed, “Congratulations, Class of 2023! As you enter the next phase of your lives, remember to stay curious, never stop learning, and seek opportunities to make a positive impact in the world. Be resilient in the face of challenges, stay true to your values, and always prioritize your well-being. Best of luck!”
This valediction is about as innovative as the printing press, but I suppose the algorithm is designed to avoid provocation, unlike a cranky middle-aged Harvard administrator. Though I don’t disagree with the sentiment, I do want to push it further: Class of 2023, in this world of proliferating technological wonders, remember that your true potential lies in what makes you human.
I’ve gotten a handful of emails over the last year of the “Your students should use AI to learn languages!” variety. These app creators are laudable in their enthusiasm for their products, as well as laughable in their one-size-fits-all approach to college-level language instruction and their confidence that an academic institution would be eager to do away with flesh and blood instructors.
Given my background in teaching and my championing of the Harvard Language Exchange program, it follows that I will never completely cede language learning to the machine. But AI is here to stay, and it will only get more sophisticated. Despite all the panic about it coming for our jobs or sparking the Skynet apocalypse, we’ll have to approach it pragmatically.
In an ideal world, we will integrate it into our academic lives as a tool as we reexamine what “human” skills are critical for students to acquire within the liberal arts curriculum. The wonderful opportunities that natural language processing and other forms of AI have presented us can, and should, only ever be augmentative, lest we lose our thirst for cultural exchange: the delight of discussing what makes a great fish curry with a new Bengali friend, explaining the subtleties of Rickrolling to the visiting German student, the first time you use the subjunctive spontaneously, or when you tell your French friend just what you think of Balenciaga’s puffer jackets.
Within the Harvard student body, more than 150 countries are represented. What would our institution be if we replaced more than 8,000 students and scholars with chatbot-powered avatars?
I certainly don’t need to preach to the Class of 2023 the effects of losing our sense of community, given the cascades of existential crises of the last several years that have caused, and were caused by, our collective and individual isolation. And it doesn’t help that, when faced with these crises, the impulse of the educated is to burrow deeper into our respective dens, insulating ourselves from contrary opinions and doomscrolling our way through hopelessness.
The machine expects nothing of us but our passive presence, and eventually will give up on even that (yes, even Duolingo will abandon its “Ready to practice your Portuguese? Keep Duo happy!” nudges).
Humans are harder. Harder, messy, prone to misunderstanding, and irritating in their demands for both accountability and simultaneous adjustment of our own expectations. And yet, how much is lost in a Google translation, and only understood through serious study or real-world interaction? Your horizon stretches a little more when you realize, for example, the extent to which your views about a particular culture boil down to stereotypes, or why that Neapolitan waiter wouldn’t bring you a cappuccino after dinner.
The sleek beauty of tech is that it doesn’t call for empathy or negotiation. It’s obsolete within months and doesn’t complain when you toss it in the trash. Each human conflict or connection, however, strains the bounds of your world, fires new synapses, and reaffirms your uniqueness. Each worthwhile human relationship requires renewal.
As you go forth from the protected space of Harvard, into a world grappling with political division, climate change, economic anxiety, and social inequality, don’t be afraid of tech — use it in all the ways that enhance our current imperfect realities. But don’t forget the immense power of human collaboration in the face of staggering obstacles.
But I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask for a final word from our friendly chatbot. ChatGPT, what is the value of human collaboration?
“Human collaboration combines diverse skills, knowledge, and perspectives to achieve common goals and create greater impact than individuals can achieve alone.”
Good bot.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
As a frequent commencement speaker, in preparing a message to graduates, I often begin by asking myself how these students might be imagining the opportunities that lie ahead for them. Surveying the present challenges that lie behind and in front of them, I usually urge them to focus on more than a career ladder common to the profession they wish to pursue — rather, to focus on allocating some of their intellectual capital and energy to areas of improvement in the lives of those who may not have similarly enjoyed the advantages of an excellent education.
In a nation where the gaps in economic and social standing among and between groups remain stark, I remind graduates that they alone cannot ensure the health and future prosperity of their communities and the nation. They must, I emphasize, work alongside or lead others in that endeavor.
Recently, I have been struck by how numerous tragic events and social struggles have caused many college students to be less confident in the advantages they will enjoy as a result of their years of study. The numerous crises they have endured in such a short span of time have made the emphasis on their good fortunes ring hollow.
Indeed, my own apprehension about the state of the world requires that I contemplate how to be meaningfully hopeful in my task as a commencement speaker, so that I do not advance hollow claims about the future graduates will likely face. At the same time, I am disappointed with my more cautious approach, when this is precisely the moment when hopefulness can be most essential as students commence their post-graduate efforts.
Yes, these are times that give me pause, in spite of my long and varied experience. Having grown up in a time of violence and strife, I have often observed that steady improvement in the nation has been the result of the beneficial and enlightened efforts of courageous individuals who spurred others to action. It was often their vision of a better future that caused others to join in overturning unfair practices and embracing the importance of shared efforts.
The bookends to my undergraduate years were, at the beginning, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy ’40 and, at the end, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy ’48. Throughout my college years, persistent racial violence in the form of bombings and mob actions plagued our reality as Black college students.
Sitting on the lawn of Dillard University on a sunny graduation day and contemplating my lack of civil rights, I could not have been sanguine about the future. Indeed, persistent doubt that the country could move forward in a productive way was a deep concern among all of those graduating with me.
Yet, I was compelled to continue my education, seeing that pursuit as an antidote to seemingly omnipresent irrational actions. Inspired by civil rights leaders, I chose to keep my efforts focused stubbornly on a future that could be better if enough people worked together to effect change and demonstrate concern for others across our differences.
Remembering those years helps me put the current troubling events in perspective — these may not actually be the worst of times. To be sure, a pandemic, continuing political upheaval, the threat to civil rights long thought secure, poisonous public discourse, anti-intellectual policy-making, and significant economic challenges might naturally cause us to have a pessimistic outlook. Yet, over the course of time, our lives are frequently upended by uncontrolled and unforeseen events that shake our confidence in the future.
In that event, we can either falter or become even more determined to engage in action that centers on the common good. I have always chosen the latter and, in many ways, that stubborn determination to seek the good has provided me purpose and uplift for a life that I would not have traded for another.
And so, in my commencement speeches this year, I will, even in these difficult times, invoke the need for graduates to look beyond their personal ambition, to ways of incorporating in their lives actions that contribute to advancing our common well-being. Whatever the future holds for them, the challenges will be made lighter and their satisfaction greater if they are connected in an intentional way to advancing the equality and well-being of others.

Simmons is a graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the incoming senior adviser to the president of Harvard on engagement with historically Black colleges and universities, this year’s Convocation speaker for Harvard Graduate School of Education, and this year’s Commencement speaker for Prairie View A&M University.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
It is my honor to join you at this crossroads, Class of 2023. I’ve had the enormous privilege of witnessing a new cohort of students arrive, learn, grow, and sharpen during each of my seven years as dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Come graduation, these students sparkle with possibility. They are prepared to think deeply and lead well in a uniquely difficult world.
The same holds true for all of you. You all have grit, tenacity, and now, the special privilege and power of a Harvard pedigree.
Today, I join you on the threshold of a new adventure. Like you, I am wrapping up a pivotal chapter in my career — my tenure as dean — and beginning another. I find myself returning to advice that has proven helpful to me, and that I hope might be a touchstone for you as well: Hold fast to your North Star.
Let’s take a step back. As a first-generation college student, I rose to become the first Black female dean of a Harvard graduate school. I identified my North Star early. While studying genetics at Princeton, I recognized that I didn’t want to pursue knowledge chiefly for knowledge’s sake: I wanted to solve real-world problems. I consciously honored my desire to make a societal impact and let it guide me to where I am today.
Only you know what you were put on this planet to accomplish. But I’m willing to bet that within the particularity of your passion, within the vicinity of your North Star, you’ll find an underlying desire to build a more resilient and equitable world for the sake of your own and future generations.
This is a charge that resonates deeply with public health professionals. But we do not have a monopoly on it. The realities facing all of us are stark. We live in a world where a global pandemic has laid bare systemic racial inequities that are as heartbreaking as they are stubborn. A world where climate change is creating devastating new challenges, almost daily. A world that will be warmer, wetter, and more volatile, with an all but inevitable escalation in conflicts around the globe. This cascade of crises calls out for innovative solutions.
We need you.
And so, as you plan your futures, I hope you will think of yourselves as ambassadors for public health. Whether you become engineers or lawyers, computer scientists or dentists, pastors or teachers or writers or therapists or any of the countless other careers you might pursue, you will have an opportunity in your workplaces and in your neighborhoods to advocate for health and justice. To fight for equity and access. To shape more resilient and sustainable societies. To uphold the dignity and worth in every human being. These are the values that define public health — and they are values that you can do a great deal to advance, whatever your field.
Hold fast to your North Star. Choose it consciously, and make sure it reflects your values. Let it steer what you do and how you serve. As you rise in your careers, you will encounter many different agendas and value systems.
If you have that North Star, your decisions will not feel ad hoc. People will see a consistency that builds trust. And in turn, you will build a better world.
I’ll leave you with two quotes. The first, from trailblazing Black tennis player Arthur R. Ashe, is one that I’ve kept on the wall by my desk for many years. It recently became the motto for Harvard HealthLab, the first accelerator at the University focused on nurturing student startups geared toward social impact. HealthLab has attracted students from a broad range of disciplines.
Ashe said: “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.” For us, these words resonate as a collective North Star. If you find that this motto fits for you too, use it.
The second quote comes from Chester M. Pierce ’48, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School who went on to have a stellar career in psychiatry.
“The greater virtues are wisdom, justice, and intelligence. Lesser virtues are qualities such as gentleness, kindness, cheerfulness, joy, and gratefulness,” he observed. “Now I am coming to the view that the lesser virtues in fact are ancestors and commanders to the greater virtues.”
I offer these two wonderful touchstones to you, along with my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
I won’t sugarcoat it: You are entering a world where some of the most basic values of our democracy are under attack. Some politicians have found political profit in demonizing certain minorities. Rather than appeal to a broad national community, they preach divisiveness and exclusion. The quest for political power has become an end that in their view justifies these means.
It used to be that we could at least debate such dangerous policies. We could openly consider whether we really want to build our nation on such exclusionist dogma.
But today, even the facts for that debate are under attack. As the filtering of traditional media has given way to the immediacy of social media, spin and disinformation often replace fact-based discourse.
The devaluation of fact is dangerous because a common understanding of reality is a prerequisite to shaping a common vision. It is hard to build a community when we cannot even agree on the world that surrounds us.
A “post-fact” environment is also one without accountability. It is a place where politicians can evade responsibility by denying the consequences and even the nature of their acts.
Our universities were once considered bastions of deliberation — a setting where policies could be debated and morale visions measured. But too often, even our universities have become infected by a censorious ethos in which disfavored views are no longer challenged and debated, but shouted down and suppressed.
For a while, until Harvard’s faculty and students reasserted the principle of academic freedom, I, myself, was excluded because of a dean’s view that certain criticisms — in my case, of Israel — were too threatening, according to a professor who spoke with him.
These developments are deeply worrying, but they are not written in stone. They are troubling trends, but they can be reversed. They have not always been, and, with your help, they are not destined always to be.
I have faith that these challenges can be overcome because I see the prospect of a better future in all of you.
You have grown up in an extraordinarily diverse America. For you, unlike some of your elders, a multicultural society is not a threatening development. It is reality. You are best positioned to defend the decency and respect for differences that alone will allow our nation to come together as a community and prosper.
With your Harvard education, you also have the capacity to redeem a fact-based discourse. You can see through the convenient obfuscation of those who pretend that facts are mere opinions. You can resurrect a reality-based discourse that is needed to hold our leaders to account for their actions.
And having learned at Harvard how to consider and contest different points of view, you understand the value of free debate. You know that to hear a difficult perspective is not to endorse it. Censorship is the blind rejection used by those who fear knowing. Your education has given you the strength to hear, consider, and even learn from those with whom you disagree.
But, you might ask, how can you, a young graduate just leaving the College, possibly make a difference? These are seemingly tectonic trends. How can you influence them?
I have spent my professional life at Human Rights Watch taking on powerful forces. The task can seem daunting, but I have seen the enormous difference that even a handful of individuals can make. And not just heroic individuals. Ordinary young people of commitment like you.
In fact, your generation is perhaps better placed than any previous one to make itself heard. The same social media that enables the deniers of truth and the purveyors of exclusion gives each of you a platform to push back. We should not cede this platform to deceit and hatred. And even if you prefer in-person to electronic communication, your voice is enormously important.
Today, it appears that people are more likely to listen to others whom they know. Institutions are regarded skeptically, but friends and acquaintances are accorded more deference and trust.
Your views matter. While each individual’s voice can travel only so far, your collective voice has enormous resonance. It has reach and influence. It has the capacity to serve as a powerful antidote to the callousness and deception that endanger our democracy.
Indifference is the enemy of democracy. Resignation is the accomplice of the autocrat. Your engagement is a prerequisite to the future you deserve.
Use your voice. Act on your beliefs. Defend your values. These are not naive steps. They are feasible and essential to ensure a world where you will want to lead your adult lives.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Not long ago, an Iranian woman in my class told me that in her country, one had to be careful about what you said in public, but could say what you wanted in private.
“At Harvard, however, it’s the reverse,” she said.
This is the self-censorship some Harvard students complain of. Only some complain because the complaint is directed against the rest who dominate conversation and do not want to hear opposition. These dominant students may not begin as a majority, but the activist few create the majority who accept their view and then impose it on those who disagree, forcing them to censor themselves.
The punishment for not censoring yourself is to lose the company of fellow students and to be disregarded and shunned. You are not put in jail, as happens in Iran and other countries, but you are deprived of the fellowship you want from college life.
I don’t know how widespread the necessity to censor oneself is felt, but I think the judgment behind it is pretty accurate. In practice, Harvard is a one-party spot, much more so than even the practically one-party state and one-party city in which it resides. But is this such an unhappy fact?
Self-censorship might seem to be a part of self-control based on the need to respect others. Everyone knows what tact is, and as one matures one gains experience of the great truth that it often pays to keep your mouth shut. You may be proud of the many wise and witty things you say, but with your mouth shut you will not be embarrassed by the few foolish remarks you let slip. From the standpoint of tact, self-censorship might seem to be an education in prudence and responsibility.
Perhaps the complainers about self-censorship should be boasting of their ability to exercise prudence. They are getting a better education than the many who live unprotesting and almost unconscious in the Harvard bubble. Conservatives, I like to say, get more from Harvard by having to be critical of its boring, politicized conformity — and by being forced into self-censorship. Upon graduation they can go elsewhere and enjoy a freedom they have prepared for themselves.
Yet if self-censorship is a benefit, should it not be made more general than it is? All should experience the feeling of taking a course where one sits in silence as an unaddressed minority. Why should genuine education be reserved for conservatives? But this reasoning might suggest that everyone should spend a term in jail to learn what it’s like. Then let’s move from the benefit to the harm of self-censorship.
Today, self-expression has much greater sway than self-control. To be free, it is said, you must be able to express yourself and be safe while doing so. To express yourself fully means to fashion your own identity. And to do that, the danger of being offended in your identity becomes a vital point: You must be free both to take offense when you are disrespected and to give offense when your own identity demands it.
Everyday slight offenses loom as large as major ones that are rare. Self-expression permits, even requires, that the names people use be inspected for the harm they cause. Once respected names like Woodrow Wilson and John Winthrop may need to be abandoned and tossed into the trash can of non-history. Pronouns, too, need to be revised so as not to offend persons formerly known as women; no more impersonal he or him, no more chairman or freshman.
Do people object to such changes, made without their consent? Mostly not, but if they did, they would be informed that justice overrides their sense of offense, and they must consent to the kind of censorship that actually puts words in your mouth. They must learn the new expressions and learn to like them. Self-censorship raises your consciousness and wakes you up so that you can join the woke.
Is anything lost by being woke? Yes, let me suggest there is. Instead of arguing the point, one begins to search for character defects and pounce when they are found. You blind yourself by taking offense because in doing so you are led to simplify the justice you think is so unquestionable. Instead of thinking about what justice might require, you try to shame opposition out of existence.
Believing that justice is easy to think, you begin to believe it is easy to apply. You conclude that slavery was as easy to abolish as to denounce today after it is abolished. You regard those who gave their lives in a Civil War to gain that end as less just than we are now, bravely changing names and pronouns. You agree that Harvard has a legacy of slavery rather than the legacy of anti-slavery you can see every day with a glimpse of Memorial Hall.
My argument against taking offense ends up by taking offense. I got there in defense of the honor of Harvard, which I have always loved a little more than it deserves. Now, facing my 70th reunion, it must be time to calm down and retire, accepting my own self-censorship.
To the Class of 2023: Make a life for yourselves that you can be proud of. And by the way, to keep our classrooms full, we teachers are always grateful to former students who have children.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Congratulations to the Class of 2023 on making it to graduation day! If you’re anything like I was approaching Commencement, you’re feeling proud, excited, a little sad to be ending your college journey, immensely relieved to be done with your final final exams, and grateful for four great years.
The world is open to you, and you undoubtedly have impressive professional accomplishments ahead. Some of you will pursue a career in public service, as I have. Some of you will not.
I will not try to dissuade anyone from their chosen career path. But I will make the case that service is for everyone, and you should find a place for it in your life. There is a tendency to think of success in terms of degrees, professional accomplishments, and job titles. But success is also measured in services to those without the same privilege you enjoy as Harvard alumni.
My mom was a career educator. My dad led the Manhattan chapter of the New York Urban League and later helped run homeless shelters. Some of my earliest memories with them are of being stopped on the street by their former students and clients who just wanted to say “thank you.” As an impatient child, I was often pulling on them to move on, but those encounters made a tremendous impression on me. I saw the fruits of my parents’ service in the faces of people whose lives they improved in ways big and small.
When I got to Harvard, I incorporated service into my life there, volunteering as a teacher and mentor through the Phillips Brooks House Association.
And I have continued to teach — for a time as a law school professor and currently as a volunteer Sunday school teacher at my church. Teaching and making genuine connections with young people remains deeply fulfilling to me, even though it’s been a relatively small part of my professional life.
As a student at the College, I also pursued service by advocating for policy change. I served on the Student Advisory Committee at the Institute of Politics, and as president of the Black Students Association.
Those experiences ultimately served me well in my career in government, although my path was not straight. My first job out of college was as a consultant (like so many of you!). But I continued to volunteer in my personal life, and since law school, the majority of my career has been in public service, as a federal and state prosecutor.
In many ways, I have achieved in my career in the traditional sense of the word. But achievement isn’t the most important throughline in my career.
The connecting thread, as I see it, is using different areas of the law to address power asymmetries: suing or prosecuting people in privileged positions who stole from government programs, companies that exploited workers, law enforcement officers who abused their power, healthcare companies that denied mental health treatment to people in need, and businesses that financed violent crime.
In the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, I have focused on expanding our services for survivors of crime who often feel left behind by the criminal justice system. We have embedded alternatives to incarceration into the core of our practice to ensure that people who have been failed by countless societal systems get the services they need and break the cycle of recidivism.
I have not always seen the faces of the people who have benefited from my work, as I saw with my mom and dad’s former students and clients, but I know that I am using my Harvard education to help people who need a powerful ally to level the playing field.
Whether it is in your career or as a volunteer in your community, I encourage you to do something to serve. Advance your career, yes, but also measure your success but what you do for others — students taught, victims counseled, patients healed.
Systemic change requires advocates both inside and outside the government. You do not have to pick just one lane, and you do not have to take a straight path. Follow your particular passion at a particular moment in time.
And regardless of what your day job is, remember that there are lots of ways to serve.
One of my favorite scriptures comes from the Gospel of Luke: “To whom much is given, much will be required.” I was provided the opportunity of a great experience at Harvard. For me, that opportunity came with an obligation to serve.
When I was a kid, I don’t think I knew where my parents went to college. I may not have known their exact job titles. But I saw their resumes of accomplishments in the people who stopped us on the street to offer thanks.
If my kids can say the same about me in 40 years, I will have had a successful career. I wish you the same as you embark on your next chapter.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
When Anne was growing up in New York City, her mother would sometimes reminisce about a radio drama show she remembered from her own childhood called “Grand Central Station.” Each week, the show began with an announcer describing the massive train station as a “crossroad” of innumerable private lives, “a gigantic stage on which a thousand dramas play out daily.”
Since we became Faculty Deans a decade ago, and began each year to share our daily lives with hundreds of students, we have learned to think about Harvard undergraduate life as being a little like this.
These years have been a profoundly meaningful journey for us. We have eaten with students, sat in quiet companionship with them, hosted them, played with them, advised them, laughed with them, and, on occasion — thankfully, more rarely — weathered struggles, uncertainties, and even tears with them.
But perhaps most of all, the years of living in community with students has helped us to appreciate them as people with complex private stories that had previously been mostly invisible to us, back when we were ‘just’ a professor and a museum director.
Some students worked long hours at campus jobs, not just to help pay for their own needs or social activities, but because their parents expected them to send money back home to help with living expenses. Some stayed up most of the night to comfort a distraught friend, but still managed to make it to their organic chemistry lecture. Some came out to their parents, only to find they were no longer welcome at home for Thanksgiving.
There were always new stories: the student who grew up in a refugee camp; the student who looked after the mental well-being of struggling younger siblings in high school because parents, for whatever reason, could not; the student who was the primary English-language translator for their family, even after arriving on campus.
At Commencement, we tend to spend a lot of time celebrating the many visible triumphs of our students: the prizes and scholarships; the Phi Beta Kappa honors; the championship varsity games; the prestigious or incredibly cool jobs; the internships; the great medical, law, or graduate schools.
We don’t generally stop to think about the many students who blend into the sea of gowns, but for whom simply arriving at this point is the hardest and most important thing they have ever achieved. Their Harvard experience may not have been primarily about landing that great job or winning that plum prize (though some achieve that too). It may have been primarily about something else that we don’t generally give prizes for: resilience, showing up, giving back, grace, grit, compassion, and perseverance.

This, therefore, is an essay of appreciation for all of these students. Students whose time here has been defined by milestones that they may never share with their professors or future employers, and that may never end up in their letters of recommendation. The ones who did not maintain a perfect GPA, but who were there for that friend all night, or showed up for their families in the midst of finals week. The ones who arrived on campus burdened with sometimes difficult stories, but who then also came to realize that they didn’t have to be wholly defined by those stories — that they had the ability to become authors of new stories, stories of their own.
And here’s a thought: Maybe these kinds of students offer all of us a different kind of metric of success — one that measures the distance run and the promises kept, and not just the tributes won and the public acclaim received.
Maybe the most interesting question we can ask friends as they prepare to depart is not, “What was your concentration?” Or, “What are you doing next?” But, “What’s your story?” “What was your story when you arrived, what did it become, and what is it now?” Some stories are gifts, easily told and publicly celebrated. But others are hard-earned accomplishments, marked by twists and turns that fewer people will ever hear about.
This Commencement, as we look out with affection at the final senior class we will help graduate, we will be thinking about these quieter stories, these less frequently told stories, and feeling a special sense of pride.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
I’m old enough to have witnessed many pivotal events at Harvard and many changes to its evolving culture. For example, when I graduated from Harvard Law School in 1967, I was one of 493 men in a class with only 26 women. Today, this gender gap has significantly decreased; in fact, there are more women than men in the J.D. Class of 2025.
My law school class was composed almost entirely of Caucasians. Looking through the snapshots of faces in my yearbook, I see only 11 African Americans: nine men and two women.
There is a section celebrating, if you will, the “Harvard Law Wives,” a group that in 1967 was in its 39th year. The wives reported that “The year commenced in the fall with a buffet supper and a tea given by Mrs. Griswold to introduce the new wives to Cambridge and to each other.”
The referenced “Mrs. Griswold” was the wife of Erwin N. Griswold, dean of the Law School from 1946 until 1967. It is difficult to forget his remarks on day one of law school, for they began more or less as follows (from distant but vivid memory): “Gentlemen: Welcome to Harvard Law School. Look to your left and look to your right. One of the three of you will not be here at this time next year.”
Given the sternness of Griswold’s message, perhaps my 26 female classmates were not terribly offended to have escaped his attention.
The Law School was not at all unique. A similar culture prevailed in the College, with which I had occasion to become quite familiar shortly after graduation. I worked for a small Boston law firm for my first year out, but shortly thereafter I founded my own firm along with two other lawyers — Norman S. Zalkind and John G. S. Flym.
It was our first big case that brought me back to Harvard. I recall that a veritable mob of students had engaged in an anti-war demonstration in Harvard Yard. By this time, students were refusing to show up when receiving induction notices, resulting in indictments. The firm of Flym, Zalkind, and Silverglate became expert in ‘draft law.’
But the most memorable case involved the Harvard Yard riot in 1969. A couple hundred students had taken over University Hall to protest the Reserve Officer Training Corps and its affiliated scholarships, as well as Harvard’s expansion into neighboring Cambridge communities.
University Hall housed the heart of the administration, and the students famously forced then-Assistant Dean Archie C. Epps III, one of the few African American administrators at Harvard back then, out of the building when he refused to leave. In the end, 196 demonstrators ended up being arrested for the riot. Twelve reporters were immediately released, leaving 184 to be arraigned on charges of criminal trespass.
At the Cambridge District Court trial, I remember the judge divided the defendants into smaller groups because the courtroom was not large enough to hold them all. In Middlesex County Superior Court, Flym, Zalkind, and I did our best, but we deemed the case hopeless, what with dozens of photographs of what transpired.
Yet, to our surprise, the jury acquitted — a sign of the unpopularity of that war. Volume 71, number 11 of the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, dated April 28, 1969, describes how: “Students accused of criminal trespass were freed on personal recognizance, while those who could not show bursar’s cards were required to post $20 bail.”
Looking back, what strikes me is the fact that Epps alone functionally filled the role of dean of students. Today, his shoes are filled — to the extent they will ever be filled — by an army of deans, deputy deans, assistant deans and so forth, who actually outnumber the faculty and inflate the College’s near $80,000 annual price tag.
But my main purpose here is neither to reminisce nor to recount the trials and tribulations of your predecessors, nor to criticize this august institution. My task is to give you parting words for the future. But I am hardly the most qualified. In my view, the wisest words were penned by cartoonist Garry Trudeau, creator of “Doonesbury.” He penned two strips that are particularly relevant.
In one, a few graduating college students discuss the “depressing” tuition debt that they owe before the dean takes the podium and states that: “All students owing more than $100,000 are invited to meet with debt counselors in the field house following today’s ceremony.” Graduation is a time of celebration, but one cannot help the dreary thought of the unreasonableness of the accumulated debt.
In the other strip, the commencement speaker, seemingly aware of the hypersensitivity on most university campuses — a phenomenon known as “political correctness” — regurgitates a variety of administrative jargon, explaining that “The intra-college sensitivity advisory committee has vetted the text of even trace amounts of subconscious racism, sexism, and classism” and that “any offensive elements of Western rationalism and linear logic” as well as “references flowing from a white, male, Eurocentric perspective have been eliminated,” before ending the speech with a simple “Thank you and good luck,” offering the students little encouragement and advice.
And so, members of the Harvard graduating class of 2023, it is my hope that despite shouldering the burdensome debt and the power to reform the education system for future generations, you will prosper.
I thank you for your patience, as I assume that by now you have read my entire diatribe, and I wish you all good luck.

Dear Class of 2023,
The time has finally come. We are now, officially, Harvard graduates.
Like all Harvard students in recent memory, we’ve been inundated with emails over the past four years. But for our cohort,unlike most before it, the emails we received marked life-changing and world-affecting events. As we look back on our time at Harvard, this smattering of emails maps our careers and lives in so many ways.
One of the first notable emails we received from Harvard was the First-Year Move-In email. With the date set for August 27, 2019, we packed up our belongings and lugged them to Harvard Yard. The sun beating down on us, we said goodbye to our families with nervous excitement running through our veins and met our First-Year entryways, our first introduction to the amazing people we would come to know and love at Harvard. We ate in Annenberg together and experienced homesickness together, and these people became our family.
Our bonds strengthened by the day that year — until March 10, 2020, the day an email informed us that we had five days to leave campus. We packed our belongings and left the place and people we had grown to love for the past seven months. Although this email marked two months of online learning, another email arrived that summer notifying us of nine more months of remote classes during our sophomore year.
We still remember the day that we opened that email. The year that followed matured us in a way that not many people experience in their late teens and early twenties. The pandemic changed each of us in different ways. Some of us lived alone, learning how to cope with life independently. Some of us lived with our parents, returning to our childhood bedrooms. Some of us took the year off, finding ourselves by pursuing our passions in life.
But all of us faced great loss or grief of some kind.
About one year later, we heard news of another Move-In Day, this time staggered over a week for the start of our junior years. We returned to campus with even brighter smiles and even more joy seeing friends we had not in over a year. It was bliss.
This past year, we received the email about Commencement. We would be graduating from Harvard College, finally, not only with a degree, but with moments and friendships that will last a lifetime.
Class of 2023, we have overcome challenges, celebrated accomplishments, and experienced events that have altered the course of history here at Harvard. Now, as we set out into the real world, it will be up to us to alter the course of history. Thank you for the amazing memories, and congratulations!
With Love,
Athena and Chibby

Fabian Koenig ’22-’23 and Maximilian “Maxi” Scheuplein’s wedding has been nine years and thousands of miles in the making.
In the summer of 2014, the two met in their hometown of Frankfurt, Germany through a website for gay teenagers. Fabian was about to start high school; Maxi had just graduated high school and was about to start his bachelor’s. They stayed up until 5 a.m. messaging each other that first day, then exchanged texts and hours-long voice recordings constantly over the next several weeks.
“I feel like we were best friends from the first message,” Fabian says. He came out to his mom two days after meeting Maxi in person for the first time.
In 2017, when Fabian graduated from high school and Maxi graduated from university, they transitioned to a whirlwind long-distance relationship. Fabian traveled the world during a gap year, then came to Harvard for college, while Maxi got a master’s at University College London, worked at Oxford and New York University, and ended up in the Netherlands for a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience.
Around two years ago, when they started talking about getting engaged, they made it a tradition to window-shop for rings in each new city they visited together, enjoying the free samples of champagne at fancy jewelry stores.
They eventually settled on a custom-ordered ring from Amsterdam. However, the proposal itself still came as a surprise.
On a trip to San Francisco last December, they hiked up a hill overlooking the ocean at sunset. When they reached the top, Maxi set up a tripod under the guise of doing a photoshoot. The two had gotten manicures for the first time a couple days prior, so Fabian joked, “My finger is ready; you can put it on!” He thought it was funny when Maxi got down on one knee — “and then he pulled out the box, and I was like, ‘Oh, wait! This is for real.’”
“I forgot everything I wanted to say,” Maxi laughs. “When you listen to the video now, the only thing I’m asking is, ‘Yes? You sure?’”
He was. The couple is planning a courthouse wedding in Frankfurt this July, followed by a small celebration with their families. In the fall, Fabian will move to Los Angeles to work in consulting, and Maxi will return to the Netherlands for the last year of his doctorate. Afterward, they hope to reunite and finally close the long-distance chapter of their relationship.
In hindsight, though, both agree that the challenge of growing up and changing alongside each other — developing their own interests and pursuing their own educations while remaining committed to a partner — made their relationship stronger.
“Having to overcome all these hurdles that come with long-distance relationships really made me feel this is definitely the right person to spend the rest of my life with,” Maxi says. “It’s the way you have to communicate with each other, the way you have to know each other in order to make this work across the Atlantic.”
Lindsey B. Bouldin ’22-’23 and Evan T. Anderson’s relationship was long-distance “from the get-go,” Lindsey says. Even though they’d attended the same high school in central Tennessee, they only began dating in 2020 when they were both in college — Lindsey at Harvard, Evan at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
In March 2020, halfway through her gap semester, Lindsey flew to Knoxville to visit Evan, “the day that the first confirmed case of Covid was in Tennessee.” Unable to fly back to Boston, Lindsey’s intended two-week visit home turned into a year-and-a-half stay. The change of plans, though unexpected, granted the couple valuable time in person together. Lindsey rented an apartment a five-minute drive away from Evan’s dorm, enabling them to spend weekends exploring Knoxville and camping in the Smoky Mountains.
But in the fall of 2021, when Lindsey returned to Harvard’s campus, the pair had to switch back into long-distance mode. “It was definitely an adjustment,” Lindsey says. But the duo has figured out a good system: they schedule virtual date nights every weekend, prioritize visiting each other during school breaks, and text every day. “I feel like we’re both really good texters,” she says.
Marriage had been on Lindsey’s mind since a year into their relationship, but her convictions solidified the summer before senior year, when she started picturing her life after graduation. “I knew whatever I do in my life, I'd want to do it with Evan,” she says. “Why delay the inevitable, you know?”
Evan was more hesitant. “I just wasn’t sure if I was ready for it,” he says. But in the last year, he’s become interested in Catholicism, and his religious commitment has inspired a newfound appreciation for marriage. “That has really cast marriage in a new light for me, and made me realize that it was something that I really wanted, and something that I really wanted with Lindsey.”
Lindsey, who grew up as a Jehovah’s Witness, says she’s still learning about Catholicism. “It’s more of a slower path that I’m going on, but I think it’s the path to the same destination,” she says. The two are planning to convert to Catholicism together through the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults program.
This past January, during a trip to the Virgin Islands, Evan proposed. “It just felt like the first step in something really great and really beautiful,” he says.
The couple are currently planning their wedding, which is slated for next May. In the meantime, they will both move to Knoxville following their respective graduations, after which Evan will pursue a master’s degree. They are already planning their honeymoon: a road trip to the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, the Badlands, and other national parks.
Most of all, the two are excited just to be together in person again and experience “the little moments that you don’t really get when you’re long distance,” like cooking and drinking coffee together — or as Lindsey calls it, “the boring life stuff that’s kind of boring when you’re alone, but is more meaningful and special when you’re with another person.”
It all started when Nyckole Lázaro Quintero ’24 spotted two anime keychains hanging off Christian J. Rodriguez’s ’23 backpack. It was a Friday night in the spring of 2022, and Nyckole was outside Fong Auditorium stringing up lights for Harvard College Faith and Action’s weekly “DOXA” worship meeting. “Hey,” she recalls saying to him, “I like your keychains.”
Christian, a long-time HCFA member, turned around with a “huge smile,” pleasantly surprised to meet “another anime connoisseur who also liked Jesus,” he remembers. “That was pretty cool for me.” After the event, the pair continued their conversation in Ticknor Lounge, where they talked about everything from anime to their spiritual beliefs.
For the rest of that semester, they frequented cafes in Harvard Square and “would occasionally flirt, but no one did anything,” Nyckole says. Because both had recently exited relationships the previous semester, they were reluctant to rush into anything, even though they knew they both liked each other.
They texted only sporadically throughout that summer but reconnected on Nyckole’s Minecraft server and then in person at an HCFA retreat the week before school began. On the first day of school, they got bubble tea and had a conversation that would prove decisive, about how they had each grown in their faith over the summer. “It was really important for me to hear that God was working in [Nyckole’s] life as an individual, and not just because I was there or when I was talking to her about what I believe,” Christian says.
Their last stop that night was the Quincy Grille, where they sat in a booth together, finally confessed their feelings for each other, and officially started dating.
From there, it wasn’t a long journey to engagement. Though originally Nyckole had imagined dating for longer before engagement, her ideal timeline “completely changed” when she saw how much her family “adored” Christian. Just four months into their relationship, the couple was already talking about potential timelines for engagement. Over winter break, they planned out their “entire hypothetical future together,” Christian says. “Things just clicked.”
On April 29, following their eight-month anniversary meal at Spring Shabu Shabu, Christian told Nyckole that a mutual friend needed help taking headshots for an internship. Halfway through the photo session on Weeks Bridge, the friend volunteered to take some photos of the couple, too. Christian moved behind Nyckole as if to pose high-school-prom-style, then got down on one knee instead. Overcome by laughter, and later by tears, she turned around and said yes.
The couple is planning to tie the knot next summer. In the meantime, Christian will be teaching at the middle school he attended in Lawrence, Massachusetts, while Nyckole finishes her senior year at Harvard. Eventually, Christian hopes to become a dentist, while Nyckole wants to become a math teacher.
Both of them emphasize how lucky they feel to have found a life partner in each other. “I don’t want to have to build my own foundation and then add someone to it; I want to build that foundation with someone from the beginning,” Christian says. “And I’m glad I found someone like Nyckole who I’m ready to do that with.”
Nyckole agrees: “I wouldn’t want to go through daily life with someone else.”
Carter J. Martindale ’23 and Elise L. Fischer wouldn’t have met if not for the pandemic.
After Harvard went virtual in spring of 2020, Carter came across a group of Harvard students looking to fill a room in their Utah apartment. Carter made the move to Provo, where he ended up meeting Elise.
One night, Carter and Elise, then a student at Brigham Young University, both attended a mutual friend’s gathering and got to chatting in the hot tub. Carter mentioned his interest in Taylor Swift’s “Evermore” album, which was also one of Elise’s favorites. “I can’t let this one go,” Elise recalls thinking.
Shortly thereafter, the pair went on their first official date: “hammocking” in a local park. They found ample common ground, from their similar taste in memes to their shared love of thrillers and mysteries to their compatible religious beliefs — both are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
They had only planned to hang out for a couple hours but ended up staying for nine. “We just kept talking for, like, forever,” Carter says.
For the rest of that spring, the duo went on dates either every day or every other day. Carter had an internship in Palo Alto that summer, so the pair went long-distance, and they stayed in that mode when he returned to Cambridge for his junior year. They reunited last summer, when Carter took an internship in Utah.
The lead-up to the engagement wasn’t a surprise; the pair had been talking about engagement for a while and even went ring shopping together. (“I was not about to just buy a random ring without her having looked at it!”) But when it came to the moment itself, Carter kept it hush-hush.
On a morning in July, he found a hiking trail with a secluded clearing and enlisted a couple friends to set up a blanket with rose petals and pictures of the couple. Then he drove back down and picked up Elise, who expected a routine hike. Ten feet into the trail, he led her into the clearing and proposed. “It definitely caught me off guard, especially because I really thought we were doing this hike,” Elise says. “He did a really good job.”
They didn’t finish the rest of the hike; they left and got Korean barbecue instead.
They got married in December in a small ceremony in Elise’s hometown. This semester, Elise elected to finish her BYU graduation requirements online, enabling the couple to move into an off-campus apartment near Fresh Pond. They settled into a routine — Elise would often drive Carter to campus in the mornings, and the two would sometimes work in Quincy House together or hang out with Carter’s blockmates.
After their respective graduations, they will move to Austin, Texas, where Carter will work for a legal tech company and Elise will attend nursing school.
The pair still marvels that the pandemic precipitated the start of their relationship. “It’s worked out to be where we are now,” Carter says. “So yeah, it was like a miracle.”
Cameron M. Stone ’23 calls his first date with his now-wife “kind of unorthodox”: After a mutual friend introduced him to Savannah J. Stone (née Fisher), they went on a group date shooting guns in the Utah desert, followed by dinner.
“Really safe first date when you don’t know someone, going out into the wilderness with guns,” Savannah says with a laugh. But after getting to know Cameron, she was immediately “smitten.” She remembers telling her mom over the phone late that night: “If it’s not this boy, I don’t want any other boy.”
The two began dating in January 2021, while Cameron was taking Harvard classes remotely from Utah and Savannah was attending Brigham Young University. That August, the weekend before he was set to return to Harvard to resume in-person classes, Cameron proposed.
“Savannah always joked with me that she would marry me even if I wrapped a blade of grass around her finger instead of a real diamond ring,” he says. So he had a florist make a custom engagement ring out of grass, and he surprised her with it on a picnic date.
“And she kept her word,” he smiles.
Cameron and Savannah maintained a long-distance engagement throughout the fall semester, then reunited in Utah for their wedding on January 7, 2022 — coincidentally one year to the day after their first date. Both members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they were married in Mount Timpanogos Temple, against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains and surrounded by 500 friends and family members from across the country.
“As part of our faith, the wedding ceremony, in the prayer that they give, they replace words like ‘until death do you part’ with ‘for time and all eternity,’” Cameron says. “So we have a belief that we’re married for this life and the next, which was pretty special and meaningful for us.”
“It was so exciting to see so many people being absolutely supportive and taking a chance on two kids getting married and coming all the way to Utah to celebrate with us,” Savannah says.
Savannah transferred to the University of Massachusetts Boston, and the newlyweds now live together in an apartment in Cambridge. They enjoy hanging out with Cameron’s friends in Mather House, trying new restaurants, and staying active by lifting, practicing yoga, and playing tennis and pickleball.
After they both graduate this May, they plan to relocate to London, where Cameron will work as a software engineer, and explore Europe while Savannah takes a gap year before starting dental school. They hope to eventually settle down in the Bay Area to stay close to their families in California. “A really cool aspect of getting married young is us being able to make these really big, game-time life decisions that usually people are making alone, together,” Savannah says.
Indeed, when asked what married life is like, they answer in unison: “The best!”
Kat S. Boit ’22-’23 and Ben B. Hebert describe their relationship as a “slow burn.”
They first met on the robotics team at their high school in Granby, Connecticut, and although Kat developed a bit of a crush, they stayed just friends for a couple years. “I just thought he was so out of my league,” Kat says.
Their romance didn’t begin until 2017, Kat’s junior year of high school, when Ben had already gone off to college at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The two kept in touch through a larger group chat, which turned into one-on-one phone calls, which eventually led to Kat inviting Ben to a party when he came home for spring break — a set crew party for their high school’s production of “Cinderella.” They made it official a month later.
For the next few years, the couple braved long-distance. Ben would make the six- to seven-hour drive down from Rochester every couple months to spend a weekend at Harvard. In the interim, Kat says, “we Skyped each other pretty much every day.”
The pandemic would prove pivotal for the pair. After being kicked off campus in March 2020, it took Kat only two weeks at home to decide to move in with Ben in Rochester. “My parents thought I was crazy!”
But as Kat tells it, their decision to move in together was a very thoughtful one. “I honestly felt like Ben was the person for me after probably a year into our relationship,” she says. “But I was very insistent on, like, I really need to be able to live with you first. I need to make sure that we’re compatible, and also we just need to grow up a little more.”
The two shared a 90-square-foot bedroom for the next year and a half (Kat took a year off school), and the tight quarters only brought them closer. “We definitely handled it a lot better than I would have thought,” Ben says. “That really cemented the idea that, like, we’re definitely it.”
When Ben graduated in spring 2021, he found an engineering job in Massachusetts, and the two moved into an apartment in Boston where they’re been living together since, along with their cat, Maisy. They cook together nearly every night, and unwind with yoga or games — Myst and Dungeons & Dragons are favorites.
Kat expected Ben to propose — they’d been talking about marriage “for a long time,” Ben says — but she was still surprised when it happened. After securing Kat’s parents’ blessing, Ben planned a trip to Cape Cod in June of 2022, framed as a long-overdue anniversary present. When he took her on a walk to the beach, Kat had her suspicions — the day was almost too sunny, the beach too empty — but she dismissed them when she couldn’t spot any ring-box-shaped objects in Ben’s pockets.
On a secluded stretch of shoreline, Ben brought out the ring he had hidden behind his car keys and proposed. “It just felt right,” he says.
The couple will be married in July, in a small ceremony in Brookline. After tying the knot, they’ll move to New Haven, where Kat will pursue a Ph.D. in Biology at Yale.
“We just talk, talk, talk, talk,” Benjamin J. Porteous ’22 says of his relationship with Polina Galouchko ’23. “That’s probably our favorite hobby.”
The pair began talking — quite literally — on Valentine’s Day last year, when a mutual friend invited them both to a group dinner in Dunster House dining hall. They quickly bonded over “an incredibly interesting conversation” about literature and philosophy, Polina says.
“I remember her as a lively conversationalist, just really interesting and thoughtful,” Benjamin agrees.
Although they bumped into each other a couple more times afterward, they didn’t really reconnect until the end of the school year. Polina, then a junior, was staying on campus to work at Senior Week and Commencement events, while Benjamin was preparing to deliver the Latin Salutatory at his own graduation ceremony. They found themselves spending more and more time together that May, until they finally made it official the night before Commencement — mere hours before Benjamin was set to appear onstage.
“We were just walking around the Quad and talking and talking, and I felt this guilt because he had to get up at 5 a.m. the next morning,” Polina recalls. “And right around midnight, he said, ‘Would you consider dating me?’”
“Scrap the Latin oration — there was more important stuff going on!” Benjamin says.
A year later, the duo can even finish each other’s sentences. When asked to describe their shared interests, Benjamin starts: “Classical music…”
“Opera,” Polina adds.
“Visiting historic churches of all kinds.”
“Traveling.”
“Ah, and this is my new fun fact for Zoom meetings —”
“Soviet comedies!”
They come from “different and yet very analogous” cultures, Benjamin says — although he attends an Anglo-Catholic church and she a Russian Orthodox one, they both love elaborate “high church” traditions, such as incense, beautiful vestments, and music.
Their academic pursuits are analogous, too: Polina will start a master’s in political science at Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies this fall, and Benjamin is currently enrolled in the equivalent master’s program studying China.
In fact, Benjamin’s knowledge of Communist China has helped him bond with Polina’s parents, who grew up in the Soviet Union. This past winter break, when the couple traveled to Europe to visit Polina’s family, Benjamin showed up at their home wearing a fluffy winter hat with ear flaps which a Chinese friend had gifted him.
“It looked like their Soviet comrade had just arrived,” Polina chuckles. (“I didn’t wear it with any ulterior motives,” Benjamin swears.)
With her parents’ blessing obtained, Benjamin proposed during that trip, on Polina’s birthday, in a Baroque church in Croatia overlooking the Adriatic Sea. They’ll be getting married this June on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, where Benjamin went to summer camp and where his parents were married.
Now, their conversations have turned to the seating charts for the wedding reception as they figure out how to arrange guests “from all walks of life.”
“There should be some really interesting conversations at the wedding,” Benjamin says.
“And good music,” Polina adds.
For Koushik “Babu” Koganti, whose South Indian restaurant Madras Dosa Co. opened just a few weeks ago in Harvard Square, the response from customers has been “tremendous.”
“People started coming out a lot for the last one year,” Koganti said, adding he has observed a change in the “mindset” and spending habits of local consumers.
“They don’t know what’s going to happen. So people want to do everything, whatever they want to do now,” Koganti said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she has seen many “exciting” new restaurants and businesses open in recent months, including many owned by “young entrepreneurs.”
“There’s a new vibe emerging,” Jillson added.
In the last year, Madras Dosa Co., Roust Deli, Möge Tee, Faro Café, Taiyaki NYC, Tiger Sugar, and Cava were just some of the businesses that opened their doors to Harvard Square. In the coming months, Blank Street Coffee and Joe’s Pizza are also expected to open.
Yet while Harvard Square has welcomed a bevy of new businesses in the last year — ranging from vintage clothing stores to boba tea shops to athletic facilities — a number of longstanding businesses continue to feel the lingering pains of the pandemic.
While some new business owners in the Square said they escaped the economic downturn caused by Covid-19, other longstanding businesses continue to feel the burden of pandemic-driven uncertainty and labor shortages.
Some well-known Harvard Square businesses have not survived these pressures. In the last year, the Square has seen the closures of Bonchon, Darwin’s Ltd., and Milk Bar, among others.
During the pandemic, the Charles Hotel reduced its workforce by around 80 of its nearly 300 total employees, according to Alex Attia, the hotel’s general manager.
While there has been a “nice rebound” from the peak of the pandemic, the hotel is still in its “recovery period,” Attia said, which he expects to be over by 2025 at the earliest.
The hotel’s guest bookings are “Harvard-driven,” Attia added, and as students depart campus for the summer, he is “very concerned” about the impact on business.
Labor shortages also continue to impact the hotel, he said.
“We need to continue to rethink, also, how can we do better on attracting employees, and can we make sure that we’re getting the right employees for the right job so they can stay longer?” Attia said.
According to Theodora M. Skeadas ’12, executive director of Cambridge Local First — a nonprofit network of locally owned, independent businesses in Cambridge — the labor market is “stabilizing in the new normal,” in particular because of the persistence of remote work.
“People want work that’s closer to home — they don’t want to commute as much,” Skeadas said. “The reality is, Cambridge is really expensive. And a lot of people who work at our small businesses can’t afford to live in Cambridge, and they found jobs closer to home and in cities outside of Boston.”
At Irving House at Harvard — a hotel that has served Harvard Square visitors for nearly eight decades — hiring has similarly been a “challenge,” according to Rachael Solem, the establishment’s owner and president. As a result, the hotel has given raises to current staff as well as increased the starting wage.
“While I am happy to be able to do this, it is scary to commit to a much bigger payroll when we have experienced the kind of loss we did in 2020,” Solem wrote in an emailed statement.
The restaurant and drinks scene in the Square is no different. According to Alvin Lu, the owner of Tiger Sugar in Harvard Square, good employees can be difficult to find.
“Because they’re in such demand, usually the good ones are taken, or they require a much higher pay,” Lu said.
“Being that the cost of goods has gone up and margins are being squeezed, we just need to find ways to be more efficient, operationally,” Lu added.
Since the start of the pandemic, Cambridge’s government has furnished at least $6.6 million in direct relief to more than 400 small businesses through federally funded grants, the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund, and other programs, according to city data collected through August 2022.
Of the relief funds, almost $1.5 million in federal funding was distributed to local businesses through the American Rescue Plan Act.
For Irving House, which sold one of its three buildings in summer 2020 to stay afloat, city government assistance has proven crucial.
“We applied for and received all the government assistance possible, and have survived due to that assistance,” Solem wrote in an email.
Of the Cambridge small businesses that applied, more than 80 percent — including Irving House — received city government assistance.
The figure is markedly higher than the 26 percent of applying businesses in Boston that received relief, according to a February 2022 WGBH News interview with Natalia Urtubey, Boston’s director of small business at the time.
“We have a very wealthy city, and the city government was able to offer a lot of resources, including grants — money to businesses to help them stay afloat during this time,” Skeadas said of Cambridge.
The resources Cambridge offered, according to Jillson, allowed businesses to overcome pandemic-driven economic difficulties.
“Fewer than originally anticipated” businesses permanently closed, she said, “because the community did pull together and because there were so many resources available to our business community here in Cambridge.”
“The community rallied,” Jillson said.
On top of government aid, groups like the Harvard Square Business Association and Cambridge Local First have promoted locally owned businesses and encouraged consumers to shop local.
HSBA is active on social media and features many of the new businesses that have arrived in the Square recently.
Cambridge Local First hosts “shop local” campaigns during the holiday season and runs educational programming on the benefits of a strong local economy, according to Skeadas.
In addition, Cambridge Local First advocates for policies that will “create a level playing field for small businesses” at all levels of government, per Skeadas.
Even as small business pandemic relief subsides, new businesses are flocking to Harvard Square.
Recently, there has been a wave of store openings, including boba tea shops and clothing stores. In just the past year, three boba tea shops — Gong Cha, Tiger Sugar, and Möge Tee — joined Harvard Square, which previously only hosted boba shop Kung Fu Tea.
Targeting both tourists and students, So Lim Ting, co-owner of Möge Tee, said the Square affords businesses like his an ideal location.
“Everybody [who] comes to Boston, they go to Harvard, definitely,” he said.
Pardis Saffari, director of Cambridge’s Economic Opportunity and Development Division, described the Square as a “regional hub, providing easy access for residents from surrounding towns to come to the city.”
“These advantages provide great opportunities for our businesses to have a consistent customer base on the weekdays and weekends, which many other commercial districts (like downtowns) lack,” Saffari wrote in an email.
Dixon Leung, operating partner of Square newcomer WakuWaku Ramen and Sake, also cited the vast potential clientele of college students and tourists as a major factor for expanding into Harvard Square.
Amid the recent additions to the Square, business owners have had to adapt creatively to new challenges that have emerged.
In addition to rising labor costs, the wave of new business openings has increased competition for shops such as Tiger Sugar, according to Lu.
“It’s overly saturated,” Lu said. “There’s just so many restaurants and food-beverage places.”
Lu said to account for labor shortages, Tiger Sugar has been experimenting with touchscreen point-of-sale systems, self-ordering kiosks, and other technologies to substitute for staff.
“On the product side of things, it’s just trying to be innovative,” Lu said. “Keep up with the trends. Also run promotions and collaborations with possibly bigger brands.”
Cecilia Hermawan, the owner of the new vintage clothing store Vico Style, said it is important to run creative marketing campaigns to attract customers.
“Post-pandemic, I feel like people are more interested to interact with one another and going into brick and mortar,” Hermawan said. “But also at the same time as an entrepreneur, I have to think creatively on how to win people’s share of wallet.”
Though many of the new entrants to the Square are chain and franchise establishments — including Tiger Sugar, Le Macaron, and CAVA — the majority of businesses in the neighborhood remain locally owned, according to both Saffari and Jillson.
“We’ve been watching the number of locally owned independents in the Square for almost two decades, and the number has hovered between 70 and 75 percent for two decades,” Jillson said. “I don’t anticipate any changes in that number.”
Even as longstanding businesses like Irving House anticipate “better and better” circumstances, uncertainty remains.
“Having experienced 2020 with all of its losses (employees, money, one of our guesthouses) I will probably never feel quite confident again about how solid our place in the market is,” wrote Solem, the owner of Irving House.
“It still hurts to think about; it feels like a failure, as I tried to keep the place open somehow but could not,” Solem added. “It’s a new landscape in so many ways.”
For Attia, a large part of his business outlook relies on having students on campus, which he said “generates energy in this Square that affects the business, but affects our psyche as well.”
“When we see people around us, we feel good about it,” Attia said.
He added, however, that the ongoing economic recovery continues to present challenges for his business.
“And when our office space is empty, and our restaurants are half full, and our rooms are not sold, then you start rethinking the whole process of how long is this going to last, and can I plan for 90 days from now, or is it the year from now?” Attia said.
Skeadas said as large corporations like Amazon continue to gain ground among consumers, “there just isn’t enough legislative work being done to create sustainable, thriving locally owned economies.” As a result, she said, Cambridge Local First has been focused on antitrust advocacy in the recent year.
“We’re doing the best we can, but it’s certainly very challenging,” Skeadas said.
Many new business owners expressed optimism about the economic state of the Square.
“I think it’s pretty back to normal. I talked with my landlord about it before opening and she said the businesses in Harvard Square have been better than ever,” said Jenna E. Cea-Curry, owner of the Attic, a newly opened Massachusetts Ave. clothing store.
Similarly, Koganti, who manages another Madras Dosa restaurant in Seaport, said he is optimistic about his Harvard Square endeavor.
“I see most of restaurants are doing great after the pandemic now,” Koganti said.
Attia said despite ongoing labor and economic challenges, Harvard Square entrepreneurs should work toward a positive future.
“If we’re not optimistic now, after this horrible pandemic, then we’ll never be optimistic,” Attia said.

In the pre-dawn hours of April 3, a false 911 call sent Harvard University Police officers equipped with assault rifles and riot gear into a suite occupied by four Black seniors — triggering a wave of scrutiny of the University’s private police force and its practices.
At around 4 a.m., HUPD dispatched at least five armed officers to the students’ suite in Leverett House, an upperclassman dormitory, in response to a hoax 911 call from an individual claiming to be armed and holding a woman hostage in the dorm. The students awoke to banging on their doors and were ordered out of their rooms with their hands up as officers pointed assault rifles at them.
Jarah K. Cotton ’23, one of the seniors, said the experience was “terrifying” in an interview later that day.
“We were all extremely scared, particularly because my roommates and I are Black students who have been bombarded our whole lives with stories and images portraying how situations such as this had ended up terribly,” Cotton wrote in an email that morning. “We felt our lives were in danger. We are traumatized.”
The false 911 call, an apparent swatting attack, made national headlines and led Harvard students, alumni, and the public to scrutinize HUPD’s response and raise questions about the potential racial implications underlying the attack.
HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay said the swatting was “an unprecedented incident.”
While the swatting itself may have been unprecedented, concerns surrounding transparency have long surrounded the more-than-century-old police force.
“My trust for HUPD is very low,” said Prince A. Williams ’25, a labor activist on campus. “I see them every day as sort of someone who’s looking over my shoulder when I’m at a labor rally, or looking over my shoulder when I’m at a Palestine rally.”
“They’re there to intimidate,” added Williams, who is a Crimson Editorial editor.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on student criticisms, though wrote in an email that HUPD has become “more diverse, professional, and community oriented” throughout its history.
How much does the public know about the University’s police force? In what ways is HUPD a “black box” — a system whose inner workings are unknown to outside observers?
Following the Leverett swatting attack, students and affiliates raised questions about HUPD procedures and Harvard’s response to the attack.
“One of my first reactions was, ‘Somebody weaponized HUPD against Black students,’” Williams said. “Clearly, whoever called knew who was in that room, and they — just like everyone else — they understand the relationship between the police and Black people historically.”
Just over two weeks after the attack, 45 Black student organizations and supporting groups at Harvard co-signed a letter demanding a University-wide statement acknowledging the “significant racial impact” of the swatting, a thorough HUPD investigation, increased HUPD transparency and accountability, “proactive” mental health support, and an in-person town hall with top University officials.
Clay acknowledged the criticisms of students in an interview earlier this month and expressed support for their demands.
“I agree with it 100 percent,” Clay said. “I don’t think their demands were unreasonable at all.”
Clay added that Harvard “dropped the ball” by not issuing a statement to students sooner after the attack. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s email to undergraduates came roughly 66 hours after the police raid, a delay that drew criticism from affiliates.
Clay, along with top Harvard administrators including President Lawrence S. Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, and Khurana met with eight Black student leaders representing organizations that signed the letter.
But some student leaders said their demands went unanswered during the meeting. Harvard Black Students Association President Angie Gabeau ’25 told The Crimson in April that she was “a little disappointed in the fact that none of the demands were met” after the meeting.
According to Monica M. Clark ’06, who is president of the Harvard Black Alumni Society, Clay held a May 15 town hall with the alumni group’s members and other administrators following a request from Clark and other leaders of the group.
“I was surprised by how open he was,” Clark said in an interview. “I thought that was really helpful.”
The attack also raised questions about HUPD’s arsenal, with some affiliates expressing concern over the use of assault rifles and riot gear in the raid.
“I was, to be honest, completely and utterly unsurprised,” said TomHenry J. Reagan, an executive board member for Harvard’s graduate student union. “I didn’t really know that they have riot gear capabilities, but I could have guessed it.”
In response to the attack, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers passed a resolution calling for HUPD to be disarmed and replaced with “unarmed first responders.”
Williams, who supports HUPD’s abolition, said the department should not have assault weapons, calling for the “demilitarizing” of the campus police force.
Clay defended HUPD’s use of “long guns and body armor” in response to criticisms of the use of assault weapons and raid gear.
“I don’t think we’re militarized at all. I think we have the weaponry that is minimally adequate considering the amount of violence in the United States, ” Clay said.
Clay also said that the department’s possession of the equipment should not be surprising.
“It’s been here for years. How come nobody else asked prior to this incident?” Clay said. “It’s not like HUPD purchased these things in a vacuum, so why wasn’t this known prior to me getting here?”
Catalano, the HUPD spokesperson, declined a request from The Crimson for a full inventory of HUPD’s weapons and equipment, citing a longstanding department policy.
HUPD has long had a contested presence on Harvard’s campus.
A January 2020 Crimson investigation uncovered a pattern of racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism in the department, and in June 2020, former HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley announced his plans to retire after a quarter-century leading the department. Shortly after, The Crimson’s Editorial Board called for HUPD’s abolition, pointing to their presence at a Boston police brutality protest sparked by George Floyd’s murder.
“There’s always been some issues and concerns that in many ways is systemic of just policing in the United States in general,” said HUPD Advisory Board Chair Tim Bowman in an April interview.
“It’s not necessarily a bad culture, but it may not always be the culture that — at a university campus — we’re ideally looking for,” Bowman said of U.S. policing culture.
Assuming the role of HUPD’s new chief in July 2021, Clay began his tenure with a pledge for transparency, telling the Harvard Gazette ahead of his appointment that police leadership must “change the culture within our departments” and “show compassion and integrity.”
By March, Clay had overseen a significant personnel overhaul, retaining just three members of Riley’s senior leadership staff.
Clay’s HUPD has also engaged with student activists on concerns over the department’s activities. Following years of outcry from students and faculty, HUPD shut down its substation at Mather House — one of four police substations on campus at the time — in February 2022.
Still, Clay faces a campus that is deeply skeptical of policing.
Nearly 50 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s Class of 2025 freshman survey indicated they strongly or somewhat supported defunding the police. Roughly 24 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s Class of 2023 senior survey indicated that they distrusted HUPD “fully or somewhat,” with Black students reporting the lowest level of trust.
Some, like Williams and Reagan, even call for HUPD to be wholly abolished.
“I personally would really rather see HUPD mostly go away and all of those positions get replaced with unarmed emergency first responders like mental health professionals and EMTs,” Reagan said.
Catalano wrote in an email that HUPD has increased its deescalation and diversity and inclusion training over the years as part of a transition toward greater community engagement.
“We have officers with more diverse backgrounds in order to connect with our community, as well as more females in leadership roles,” he wrote.
Unlike municipal police agencies, HUPD’s status as a private police force allows it to shield police reports and other documents from public records requests, with police reports only becoming publicly available following an arrest.
In 2003, The Crimson — represented by the American Civil Liberties Union — filed a lawsuit against HUPD in an effort to compel the department to release detailed crime reports under Massachusetts public records laws.
It argued that HUPD officers should be subject to laws allowing the public to access police reports with detailed information on incidents, including testimony from witnesses and officers’ direct accounts of interactions with the public. The Crimson claimed that HUPD’s denial of its requests for incident reports hinders its ability to report fully on crime-related matters.
However, in 2006, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled against The Crimson, upholding the University’s position that HUPD, as a private entity, is not subject to the same public records requirements as municipal police departments and thus is not obligated to disclose incident reports — even to the victims of crimes themselves.
Exceptions to the rule are rare and limited to specific circumstances, such as when victims of theft and accidents require a copy of their incident report for insurance purposes. In those cases, the University’s Office of the General Counsel authorizes HUPD to provide them.
“I think it’s kind of ridiculous that these records aren’t public,” Reagan said. “I think that they should, at the very least, be held to the same level of accountability as a municipal police force.”
“Ideally, I would like to see a step beyond that — maybe, disarmament or just replacing them entirely with unarmed emergency first responders,” he added.
Clay objected to calls to make all police reports publicly available.
“It’s just a popular way of saying, ‘We don’t trust you,’” Clay said. “I’d rather you just say, ‘We don’t trust you, and we want to know more,’ than to say, ‘All your reports should be released.’”
“There’s some things that could cause irreparable damage if they’re released, and I’m not going to do that,” he added. “I don’t care what the cry is.”
Catalano wrote in a statement that the policy is upheld “in the interest of maintaining community members’ privacy.”
But “if the laws and rules around info sharing change,” Catalano wrote, HUPD will comply “as required.”
Following a 2020 external review commissioned by Bacow, HUPD introduced an online workload and crime dashboard that “serves to improve communication, information-sharing, and transparency," according to the body’s website.
The dashboard spans three years of data, displaying a detailed breakdown of arrests, criminal complaints, and calls of service from lockouts to medical situations. The dashboard’s initial release of data showed that the department disproportionately arrested Black people from 2018 to 2020.
The tool has not been updated since June 2021.
Reagan criticized the lack of availability of recent data, noting that he was unable to find information after 2021. He added that he has “personally been dissatisfied” with HUPD’s reporting practices and feels “that they’re not really up to par.”
“It doesn’t feel great that we don’t have data on what kinds of arrests are being made, who HUPD is interacting with,” Reagan said.
In a recent interview, Clay explained that the delay in dashboard updates is “to look and make sure that this stuff is actually accurate, and that it rises to the level of what Harvard University would like to see of HUPD.”
“That takes time, and it drags it out,” Clay said, noting that the update has been “ready to go” since March. Clay said that his goal is to release an update every April, though he is “not making any promises.”
Clay stressed HUPD’s commitment to transparency with regard to accessible data.
“I’m proud to say we’re one of the few people that we will put out our data, regardless of what it looks like. We are ready to take the criticism,” Clay said. “It’s not because we’re trying to win some prize.”
Clay added that equipping HUPD officers with body cameras, a measure presently absent, could help enhance accountability.
“It’s a recording of what actually occurs at a scene, so you can’t dispute it — there’s very little room for interpretation,” Clay said. “That makes it very simple for me to say this occurred or this didn’t occur, or officers should have done this, or that was remarkable that an officer did do that thing. So I love it.”
Still, Clay said that he has not “done a deep dive” on implementing body cameras due to student privacy concerns.
Catalano wrote in an email that the dashboard already highlights the “demographics of the persons impacted by our enforcement actions.”
According to Catalano, the second phase of the dashboard will be released in June and will include updated data through 2022 on HUPD calls, arrests, and criminal complaints, which were previously available through 2020. It will also display three new dashboards with data on field stops, use of force, and personnel complaints, which have not previously been publicly reported.
Catalano added that members of the HUPD Advisory Board — a committee of Harvard affiliates tasked with overseeing HUPD’s activity and providing recommendations — “complimented the transparency of the Dashboard” and offered “a few minor modifications.”
Clay said that the new data will make the department “by far” more transparent than “any other part of this University.”
“I don’t recall seeing data like this from anyone else,” he said.
The student and alumni backlash and calls for greater transparency following the Leverett swatting attack mark a new challenge for Clay’s tenure and his project of police reform.
“The Chief has made community engagement a priority,” Catalano wrote. “He wants the officers to be approachable to be seen as a resource in our joint effort to maintaining a safe and secure campus.”
Some students, however, remain unconvinced by Clay’s moves toward a more open HUPD.
“Story after story, it doesn’t seem like this entity is there to really protect and serve people, but more so to protect and serve this big corporation and its property,” Williams said.

With the Supreme Court widely expected to strike down race-conscious admissions this summer, another Harvard College admissions practice — legacy and donor preferences — could become collateral damage.
After hearing oral arguments from Harvard and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in October, the Supreme Court appears prepared to overturn race-conscious admissions in higher education. In the process, SFFA and other legal experts have criticized Harvard’s long-held leg-up for legacies and children of donors.
Overall, applicants to the College’s classes of 2014 through 2019 faced an acceptance rate of about 6 percent. But this figure was not uniform for all groups: the College admitted 86 percent of athletes, 33 percent of legacy students, 42 percent of students on the dean’s list, and nearly 47 percent of applicants who were children of faculty or staff.
These students are collectively called ALDCs, shorthand for athletes, legacies, dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff.
Critics of legacy and donor preferences say that these preferences reinforce inequality in the admissions process.
In a March interview, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 defended these practices, saying that legacy status gives a “slight tip” in the admissions process.
“It’s been a policy in place at Harvard for a very, very long time, and that’s what our office does,” Fitzsimmons said.
Much of the data concerning the College’s use of legacy preference in the admissions process surfaced during SFFA’s lawsuit against Harvard.
“We wouldn’t really know anything about this process but for discovery during SFFA’s lawsuit,” John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Evan J. Mandery ’89 said. “So that’s kind of one virtuous thing that came out of it — it opens a window into this otherwise opaque admissions process.”
According to the incoming class survey for the Class of 2025, roughly 31 percent of students who had one or more parents attend Harvard reported a family income of $500,000 or more.
Almost 19 percent of respondents who identified as white reported legacy status, while for Asian American, Latinx, and Black respondents, the numbers were 15.1 percent, 9.1 percent, and 6.1 percent, respectively.
Members of the dean’s interest list — a confidential list of applicants compiled by the College every admissions cycle — are often related to top donors, and based on 2018 court filings by SFFA, these applicants benefit from an increased acceptance rate.
According to court documents, 192 students in the Class of 2019 — representing more than 10 percent of the class — were members of the dean’s list or the “Director’s List.”
A 2019 study led by Duke economist Peter S. Arcidiacono, an expert witness for SFFA, found that 43 percent of white admits in the Classes of 2014 through 2019 were ALDCs.
The study also determined that roughly 75 percent of these admitted students would have been rejected if their legacy status, athletic ability, or presence on the dean’s list were not considered in the admissions process.
Arcidiacono’s analysis claimed removing legacy and athlete preferences “results in shifts in admissions away from white applicants with each of the other groups either increasing or staying the same” while reducing the number of high-income applicants admitted to the College.
In response to a free-response question on The Crimson’s 2023 Faculty of Arts and Sciences survey asking for thoughts on Harvard’s admissions policies, 15 of 31 respondents who wrote an answer specifically mentioned legacy admissions in criticisms of the College’s admissions process.
“When Affirmative Action is overruled, we should use this opportunity to end legacy, donor, and athlete preferences as well,” one faculty member wrote.
Mandery criticized Harvard as “resistant to change” and “reinforcing of the existing status quo of the social hierarchy.”
“Harvard does promote opportunity for a handful of poor students of color. But mostly what it does is it takes the accidents of birth, white, rich students who are winners of the natural lottery, and launders their advantage of birth into a degree of sort of objective value,” Mandery said.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on criticisms of admissions preferences for legacies and children of donors.
Julie J. Park — an associate professor of education at University of Maryland, College Park, who previously served as a consulting expert for Harvard during SFFA’s lawsuit — said she thinks legacy and donor preferences are “deeply problematic” and “contradictory towards equity.”
An applicant’s legacy status, Ena Basic ’24 said, “just tells a person that you had a little bit better luck in life.”
Jordan H. Barton ’23 said he believes students are “ambivalent” about legacy and donor preferences because it is the “prevailing ethos” at the College.
“It’s like going to Dartmouth and being like, ‘Do you think day-drinking is a problem?’” Barton said. “It’s just so embedded and part of the school — I don’t know if you can really bring systemic changes to it that don’t go way deeper.”
Emily Handsman, a Harvard College postdoctoral fellow in Sociology, said if you go up to “random Harvard undergrads,” there is a meaningful chance that either they or someone they know benefited from legacy or donor preferences in admissions.
“Even if you’re talking to someone who didn’t have any of those legs up, they made it here,” Handsman added. “I think that at that point you’re focused on ‘Okay, I’m here at Harvard. I might have some impostor syndrome but I made it here. So clearly things are fair enough if I got here.’”
Some critics of legacy admissions and affirmative action link Harvard’s longstanding practices to the College’s past efforts to bar Jewish applicants during the 1920s and 1930s.
“Harvard started using legacy preference as a way to address the rising number of Jewish admitted students,” Massachusetts State Representative Simon Cataldo said.
“It’s really hard, I think, to justify from a moral or historical perspective the continued use of legacy admissions. Donor preference admissions is discriminatory on its face to students who lack generational wealth,” he said.
The College has previously convened several groups to examine its admissions policies. In 2014, the College formed a committee to analyze the role of race in the admissions process and its importance to diversity of the student body.
The group’s work was paused when SFFA filed its initial lawsuit against Harvard, alleging that the College’s use of race in the admission process discriminates against Asian American applicants.
Two years later, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana chaired the Committee to Study the Importance of Student Body Diversity.
In June 2017, Khurana co-chaired the Committee to Study Race-Neutral Alternatives with Fitzsimmons and Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Michael D. Smith.
In a report released in 2018, the committee considered eliminating preference for ALDCs as race-neutral alternatives but concluded that none of these alternatives would achieve diversity without “significant and unacceptable” sacrifice to “other institutional imperatives.”
The report also stated that legacy preference “helps to cement strong bonds between the university and its alumni.”
“Harvard alumni also offer generous financial support to their alma mater. That financial support is essential to Harvard’s position as a leading institution of higher learning; indeed, it helps make the financial aid policies possible that help the diversity and excellence of the College’s student body,” the report states.
Some supporters of legacy preferences argue there is a link between legacy preference and increased alumni donations.
“I think economically, it just makes sense for the University to do. So, I don't have a huge problem with it,” Cormac J. McIntosh ’24 said. “I think that you’re more likely to give money if your children will go on to have the same experiences.”
Texaco U.M. Texeira-Ramos ’26 said being a first-generation, low-income student influenced their perspective on donor admissions.
“I’m FGLI so I am dependent on donors’ donations to be able to afford to attend this university. And so to some extent, if that’s the price to be paid, then so be it,” Texeira-Ramos said.
In response to the report’s endorsement of legacy preferences, Mandery said there is no proof supporting the proposition that ending legacy admissions would “jeopardize important institutional interests.” Instead, there is “significant evidence to the contrary,” he claimed.
Mandery pointed to MIT, which does not prefer children of alumni in its admissions process but maintains an endowment of almost $25 billion.
“I understand the institutional need from the Harvard administration perspective to keep these policies in place but I think they’re quite damaging, perhaps beyond what the administration is aware of,” said Kylan M. Tatum ’25, co-founder of the Affirmative Action Coalition.
Several of the College’s peer institutions have done away with legacy preferences, including Johns Hopkins University, and Amherst College. The admissions office of the University of Pennsylvania this year quietly reworded its admissions website to deemphasize legacy benefits, the Daily Pennsylvanian reported in March.
“As more campuses have moved away from legacy preferences, as far as I know, you haven’t seen a hit to donations in any meaningful way,” Park said.
During oral arguments in October, attorneys for SFFA scrutinized the College’s use of legacy preferences, arguing for the use of race-neutral methods to increase diversity, such as eliminating the consideration of legacy status.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch pushed back against Harvard’s use of legacy preferences, asking Harvard lawyers if eliminating these preferences would increase socioeconomic diversity at the College.
According to Peter F. Lake ’81, an expert in higher education law, the Supreme Court’s impending decision will be a “game-changer” for issues related to the admissions process.
“I don’t think that this litigation will actually end litigation over admissions. I think this is just another step in the process of the courts micromanaging admissions processes,” Lake said. “And so it just seems that one fight begets another.”
Legislation at the state level could also pose problems for the future of the College’s legacy and donor preferences.
The Massachusetts State Legislature is currently considering a bill which would levy fees against universities that continue to apply legacy and donor preferences in their admissions processes, proportional to the size of their endowment.
If the bill were to go into effect, Harvard would have to pay approximately $100 million each year they consider legacy and donor status.
Dane, the Harvard spokesperson, declined to comment on the bill.
Cataldo said he believes state legislation to curtail legacy practices is urgently needed as the Supreme Court is expected to rule on race-conscious admissions this summer.
“Massachusetts needs to be a leader in that regard. If the Supreme Court is going to take away affirmative action for historically disadvantaged students, then we can limit affirmative action for the rich,” Cataldo said.
Mandery said if Harvard attempts to eliminate legacy and donor preference in the wake of a potential overturning of race-conscious admissions, the College could be liable to more litigation.
“The race-neutral principle carried to its logical conclusion would preclude Harvard from ending legacy preference for the purpose of promoting race diversity,” Mandery said.
Mandery said the College’s “explicit preference for white alumni” while arguing for racial diversity before the Court is “ethically hypocritical” and a “legally untenable position.”
“Legacy preference fundamentally compromised their case,” Mandery said. “They can’t use a race-conscious method until they’ve exhausted race-neutral means. And so they have a simple race-neutral mechanism, which is they could end or sharply curtail all of these preferences, which work to the benefit of rich white people.”
Experts say that if race-conscious admissions are overturned, Harvard might seek to also get rid of legacy admissions, but the Court’s ruling is not expected to restrict legacy and donor preferences.
Natasha Warikoo, a Sociology professor at Tufts University, wrote in an emailed statement that she believes the Court is “unlikely to say anything” about legacy admissions policies.
“There is no law against favoring legacies or well-off people — colleges are free to make admissions decisions using almost any criteria,” Warikoo wrote.
“Race is a ‘suspect class’ in the eyes of the law, and must only be used in narrow circumstances, for reasons that a judge approves. This is why affirmative action can be attacked — by using laws designed to protect African Americans — but not legacy or donor-list admissions,” she added.
But Arcidiacono said he does not believe legacy preferences will persist if the Supreme Court rules against race-conscious admissions practices.
“I think it would just not be politically palatable,” he said.
While athletes, legacies, and children of donors or faculty are often lumped together into one category, Park said the College might still give preferential treatment to applicants in certain categories.
“I don’t think the whole ‘ALDC’ is necessarily going to go away in one chopping block,” she said.
Lake said he believes the Supreme Court has “made itself co-chair of the academic admissions process at private schools.”
“Something similar is happening at the state level,” Lake added. “But this is a particularly unusual and historical movement from the point of view of the federal government.”

For decades, activists at Ivy League schools have pushed for the establishment of multicultural centers — physical spaces on campus to foster inclusion for diverse groups of students.
Many of Harvard’s peer schools — including Princeton, Columbia, and Yale — ultimately established these spaces, either for individual groups or diverse identities as a whole.
Still, since the 1960s, Harvard administrators have rejected undergraduate proposals for a multicultural center. In the years following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, some believe students have stopped asking for a multicultural center, even as activism supporting an ethnic studies department and race-conscious admissions has persisted.
Three years after the pandemic began, activists are beginning to revive efforts for cultural centers or a multicultural space, though many have different views on what these spaces would look like.
Though Harvard has a prayer space and a center for race relations housed in the basements of freshman dorms, affinity group leaders said these areas fall short of a multicultural space.
Tung T. Nguyen ’86 — a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who has worked in diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism — said he first witnessed the push for a multicultural center while he was a student on campus.
“For us, a lot of us, we feel that it’s not just about a multicultural center,” Nguyen said. “It’s about a mindset at Harvard that says it values diversity and brings in diverse people. But when the diverse people get there, Harvard does not welcome them.”
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo declined to comment on criticisms of institutional support for diverse students.
In early 2018, it seemed like the movement for a multicultural center was picking up steam. Student government representatives voiced their support for the space and created a Multicultural Center Coalition. A year later, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said Harvard would continue research on a potential multicultural center.
But some students said the movement came to a halt during the pandemic, as students were forced to go home and reimagine their relationship with a physical campus while taking classes on Zoom.
Former Harvard South Asian Association Co-President Shruthi S. Kumar ’24 said she noted a decrease in advocacy efforts for a multicultural center since the onset of the pandemic.
“I don’t think there has been any progressive movement since the pandemic, or any large action taken since then,” Kumar said.
Harvard Dharma Co-President Navin S. Durbhakula ’25 said even pre-pandemic, his group faced difficulties in taking advocacy efforts beyond intergroup conversations because “nobody really knew where to go from here.”
“I think that that had always sort of presented a difficulty, and then obviously during Covid when there was no chance of building anything on campus — I think that definitely probably stifled progress a bit coming back,” he said.
Shraddha Joshi ’24, a member of Harvard Ghungroo and the Palestine Solidarity Committee, said she believes the pandemic may have severed advocates’ connections to physical spaces when they were sent home.
“Having such different relationships with physical spaces post-pandemic might have affected the way people sort of conceptualize the value of a dedicated center,” Joshi said.
Some student leaders cited changing priorities in recent years as a reason behind the shift away from advocacy for a multicultural center.
Chelsea Wang ’25, co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, said pushing for a multicultural center has “been on the back burner” because the organization has been focused on fighting for affirmative action as Harvard faces a ruling on a lawsuit threatening its race-conscious admissions practices.
Former Harvard Islamic Society Co-President Reem K. Ali ’23 said her group’s advocacy efforts “turned to more immediate asks” post-Covid-19, such as implementing Halal options in Harvard dining halls.
“Advocacy for a multicultural center is something that does need to be restarted because it’s something that’s very, very desperately needed by the various affinity groups here, who often feel like they have no space, they have no home,” Ali said.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24 — who formerly served as director of inclusion and belonging of the Undergraduate Council, Harvard’s recently dissolved student government — said despite stumbles due to the pandemic, she believes “energy and momentum is building up again to try to continue advocacy efforts.”
Abigail Romero ’23, chair of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations Student Advisory Committee, said she spoke with senior members of the Foundation about reviving the push for a multicultural center.
“We talked about perhaps revitalizing this conversation, or what it would look like to advocate for a multicultural center, given that the Harvard Foundation kind of serves a purpose of bringing together different organizations on campus already,” said Romero, a Crimson News editor.
Over the years, the conversation about what cultural spaces on Harvard’s campus should look like has evolved.
Mataya R. Philbrick ’24 said she believes student demands have “really shifted” from one large multicultural center to many smaller cultural centers. Philbrick is working with the Harvard Black Alumni Society and Harvard Black Community Leaders to push for a Black cultural center on campus.
The idea started last summer when Philbrick spoke with a friend at Yale, who was “shocked” to learn that Harvard does not have a multicultural space or cultural houses for diverse groups.
“When you create a space that is multicultural, oftentimes it can exclude based on other societal factors like economic or colorism,” Philbrick said. “Thinking about the Black community, I felt that a space that would be safe for us would be a space where we’re able to come together as a community.”
“I think that solidarity amongst people of color is incredibly important and valuable,” she added. “But I think that solidarity can occur more across us all having our own spaces and own time to celebrate our unique cultural differences rather than one space that kind of flattens us.”
Kashish Bastola ’26, the Education and Political Chair of AAA, also said he was concerned about one large multicultural center, citing the potential for minority groups to be excluded or overlooked.
Bastola said AAA sees forming cultural spaces for students with marginalized backgrounds to “come together and feel that their identities are being affirmed” as “a huge priority.”
“We really hope that the College will listen to students and to student organizations as we organize around these cultural centers that we have seen be successful on other campuses,” Bastola said.
Brian M. Magdaleno ’23, president of Mariachi Veritas, said while performing with his group he noticed several Boston-area schools had both multicultural centers and specialized cultural spaces.
“I think it would be beneficial to also have smaller centers,” Magdaleno said. “Maybe having smaller cultural centers will allow more personalized support or resources to that specific group.”
But other student leaders and affiliates are pushing for one large multicultural space over individual centers.
Wang said because students “don’t have anything to begin with, it’s much easier to start with one center” than to ask for many.
“We can have both — I think we can have a multicultural center and within it have different spaces dedicated to different groups,” Wang said. “But I think there is value in having a space where everyone can come together and collaborate on projects that affect all of us because at the end of the day, while we have many very different experiences, often there are the same issues facing all of us.”
Professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures Ali S.A. Asani ’77 said the administration has cited the lack of space on campus in rejecting requests for a multicultural center, a factor that may impede the establishment of several cultural spaces.
As conversations surrounding multicultural center advocacy continue, some groups said specific needs to be addressed in the potential space.
Prayer spaces for some campus religious groups — including the Harvard Islamic Society and Harvard Dharma — are currently housed in the basement of Canaday Hall.
Durbhakula, co-president of Harvard Dharma, said the organization has pushed for a larger, above-ground prayer space that can accommodate more students and provide greater flexibility in holding events.
“It was really difficult for us logistically to have our prayer space in the basement,” he said.
Ahuja said the Harvard Sikh Student Association does not currently have a prayer space, underscoring the importance of pushing for a multicultural center as a physical space.
Physical space limitations have “hindered the growth” of the South Asian Association, Kumar said, adding that a space would allow the group to host speakers, board meetings, fashion shows, and other events.
Bastola said he would like to see a multicultural center with features including a kitchen, lounge spaces, conference rooms, and artwork to showcase different cultures.
“A lot of it boils down to it being kind of like a home, honestly,” he said. “I think these cultural centers can be microcosms of that for our campus community, but also places where we can invite people who are non-Asian to come and see what our culture is.”
In 2019, the College convened a Working Group on Symbols and Spaces of Engagement to “examine and evaluate how the variety of spaces and symbols impact the experiences of different students on campus,” according to its mission.
The working group, chaired by Asani, recommended “rethinking the Harvard Foundation” to become a space of “engaging students of all ethnicities and backgrounds.”
The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, founded in 1981, hosts cultural events and has a space in the lower level of the freshman dormitory Grays Hall that includes a kitchen, conference room, and serenity room for prayer or meditation.
“It’s been in existence for 40 years. When it was created, Harvard was a very different place,” Asani said. “You rebrand its mission, and it will then address some of the needs that the students who are calling for a multicultural center — they have certain needs that they want — then this can address those needs.”
Kyla N. Golding ’24, an intern at the Harvard Foundation, said the Foundation tries to be “an open and inclusive space” for cultural groups to find support and resources.
“Although we are not in name a multicultural center, in the absence of one, we’ve kind of operated as one,” said Golding, a Crimson Editorial editor.
Sadé Abraham, senior director of the Harvard Foundation, wrote in a statement that the center is engaged in conversations “deeply rooted in our lived experiences, which are essential to driving progress.”
“We intentionally establish safe spaces for historically marginalized individuals,” Abraham wrote. “The Harvard Foundation is committed to continuing our legacy, history, and practice of actualizing inclusive excellence and embodying our highest hopes and aspirations through our efforts.”
A multicultural center would be able to provide more “individual and personalized” resources for students than the Harvard Foundation currently can, Golding said.
She added that she is uncertain about the future of the multicultural center, given Harvard’s upcoming presidential transition, which will see Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay assume Harvard’s top post.
“Because she’s Black and a woman, people are going to expect her to do more or care more. I definitely think that she still has a lot of pressure from above her and below her, and so I don’t know how much this is going to change in the next couple years,” Golding added. “But I am hopeful.”
AAA Co-President Kylan M. Tatum ’25 said he would like to see more collaboration across student organizations in pushing for a multicultural space.
He cited plans to leverage alumni networks and form a student-based coalition that can “move a little quicker than organizations that have to go through more formal bureaucratic processes.”
Tatum said the push for a multicultural center is connected to advocacy around affirmative action. Legal scholars say the Supreme Court’s conservative majority is likely to strike down race-conscious admissions this summer in the lawsuit brought against Harvard by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
“Given a potential ruling in favor of SFFA and the possibility of a decreased number of minority students on campus, I think both having a multicultural center and pushing for an ethnic studies department, among other solutions, could help to attract and retain more students of color at Harvard,” Tatum said.
“Especially following this June when the decision drops, a lot of our efforts will be focused towards trying to advocate for a multicultural center,” he added.

Last August, the Cambridge City Council appointed 15 residents to a charter review committee set to reassess the city’s form of government and recommended changes. The committee continues to grapple with its first major dilemma: Should the city be run by a mayor or a city manager?
For the last 80 years, the City of Cambridge has been run by an appointed city manager. But soon, the city may change its form of government entirely.
The current city charter — essentially the “constitution” of Cambridge — includes both a city manager and a council-elected mayor under the “Plan E” system. The Cambridge City Council currently appoints the city manager, currently Yi-An Huang ’05, to act as the chief executive of the city, responsible for implementing Council legislation and running all government departments except the school department, which is run by a separately elected School Committee.
The Council itself comprises nine at-large members, one of whom is elected mayor by the Council. Having been first elected in 2020, Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui is currently serving her second term in the role and third on the Council.
The Plan E charter itself was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in June 1938 and adopted by Cambridge two years later, after its then-mayor was caught accepting bribes. Now, Cambridge’s mayor chairs the City Council and the School Committee, but otherwise has very little power in the council-manager system.
But in most other cities in Massachusetts — save a few, such as Worcester and Lowell — local government is set up very differently.
Instead of an appointed city manager, an elected mayor acts as the city executive, with full control over city function, including finances and the police department. In most cities with strong mayors, like New York City, the mayor is directly elected by citizens.
Last August, the Council appointed 15 residents to the Cambridge Charter Review Committee, which was tasked with establishing a set of recommended changes to the charter over a 12-month period. That timeline has since been extended, and a final committee recommendation is expected at the end of 2023.
The review committee has not yet decided which version of a “strong mayor” system they will vote on, but discussion has centered around a directly elected mayor, according to Charter Review Committee member Jim G. Stockard Jr.
“But there has been some discussion of a directly elected mayor, but with only the same powers as the current mayor — chair of the council and the school committee and ceremonial chief of the city,” he wrote in an email.
The structure question is being evaluated before other proposed charter revisions, including the potential adoption of city councilors elected by district and mayoral term limits.
“The city manager-mayor [decision] is really a starting point, and lots of other decisions flow from that,” Stockard said in an interview.
Once a recommendation is made, it will then be reviewed by the Council, which will vote on the changes before a potential city-wide referendum.
“We are mostly an advisory group,” committee member Kevin Y. Chen said. “But the idea is that we are supposed to be representative of the city population at large, and hopefully our recommendations carry some weight given that we are engaging in such a long and hopefully thorough process to figure these things out.”
Before Huang became city manager in September 2022, there had been a series of city managers who were almost all “cut from the same cloth,” according to Cambridge City Councilor Paul F. Toner.
Robert W. Healy served as city manager from 1981 to 2013, followed by his deputy Richard C. Rossi. After Rossi came Louis A. DePasquale, who was the assistant city manager for fiscal affairs under both Rossi and Healy.
“They were different personality-wise, but they had the same general philosophy of municipal government, which was being fiscally responsible, providing solid public services to the residents, and being good to the employees essentially,” Toner said. “That was a 50-year tradition.”
Huang, however, had never served in Cambridge’s city government. He instead came from a nonprofit background, having previously served as executive director of Boston Medical Center hospital clinical operations.
“I know that Cambridge has essentially promoted from within, but most city managers get hired from other cities — they move up the chain in terms of size. It’s a profession,” said Stephen Goldsmith, a Harvard Kennedy School professor of the practice of urban policy.
With Huang largely viewed as an outsider, his term is seen by many as a test of the council-manager system.
“His selection and his seemingly good work as he begins is a kind of endorsement of the system,” Stockard said. “In other words, it’s not just one more guy from the family.”
In November 2021, during DePasquale’s term, citizens voted on and approved a set of ballot initiatives that would institute annual reviews of city managers’ performance and require the Council to launch a charter review every 10 years.
Cambridge City Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 said she led the ballot initiatives effort because she had “heard many many people express concerns and complaints about the structure of the government.”
“It’s way past time to do something like this,” she said.
Toner, who voted against the ballot initiatives, said he believes those who view the city manager as unaccountable to Cambridge residents are mistaken.
“The narrative out there among people who are watching the city is, well, it’s all because of the city manager,” Toner said. “We got to get rid of the city manager because he’s not elected, or he’s not an elected person. But the reality is, the City Council hires them.”
“In my opinion, we have all the authority in the world,” he said.
At the Charter Review Committee’s May 9 public meeting, committee members were split 9-5 in favor of the council-manager form of government. But many members have switched their votes throughout the process, and some remain undecided on the structure question.
“I came in pretty open,” said Chen, an environmental attorney. “I think I didn’t have a really in-depth understanding of how the city government works. I got the sense that, in general, the city operates pretty well.”
“I’m not saying there’s not room for improvement — there always is — but we’ve been able to really implement effective programs,” committee member Lisa Peterson said.
“I don’t think you have to change the form of government to have more accountability,” she added.
Toner, likewise, said he believes the Council is “supposed to stay out of the way.”
“We could certainly come to meetings and criticize a city manager and raise our concerns and let him or her know what we’re upset about,” Toner said. “But we’re not supposed to be interfering in the daily operation of the city government.”
Others, however, believe switching to an strong mayor system allows the government to be more accountable to citizens and centralizes decision making.
“The last time our committee took a vote, I voted for mayor structure,” Charter Review Committee member Jessica De Jesus Acevedo said. “I do think Cambridge is at some point leading into that direction, whether it’s this charter review or the next.”
“I just think centralizing a center of power makes the most sense, but I haven’t made a final decision,” she added.
Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said one of his primary concerns with the current form of government is that once the city manager is directed to enact a Council policy order, “at that point, the manager can ignore the request.”
“Our only real power when it comes to the city manager is to fire them,” Zondervan said, which he added is politically difficult when citizens are less informed about what’s happening.
On the other hand, Goldsmith, who previously served as mayor of Indianapolis, said he thinks the threat of firing is insufficient to keep city managers generally accountable.
“I don’t think termination as the way you enforce accountability is particularly helpful,” Goldsmith said.
In comments to the committee and at meetings, members of the public unaffiliated with the committee also showed a sharp divide in opinion.
Some, including Susan Fleischmann ’94, have written to the committee to express support for different systems.
“The skills required to be a successfully elected official have very little overlap with the ability to be a successful manager, in my opinion,” Fleischmann wrote in a March 24 public comment.
“A strong mayor might be challenged when weighing the needs of the City at-large with the particular interests of their most vocal constituents. Attention to those who reliably vote may take precedence over those who may not. Whether consciously or not, actions will be taken with the next election in mind,” she added.
Ilan Levy, a Cambridge resident who has unsuccessfully run for Council four times, said at a community engagement event May 16 that he also hopes for a change to the existing structure.
“I don’t want to be reckless and destroy what we have. I want to make sure that we do it right,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have to be imaginative and that we don’t have to do something different.”
Accountability has emerged as a central point of contention in the ongoing debate over whether Cambridge should adopt a manager-council or council-mayor form of government.
Currently, the city’s operation under a council-manager model grants significant control over daily operations and a nearly-billion-dollar budget preparation to Huang, the city manager.
Recent events have created a greater impetus for greater transparency and accountability in Cambridge. Most prominently, the killing of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal — a Cambridge resident and Bangladeshi-American student at UMass Boston — by Cambridge Police on Jan 4. sparked months of protest and intensified calls for widespread reform.
Though protesters have largely directed their ire at the Cambridge Police Department, the city government has also also faced scrutiny, with some demanding that the city name, fire, and prosecute the officers involved in Faisal’s killing, as well as release the full unredacted police report of the encounter.
In the wake of Faisal’s death, Huang and other Cambridge officials have made commitments to implement reforms ranging from increasing funding for non-police public safety alternatives to outfitting CPD officers with body cameras. CPD has also engaged the services of the Police Executive Research Forum, an independent think tank specializing in law enforcement matters, to conduct an external review of the department.
“I hope that we’re doing a good job of putting together a real agenda for police reform that will continue on a lot of what the police have already done within the city of Cambridge, but there is more work that needs to happen,” Huang said in an interview.
“I think it really did shine a light on areas where we need to make continued changes,” Huang added, pointing to the more than a dozen protests that followed the fatal shooting.
During a Feb. 27 rally and teach-in at Cambridge City Hall, Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer Suhail P. Purkar referred to Cambridge’s government as “an undemocratic mess.” Purkar alleged that the city’s current charter deprives Cambridge residents of the accountability they deserve in their local government.
Another PSL organizer, Rafeya V. Raquib, told protesters that the city has “been ignoring the community’s calls for transparency and justice.”
“We’ve seen that the city manager has the freedom to pick and choose what policies get enforced with no accountability,” Raquib said.
Huang said he maintains a steadfast belief in his own accountability despite his position as an unelected city manager, a feature of the Plan E charter that some have called undemocratic.
“I am more accountable in these kinds of circumstances. If you look at my contract, ultimately, a majority of city councilors could terminate my contract at any time,” he told The Crimson in an interview after a March 21 meeting between activists and city officials.
Huang said he feels a sense of accountability from both residents and the Council in an interview earlier this month.
“If you talk to me or if you talk to city leaders, we really do feel accountable and like we are in close relationship with the councilors,” Huang said. “We are constantly trying to both help them understand the implications of what they’re asking us to do and help them prioritize.”
Huang said he’s proud of what he’s accomplished in his first eight months in office and believes he has responded to the city council’s requests appropriately.
“If the Council is not willing to hold the city manager accountable, there is a lack of accountability,” Huang said. “That’s sort of true of every boss or manager relationship.”
Despite the council-manager form of government’s relative rarity in Massachusetts, where only 15 out of the state’s 351 municipalities employ it, the model is widespread on a national scale.
Approximately 40 percent of municipalities across the country have embraced the council-manager model, some of the largest including Dallas, Texas, San José, California, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Cambridge’s neighboring cities of Somerville and Boston, however, have opted for a mayor-council form of government.
Joseph A. Curtatone, Somerville’s longest-serving mayor from 2004 until 2012, said he believes that when choosing a form of government, Cambridge should carefully consider the system that strikes the right balance between transparency, accountability, effectiveness, and efficiency.
The goal, according to Curtatone, should be to deliver results that align with the community’s values and aspirations, though he declined to weigh in on the best structure for Cambridge’s government.
When it comes to his own city of Somerville, however, Curtatone is a “strong advocate” for the mayor-council form of government.
“There is no way — and I’m confident — Somerville would have ever accomplished what it has accomplished during our time there in a city manager form of government,” Curtatone said.
“We built what was — I submit — the best public administration in the country,” Curtatone added, pointing to Somerville’s implementation of data-driven decision-making, real-time budgeting, and customer service through programs like 311.
Goldsmith, who also supports a strong mayor system, said this model of government was “essential” to his accomplishments during his nearly decade-long tenure as mayor of Indianapolis.
According to Goldsmith, the system aided him in “repairing the neighborhoods that had been too long neglected” by helping him “operating more efficiently.”
“The efficiency of operation for me was directly connected to implementing my vision. It was invaluable for me,” he added.
Regardless of what the charter review recommends, however, Goldsmith emphasized the importance of having frequent charter revisions.
“There are cities like New York City that more regularly have charter revisions, and doing it on a more regular basis was helpful as well. Then you can make some small modifications as you go instead of trying to do everything at once, which allows you to focus the community on certain things,” Goldsmith said.
Some advocates for a strong mayor system argue that Cambridge would be more democratic and conducive to higher voter participation compared to the current city manager system.
Proponents of an empowered elected mayor say the role establishes a direct link between residents and the government, enhancing accountability and responsiveness and encouraging civic engagement. This, they contend, would make it easier for residents to participate in local politics.
“If there is a simple question on the ballot for the charter change and its strong-mayor city manager, 60 percent of those people are going to scratch their heads and say, ‘What in the world is a city manager?’” said former Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis at a May 16 Charter Review Committee meeting.
Cambridge City Councilor Burhan A. Azeem disagrees, however, calling the difference “negligible” — though he acknowledged “people would be drawn to the simplicity” of having fewer city officials.
“It’s not like Somerville, which has a strong-mayor system, has a really high turnout, and we don’t,” Azeem said.
Both cities saw roughly a third of registered voters turn out for their 2021 municipal elections.
The charter review process itself has also led some to question civic engagement in Cambridge — fewer than ten people attended the May 16 community meeting with committee members to discuss their thoughts on the process.
Goldsmith said resident participation is vital for a successful government in Cambridge.
“Democracy and effectiveness depend on trust. Trust depends on people believing their voice matters. And the narrower the participation, the less likely that trust is to resonate, and therefore, the more difficult it is to govern,” Goldsmith said.
“To some extent, though, these are pretty arcane questions for the average person, and they need to be made as visible and understandable as possible,” Goldsmith added. “Enlarging the number of people who care and participate will be important.”

For student-athletes who are graduating from Harvard College in 2023, the past four years have been marked with ups and downs — difficulties compounded by the loss of full sports seasons due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The chance to play on an NCAA Division I team offers students the highest possible college-level competition, representing the culmination of years of hard work and commitment. But, whether walking on or committing early, student-athletes at Harvard sign themselves up for a college experience markedly different from many of their peers.
Harvard prides itself on its rich athletic tradition, boasting 42 Division I teams and with more than 10 percent of incoming students recruited to play a varsity sport.
According to an analysis of year-by-year rosters by The Crimson, approximately one in four students who played on a varsity sports team in the 2019-20 season left their team before the 2022-23 season. This statistic includes both recruited athletes and “walk-ons,” students who join teams after arriving at the College.
Interviews with nearly a dozen former Harvard athletes suggested that time commitments, battles with injuries, and balancing a beloved sport and the desire for a more well-rounded Harvard experience contributed to decisions to step away.
Athletes also said Covid-19 added hurdles to the athletic experience and contributed to burnout, as many members of the Class of 2023 lost one to two full seasons as Harvard athletes during the pandemic.
Of the 295 freshman student-athletes from 2019-20 rosters, 220 remained on their teams in the 2022-23 academic year, putting the overall retention rate at roughly 75 percent. Still, there was significant variation by team.
The Crimson’s survey of the graduating Class of 2023 found that roughly 31 percent of the class did not remain on their team all four years, an increase from 20 percent in 2022.
Harvard lists rosters for 40 sports teams on its official athletics website. Of these teams, 13 experienced perfect retention of the 2019-20 freshmen class, while six had retention percentages at or below 50 percent.
These six included women’s ice hockey, men’s golf, women’s heavyweight rowing, women’s rugby, men’s lightweight rowing, and women’s lacrosse. Women’s teams experienced lower retention — at 71 percent — than men’s teams, which saw 78 percent retention.
Women’s ice hockey had the lowest retention rate of all 40 teams, with just 20 percent of the original freshman class remaining for the 2022-23 season. Earlier this year, dozens of current and former players leveled allegations of emotional abuse spanning years by longtime head coach Katey Stone in investigations published by the Boston Globe and the Athletic.
In March, Harvard Athletics announced an external review of the team by a New York-based law firm. The review was expected to conclude by the end of this academic year.
While Harvard did not comment directly on the full data or team retention rates, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University encourages student-athletes to take advantage of the “myriad academic, social, and athletic experiences” available to undergraduates.
“We are thrilled when a student-athlete, whether recruited or not, chooses to participate in competition during the full course of their time at Harvard, but we also support student-athletes choosing to pursue different paths once they arrive on campus.”
Analysis by The Crimson for the graduating Class of 2020 similarly found that roughly a quarter of athletes in the class quit their sport by the time they graduated.
The student-athlete experience was dramatically shaped by Covid-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021: as case counts rose and fell, the Ivy League canceled four consecutive seasons.
Lindsey S. Lawson ’24, who played on the women’s basketball team for three seasons, said her athletic experience suffered from “a ton of restrictions” that were in place her freshman year. She noted difficulties caused by practicing with just one or two teammates in a limited training group throughout the fall 2020 semester.
Even after the return to campus, Lawson said, the consequences of these changes lingered.
“I was kind of burnt out at that point from the previous year of training alone and not having a season and not playing in games, really,” she said. “That was something that was weighing on me.”
Nina A. McCormack ’24, who quit the women’s lacrosse team in her sophomore spring, said she longed for the camaraderie that comes with being part of a team while experiencing difficulties in building connections remotely during her freshman season.
“All around, everyone was pretty heartbroken and people are dealing with that in their own ways,” she said. “So building community remotely with the sophomores, juniors, seniors that you’ve never met in person, as incoming freshmen, is pretty difficult.”
Arsh Dhillon ’23, who quit the women’s lightweight crew team, said coming back from Covid-19 offered an opportunity to reimagine her Harvard experience outside of athletics.
“It’s so crazy how the Covid year and then coming back not as a rower — it felt like an entirely new fresh start on who I am,” Dhillon said.
For some students, other opportunities at Harvard — and beyond — made playing a varsity sport too large of a tradeoff.
Per Harvard’s Student-Athlete Handbook, varsity athletes can expect to spend four hours a day and 20 hours a week on their sport while in season, and up to six hours per week in the offseason.
But travel to competitions, as well as social pressures to spend additional time with the team, can lead to athletics being a larger-than-expected commitment, many athletes said. Respondents to The Crimson’s senior survey reported devoting an average of 29 hours to athletics each week.
Cayla A. McFarlane ’24, who left the women’s soccer team before her junior season, cited the wealth of other opportunities at Harvard as a key reason for her departure.
“We’re gone all the time on the weekends and we practice every day, and that was very — both mentally, physically, and emotionally — taxing, but I don’t necessarily think that was specific to Harvard,” she said.
“I did feel like I was missing out on other things happening on campus,” she added.
Justin G. Han ’24, who quit the men’s lightweight crew team, said the time the sport required was “the most important factor” in his decision to quit.
“Eventually I decided that I myself wasn’t getting a lot out of remaining on crew, and that my time could be spent on more important things, like for my career, or classes, things like that,” he said.
Carolyn A. Wang ’23, who walked on to the women’s sailing team freshman year, said sailing did not feel like a sport she could do “half-heartedly.”
“There’s a bit of a stigma to not participating to the fullest extent, especially at the higher levels of the sailing team,” she said.
After quitting, Wang said she was able to take a painting class that met when she previously had sailing practice.
"It’s not something that I would have been able to do if I was still on the team,” she said.
Lawson said the diverse array of opportunities at Harvard — both in and out of the classroom — “empowered” her decision.
“I think if I were at any other school, I would have felt obligated to continue on even if it was very, very detrimental to my health,” she said.
McCormack said her departure from the women’s lacrosse team was influenced by a feeling that she “wasn’t being invested in” and had limited time on campus.
“I wanted to be putting my time and energy into something that was giving back to me and really something I was excited about,” she added.
Several students cited persistent or severe injuries as a key reason for departing from their teams.
Max Keck ’24, who has played water polo since he was 10, left Harvard’s team due to concerns around sustaining further serious injuries.
“I felt that if I was going to be running a risk anyway, I’d rather just have a more holistic student experience as someone that wasn’t on the water polo team, or as an athlete, since I hadn’t experienced that yet,” he said. “I really hadn’t experienced that ever in my life.”
Lawson said struggles with concussions, beginning in her sophomore year and continuing through January, gave her time to reflect on college athletics.
“I had kind of exhausted all my options with concussions specialists from MGH, all the support resources at Harvard — like mental health support, just like self-help, that type of thing,” Lawson said. “Still working out and still attending all the games and practices and not really taking the time that I needed to probably recover initially.”
“I wasn’t really getting better,” she said.
Melissa Meng ’24 left the women’s golf team halfway through her sophomore year in part due to chronic injuries.
“I realized that while I love the team, and I love golf, I also want to explore some of these other interests and given all the injuries and everything, I found that it might have been a better use of my time to go into these other passions that I had,” Meng said.
A handful of Harvard students leave their teams each year to play professional sports. NCAA regulations dictate that once a student chooses to compete at the professional level, they are no longer eligible to participate in college athletics.
A defenseman for the men’s ice hockey team for two seasons, Jack C. Rathbone ’22-’23 was drafted to the Vancouver Canucks, an NHL team, in July 2020.
“You know, you dream of playing college hockey and the next dream is to try and play professional hockey. That was kind of an opportunity I couldn’t pass up,” he said.
But for most other Harvard student-athletes, college athletics represents the end of their playing career, leading them to weigh their options differently.
McFarlane played soccer at the international level for Trinidad and Tobago, but she said limitations in infrastructure and compensation made playing professionally feel “less viable.” She struggled to find other career paths at Harvard while balancing the time required to play a varsity sport.
“My biggest fear was just leaving Harvard not knowing what I wanted to do and ending up in a job that pays well, because, you’re likely to get a good job coming out of Harvard, but wasn’t my passion,” McFarlane said.
Dhillon said the lack of women’s crew opportunities was a motivating factor for leaving the team.
“You’re thinking about the rest of your life, versus two years of your life and no one rows outside of college on the women’s side of things,” she said.
Still, many former student-athletes said they missed competing in their sports and being on a team after departing their athletic programs.
“Being able to compete and getting ready and getting up for games is something that I definitely miss. It was a huge part of my life,” Keck said. “It was a huge part of the reason I wanted to go to Harvard.”
Han, who joined crew through the novice program, said he misses the group environment.
“There’s just a group of people that you see every day who you spend a lot of time with, you all work together towards a common goal, that sense of camaraderie,” he said. “I definitely miss that a lot.”
Despite no longer being a member of the golf team, Meng said her relationship with sports has changed only marginally.
“My love for athletics will never go away. I think it’s just — I have a slightly different approach to it now,” she said.
McCormack said she struggled with the idea that her departure would reduce diversity within Harvard Athletics.
“Representation matters, and I’m a person of color, and I’m also part of the LGBT community, and those types of people are very underrepresented in lacrosse, and in a lot of other sports too,” she said. “So that is one thing I’m pretty sad about is that Harvard Athletics loses that type of diversity and that experience in their community.”
Despite the myriad of factors involved in the decision, Dhillon said she has no regrets.
“I think I miss sometimes playing a sport, but I don’t miss rowing. And I know that it’s probably the one decision during my college life that I’ve never looked back on,” she said.
The data includes the 295 current and former student-athletes who entered Harvard as part of the Class of 2020 whose names appeared on an Athletics Department roster published in the 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, or 2022-23 academic years. The data included all athletes, both recruits and walk-ons.
To gather data for this article, The Crimson cross-referenced the four years of rosters, which are available on the Athletics Department website.

Across the country, the issue of academic freedom is dominating discourse in higher education.
The conversation is especially prominent at Harvard: In recent years on campus, affiliates have launched numerous groups and initiatives to identify and address issues around free idea exchange. Most recently, 70 faculty from across the University founded the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard — at the time of writing, membership is more than 120.
The overwhelming faculty response mirrors that of Harvard Alumni for Free Speech, an alumni-founded group that formed last year, complete with a website, advisory board, and 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.
The issue has attracted the attention of top administrators, too. Over the past two years, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has periodically met with an “Intellectual Vitality Committee” — a small group of Harvard undergraduates, faculty, and alumni — to examine what they see as a lack of free idea exchange at the College. Earlier this year, the Committee even presented to the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body.
Peer schools are grappling with the same issues. Earlier this year, Stanford University’s president and law school dean apologized to a conservative federal judge after he was shouted down by protesters.
At Cornell University, the president and provost rejected a proposal from the student government asking professors to put “trigger warnings” for certain course content, citing Cornell’s free speech policy and the “faculty’s fundamental right to determine what and how to teach.”
“The issue of academic freedom is a broad issue of education, especially higher education. It has been written about and understood for a long time,” said Jeffrey S. Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School and a co-president of CAFH.
According to a recent faculty survey conducted by The Crimson, approximately 75 percent of surveyed members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences believe that academic freedom in America is under threat, compared to approximately 11 percent who believe it is not.
In the face of what many characterize as an academic freedom issue at Harvard, professors and students have created their own spaces for exchanging potentially controversial ideas. Nonetheless, they disagree on the stakes.
In an April 12 op-ed in the Boston Globe, Harvard professors Steven A. Pinker and Bertha K. Madras announced the formation of the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard.
“When an individual is threatened or slandered for a scholarly opinion, which can be emotionally devastating, we will lend our personal and professional support,” they wrote.
A major threat facing academic freedom, according to some professors, is a rise of self-censorship on campus.
“There’s been an abridgement of freedom of speech, not because of consciously censorious rulemaking or anything like that, but the climate around use of language is, in practice, socially, quite judgmental,” said Harry R. Lewis ’68, another CAFH co-president and former Harvard College dean.
“​​I think a lot of Harvard faculty and especially the Harvard students are afraid to speak their mind,” said Flynn J. Cratty, a History lecturer and CAFH’s executive director. “I think that that is actually corrosive to the academic endeavor. I think it makes it very difficult for us to take academic risks, to learn from others.”
Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53, a recently-retired professor in the Government Department, said certain topics, like those on race and gender, have become too controversial “for even academic investigation.”
“It’s a limitation on frankness of conversation and argument that I think we see quite a bit out here,” Mansfield said.
Many faculty members said they believe academic freedom is not threatened by one political group over the other — the issue is beyond partisan politics.
“It’s not purely a left-right thing,” Cratty said. “It’s more like granular disciplinary debates that don’t obviously map on to national political questions, but are more about how ideas, what ideas went out in specific academic subfields.”
Still, not all faculty agree that the University has restricted their ability to express ideas.
Isaac F. Silvera, a Physics professor, said he has “not seen any problems at Harvard that have interfered with” his academic freedom.
“Academic freedom is the freedom to pursue your research interests, the interests in the sciences, and to be able to get results, publish them openly, and discuss your ideas openly, without interference from the administration of the university,” Silvera said, adding that he has not experienced restrictions to academic freedom.
Sean R. Eddy, chair of the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, said that he disagrees with drawing distinct “sides” in issues at the intersection of science and social affairs.
“I’ve never had any trouble having a scientific conversation with anybody I actually know personally, including some of the people on the two sides of this. But when it gets into public, somehow it polarizes. And both sides will say things that neither of which I’ll agree with as a scientist, or as a human being,” Eddy said.
Nonetheless, Eddy said social and political issues — that often dominate conversations about academic freedom — are not his area of expertise, and many are not “directly relevant” to his work in science.
Faculty members also argued that discomfort with certain ideas is central to academic freedom.
“You have to be able to express controversial ideas, as long as you’re doing it in good faith,” Eddy said. “And then people should engage you — in good faith — in intellectual discussion on whether those are good ideas or bad ideas.”
“The context of a university should be one in which there is robust, respectful disagreement over ideas, and that the first reaction — or early reaction — to hearing ideas that you might disagree with on first hearing them is not to demand that they be shut down or punished or called to task in some way,” said Flier, the former HMS dean. “That is the opposite of what a university should be.”
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment for this article.
While professors have created the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard, some students at the College have carved out spaces specifically dedicated to promoting free idea exchange.
The 1980s saw the creation of the Harvard Salient, a campus publication aimed at elevating contrarian viewpoints, often through anonymously published editorials.
“Pseudonyms are used in order to encourage freedom of expression and attract contributors who would otherwise be too shy of public exposure,” wrote then-Salient spokesperson Jacob A. Cremers ’23-’24 upon the paper’s revival in late 2021.
This public scrutiny often comes from peers, according to students.
“I think, depending on your political leanings, there can be a strong social pressure to not speak or not say your true beliefs,” Michael A.C. Hla ’23-24 said. “But in practice it’s depending on the people you surround yourself with.”
Tamar Sarig ’23 agreed that social circles played a significant role in policing opinions, but she said she personally had not witnessed censorship.
“I have friends with a wide range of viewpoints. Some are questionable, and they feel fine voicing those questionable opinions, and none of them have been canceled yet,” said Sarig, a Crimson Magazine editor.
“I’ve heard a wide range of ideological diversity at the school that I don’t think reflects the fearmongering that you hear about censorship,” she added.
According to a 2022 survey conducted by College Pulse and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, 70 percent of surveyed Harvard students reported feeling either “comfortable” or “extremely comfortable” expressing their views on a controversial topic in a classroom setting, 9 percent higher than the national average.
When asked about sharing such views in campus social spaces, that number fell to 45 percent.
In the digital age, these social spaces can take the form of social media and online campus forums.
Last year, over an unmoderated house email list, students criticized then-Harvard Undergraduate Association Co-President LyLena D. Estabine ’24 for defending Harvard College Faith and Action — a Christian campus group that was previously sanctioned for pushing out a leader who was in a same-sex relationship. One student publicly called for Estabine to be recalled from the co-presidency.
Jaya J. Nayar ’24, also a member of the Intellectual Vitality Committee, pointed to incidents like this as examples of unproductive student disagreement.
“We are really trying to reencourage disagreement and look for healthier forms of disagreement, rather than having things that are spats on the email chains or in GroupMes that really devolve into nothing but hurt feelings and bitter sentiments,” she said last month.
During a classroom discussion, Shira Z. Hoffer ’25 said her professor dismissed her honest question.
The conversation centered on ways to dismantle the university system, which the professor said was discriminatory. Hoffer, a member of the Intellectual Vitality Committee, asked to take a step back, wondering why the system was discriminatory and needed dismantling in the first place.
“I was told, ‘We don’t ask that question because this classroom is a safe space,’” she said. “I think when questions are shut down in class, that’s a big red flag to me, because the whole purpose of class is to ask questions and learn things.”
Still, Hoffer didn’t think her professor was acting out of malice and acknowledged that encouraging tolerance of viewpoints on campus can be difficult when ideas are perceived as “fundamentally morally reprehensible.”
“I think that’s when things become extremely challenging, and the problem is that people draw those lines in different places,” Hoffer said.
Often, these lines are debated when discussing race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and sexuality.
In 2020, then-Government preceptor David D. Kane sparked extensive campus backlash when he invited to his class Charles A. Murray ’65, a social scientist who has hypothesized a relationship between race and intelligence, and whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center has termed “racist pseudoscience.”
Harvard did not renew Kane’s contract after racist posts he made on a Williams College alumni blog came to light.
In 2021, Human Evolutionary Biology lecturer Carole K. Hooven received student and faculty pushback following comments she made on Fox News arguing that there are only two sexes and decrying the pressure on medical professors to use gender-neutral vocabulary. Cratty said faculty were thinking about the situation as the CAFH was being founded.
For Hoffer and other proponents of expanding free dialogue on campus, few topics should be off limits.
“As a Jew, I would happily sit down with a neo-Nazi for dinner,” Hoffer said. “If I knew what they had to say, one, I would just have a more robust understanding of humanity, which I think is fundamentally a beautiful thing. And two, if I were being crafty about it, I would now understand their arguments and be able to argue against them better.”
But for other students, platforming such views feels unnecessary, or even dangerous.
“I feel like all students at Harvard understand that white supremacy exists in America,” Rosie P. Couture ’26 said. “I do not think that we need to be welcoming people to our campus to voice those perspectives.”
Shraddha Joshi ’24, an organizer with the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, said she found that platforming certain opposing viewpoints had the potential to produce a “false symmetry between oppressors and oppressed.”
Approximately 57 percent of surveyed faculty said that Harvard should give platforms to controversial speakers, even when a significant number of students or faculty object to their views. Roughly 20 percent disagreed.
Though they think voices from opposing viewpoints can be valuable, Oliver J. Slayton ’26 said Harvard should be cautious in providing a platform to speakers who challenge the rights of certain students.
“The weight and the merit that the name of Harvard carries and saying that you were a guest speaker at Harvard means something,” Slayton said. “If someone gets that seal of approval and gets to boast about it and use it to broaden their audience and increase their voice, whose voices are we increasing?”
“I think where I personally draw the line is where someone’s rhetoric or ideas directly conflict with someone’s right to exist, right to express themselves in safe ways,” they added.
Alex Morey, FIRE’s director of campus rights advocacy, cautioned against conflating issues of academic freedom with those of discrimination and harassment, which she said Harvard already has robust policies against.
“We are big proponents that two things can be equally true,” Morey said. “Existing Harvard policies already do a good job of saying, ‘We don’t tolerate discriminatory harassment on campus,’ ‘We don’t tolerate threats or violence,’ and ‘We also allow students and faculty to talk about, teach about, research about a wide variety of topics, even ones that are offensive.’”
Similarly, Lewis said he believes the University is responsible for protecting its affiliates’ physical safety, but should not protect them from unpleasant speech.
“People should feel safe. But again, no one should feel safe from troubling words and troubling thoughts, troubling ideas,” Lewis said. “Higher education sometimes involves troubling feelings.”

In 2004, Harvard employed just under 5,300 full-time administrators. Nearly two decades later, this figure has seen a whopping 43 percent increase.
In contrast, the University’s faculty, starting at 2,000 members, has only increased by 11 percent in that same time period.
But the explosive growth of administrative ranks has affected more than just raw numbers.
Former Harvard College Dean and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said the expansion of University administration has also resulted in “drawing authority upward” and away from faculty.
The result, according to Lewis, is a system that hurts both faculty and students.
“I don’t think it’s great for the students. I also don’t think it’s good for the faculty, either,” he said. “The whole spirit of the place is changed because of it.”
Harvey A. Silverglate, who has staged multiple outsider campaigns in an attempt to win a seat on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, also called into question the necessity of adding more administrators to Harvard’s ranks.
“If you examine the daily life of these administrators, I bet they don’t spend more than a half hour a day doing something useful,” Silverglate said.
According to Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton, administrative positions added over the past decade support new degree programs and academic centers, as well as provide a wide range of job functions, such as human resources, finances, research, health and mental health care, and information technology.
In addition to diminishing faculty authority, the increase in administration decentralizes the University, drives a wedge between students and instructors, and provides surface-level solutions to difficult issues, some former and current Harvard faculty and administrators said. Others, however, believe the growth is justified for the increasingly complex challenges faced by Harvard.
When Neil L. Rudenstine assumed the Harvard presidency in 1991, he was the only academic officer in Massachusetts Hall.
Feeling the need for more academic support within the administration, Rudenstine proposed the idea of creating an office of the provost.
“I had told the Corporation and deans that I wanted a provost because I thought we needed at least two people in Mass. Hall who could think about academic collaboration and integration,” Rudenstine said.
Since its creation under Rudenstine, the provost’s office has enjoyed a massive expansion. Established in 1992, the office began with three members. Now, in 2023, it boasts 21 provost positions — a seven-fold increase.
“We had three people during my 10 years — the provost, myself, and an associate provost,” Rudenstine said. “That was it.”
Now, Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 has under his purview nearly two dozen associate and vice provosts responsible for managing students, research, and projects across the University.
Though he felt the imperative to create an office dedicated to academic administration at the University, Rudenstine acknowledged the issues with expanding administrative ranks within Harvard, which is “probably the most decentralized administration I know.”
“It’s a problem,” he said. “Scale is a problem. Size is a problem.”
“The more individual programs or institutes or schools that you create, the more there’s a tendency for the institution to go in different directions and speak at the same time, and the harder it is to bring the parts together,” he added.
Compared to its peer institutions, Harvard employs a comparatively higher number of provosts. Though Yale lists 19 administrators who hold a “provost” title and Columbia 24 — figures similar to Harvard’s 21 — Dartmouth and Princeton have only nine and 11, respectively.
Still, all institutions feature a host of other administrators within the offices who, though lacking the provost title, assist with academic administrative duties.
Lewis also criticized the expansion of the provost’s office. In particular, he honed in on positions related to coordinating student affairs across the University.
“Look up what the provost’s office looked like 20 years ago and compare it to what the provost’s office looks like today,” Lewis said. “I mean, there’s even an assistant provost for students now.”
The Associate Provost for Student Affairs, Robin Glover, is responsible for “promoting and facilitating coordination and information sharing among our Schools that will lead to better support for our diverse student body,” according to the office’s website.
However, Lewis said that “the provost has no students” and “only the faculties, only the schools have students.” Instead of focusing on any particular school, the associate provost for student affairs is tasked with managing student affairs broadly across the University.
“In what world does it make sense to compare the experience of medical students and Harvard College freshmen?” Lewis added.
Lewis said he believes the provost’s office reflects the “vertical fragmentation” within the University’s administration.
“They end up stepping on each other’s feet,” he said. “This is part of an attempt to decentralize and coordinate in ways where it doesn’t actually make sense.”
Administrators currently outnumber faculty more than three to one.
Richard F. Thomas, a Harvard Classics professor, said the “bloated administration has little effect on the effective teaching and research of the institution.”
“The job that matters to faculty — that is, their research and their teaching — seems to me not to require the sort of administrative expansion — colossal administrative expansion — that we’ve seen in higher education,” he said.
This growth, Thomas said, necessitates a tradeoff in resources between administrators and faculty.
“If the administration is growing at a greater pace than the faculty, then de facto what could have been a faculty allocation has become an administrative allocation,” Thomas said.
According to Lewis, administrative growth means “power has become centralized” away from the faculty and deans who work more closely with students — and toward the president and provost.
While professors used to play a more active role in supporting students outside their classes, Lewis said the rise in administrative departments responsible for helping students find their interests, resolve conflicts, and address social issues “puts a wall up between faculty and students.”
“It’s sad when they then become somewhat preachy about how things should be done, and the faculty kind of withdraw,” he said.
Lewis added that the addition of new administrators serves more as a way for Harvard to signal its priorities to the world.
“When you identify a particular individual, as the kind of ‘owner’ of this issue, you get the feeling that it’s sometimes done as, ‘This is the way to prove that Harvard takes this issue seriously — to have a dean on it,’” he said.
But Leslie P. Tolbert ’73, outgoing vice chair of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and former senior vice president for research at the University of Arizona, said administrators aid faculty in their research and instructional work.
In a May 2 update, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Office for Faculty Affairs announced it would audit “administration requests of faculty” to “determine where work can be eliminated, done more efficiently, or performed by administrative staff.”
Tolbert, a neuroscience professor emerita at Arizona, said as a faculty member, “you often wish there were some more people” in administration “who could just help you to get the grant or to find out where the research opportunities are.”
“It’s not a ‘Oh no, here we go, there are going to be more administrators telling me what to do,’” Tolbert said. “I think what Harvard is doing when they add administrative positions is helping faculty and students to do what they want to do.”
Despite widespread complaints of administrative bloat, Penny S. Pritzker ’81 — senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — insisted that Harvard doesn’t “have a huge central administration.”
“The University has benefited from the areas where the schools are working together,” Pritzker said.
“I think we have the best of all worlds, which is we have a strong center, but we also have these very independent schools,” she added. “Getting that balance right is art, not science.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow pointed to the expansion of research initiatives as a driving force behind administrative growth.
“When we stand up new academic initiatives, they need support,” he said.
Research and other academic positions at the University — including research scientists, visiting scholars, postdoctoral students, and coaches — did see a spike in count from 2010 to 2012, increasing nearly 200 percent.
Bacow added that there are more undergraduates on campus now than before the Covid-19 pandemic, which means the College needs more advisers and residential administrative staff.
He also credited the expansion of administrative ranks to be a result of the University’s attempts to provide other services for students, including mental health resources and career services.
“We’ve tried to be responsive,” he said. “That’s adding administrators — all those people count as administrators.”
For example, in 2013, the University established its Title IX offices to address complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct.
The University has also been forced to respond to a number of new technological demands and government mandates on reporting, Bacow said, which serve as major contributing factors toward administrative growth.
“As we become a more computationally intensive institution, we need more people there,” Bacow said. “Just responding to government mandates, to report on all sorts of things which we did not have to report on previously, that requires people.”
“We don’t keep people around if there’s no work for them,” he added.
Tolbert said her job as a member of the Board of Overseers is to look across departments and programs within the University to determine the areas where the school needs further development or expansion.
“I don’t see it as a problem,” she said. “I see it as a wise use of resources.”
Philip W. Lovejoy, former executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association and director of University-wide alumni affairs, said during his time at Harvard, “central administration got more and more efficient.”
“It’s a huge enterprise and it needs a lot of people to make it run,” he said. “I actually think that Harvard does not have a bloated administration.”
Broadly, Thomas said the expansion of Harvard’s administration reflects a “natural impulse in American higher education.”
“I think it’s been an inexorable process, which has taken on its own momentum,” he said.
Thomas D. Parker ’64, an expert on higher education, said administrative growth is “not a new issue” and that it can be difficult for university leadership to successfully remove administrative positions without inadvertently cutting important roles.
As Gay, the outgoing dean of the FAS, prepares to ascend to her presidential position in Mass. Hall, she faces a litany of demands that will require her to reassess the administration of the University.
“I think that every incoming president ought to take a little inventory and see what can be done. Problem is, everybody’s got an ax,” Parker said. “Everybody thinks they know which administrator should be eliminated.”
“The trouble is, usually the people who try to do something dramatic about it just screw up,” he added. “They go too far.”
Parker also pointed to the broader changes across higher education, in which universities have become more than “a purely instructional place.”
“The modern university is a city, and it’s got all the needs and problems of cities,” he said. “It’s a huge group of people who have very specialized and expensive needs.”
“It’s not just a Harvard issue — this is true in every major university,” he said. “It’s part of the landscape.”

One day after the Trump administration blindsided thousands of international students by barring them from remaining in the country during the Covid-19 pandemic, MIT President L. Rafael Reif was eating breakfast and drafting an op-ed to express his outrage.
Reif was interrupted by a call from Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow. Though he was also furious about the barring, he suggested a different strategy: suing the government.
“I was thinking, ‘How do I express my anger?’” Reif recalled. “He was thinking, ‘How do I stop this?’”
Reif said the decision that morning in July 2020 to join Harvard in the lawsuit was a “no-brainer.”
The plan, he said, also reflected Bacow’s approach to leadership — a willingness to act decisively based on his convictions.
“He was ahead of me. He was already taking an action,” Reif said. “He knows very clearly what’s right and wrong — and this he felt was very wrong.”
Bacow’s was a historically brief presidency, tied for the shortest at Harvard since the Civil War. Yet during the five years he held office, he encountered a unique convergence of challenges — one that reflected a higher education landscape under attack. Woven through all this was the pandemic, a crisis during which Bacow — a seasoned higher education leader — was forced to make consequential decisions without a blueprint.
With his time in Massachusetts Hall coming to a close, colleagues reflected on a man whose presidency was defined by defending Harvard — and the rest of higher education — from political and public health threats.
Before Bacow became the University’s 29th president, he was charged with finding them.
Bacow joined the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — in 2011. One of the board’s responsibilities was finding the 29th president of Harvard after former President Drew G. Faust announced she would step down from the post in June 2018.
However, in December 2017, as the search neared its end, Bacow was asked whether he would step down from the committee to be considered for the post himself. He agreed.
Bacow had a pedigree that many would call unsurprising for the role — a recipient of three Harvard degrees, Bacow had served as president of Tufts University from 2001 to 2011. During his time there, he led Tufts’ largest capital campaign and expanded initiatives related to financial aid and diversity.
After the presidential search committee selected Bacow as Harvard’s 29th president, he sat down with members of the Corporation to discuss his tenure. It was a time — in the midst of Donald Trump’s presidency — where universities faced increased attacks from lawmakers and other political figures in Washington.
Bacow told the Corporation members — all of whom served on his search committee — to expect two things from his presidency: It would last five to seven years and he would use the role to defend higher education from political and existential attacks.
“I thought we were facing serious challenges,” Bacow recalled of his mindset going into his presidency in an interview earlier this month. “For the first time in my lifetime, people were asking questions about the value of higher education and I thought that it was imperative to respond.”
At his presidential inauguration in October 2018, with dozens of university presidents in attendance, Bacow reiterated the vow he made to the Corporation.
“We must defend the essential role of higher education in the life of our nation and the broader world,” Bacow said in his speech from Tercentenary Theatre.
Just 10 days later, Bacow faced the first major test of his pledge to defend higher education when Harvard went on trial in a case brought forth by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. The lawsuit argued that Harvard illegally discriminated against Asian American applicants in its use of race-conscious admissions practices.
A federal judge ruled nearly a year later in Harvard’s favor. Over the course of Bacow’s presidency, however, the case has been appealed up to the Supreme Court, which legal experts widely expect will overturn decades of precedent allowing colleges to consider race in admissions practices. A verdict in the case is expected to arrive at the tail end of Bacow’s presidency in June or in early July, days after he departs office.
With affirmative action on the brink, some of Bacow’s legacy still remains to be written. But higher education experts and several of Bacow’s current and former colleagues said in interviews that he will go down in history as a president who was not afraid to take a stand — from both Cambridge and Washington — not just for Harvard and its students but for higher education at large.
Bacow’s advocacy for international students and immigration reform helped put a stamp on his presidency, according to Thomas D. Parker ’64, an expert on higher education.
“For a long time, I saw him as a sort of Gerald Ford of Harvard presidents. A sort of bland, no drama Obama kind of guy,” Parker said. “But when you read his stuff about immigration and international students and the way he stood up for international students in some tough situations, I gotta give him some credit.”
Bacow, who traveled to Washington during his first month as president, said he met individually with more than 70 members of Congress over the past five years — a figure he said would have been even higher if not for the pandemic.
“I’ve spent a lot of time in Congress,” Bacow said. “I’d like to think that my efforts in D.C. have also changed how people think about a number of these issues.”
Former U.S. Representative Ronald J. Kind ’85, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said he would often organize a bipartisan lunch for fellow lawmakers to meet with Bacow when he visited Capitol Hill.
During these trips, Bacow frequently advocated for “a lot of social issues,” according to Kind.
“It was immigration reform — the need for that. It was trying to maintain a welcome mat for foreign students to come and learn and hopefully stay, so we’re not sending them back only to compete against us in the future,” Kind said. “He brought a bigger world picture with him, too, not just solely on the education front.”
On other occasions, Bacow was also willing to go to bat for individual students.
In the fall of 2019, then-freshman Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, a Palestinian student who lived in Lebanon, was denied entry and deported by United States border officials after arriving at Boston Logan International Airport.
When the news reached Harvard’s administrative offices, “it was quite a shock,” according to Vice Provost of International Affairs Mark C. Elliott.
“This was early in President Bacow’s tenure, and it was early in the days of the previous administration and when it became clear that people from certain parts of the world were not going to be so welcome anymore in the U.S.,” Elliott said.
Elliot said Bacow immediately began asking questions: “‘Who can we contact? How do we reverse this?’”
“That instigated a flurry of mails and phone calls and texts,” Elliott said. “Strings were pulled, calls were made, and this decision was reversed.”
Ten days later, Ajjawi successfully arrived on campus in time for the beginning of classes.
To Neil L. Rudenstine, Harvard’s 26th president, managing the Covid-19 pandemic was the most difficult moment of Bacow’s presidency.
“The possibility of a good education for students was challenged by the pandemic in a way that very, very few things we can imagine were challenged,” said Rudenstine, who taught a seminar during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“I think he rose to that challenge,” he said. “I don’t know anybody who did it better.”
In March 2020, as the Covid-19 outbreak continued to grow globally, all Harvard courses moved to remote instruction, and the University asked students not to return to campus after spring break.
Rudenstine noted the importance of viewing Bacow’s tenure in the context of the pandemic.
“There’s only so much you can do in five years, of course, so you have to take that into account. And if three years are consumed by the pandemic, that also makes it harder,” Rudenstine said. “Within the constraints, and within five years, I think it’s been a really unusually fine presidency.”
As Covid-19 cases began to rise in the U.S., Reif also debated whether to move MIT to online instruction, a decision he “knew was gonna be controversial.” But just hours before Reif announced his decision, news came from up the river: Harvard would be sending its students home.
“It was very comforting to me to see,” Reif said of Harvard’s decision. “I was clapping my hands and applauding him for doing that because he made my decision so much easier to announce.”
Peter L. Malkin ’55, a prominent Harvard donor, called Bacow’s tenure a “pretty outstanding performance.”
“He acted quickly, rallied the faculty and administration and provided as well for Harvard students as circumstances permitted,” Malkin wrote in an emailed statement.
While colleagues lauded his approach to the pandemic, some students raised concerns about more specific features of Harvard’s pandemic response. For instance, when the University announced in spring 2022 that students would no longer have to self-isolate, some criticized the policy for placing others living in proximity at risk.
Rudenstine, who headed Harvard’s first University-wide capital campaign in 1994 and raised more than $2 billion, also voiced confidence in Bacow’s ability to shepherd Harvard finances and said he “would have been” a successful fundraiser in a capital campaign given a longer presidential tenure.
“We didn’t get our campaign in the 90s going until my fourth year,” Rudenstine said of his own fundraising efforts. “So the real returns came in between years five and nine.”
“That’s an opportunity that I think President Bacow just, in a sense, did not have,” he added.
When Bacow’s fellow university presidents — including Reif — began announcing their intentions to step down, he decided to follow suit.
“I concluded that this was a good time because I thought we had a lot of talent within the University that is capable of leading an institution like this,” Bacow said. “If I stuck around for another year or two, some of those people might have gone elsewhere.”
Claudine Gay, outgoing dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and incoming 30th University president, is an example of such talent.
Poised to move from University Hall to Massachusetts Hall in just over one month, Gay will be faced with many of the same challenges that Bacow confronted half a decade ago, including the imperative to defend higher education.
Now at the end of his tenure, Bacow said “higher education is certainly in the crosshairs.”
“We’re being criticized from both the right and the left, and I don’t think much of the criticism — or most of the criticism — is at all fair,” he said.
In recent months, some prominent Republican lawmakers — including potential 2024 Republican nominee and HLS graduate Ron DeSantis — have taken sharp aim at disciplines such as gender and sexuality studies that they contend is part of the left’s “woke” agenda.
Other politicians have lobbied successfully for the imposition of an endowment tax that would chip away at Harvard’s status as a nonprofit organization immune from taxation due to its broad benefits to society.
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 affirmed that the ability to successfully defend higher education was “front of mind” for the Corporation in selecting the University’s next president.
“It’s extremely important that the leader of Harvard be able to speak on behalf of higher education,” she said. “They’re not the only voice, but we need a powerful and effective voice.”
Harvard Corporation member Kenneth I. Chenault also highlighted the importance of fostering a “high level of dialogue reflecting a wide range of perspectives.”
“What’s absolutely critical is the ability, in fact, to foster an environment for civil discourse, and that’s what Larry was able to do,” Chenault said. “I’m very confident that that’s what Claudine will be able to do.”
As Bacow prepares to hand off the reins of the University to Gay, many of his closest colleagues and confidants look back on his tenure favorably.
However, a broader survey of University faculty paints a more ambivalent picture. In The Crimson’s 2023 annual survey of the FAS, more than 37 percent of the 386 respondents indicated that they neither agreed nor disagreed that Bacow represented their interests well. Others somewhat and strongly disagreed with the statement — approximately 18 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
Harvard University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said he believes Bacow “consistently made the best decisions that people can make under the circumstances.”
“His legacy is that he enabled Harvard to advance in meeting important goals, despite the pandemic,” Garber said. “His legacy is really about Harvard’s future.”

In a video that racked up millions of views, a student rose from her seat in an overcrowded classroom to directly address John L. Comaroff, the Harvard professor accused of sexual misconduct.
“John Comaroff spent his career harassing, silencing, and retaliating against students,” the student said. “He does not belong at Harvard.”
On that January afternoon, she and more than 100 other students then stood up and walked out of the classroom and through Harvard Yard, chanting, “Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Comaroff has got to go!”
At the end of the march, organizers encouraged attendees to complete a form to send a pre-written email to Harvard’s top administrators demanding that the University fire the African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor. In the days following, more than 240 Harvard affiliates filled out the form.
Comaroff — who has repeatedly and consistently denied all allegations of harassment and retaliation made against him — is not the only tenured Harvard professor to face accusations of misconduct in recent years. In nearly every case, Harvard has also weathered fierce public scrutiny for what many saw as its unwavering protection of its faculty despite misconduct findings.
Every tenured Harvard professor embroiled in a recent controversy either chose to retire or remained a member of the faculty. The revocation of Comaroff’s tenure was never on the table, according to his attorney Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02.
A 2020 investigation published by The Crimson uncovered allegations of sexual harassment by Comaroff and two other Anthropology professors: Theodore C. Bestor and Gary Urton.
Bestor stepped down from his position as director of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies following the investigation and continued teaching until he died in 2021. Urton was placed on administrative leave in June 2020 and announced his retirement the next month. Following his retirement, Claudine Gay — Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean and president-elect — stripped Urton of his emeritus status and barred him from campus.
In 2018, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that 18 women accused Jorge I. Domínguez — then a Government professor — of incidents of sexual harassment and assault spanning nearly four decades. That same year, The Crimson reported that Economics professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. was the subject of two Title IX complaints and under investigation by both Harvard and the state of Massachusetts.
Though his case was of a different tenor, then-professor Charles M. Lieber made national headlines when he was arrested — and later convicted — of lying to federal authorities about his ties to China, a felony offense.
Domínguez retired shortly after the allegations against him were made public. Lieber, who had been placed on administrative leave, quietly retired in February in advance of his sentencing. And both Fryer and Comaroff — who were placed on unpaid leave — have since returned to teaching.
Fryer and two of Lieber’s attorneys reached by phone all declined to comment on whether tenure revocation was ever considered in their cases. Domínguez did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
If history is any indication, none of them were in any danger of being fired.
Technically, it is possible for a tenured professor to be fired.
According to the website of the Office of the Provost, the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — has the power to dismiss any officer in a teaching position, even a tenured professor, “only for grave misconduct or neglect of duty.”
Neither “grave misconduct” nor “neglect of duty” are defined in the publicly available policy, a 289-word excerpt from the University’s charter detailing the “appointment of officers and staff of the University.”
In practice, however, this power has rarely — if ever — been exercised.
The Crimson could not identify any instances where the Harvard Corporation forcibly stripped a tenured faculty member’s position since the 1940s, when the American Association of University Professors formalized rules around tenure.
In 1979, then-freshman Helene S. York ’83 accused Government professor Martin L. Kilson Jr. of attempting to kiss her, in what The Crimson later wrote was the first reported case of sexual harassment by a student against a tenured professor.
In the aftermath, Henry A. Rosovsky, then the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, reprimanded Kilson. Rosovsky told Kilson that a repeated offense could be grounds for placing the case in front of the Corporation, Kilson told The Crimson at the time.
But, there was no second public allegation against Kilson and no available record of Rosovsky ever recommending that the Corporation revoke Kilson’s tenure. Kilson remained a professor until his 1999 retirement and died in 2019. Rosovsky died late last year.
A few years after Kilson’s case, Harvard took disciplinary action against another tenured professor, Domínguez, prompted by harassment allegations first made by former assistant Government professor Terry L. Karl and then by a Government Ph.D. candidate. Domínguez was stripped of his post as chairman of a minor academic committee but remained on the faculty.
In Domínguez’s case, as in Kilson’s, Rosovsky again wrote a letter indicating his intent to recommend that the Corporation fire Domínguez if there was a repeated offense. But when an undergraduate filed a complaint against Domínguez for sexual harassment six years later, the new FAS dean — A. Michael Spence — did not ask the Corporation to strip Domínguez’s tenure.
The latter allegation — and over a dozen more — did not come to light until the Chronicle of Higher Education published an investigation into Domínguez in early 2018. During the intervening years, he had been promoted to head a major academic center and later to Vice Provost for International Affairs.
He was placed on administrative leave and then announced his retirement in March 2018, shortly after the Chronicle published their investigation. Following the conclusion of a Title IX investigation into Domínguez in May 2019, Gay stripped Domínguez of emeritus status.
Another instance of the administration disciplining a tenured faculty member came in 1985, when Government professor Douglas A. Hibbs Jr. was “forced” into resigning after being accused of sexual harassment by a student at MIT, according to The Crimson. While the Corporation did not revoke his tenure, Hibbs may have been the first tenured faculty member to leave the school as a result of misconduct.
Hibbs declined to comment, citing an agreement with the University not to do so. Spence did not respond to a request for comment.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton and FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
In a sense, tenure — an institution partially developed at Harvard — is working exactly as intended.
In his book “University Administration,” former Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, described one way of recruiting quality faculty: the school can “invite to full professorships men of proved capacity, industry, and intellectual productiveness.”
“To such men the university commits itself for life,” Eliot wrote.
According to Roger L. Geiger, a historian of higher education and professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University, Harvard “led the way” in the establishment of tenure guidelines.
“There was kind of an unwritten rule that tenure was granted after a certain period of time and could not be revoked,” Geiger said.
Eliot’s book makes no mention of grounds to dismiss tenured professors.
When the American Association of University Professors codified the modern system of tenure in 1940, it called for faculty members to have “permanent or continuous tenure” and to be “terminated only for adequate cause” or extenuating circumstances.
According to Geiger, the “chief argument” for lifetime tenure was safeguarding academic freedom, an argument that proved particularly salient during the McCarthy era, where professors came under fire for suspected communist sympathies.
But in practice, the system has meant that a professor’s tenure is essentially impenetrable.
According to former Harvard President Derek C. Bok, “the only thing close to that” that he remembers is a “couple of cases involving misconduct of a fairly serious nature” in which the professor in question resigned before the Corporation could ever consider a vote to revoke tenure.
“Cases didn’t come up where the Corporation needed to get involved, even if they wanted to, because the facts were fairly clear,” he said.”Professors resigned their tenure and left so there really wasn’t much for the Corporation to talk about.”
Student activists leading protests against Comaroff — the embattled anthropologist — understand that it is unlikely the University fires Comaroff, at least while there is an ongoing lawsuit against the school.
According to Rachael A. Dziaba ’26 — one of the organizers of the anti-rape culture student activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better — the group has switched from calling for the University to fire Comaroff to demanding that he resign.
“At the end of the day, as an organization, we just want Comaroff off campus and to stop teaching, and I think that at a certain point, we realized or at least felt that Comaroff taking the step to resign would be a more realistic scenario,” she said.
In response to a request for comment, Comaroff’s lawyers said in an email that activist efforts against Comaroff “ignore any semblance of fairness or due process.”
“The suggestion that Professor Comaroff resign or be terminated is preposterous and would be inconsistent with Harvard’s own very thorough investigation whose findings largely exonerated Professor Comaroff. It would be outrageous—and a violation of contract—for Harvard to terminate any tenured or tenure track faculty member in these circumstances,” they wrote.
Dziaba said that it was unrealistic the University would fire Comaroff, citing the history of tenure at Harvard.
“Unfortunately, in a lot of cases, I feel like with allegations like this or instances where professors have come under public scrutiny, often they only leave of their own volition and Harvard administration has been hesitant to take action against tenured faculty,” Dziaba said.
Austin Siebold ’23, another Our Harvard Can Do Better organizer, said terminating Comaroff is off the table due to potential legal ramifications for Harvard.
“We know that Harvard cannot fire Comaroff without signaling fault in the lawsuit against Harvard,” Siebold said. “Harvard’s hands are tied, and I think it really goes to show just how much control Comaroff and others like him have at this university because Harvard can’t fire Comaroff.”
“It seems like tenured faculty are invincible,” Siebold added.

Former Harvard University President Derek C. Bok vividly recalls the day that he, then dean of Harvard Law School, flew to California to recruit Derrick A. Bell Jr. to the Law School’s faculty in 1969 — more than five decades ago.
“We had gradually developed a fairly substantial number of Black students in the Law School, and we had nothing in the curriculum about the role of race in the law as it affected a number of fields of law,” Bok said.
“There was nobody really in a position on the faculty that could relate in ways that only a Black professor at that time could really understand and help with,” he added.
Bell became the Law School’s first tenured Black professor in 1971 and called for the school to diversify its faculty. In 1990, Bell took what he called a “leave of conscience” — a voluntary unpaid leave of absence — and said he would not return until the Law School hired its first Black female tenured professor.
The school, however, did not do so until 1998, leading Bell to ultimately forfeit his tenure in 1992, spending the rest of his career at New York University.
While at Harvard, Bell published the casebook “Race, Racism, and American Law,” which — as he wrote — was motivated by the question, “What does it mean to say that racism is a permanent feature of American society?” Much of his work aimed to address this issue, studying how racism had been incorporated into America’s legal framework.
Bell’s scholarly work and writings are widely credited as being foundational works of critical race theory, a field of legal scholarship that has become a lightning rod for conservative backlash in recent years. Multiple state legislatures have limited the teaching of critical race theory in public schools, and several more are considering laws that would do the same.
A number of Republican politicians — including Florida Governor and Law School alum Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence — have publicly condemned critical race theory, with DeSantis tweeting that it is “state-sanctioned racism.”
Legal scholars, however, say that the political attacks and laws against critical race theory are baseless and misrepresent what the term actually references.
“These statutes are — in some fundamental sense — ridiculous, that they’re aimed at a nonexistent target. A second version of that point is the people who are supporting these statutes have literally no idea what critical race theory is,” said Mark V. Tushnet ’67, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School. “It’s just a label they’ve attached to ideas that they don’t like, ideas about the importance of race in U.S. history for example. The word I use is fundamentally silly.”
Rather, to legal academics, critical race theory is a school of legal thought that seeks to examine how the concept of race is codified by the law and the consequences of these codifications, such as systemic racial inequality.
Bell and a number of Harvard Law School alumni — including University of California, Los Angeles and Columbia University law professor Kimberlé W. Crenshaw, who is credited with coining the term, and University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa Law School professor Mari J. Matsuda — are considered to have been instrumental figures in critical race theory’s development.
How has this legal field been shaped by Harvard Law School and how do its students and scholars view conservative attacks on the field?
Many of critical race theory’s pioneers passed through the Law School on their scholarly journeys.
While at the Law School, Crenshaw and Matsuda were engaged in organized discussions on critical race theory, which called on the school to increase diversity among its faculty and to better incorporate race into the school’s curriculum.
In 1983, Crenshaw and Matsuda led a group of Law School students in organizing an “Alternative Course” called “Racism and the American Law.”
The 14-week project — based on Bell’s “Race, Racism, and American Law” — was supported by proponents of critical legal studies on the Law School’s faculty and invited visiting professors from other law schools to teach at the school. More than 100 students attended the “Alternative Course,” one of the goals of which was to call on the Law School’s administration to offer an official course that studied race in the law.
Critical legal studies — a prominent legal movement of the 1970s and 1980s that was especially influential at Harvard Law School — sought to study the relationship that the law had with social and political issues.
Critical race theory emerged as an offshoot of the critical legal studies movement after the originators of critical race theory contended that critical legal studies and other legal approaches of the time failed to properly examine the relationship between race and the law.
“Critical race theory originates in kind of a splinter conference that breaks off from the general CLS conference,” said Robert W. Gordon ’63, professor emeritus at Yale and Stanford law schools and a former Crimson Editorial chair. Gordon was one of the original scholars of critical legal studies.
As Crenshaw wrote in her 2011 Connecticut Law Review article “Twenty Years of Critical Race Theory: Looking Back to Move Forward,” 24 scholars attended a 1989 conference at the University of Wisconsin called “New Developments in CRT” — which Crenshaw added represents the first use of the term.
Among the event’s participants were Bell and several Harvard Law School graduates — including Crenshaw, Matsuda, Western State College of Law professor emeritus Neil T. Gotanda, University of Buffalo Law School professor emeritus Stephanie L. Phillips, and others — a number of whom first interacted with critical legal studies at Harvard and met during their time there.
These academics, characterized by Crenshaw as “a motley crew of minority scholars” who attended the “backdoor speakeasies” of American Association of Law Schools and critical legal studies annual meetings, hoped to “move beyond the non-critical liberalism that often cabined civil rights discourses and a non-racial radicalism that was a line of debate within CLS.”
In the years since critical race theory’s inception, Harvard Law School has incorporated critical race theory and other approaches to the law related to identity — such as feminist legal theory — into courses in its curriculum, though many argue the school has not gone far enough in these efforts.
Today, Harvard Law School offers two courses focused on critical race theory. This past fall, Law School professor Kenneth W. Mack taught a course titled “Critical Race Theory” and this past spring, Law School professor Guy-Uriel E. Charles taught a seminar called “Critical Race Theorists and their Critics.”
For Charles, teaching the seminar was appealing because he wanted “to try to understand why critical race theory was viewed as so controversial.”
“When I first started, it was focusing as much on ‘What is critical race theory?’ as ‘What [do] the critics of critical race theory think that it is?’” he said. “This semester, when I’ve taught it, I’ve focused much, much less on the critics.”
Charles added that conservative criticisms of critical race theory have factored into how he teaches the class, saying that “part of the focus of my class is to make sure that my students have a pretty good understanding about what critical race theory is.”
“Just to give a basic example, critical race theory is not diversity, equity, and inclusion — DEI — those are just two different things,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily incompatible — doesn’t mean that they are or they are not incompatible — it just means that they’re different things.”
When asked if the conservative attacks on critical race theory had impacted its teaching and study at Harvard, Law School professor Jon D. Hanson answered, “Mostly no, but a little bit yes.”
“The ‘mostly no’ has to do with the fact that there isn’t any direct prohibition or attempt to prohibit what is taught in schools here in Massachusetts, much less law schools,” Hanson said of teaching critical race theory. “I can’t imagine a school like Harvard capitulating to pressure not to do that.”
“On the other hand, I would say, it is striking to me that, as an institution from which we could say critical race theory emerged and an institution that purports at this point to value the insights of critical race theory, I think it is striking how quiet we have been about what could be described as fascist trends in this country,” he added.
Boston University School of Law professor Aziza Ahmed said when she taught a seminar on critical race theory at Harvard Law School in spring 2021, she wanted her students to “understand what the background rules — legal rules — and structural conditions were that essentially contribute to the ordering of society along racial lines.”
Ahmed — a graduate of Harvard’s School of Public Health — said she was also interested in “how science gets mobilized in the context of law to essentially make racial claims,” which motivated her selection of cases to study in the class.
Sean R. Wynn, a rising second-year student at the Law School who took Charles’ class, said he enrolled because he had just one slot for an elective and “wanted to take something that was as far away from a doctrinal class as possible.”
“It was really good over the past five months to just be challenged on the way that I see the world,” Wynn said.
But some affiliates say the Law School’s most fundamental courses — its required first-year curriculum — fail to challenge students along these lines.
Student efforts to incorporate critical race theory into the curriculum and discourse at the Law School have continued since the “Alternative Course,” including student-run conferences, teach-ins, and protests in recent years.
One example of this is the Bell Collective, a student organization at the Law School — named after Bell, the former Law School professor — that organizes an annual critical race theory conference. Edward S. Chung, the Bell Collective’s incoming president and a rising third-year student at Harvard Law School, joined the group after feeling disheartened by the school’s first-year curriculum.
“I was kind of disappointed in the curriculum that they had in terms of how they approached race and other topics,” Chung said. “So, a few of my mentors reached out and said you should join the Bell Collective, we had the same issue you had our first year, and this is how we decided to deal with it and make our own conference to address these issues that weren’t being covered in the curriculum.”
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment on criticisms that the school’s first-year curriculum focuses too heavily on doctrine and fails to properly address race and identity.
In recent years, as political attacks on critical race theory have increased, Chung said he feels the nine-member Bell Collective has received increased attention at the school.
“The support the conference is getting has changed a little bit, from more left-leaning or smaller communities within the Harvard Law community,” Chung said. “Now, it’s like the institution is trying to take a heavier hand or like a bigger role in the conference because of the attacks and because of the buzzword that’s been going around in a sense.”
According to Noah Q. Spicer, a rising second-year student at the Law School who took Charles’ class, not talking enough “about how doctrinal issues or black letter law intersects with our various identities” is a missed opportunity for the Law School’s first-year curriculum.
“Harvard Law School produces some of the most notable figures in not only American history, but world history, and so, I think not talking about how our identities play a role in how decisions are made within the courtroom and how it impacts people’s lives doesn’t allow us to interrogate those views and to really refine how we feel,” Spicer said.
“Some people might deny or not feel like race plays a meaningful role in how the law is adjudicated, that judges and lawyers are facially neutral and look at the law from a sanitized perspective, but I just don’t think that that’s reality,” he added
Ahmed, the BU law professor who was a Harvard visiting professor, said that she feels there is a need to incorporate discussions of race and identity into the first-year law curriculum.
“I think it’s not just critical race theory,” Ahmed said, referencing other approaches to the law examining identity. “The concern is becoming more immediate because the Supreme Court — especially if you’re teaching a class like Constitutional [Law] — is so out of sync with what most Americans want and certainly what most law students want.”
“You have to be able to bring in a broader conversation about power and politics and interest groups,” Ahmed added. “That necessarily requires an acknowledgment of the types of inequalities we see in society.”

Massachusetts governors Mitt Romney, Deval L. Patrick ’78, Charlie D. Baker ’79, and Maura T. Healey ’92 don’t share a party, vision, or even home state. But the four most recent governors of Massachusetts do have one thing in common: a Harvard diploma.
The prestige of the Harvard name often connects the University’s brand to the highest echelons of American society — a plethora of presidents, top scholars, and leading executives found their start at Harvard.
Yet the space Harvard occupies in the public imagination often overlooks its commanding presence at the Massachusetts state level — even though the University is mentioned in three articles of the Massachusetts Constitution, a testament to its deep historical ties to the Commonwealth.
Of the 72 governors of Massachusetts since the state’s founding, 29 have been Harvard graduates — or about 40 percent.
Previously, the Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — included, by state law, the Massachusetts governor, lieutenant governor, State Senate president, and House speaker. Only in 1865 did the Board of Overseers split from the Massachusetts government and become an elected body.
As the historically close relationship between the University and the Commonwealth has survived the centuries, however, it has become less cozy and more fraught. According to elected officials, Harvard operates as both a partner and as an influential stakeholder in policy issues full of competing interests.
As Harvard affiliates continue to interact with and fill the Massachusetts government, it often falls to the University’s own to create policy and settle disagreements that directly affect Harvard.
How does their time at the University influence the way they approach these disputes, and what is the effect of Harvard’s impact on Massachusetts leaders?
Harvard’s Dexter Gate, at the precipice of Harvard Yard, was christened in 1890 with an inscription championing public service from then-University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1852.
“Enter to grow in wisdom,” the gate proclaims. “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.”
Eliot did not have to look far for such a link between Harvard and government. His father, Samuel A. Eliot, Class of 1817, ran the gamut of Massachusetts elected offices, serving as a state representative, mayor of Boston, and state senator before representing Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Samuel Eliot did not have to choose between public service and service to his alma mater — from 1842 to 1853, he was treasurer of Harvard University, amid his terms as a state senator and later a member of Congress.
The University’s pipeline to local, state, and federal government is not a relic of the past — Harvard alumni continue to fill all levels of elected office today.
When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, a third of his cabinet boasted time at Harvard, including four alumni of Harvard College — most prominently, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84, a former Crimson editor, and Attorney General Merrick B. Garland ’74.
This trend is also reflected at the state level. For the last 20 years, four Harvard alumni in a row — Romney, Patrick, Baker, and Healey — have held the governor’s office.
The current city executives of Boston and Cambridge — Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 and Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 — both hail from Harvard, too.
Elected in 2021, Wu has called her education at Harvard “foundational” to her work in city politics. Though Wu is the first Harvard College alum in nearly 100 years to lead Boston, the city has run deep with Crimson ties for centuries.
Before 1900, 14 of 31 total mayors of Boston were Harvard graduates. Malcolm E. Nichols, Class of 1899, the last Harvard College graduate to take Boston’s top office before Wu, was elected to lead the city in 1925.
“Once again a Harvard graduate has reached the top of Boston’s political ladder,” The Crimson declared in a November 1925 article announcing Nichols’ election.
Healey, one of the most recent Harvard alumni to take Massachusetts office, wrote in an emailed statement that she is “grateful for her experience at Harvard,” and that her administration continues to enjoy a collaborative relationship with Harvard University.
Healey – who is the first elected female governor of the state – wrote that she has developed a “strong partnership” with University leadership “to strengthen our education system and make Massachusetts a more affordable, competitive and equitable place for all.”
“We all share the same goals of attracting students, researchers, academics and business to Massachusetts and making sure our state is a place where they choose to stay and build their futures,” she added.
Harvard’s extensive influence across Massachusetts makes it a priority for state legislators — but also a target for accountability.
Despite Massachusetts’ close connections to the University, Juliette N. Kayyem ’91 – lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former Massachusetts homeland security adviser – said that “the institutions are different.”
“Harvard does not reflect the state. No matter how hard it tries, it does not,” Kayyem added.
In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote that the University works closely with officials on statewide issues.
“Harvard works with our higher education partners to monitor state-level issues and to support government partners across the Commonwealth in their work to address critical policy areas for the state,” Kamosa wrote.
Massachusetts State Rep. David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13, a Harvard College alum, said the school enjoys greater access to state government than other institutions might.
“There are many private institutions that will be lobbying the Commonwealth very significantly,” LeBoeuf said. “Harvard — for the most part, because its storied history — doesn’t have to approach the Commonwealth in that way.”
LeBoeuf, a former Crimson editor, is currently co-sponsoring a bill that takes aim at donor and legacy preferences at colleges like Harvard.
The bill would disincentivize these considerations in higher education admissions processes, levying a fee against institutions prioritizing legacy applicants and those with connections to donors.
LeBoeuf said his time at Harvard did not contribute to his commitment to co-sponsor the bill. Instead, he cited loyalty to his constituents and his district as more important to his ultimate decision.
“I represent a very high-needs, lower-income district,” he said. “When I’m looking at bills, I’m not necessarily thinking about how it’s going to affect one institution — I’m looking at how it’s going to affect this system, the whole state.”
“It wasn’t necessarily about Harvard and my Harvard experience,” LeBoeuf added.
While this legislation provides a challenge to the University’s practices, LeBoeuf said that Harvard generally enjoys an advantaged position in government.
“I think where Harvard has an advantage or has more autonomy is because of the size of its endowment and its global connections,” he said.
Harvard’s unique influence on the Boston area has most recently come to the fore in the University’s contentious expansion into Allston.
In an eight-year anonymous property buy-up starting in 1989, the University purchased 52.6 acres of land in the area for $88 million. Subsequent purchases made in the University’s name brought Harvard’s land holdings in the area to more than 200 acres.
The purchased property has since been a major focus of development by Harvard, becoming home to its Science and Engineering Complex and soon, its Enterprise Research Campus.
All the while, the expansion has been overseen by Harvard alums in Boston city government.
Brian P. Golden ’87 led the Boston Planning and Development Agency — named the Boston Redevelopment Authority when he began his tenure — from 2014 to 2022, coinciding with a crucial period in the University’s push to develop its Enterprise Research Campus in Allston.
The BPDA approved a framework for the expansion — detailing a 36-acre entrepreneurship center including offices, lab space, and a hotel and conference center — in 2018, while Golden was director. In 2016, the then-BRA approved plans for the SEC in Allston, also under Golden.
Since its founding in 1957, five of the agency’s permanent directors have been Harvard alumni, including its inaugural director, Kane Simonian ’33.
Just last summer, Wu negotiated a deal between Harvard and neighborhood representatives to allow Harvard’s construction of the first phase of its Enterprise Research Campus to move forward.
Following her election in November 2021, Wu met with representatives from her alma mater and elected officials from Allston for months to work out a compromise that would satisfy both Harvard’s intentions to develop the land and the specific requests of neighborhood residents associated with any such development, like affordable housing requirements.
Wu’s office did not respond to The Crimson’s request for comment.
Kamosa, the Harvard spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that the University “routinely engages with elected officials, government agencies, members of the community, and other partners in Boston, Cambridge, and across the Commonwealth.”
“We appreciate these longstanding relationships and opportunities for our continued work together,” she added.
Close coordination between city leaders and private universities is not unique to Harvard’s Allston expansion, however.
Thomas P. Glynn, a former head of the Harvard-Allston Land Company with previous roles in state and national government, described in an interview how common this relationship has become particularly with urban universities, in a comment on Harvard’s position as a landlord in Allston.
“I think most universities in this era — if you’re located in cities — are in the housing business in the same way that Harvard is. People at a point in time wanted the University to invest in the neighborhoods to strengthen them,” he said. “That was certainly true in Penn, that was true in Columbia, was true in NYU.”
Glynn said he believes Harvard’s prominence makes it less likely that elected officials coming from the University would be swayed by their connection to it.
“Harvard is so visible. It’s not a secret that Maura Healey went to Harvard,” he said. “If she did something that seemed tilted towards Harvard, everybody would know.”
Glynn noted that in conflicts involving Harvard, those who have active ties to the University can recuse themselves — an option he took himself after being named board chair of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority last month.
“I sent a letter to the general counsel of the T saying I’m recusing myself from any matters having to do with West Station,” he said, referencing a planned T station in Allston that will be built as part of the Allston Multimodal Project — an initiative Harvard is helping to plan and fund.
“You know, I’m on the Kennedy School payroll,” he noted.
Glynn said that despite an array of competing influences, he believes the government follows the will of the people.
“We have a lot of big institutions, which is great, but we have a lot of neighborhoods,” Glynn said of Boston. “Usually the neighborhoods win, in the end.”

Harvard sophomore Ricky R. Razon IV ’25 recalls his grandmother living off a highway named after Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy.
“I’m all too familiar with buildings, landmarks being named after slaveowners and people that have played a role in upholding the legacy of slavery,” Razon said. “Coming up north, I thought this was something I did not have to deal with — buildings being named after enslavers and people in positions of power that upheld the legacy of slavery.”
Razon, who is the president of the Generational African American Students Association, wondered if it was “naive” of him to be surprised when he learned that the “sought after” Winthrop House was named after slaveowners.
Razon is not the only student who has taken issue with the names adorning some Harvard buildings. Over the past few years, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum and Building, Winthrop, and Mather House have all been subject to calls for denaming due to the legacies of their namesakes.
For nearly all of Harvard’s history, the University provided no official procedures through which students could request building name changes.
But in 2020, President Lawrence S. Bacow created a committee charged with the creation of procedures under which the University and FAS would consider requests for renaming. In December 2021, the committee released its final report before its dissolution.
Since the guidelines were published, written requests for denaming both Winthrop and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum and Building have been submitted and are currently being reviewed by administrators.
But student activists — who have spent months putting together denaming campaigns — said the new guidelines have come with a veil of uncertainty over Harvard’s timelines and criteria for review. Other undergraduates and alumni expressed concerns that denaming would shift their relationships with the buildings they called home.
For Razon, denaming represents a way to reckon with “a very dark and ugly history.”
“We’re able to bring that to light and hold the institution to the fire in acknowledging its dark past and dark history and uplifting those who Harvard has profited off of,” he said.
In February, GAASA and Natives at Harvard College disseminated a petition calling for the denaming of Winthrop, citing the history of its namesakes, both of whom were named John Winthrop.
The petition has since acquired more than 600 signatures, including those from 45 descendants of the John Winthrops.
The following month, GAASA and NaHC submitted an official denaming request to the FAS, which they also published publicly as a historical and archival report on the Winthrops.
Clyve Lawrence ’25 — who spearheaded the research and drafting of the denaming request — said he believes building names honor “certain figures and values.”
“What we said with this denaming project is that John Winthrop is not a figure that we should commemorate,” said Lawrence, a Crimson Editorial editor.
The Winthrop request comes almost a year after Harvard released its landmark Legacy of Slavery report in April 2022 that detailed how the school participated in, perpetuated, and profited from slavery. Included in the report are details of the Winthrops’ enslavement of Indigenous and African peoples.
The elder John Winthrop served as governor of Massachusetts for 16 years and as a Harvard overseer. But the Winthrop report said he was also “an instrumental leader in The Pequot War,” described as “a brutal, genocidal war of extermination against the Pequots, driving them to near-extinction.”
Winthrop personally enslaved at least seven people and contributed to the creation of the legal code which legalized slavery in Massachusetts, according to the Winthrop report.
The younger John Winthrop, his great-great grandson, served as both a Harvard professor and president. He enslaved two individuals of African descent.
Lawrence said the proposal is based on the idea that “the University should be compelled to change the symbolic and physical remnants of this legacy.”
“It’s a first step that we can say is really reckoning with the legacy of slavery at Harvard,” he said.
Morgan H. Curtis, a descendant of John Winthrop and student at Harvard Divinity School, signed onto the petition to dename Winthrop after studying and researching the Winthrops.
“It feels personal to understand the privileges I was born into are connected to the taking of land and labor from Black and native people,” Curtis said.
Madison R. Webb ’25, a member of the Winthrop report outreach committee, said she believes that for Indigenous and Black students, walking through Winthrop House can be an “emotional experience.”
“It’s just a reminder that the University historically thinks of you as not even a human being worthy of respect, worthy of being alive, and worthy of being treated as an equal,” Webb said.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on calls to dename Winthrop or student criticisms.
Activists rekindled calls to dename the Arthur M. Sackler Museum and Building this fall, almost five years after an initial protest that demanded the University take down the Sackler name. Students staged a subsequent protest at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum last month.
Members of the Harvard College Overdose Prevention and Education Students oppose the presence of the Sackler name due to the Sackler family’s ties to Purdue Pharma, the pharmaceutical company that created and marketed the highly-addictive opioid OxyContin.
In fall 2022, members of HCOPES disseminated a petition to remove the name from both buildings, which included a poll administered to undergraduate students at the University. Out of 316 respondents, 310 supported the denaming of the Sackler Museum and Building. That October, HCOPES submitted their official denaming request to Harvard administrators.
“For decades, the Sackler family has profited off the sale and deceptive marketing of addictive drugs, most notably OxyContin,” the 23-page report reads.
Arthur M. Sackler died before the release of OxyContin in 1996. Still, HCOPES wrote in the report that they believe he is “far from blameless” in the popularization of opioids due to his work developing “deeply unethical and detrimental” medical marketing strategies.
Regardless of Arthur Sackler’s personal involvement, HCOPES argued that his name should be removed due to its association with his family.
“I think that the Sackler name in this country, and Arthur Sackler’s name as well, is deeply intertwined with the opioid epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans,” HCOPES Policy Chair Jay P. Garg ’24 said.
Signatories of the HCOPES petition had the option to provide personal comments about their relationship to the Sackler name. According to a copy of the petition obtained by The Crimson, a number of affiliates described deep discomfort with spending time in or walking by buildings with the Sackler name.
Spokespeople for Purdue Pharma and Jillian Sackler, Arthur Sackler’s widow, did not respond to requests for comment. Newton declined to comment on the Sackler denaming request.
Denaming requests for FAS buildings are evaluated either through the FAS or the University, or both. The components of requests are outlined by the “Committee to Articulate Principles on Renaming,” the group which Bacow convened in 2020.
President Emerita Drew G. Faust chaired the group, which consisted of 15 other members.
This group aimed to determine circumstances in which names might be removed from Havard buildings due to “past advocacy or support of activities” that affiliates “would today find abhorrent,” according to its final report.
Harvard Economics professor and Lowell House Faculty Dean David I. Laibson ’88, a member of the committee, said the group solicited opinions from stakeholders including students, staff, faculty, alumni, Cambridge residents, and historians throughout the process.
“It was a highly consultative process, and I thought it was a very fruitful set of conversations because people really were listening to one another,” Laibson said.
According to the committee’s final report, denaming requests must determine to what extent the name “creates a harmful environment,” consider the historical evidence and why the name was originally selected, and discern how central the name is to the experience of Harvard affiliates.
Requests must also consider if the namesake’s criticized behavior is “a significant component of that individual’s legacy when viewed in the full context of the namesake’s life” and whether their actions would have been “objectionable in the namesake’s own time.”
Finally, petitioners must discuss whether retaining and contextualizing the name is a better alternative to denaming.
Denaming proposals originally submitted to the FAS will also be reviewed at the University level if they involve a gift agreement or other legal contract.
According to Harvard’s guidelines, if a denaming proposal is not accepted by the review committee, another request for that name cannot be submitted for five years, except if “significant and consequential new information comes to light.”
After submission, the request is first examined for basic validity criteria unrelated to the denaming argument. If the request passes this initial review, it advances to a substantive review, conducted by a committee of faculty, administrators, and students unaffiliated with the request.
The Winthrop petition is currently in the substantive review stage, Lawrence said. Advocates for the Sackler petition have received no updates on the process beyond the fact that the request is under review, according to Garg.
The denaming processes do not set any time frame for how long the review should take.
Some students involved in the creation of denaming proposals criticized the length, uncertainty, and complexity involved with the petition process.
Webb said she respects the “tedious” nature of the process, though she said it shouldn’t take “three years to acknowledge wrongdoing.”
“They’re thinking about stakeholders, and they’re thinking about their endowment and they're thinking about future students, and how this may impact admissions and how it may impact future students who want to live at this university,” Webb said.
Kiersten B. Hash ’25, an organizer of the Winthrop denaming petition, said she feels the administration’s lengthy timeline for reviewing proposals is a “very intentional” method to subdue student activism.
“A lot of the ways that the school quells student organizing is by making things slow-moving,” Hash said. “It’s guaranteeing the same students won’t be here.”
Newton, the Harvard spokesperson, declined to comment on criticisms of the denaming process.
Lawrence cited Stanford’s public list of names under review for denaming as an example of greater clarity in denaming processes.
“There’s a precedent for other colleges for making these types of things public,” Lawrence said.
Not all Harvard students and alumni are unified in the belief that the Winthrop or Sackler names should be removed from campus buildings.
Alma H. Conway ’23 said she supports denaming the Sackler buildings more than Winthrop House, describing allegations against the Sackler family as “a much more current and pressing issue.”
“They still are well off and don’t have to face the consequences of people who are addicted to opioids nowadays,” Conway said. “The slavery issue is awful and I think it will be a scar on America’s record forever, but I’m glad we overcame it and we should look at them with the lens of their time.”
Cindy H. Phan ’24 said she has no qualms with denaming, but she prefers that it is viewed as “a catalyst to a broader conversation that needs to happen.”
But for some Harvard alumni and former Winthrop House residents, like Gerasimos N. “Jerry” Tsandoulas ’61, “Winthrop” carries an intimate meaning associated with his time living in the house that transcends its namesakes’ legacies.
“This initiative will provoke a visceral, not intellectual, negative reaction in most of us whether such reaction is explicitly stated or not, for the name is inextricably tied to our overall experience at Winthrop House and we do not want that experience to be in any way degraded,” Tsandoulas wrote in an emailed statement.
Tijesunimi E. Borode ’24, who did research for the Winthrop petition, said houses can be a “safe haven,” providing all the more reason to pay attention to their namesakes’ historical roots.
“What [it] symbolizes for some is the remembrance that will provoke recollection of atrocities that were done in the past,” Borode said.
Albert Z. “Chig” Lewis Jr. ’70, a former Winthrop resident, wrote that affiliates “must understand the past to improve upon it.”
“I find it exceedingly more interesting to examine the history of a flawed person and try to understand the forces and cultural impacts of their situation than to try to glorify someone in an edifice that bears little connection with the history of the building,” Lewis wrote in an email.
Lawrence said he believes denaming is not “erasing history or rewriting history” but instead “a symbolic step” towards dismantling oppressive systems.
“It is a specific process of contextualization and acknowledgment,” Lawrence said. “It’s a way for us to reckon with a complete picture of somebody’s life, rather than just brushing off, or cherry-picking certain parts of the legacy.”

UPDATED: May 26, 2023, at 3:10 p.m.
When Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences raised its new flag bearing the name of Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, it was just the fourth time the University had ever renamed a school following a donation.
The first happened in 1639 after a donation by Reverend John Harvard changed the College’s name, and it would be another 375 years before the University renamed another school following a donation.
But in the past decade, top Harvard officials have shown a renewed willingness to exchange the naming rights of schools for nine-figure donations — decisions that have raised questions and eyebrows.
Just last month, GSAS was renamed following a $300 million unrestricted donation from Griffin to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The gift prompted heavy criticism, with affiliates questioning the University’s choice to publicly honor a donor with a record of supporting controversial political figures.
But the donation also raised further questions about Harvard’s donor practices in general, with many wondering exactly how, why, and for how much Harvard sells the naming rights to its major schools and institutions.
In the fall of 2013, when Gerald L. Chan called William F. Lee ’72 — then the newly-appointed senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — renaming the Harvard School of Public Health was just an idea. But one year and $350 million later, it became a reality as the University announced the renamed T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The next year, hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson donated $400 million to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and saw his name emblazoned on the school. This time, the negotiations lasted two years.
But talks for Griffin’s donation lasted more than twice as long.
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 has served on the University’s highest governing body since 2018, but said she was not a member of the Corporation during the negotiations for the Griffin donation.
Michael D. Smith confirmed in an emailed statement that he helped negotiate the gift during his tenure as dean of the FAS, which lasted from 2007 to 2018. Then-University President Drew G. Faust was also kept informed of the ongoing talks.
However, the University did not announce the gift until April 2023 — five years after the end of Smith’s term.
Roy Y. Chan, a higher education expert, said gifts of this size typically require just three to six months to finalize, a figure that raises questions about the half-decade gap between the negotiation and announcement of Griffin’s donation.
During his time as dean, Smith negotiated the terms of the agreement with Griffin, including that the gift would be unrestricted to the FAS and that Griffin would be recognized through the renaming of GSAS.
Griffin’s donation sparked intense backlash from Harvard affiliates over the billionaire’s public support of Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who Griffin is expected to back in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. Negotiations for his donation to the FAS, however, began before DeSantis’ election to his first term as governor.
At the beginning of negotiations, Smith and Griffin also agreed that the money from the gift would be transferred to the University before any public announcement was made.
In a Friday interview with The Crimson, outgoing FAS Dean Claudine Gay declined to comment on the details of the negotiations or her involvement.
Faust also declined to comment on Griffin’s donation.
Nine-figure donations to colleges and universities “have been common for quite a while now,” said Maria Di Mento, a senior reporter for the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
But Di Mento said at top schools with large endowments, renaming institutions after donors is not as common, noting that Harvard routinely receives large donations. She said renaming for donors “has been far more common” at smaller schools.
“They’re probably going to be a lot more cautious about putting somebody’s name on a building because they’ll probably get another nine-figure gift the following year,” she said of wealthy schools.
Hansjörg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire who has given more than $700 million to the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering since its establishment in 2009, said his donation negotiations began with then-Provost Steven E. Hyman.
That the institute would bear his name was a foregone conclusion, Wyss said. The whole project, bringing together different disciplines, scholars, and ideas together, was his idea.
“It had to be named in my name,” he said.
Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, a longtime Harvard donor who is the namesake for a University professorship — Harvard’s highest faculty rank — said the University can either solicit its donors and tell them how much it would cost to endow a professorship, or the donor can give Harvard a certain sum and let the University decide how it wants to recognize the gift.
Buttenwieser pointed to his recent gift to the Harvard Art Museums as an instance in which naming rights were agreed upon after the donation was finalized.
“I decided what amount of my gift to Harvard should go to the Art Museum, and then they came back much later and said, ‘For a gift of that size, we’d like to recognize you by naming a gallery after you,’” Buttenwieser said.
“So it might be that I would have said, ‘How much does a gallery cost?’” he added. “Which, I can assure you, a lot of people do.”
Harvard megadonors Pritzker and Griffin stand on opposing sides of the political spectrum.
Hailing from a family of Chicago political titans, Pritzker served in a Democratic cabinet as the United States Secretary of Commerce under Barack Obama. Her brother, Democratic Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, also has a well-publicized feud with Griffin, a Republican who gave nearly $60 million to GOP candidates in the 2022 midterm elections.
Griffin has also given to Democratic candidates, including $500,000 to President Joe Biden’s inaugural committee.
Despite their political differences, Pritzker said in a phone interview earlier this month she was “grateful” for Griffin’s financial support of the University.
“He’s given us over $500 million. That’s a heck of a vote of confidence, which I think is great,” she said.
Pritzker praised Griffin’s fundraising efforts for Harvard’s financial aid program, highlighting the more than $600 million he’s raised in support of undergraduate education. Griffin himself donated $150 million to support financial aid at the College, prompting Harvard to rename its undergraduate financial aid office in his honor.
Pritzker, however, declined to comment on Griffin’s politics.
“He’s philanthropically very generous,” she said. “His politics are his politics.”
But concern among affiliates over Griffin’s political leanings extends beyond his contentious relationship with the Pritzkers. Critics point to Griffin’s public support for DeSantis for president, noting that the controversial governor has passed anti-gay legislation and spoken out against gender-affirming healthcare for transgender people.
“Ken is a passionate supporter of individual rights and freedoms and ensuring that future generations have access to the American Dream,” Jaquelyn M. Scharnick ’06, a spokesperson for Griffin and a former Crimson News editor, wrote. “Ken has supported candidates from both parties whom he believes advances these important values and has both publicly and privately engaged with politicians from both parties who undermine them.”
In a follow-up statement Thursday, Scharnick wrote that Griffin does not support Florida’s new law expanding the state’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” instructional restrictions through the 12th grade.
“Like the vast majority of Americans, Ken believes that discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation should be led by parents with their children at home, rather than by teachers in elementary schools,” Scharnick wrote. “However, as a steadfast supporter of open discourse, academic freedom, and free speech, Ken disagrees with Florida’s recent rule extending the prohibition of classroom instruction on these topics through 12th grade.”
Griffin, however, has publicly supported restrictions on the teaching of gender identity and sexual orientation through the third grade.
Former Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine, who led Harvard’s first University-wide capital campaign, highlighted the importance of maintaining a balance between the school’s reputation and its need for financial support.
“It’s a moral judgment,” Rudenstine said. “You have to make that moral judgment, I think, in order to keep the University’s reputation and its integrity intact.”
“You have to be willing to turn down things — you really do,” he added.
Outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow — who did not assume the presidency until 2018 but served on the Harvard Corporation during the negotiation of the Griffin donation — defended the University’s acceptance of the gift in an April interview.
“One of the things which we do not do — nor should we do — is have political tests for who donates,” Bacow said. “The institution does not speak with one voice.”
In response to widespread criticisms that renaming GSAS in Griffin’s honor would create a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ affiliates, Bacow insisted on the differentiation between Griffin’s own political views and those of the candidates he financially supports.
“Ken himself is a libertarian,” Bacow said. “I suspect if you talk to him about this specific view, you might get a different response than what some politicians that he has supported might give.”
“We don’t hold individuals responsible for the actions of their countries,” he added. “We also should not hold individuals responsible for every action, every opinion of every candidate that they support.”
Faculty members, too, have said the political views of donors should not influence whether or not Harvard accepts money from them.
“I don’t think it makes sense to screen out donors based on their politics any more than it makes sense to screen out students or faculty members based on their politics,” said Flynn J. Cratty, a lecturer in the History Department.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, a former Harvard College Dean, pointed to the unrestricted nature of Griffin’s donation.
“He’s not giving to support a particular political agenda or political program,” he said in an April interview. “I don’t believe Harvard should be picking and choosing its donors that way.”
On the day of the announcement, many noted the speed at which the flag that flies outside Lehman Hall, the GSAS student center, was replaced with one that bore Griffin’s name.
But as more details about the name change emerged, amusement was replaced with unease for some GSAS student leaders over what they viewed as highly stringent requirements on the use of the school’s name. The renaming, as it turned out, applies to all formal and informal references to GSAS.
According to outgoing GSAS Student Council president Zachary Lim, this means that names of all institutions that include “GSAS” — from offices and programs to student organizations and potentially the student center — will also be required to include a reference to Griffin.
During a Thursday meeting with GSAS student leadership, GSAS administrators “told us that the contract is ironclad, and that they made it such that only two names were permissible: either the full name, which is ‘the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences,’ or ‘Harvard Griffin GSAS,’” Lim said.
When GSAS student groups go through a renewal process in October, “all student groups are going to have to repropose a new name that it is in realignment with these standards, otherwise it will not be reapproved,” Lim said. “This includes the student council.”
Lim noted that Paulson’s name is generally omitted from colloquial references to SEAS and the names of student organizations, including the SEAS Graduate Council. SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said that he was “not aware of any such mandate to that effect” for Paulson’s name in SEAS student organizations.
Ashley Cavanagh, a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Physics and the president of the Harvard LGBTQ@GSAS Association, said the prospect of having to change the group’s name to include a mention of Griffin was “hurtful,” citing Griffin’s support of DeSantis, who has signed and proposed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.
Griffin’s name “cannot be attached to an LGBTQ+ students group,” Cavanagh said. “That is not okay with me. So if there’s not wiggle room, I’m hoping to be able to fight it.”
Scharnick, the Griffin spokesperson, declined to comment on criticism of student group name restrictions or specifics of the gift agreement. GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall did not comment for this article. FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the details of the negotiations.
Many GSAS affiliates have also called for Griffin’s funds, which came as an unrestricted gift to the FAS, to be spent in part to support graduate students or graduate education.
Lim said he hopes to see some of the gift go toward GSAS projects, such as a long-awaited renovation of the student center, but said he and other students were “discouraged” about that coming to fruition.
Gay did not confirm whether any of Griffin’s gift would go toward GSAS. Instead, she said graduate education was an “enduring priority” of the FAS and that she could not give a “line item accounting” of the gift’s allocation during Friday’s interview.
“Ken is proud to support the research and scholarship of this great institution in debating ideas on their merits in the pursuit of truth,” Scharnick wrote of the FAS.
“There was a $300 million unrestricted gift, but it was unclear to us if we would ever see any of that money,” Lim said. “We spoke to our deans. Our deans said that our budget lines have not changed and there’s no projection that it will change.”
“It didn’t come with any victories for us,” Lim added. “It’s like, ‘Here, have a new name that came with a lot of money, but you’re not going to see any of it.’”

For more than 25 years, higher education officials criticized U.S. News and World Report privately and publicly for its annual rankings of universities and graduate schools but continued to cooperate with the highly popular scoresheet.
That all changed last fall.
Yale Law School, consistently ranked first in the country by U.S. News, announced last November it would stop cooperating with the rankings, claiming its methodology “not only fails to advance the legal profession, but stands squarely in the way of progress.”
Hours later, Harvard Law School also announced it would stop participating in the rankings. Dozens of other law schools quickly followed suit.
In January, Harvard Medical School led another exodus — this time of medical schools — from the rankings after announcing it would also boycott the U.S. News rankings.
While the boycott represents the most serious challenge to U.S. News since it began ranking colleges and universities 40 years ago, the magazine has pledged to continue its annual rankings practice by relying on publicly available data it can use with or without the participation of schools.
It released its 2024 list of top law schools and medical schools earlier this month, affirming its commitment to producing a set of rankings even without the cooperation of many top-ranked schools themselves.
Eric J. Gertler, chief executive officer of U.S. News, said in an interview that the magazine remains undeterred in its efforts to inform students through the application process, calling the movement against U.S. News rankings is ultimately a boycott “against accountability.”
“It was a decision against more data for students,” he said. “It was a decision against students.”
Grievances with the rankings date back to at least 1998 when a group of law school deans publicly took issue with the questionnaire circulated to schools that year and the formula used by U.S. News to compile its rankings.
Law school officials criticized the magazine’s rankings formula — which heavily weighted standardized test scores — as an obstacle to admitting a diverse student body and training graduates for public interest law careers.
Despite the criticism persisting for decades, deans cooperated with U.S. News year after year, proving the rankings to be irresistible to even its most outspoken detractors — until Yale and Harvard suddenly decided late last year they had seen enough.
Yale Law School Dean Heather K. Gerken announced in a Nov. 16 press release that the school would stop submitting data to U.S. News because the rankings are “counterproductive to the mission of this profession.”
“The U.S. News rankings are profoundly flawed — they disincentivize programs that support public interest careers, champion need-based aid, and welcome working-class students into the profession,” Gerken wrote. “As a result, we will no longer participate.”
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 stated in a similarly worded statement hours later that the school moved to withdraw from the rankings because “it has become impossible to reconcile our principles and commitments with the methodology and incentives the U.S. News rankings reflect.”
“This decision was not made lightly and only after considerable deliberation over the past several months,” he wrote.
The deliberation, however, did not involve input from U.S. News. In an interview, Gertler said U.S. News was “given no warning and there was no outreach” prior to Yale and Harvard Law Schools’ decision to withdraw from the rankings.
“We heard about the decision not to participate in our survey, like everybody else, from a press release,” Gertler said.
It was also a decision that came as a surprise to some law school deans.
Matthew R. Diller ’81, dean at the Fordham University School of Law, acknowledged that law schools had been in discussions regarding the shortcomings of the U.S. News rankings for many years but said the boycott that began last November was not a coordinated effort.
“As far as I know, there was no larger kind of agreement or discussion to pull out in any kind of mass way,” he said. “I think each school that I know of made its own decision based on its own vantage point.”
But it became easier for other law schools to join the boycott after two of the top law schools dropped out of the rankings first, according to Diller.
“Having the leaders in the fields — the Harvards and Yales — pull out, made it much easier for other schools to pull out,” he said.
William M. Treanor, dean of the Georgetown University Law School, said Gerken’s decision to leave the rankings was “very courageous.”
“She’s pulling out of a game that she wins every year,” Treanor said.
While law school officials say their decisions to withdraw from rankings were made on principle, some admissions experts maintain that the boycott is also an effort to influence the U.S. News formula.
Dan Lee, co-founder of Solomon Admissions Consulting said he believes law schools, in pulling out of the rankings, have been able to “collectively bargain” with the magazine to manipulate the way rankings are determined.
“Schools have a tremendous amount of leverage in terms of shaping what they want the ranking metrics to be and the weighting of each metric,” Lee said.
As an example, he cited a change in the weighting of law school metrics in U.S. News rankings. Following the boycott, the magazine decreased the weight it gave to LSAT scores from 11.25 percent to 5 percent, and the undergraduate GPA weighting decreased from 8.75 percent to 4 percent.
The rankings’ formula change following the boycott, Lee said, allows law schools to diversify the types of careers their students pursue post-grad. According to Harvard Law School’s recent employment data, more than 55 percent of its class of 2022 took jobs post-graduation at law firms that employ more than 500 lawyers, while less than eight percent pursued public interest careers.
“Top law schools, in general, tend to want to send more of their students to public interest areas of law that don’t involve working in large corporate law firms, and that’s going to be easier for them to do given the current change in the metrics,” Lee said.
“It’s going to give schools leeway to admit very talented, underrepresented students who may not necessarily be the best test takers,” he added.
Incoming Harvard Law School student Joshua Y. Rotenberg said diversity of interests was a “big driver” for him when considering law schools and his future career.
“If you’re changing your methods to try and increase diversity within your school — it’s definitely something that spoke to me, and I think it generally makes sense, just from an educational standpoint,” Rotenberg said.
But while the changes to the U.S. News rankings will give law schools more flexibility in their admissions practices, some say the boycott also reveals an unwillingness from top law schools to make policy changes that would result in a lower ranking.
“The interesting thing is that they could take students with lower scores,” said Bari Norman, president of the professional college advising service Expert Admissions. “They could take students from more diverse backgrounds and not pull out of the rankings.”
“It sort of acknowledges, obviously, the power of the rankings in saying, ‘We’re going to pull out so that we don’t obviously suffer,’” Norman added. “So if they suffer in the rankings, it’s because they pulled out, not because they did what they thought was the right thing.”
Despite the methodology changes to the rankings, top law schools have doubled down on their criticisms of U.S. News. In a January statement, Gerken, the dean of Yale Law School, said that “having a window into the operations and decision-making process at U.S. News in recent weeks has only cemented our decision to stop participating in the rankings.”'
Yale Law School retained its number one status, tied with Stanford, in the 2024 U.S. News ranking of law schools released earlier this month.
Abigail Joseph ’21, an incoming Harvard/MIT MD-Ph.D. program student, said she believes it is possible that schools considered both their individual rankings and student outcomes when deciding to drop out of the rankings.
“You could have a pure motive along with a more self-prioritizing motive, and I don’t think they’re necessarily mutually exclusive of each other,” Joseph said.
Top administrators at HLS, HMS, and Yale Law School declined interview requests to discuss the U.S. News boycott.
Even as top schools remain steadfast in their criticism of U.S. News, experts say any future fluctuations in the rankings will not likely have long-term repercussions on their reputations.
“When a school rises in it that isn’t historically toward the top, it will get some more respect,” Norman said. “As opposed to damaging places that have brands that are literally hundreds of years old.”
“U.S. News is powerful, but not that powerful,” she added.
Diller, the dean of Fordham Law, said his school’s participation in the boycott of U.S. News was a “symbolic protest” because it occurred after U.S. News already announced it would only rely on publicly available data for this year’s rankings.
Still, Diller said he joined the movement in order to encourage law school applicants “to view U.S. News with a certain skepticism.”
“The more U.S. News has been discussed, the more educated prospective students are about the limitations of U.S. News,” he said.
Norman said rankings are mentioned much less frequently in her own admissions consulting practice but added she believes the influence of rankings on college and graduate admissions will not “go away overnight.”
Asked if there is concern that the rankings boycott could spread to colleges or other graduate schools, Gertler said U.S. News needs to focus on fulfilling its mission.
“What we need to do is to strive to provide the highest journalistic quality service that we can,” Gertler said. “The traffic numbers certainly reflect that there’s high interest, but we can never take that for granted.”
“We’ve got to continue to make sure that we’re doing our best for our core constituency, which in this case, is our students,” he added.
When considering the possibility of undergraduate colleges dropping out of rankings in the future, Norman said it is “clearly not an institutional priority” as none of the graduate programs that pulled out of rankings saw their undergraduate programs follow suit.
Norman, however, said she would like to also see top undergraduate schools boycott the rankings.
“I would love to see them truly pull out, not try to manipulate it from the back,” Norman said. “I hope I’m wrong, but I don’t think they have the courage to do so.”

Days after freshmen arrive on campus in the fall, they are greeted by a bustling club fair in Harvard Yard staffed by hundreds of student groups, wooing prospective members with free food, merchandise, and energetic pitches.
While most clubs advertise opportunities to find social connection or gain pre-professional experience, a small-but-growing number of student organizations boast perks and resources more akin to those of small corporations — including themed apparel, glamorous formal events, all-expenses-paid travel, financial aid, and six-figure budgets.
For decades, Harvard has taken pride in its hands-off approach to monitoring the finances of student clubs, even while some groups have faced high-profile allegations of mismanaging thousands of dollars of club money.
In March, a monthslong Crimson investigation found that the former president of the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative transferred roughly $30,000 from the student organization’s bank account to her own. The dispute was later brought to the Harvard College Administrative Board.
Recent months have seen the Dean of Students Office — a College administrative body that oversees undergraduate life — move to learn more about the entities that govern so much of students’ time at Harvard.
In April, Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason R. Meier said in an interview that the DSO would be conducting an audit of the College’s independent organizations with Harvard’s risk management office. The audit aims to gain a more “inward view” of the student organization ecosystem.
The Crimson reported later that month that the DSO was weighing a proposal to temporarily freeze the creation of new clubs, citing a shortage of resources to support existing ones.
Still, administrators have doubled down on their commitment to preserving the autonomy of clubs to spend their budgets and operate as they see fit.
“Student organizations are independent, and the Dean of Students Office does not provide oversight of the content of the work of the organizations,” College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo wrote in an emailed statement.
As these clubs grow, often by embracing the Harvard name, the line between student organization and corporation has blurred.
Interviews with more than a dozen club leaders and members painted a picture of the ways that some of Harvard’s most recognizable clubs have evolved to resemble something else: full-fledged companies.
Among campus organizations with large bottom lines, many generate income by hosting paid conferences, often for academically involved high school students.
The oldest of these organizations, the Harvard Debate Council, hosts a variety of programs including a signature debate tournament and other workshops. In the 2020 tax year, the Council brought in more than $1.8 million in revenue and declared more than $500,000 in net assets.
Officially incorporated in 1974, Harvard’s International Relations Council is another campus leviathan, featuring six constituent programs across a 700-strong membership, according to its website. Among the IRC’s endeavors are a series of international and domestic high school Model United Nations Conferences, which host more than 5,500 high school students annually, according to the IRC’s website.
In 2020, the IRC — a nonprofit — reported more than $700,000 in revenue and $1.2 million in net assets on their tax forms.
The Harvard Crimson also hosts an annual two-day program for high school students, the Harvard Crimson Journalism Summit, which can cost as much as $300 per student to attend.
Though many clubs, like the HDC, IRC, and The Crimson, rely on long-established reputations in order to maintain clientele and revenue streams, more recently formed student-run conferences have proven able to catapult themselves to financial success on surprising timelines.
One such organization is the Harvard Association for U.S.-China Relations, whose programming includes conferences and annual summits for Chinese students. Just seven years after it held its first conference in 2006, the club reported more than $400,000 in yearly revenue, though this number dipped to $140,000 in 2019, their last reported year.
According to Athena P. Bowe ’15, a former seminar leader and director of internal development at HAUSCR, the Harvard name is an undeniable factor in the success of these conferences, especially when students are eager to improve their chances of admission.
“To ignore the legitimacy the Harvard name lends to any of the student organizations would be disingenuous,” she wrote in a statement. “Some students I’m sure hoped [the Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China] would improve their chances.”
Most recently, HUFPI demonstrated that robust streams of cash could be established on the order of months, not years. In summer 2021, the young club held a lucrative conference for high schoolers interested in international relations — just over one year after the group had formed.
The conference brought in foreign policy titans including former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ’50, Blackstone CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta — and more than $180,000 in revenue.
Alongside the wealthy organizations that generate income from hosting conferences and competitions, some of Harvard’s student groups grow their budgets by consulting for external organizations, benefiting from perennial interest among Harvard undergraduates in consulting careers.
Founded in 2000, the Harvard College Consulting Group is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has worked with high-profile clients including Disney, Pepsi, and Microsoft, according to its website. In 2020, the group reported more than $440,000 in revenue — down from $880,000 the year before — as well as more than a million dollars in assets.
While another such club, Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment, was founded in 2008, it only began explicitly charging clients case fees in 2018. Since then, HUCBE has worked with big-ticket clients including Google, Amazon, and Pfizer, according to its website.
Often bound by confidentiality agreements, students involved in these groups undergo a rigorous and selective recruitment process and can spend up to dozens of hours per week on leading the club or working on cases for prominent clients.
“It definitely borderlines on being a little bit absurd,” HUCBE President Alexander H. Dang ’24 said of the time board members are asked to commit to the organization.
Like Bowe, Dang also recognized the impact of the Harvard name, though he maintained that it was simply a way to “get your foot in the door.”
“It still doesn’t change the fact that, even if we were not Harvard, we would have to do good work to get them to come back,” Dang said. “It definitely helps.”
Other student organizations, including The Harvard Crimson and the Harvard Lampoon — a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine — generate revenue by producing a publication. Though they do generate income from their content, including the sale of ads, both The Crimson and the Lampoon appear to largely break even in their publishing endeavors.
According to public tax records, in 2019, the Lampoon’s publishing entity brought in approximately $224,000, with a net yearly loss of $174,000. In that same year, The Crimson generated approximately $500,000 of revenue for a net income of just over $75,000.
With millions of dollars spread across clubs, Harvard’s wealthiest organizations are uniquely equipped to offer a variety of extravagant benefits to their members.
Members of HUFPI have traveled with the club to Dubai, France, and South Korea for a variety of foreign policy initiatives and engagements, but trips with these organizations are not always explicitly linked to club functions.
A member of HAUSCR said they were given the opportunity to attend trips with the club including a previous spring break trip to New Orleans and a planned trip to Thailand this summer.
Harvard Model United Nations members also have the opportunity to travel for the group’s conferences in China and India.
While HDC can’t boast international travel for its members, collegiate competitions require regular travel across the United States — all fully funded by the organization for participants.
Many clubs also subsidize branded merchandise and group bonding activities, including dinners out, retreats, and other socials.
HCCG has previously hosted opulent socials for its members at the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art, the Searles Castle, and an island in Boston Harbor. The club also subsidizes restaurant meals, outings, and concert tickets for their membership.
In HCCG’s 2020 public tax filings, the club disclosed almost $150,000 in spending on “student networking” alone.
Merchandise — for example, free North Face jackets offered to HUCBE members this year — is also a popular way to reward members for their time while cultivating a unified club image.
“I totally understand how the gift can be construed in a certain way,” Dang said of the decision to provide premium apparel. “At the time, in my judgment, just giving members a lump sum of cash wasn’t really accomplishing anything.”
Some clubs with particularly robust cash flows have opted to provide financial assistance to certain students in the form of cash payments, programs that are designed to allow financially constrained club members to dedicate time that would otherwise have to be spent at a job.
The Crimson’s financial aid program provides as much as $1,500 per semester to qualifying students, sometimes through the Federal Work Study Program.
HCCG describes a similar “scholarship” program on their website to compensate qualifying students, as does HUCBE. In 2019, HCCG provided $31,500 to 33 individuals, according to public tax filings.
Though these programs enable certain students to access otherwise inaccessible opportunities, some students say they can create an incentive to choose and stick with certain clubs out of financial necessity rather than genuine passion.
“Low-income students, if their options are work or a student organization that pays, they probably are going to choose the student organization that pays. I don’t think there are a ton of choices,” said Joseph W. Hernandez ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, on the club’s financial aid program.
“I do think that pushes more students towards those specific organizations, even if there are some issues within those organizations,” he added.
Some clubs also have employees, including HDC. The DSO appointed Arthur Joseph “Tripp” Rebrovick III ’09 as the club’s coach, yet his salary remains a product of Harvard Debate Incorporated’s revenue. Rebrovick earned $50,000 in fiscal year 2020, per tax filings.
Harvard Student Agencies — a student-run nonprofit which operates more than a dozen business lines across campus, including tours, merchandise shops, and tutoring — has nine permanent staff members who help operate the business. HSA raked in roughly $3.3 million in tax year 2019, with cash and investment assets totaling more than $2 million in value.
Some of Harvard’s organizations also apply their excess funds to philanthropic ends.
In the past year, HUCBE launched a program to allocate $30,000 scholarships to 10 underprivileged students in the Boston area.
Recently, the organization also donated $17,000 to both the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and the Jimmy Fund at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in honor of its late president, Arda Cataltepe ’23, who died in November. In addition, the organization donated $40,000 across nonprofits in Turkey and Syria to assist in providing relief following devastating earthquakes earlier this year.
HCCG also declared more than $7,000 in charitable donations in 2019, its most recent public filing.
HDC’s “Diversity Project” recruits and trains Black students in Atlanta to participate in a Harvard summer debate program. According to 2020 tax filings, HDC provided almost $130,000 in scholarships to 40 students for the program.
Beyond donating to other nonprofits or relief causes, some of Harvard’s clubs also receive donations and find financial support in robust alumni giving networks.
In 2020, public tax records show that both the Lampoon and The Crimson’s trusts for donations each held approximately $7.5 million.
Like companies, several of Harvard’s wealthy student organizations hire accountants and perform yearly independent audits — a requirement for nonprofits that generate more than $200,000 annually.
Still, off-mission spending — or even theft — of funds has affected Harvard organizations throughout their existence.
In 1975, The Crimson reported that an external audit had identified “improper management” by Harvard Model United Nations, when members of the club spent thousands of dollars on extravagant meals, hotels, and liquor.
The Crimson reported in 1994 that two student executives had stolen thousands of dollars from the yearbook, less than a year after a former business manager of the Harvard Krokodiloes improperly spent $3,000 of club money on personal items, such as clothing from The Gap.
Eight years later, two Harvard undergraduates pleaded guilty to embezzling almost $100,000 from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a collegiate theater company.
And last year, a Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services audit of Harvard’s now-defunct student government structure, the Undergraduate Council, reported a “risk of errors, overspending, and misuse of funds” and a “risk that funds are awarded for inappropriate purposes.” The audit, which was obtained by The Crimson, did not identify specific instances of mismanagement.
Time and time again, College administrators have reaffirmed their commitment to student organizations’ independence, even when its guidelines and best practices are disregarded.
Some DSO regulations have even been eased, such as a previous requirement that student organizations submit yearly financial reports.
Even as Harvard refrains from monitoring and influencing the finances of its student organizations, it seems administrators remain aware that clubs’ actions can reflect back on the University’s reputation.
A DSO resource guide for student organizations implies that debt can be taken on by clubs, but it may present a reputational risk to Harvard.
“Faculty, staff, graduate advisors, or trustees have no legal responsibility for undergraduate organization debts,” the resource guide reads. “However, debts incurred by undergraduates should always be a matter of concern to advisors or trustees, since debts reflect on the good name of the organization and ultimately of Harvard College.”
In February, the school renewed efforts to enforce restrictions on clubs’ use of Harvard trademarks in their names and promotional materials, requiring that clubs formed after 1998 include the words “college” and “student” or “undergraduate” in their branding.
Still, some campus organizations continue to operate under their original names, sidestepping regulations. On Instagram, HCCG posts under the username “@harvardconsulting.”
HCCG did not respond to a request for comment.
While HUCBE Director of Finance Justin Xu ’25 said he feels the naming policy is “arbitrary,” he said it might be more productive to offer “more guidance” to students on legal structures and potential governance required for their organizations.
In an emailed statement, Palumbo — the College spokesperson — stressed that restrictions of club branding are imposed by the University’s Trademark Office.
“The DSO is a partner of the Harvard University Trademark Office, where the policy sits, and the DSO works with student organizations to come into compliance with University policy,” he wrote.
Outside of immediate oversight, Dang said access to further financial resources or advisers could benefit student organizations.
“I appreciate that they don’t directly oversee and police what you can and can’t do, but I think it’d be great if there was someone who had the skills of our personal auditor or accountant, but maybe he or she was just a general resource for Harvard orgs,” Dang said. “I think it would be great.”
But without this information being readily accessible, Dang said he fears students risk making consequential financial mistakes despite a lack of “malicious intent.”
“I appreciate the process that they’re doing — gathering more information while still trying to stick to the core belief of letting students in organizations run themselves,” Dang said of the DSO.
“It could be a fine line,” he added.

At the tail end of finals week in December 2022, as Harvard students packed up to scatter across the globe for winter vacation, the University dropped a surprise announcement: Claudine Gay, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, had been chosen to become Harvard’s next president.
Her selection prompted jubilant celebration from administrators, who gathered in the Smith Campus Center for the announcement. Observers noted the historic nature of her appointment as Harvard’s first Black president. Colleagues regaled her with praise of her leadership and scholarship.
After the celebrations, however, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — Harvard’s largest academic school — geared up to face its next big challenge: replacing its leader.
As dean, Gay has overseen several monumental developments within the FAS. The school reevaluated its own structure, hired new ethnic studies faculty in response to years of advocacy, and opened a new billion-dollar instruction center in Allston. It was rocked by a pandemic, faced a serious challenge to its race-conscious admissions policies, and roiled by allegations of sexual harassment against several FAS professors.
And now, the captain of the ship would be leaving.
Typically, The Crimson interviews top Harvard administrators once a month during the academic year on a range of topics. But Gay, occupied by her duties as dean and preparations for her new role, did not agree to regular sit-down interviews with The Crimson for the spring 2023 semester. Nor did she give interviews to any other independent media outlet, save for an end-of-semester interview with the Harvard Magazine, an alumni publication.
That changed on Friday, when Gay sat down for her final interview with The Crimson as FAS dean. As she readies to assume her new post in Massachusetts Hall on July 1, she reflected on her eventful five-year tenure as FAS dean and shared her hopes for the future of the institution.
In interviews this semester about the search for a new FAS dean, faculty were divided over whether the attention and financial support of FAS leadership should be directed toward STEM or to the arts and humanities.
Gay said these discussions among the faculty “​​really speak to the enormous ambition” of her FAS colleagues.
She felt that the school’s increased focus in quantum engineering, climate research, and ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration were major accomplishments of her tenure.
The past few years have seen an increased investment in University science, notably reflected in multimillion-dollar gifts for the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence and the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.
Within the FAS, Gay oversaw the launch of the Science and Engineering Complex, a landmark development on the Allston campus for STEM research and education with a $1 billion price tag. The institution also recently scaled up its investment in quantum science, including the launch of one of the world’s first Ph.D. programs in the subject.
Gay stressed the “value of practical benefits of a liberal arts and sciences education” to Harvard’s academic mission in the interview.
She also argued for the importance of embracing approaches that crossed disciplinary boundaries.
“There are very few, if any — certainly can’t name one — societal challenges, where one discipline has a monopoly on insight. Virtually everything that our society confronts requires multidisciplinary perspectives and expertise,” Gay said.
Gay also mentioned the FAS strategic planning process, a three-year internal evaluation of the FAS’ academics, budget, and technology launched nearly two years ago.
She said faculty would hear initial recommendations from the strategic planning process and have an opportunity to “make some choices about how we want to move forward as a school community” at an all-faculty retreat in August.
One of the defining events of Gay’s last semester as dean was the announcement of a $300 million unrestricted gift from hedge fund CEO and Republican megadonor Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 to the FAS. The donation was accompanied by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences being renamed in Griffin’s honor.
Gay thanked Griffin for his generosity.
“I have nothing but gratitude for this gift,” Gay said. “Really, my mind is focused on how do we realize the full promise of this gift which, because it’s an unrestricted gift to the FAS, enables us to really advance and support our academic core.”
In an interview with The Crimson last week, Penny S. Pritzker ’81, the senior fellow of Harvard’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation, said the negotiations for Griffin’s donation took place before she joined the Corporation. Gay was tapped as FAS dean two months after Pritzker joined the Corporation.
Gay declined to provide details about the negotiation process for the gift or her involvement in it.
The donation garnered criticism from GSAS students and former GSAS Dean Theda R. Skocpol, who slammed Griffin’s public support for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
In an interview with The Crimson last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended the donation, arguing that Harvard should not have political litmus tests for its donors.
Though Griffin’s funds are unrestricted and Harvard has yet to announce how they will be allocated, many GSAS affiliates have called for a portion of the donation to be spent directly on graduate education and pay.
Gay declined to comment on any specific use of the funds, saying she was “really not in a position to provide you a line item accounting of this.” She added that graduate education is one priority for the FAS.
This summer, the Supreme Court is widely expected to rule against Harvard in the lawsuit against the school brought by anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions. Such a ruling could overturn years of precedent and make race-based admissions policies unconstitutional. The decision is expected to come around when Gay would start her term as president.
In her interview, Gay reiterated her hope that the Court would rule in Harvard’s favor, stressing the importance of diversity among the student body.
“We will comply with the Court’s decision,” Gay said. “But we’ll also remain committed, as we have been for generations now, in the educational value of bringing diverse learners together in one community.”
“That’s something that we believe to our core, it’s part of our DNA,” she added.
She declined to answer whether there were plans in place in case the Court ruled against Harvard or say whether she has spoken with other University leaders about contingency plans.
“It would be premature, and cavalier, and an utter act of hubris to try to predict what the Court will do,” she said.
The SFFA case has also prompted scrutiny of Harvard’s practice of giving preference to legacy applicants, with many calling for the University to abolish legacy admission altogether.
Gay declined to answer how she would consider calls to abolish legacy admission as president.
After five decades of advocacy from students and alumni demanding a concentration in ethnic studies, Gay took the step in 2019 of announcing a cluster hire of three to four ethnic studies faculty. Last year, the FAS finalized the cluster hire, announcing that Taeku Lee, Erika Lee, and Jesse E. Hoffnung-Garskof ’93 would join Harvard’s faculty as full professors.
But advocates for ethnic studies are still demanding more from the FAS. During the inaugural Ethnic Studies Week in April, many advocates reiterated demands for a dedicated ethnic studies department, which Harvard lacks.
Gay said that despite the hiring of the three faculty, there was progress to be made in the field. She said she hoped to “build out the cohort” of ethnic studies faculty and foster “intellectual synergies” among existing faculty across the departments whose work concerns ethnicity and race.
“There’s already an emerging critical mass,” she said.
Gay has previously endorsed a concentration for ethnic studies but deferred to the faculty themselves to decide what form ethnic studies at Harvard should take.
During Gay’s tenure as dean, another landmark step the University took to further study and understand race was releasing the landmark Legacy of Slavery report, which documented the integral role that slavery played in Harvard’s growth.
Gay said that along with some symposiums organized in the FAS, she is focused on expanding Harvard’s collaboration with historically Black colleges and universities, another recommendation of the report.
Pointing to former College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, a professor in the History of Science Department who spent the past year working at Spelman College, Gay said that other faculty are “arranging to also have that kind of exchange,” and that she will be looking at similar initiatives for students.
“But those conversations are really still quite early,” Gay said. “But the ambition — and it’s one that I feel particularly passionate about — is just finding more ways for us to just be in conversation with our HBCU peers, sharing knowledge and educational opportunities and research opportunities in ways that really enhance all of our institutions.”
Two years into Gay’s tenure, The Crimson published an investigation uncovering numerous allegations of sexual harassment by three top professors in Harvard’s Anthropology Department: Theodore C. Bestor, Gary Urton, and John L. Comaroff.
In June 2021, Gay stripped Urton of his emeritus status and banned him from Harvard’s campus. Bestor — who stepped down as the director of Harvard’s Reischauer Institute following an FAS investigation — died in July 2021. Gay put Comaroff on unpaid leave following an FAS investigation, but he returned to teaching in the fall 2022 semester, sparking protests.
In the spring 2023 semester, students staged a walkout, a march, an email campaign, and a sit-in of University Hall protesting Comaroff’s presence on campus. Comaroff has consistently denied all allegations of misconduct.
Gay said institutions of higher education are all working to amend their policies to better cultivate “a community where all members can thrive and do their best work.”
“This is an area that I would agree represents unfinished business. But it’s one where I actually feel really hopeful, because I’ve been part of Harvard for a while, and I feel like I actually have seen a culture change around just the elevation and importance of building a culture of mutual respect,” Gay said.
Gay also pointed to a new University-wide bullying policy unveiled in March as a sign of progress made under her deanship.
“That’s going to require work in every school to adjust our processes and our various offices to support effective implementation” of the University’s new anti-bullying policies Gay said, adding that she worked with deans of other Harvard schools to create the policies.
Affiliates of Harvard’s Earth and Planetary Sciences Department have called for bullying and harassment policies to be strengthened after an investigation by The Crimson detailed decades of bullying and workplace toxicity allegations against Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor Daniel P. Schrag.
According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, affiliates had opportunities to provide feedback on the draft anti-bullying policies during a comment period from April 2022 to the end of September 2022. He has declined to comment on other aspects of the EPS affiliates’ demands.
Gay will be vacating her current position and ascending to the presidency on July 1, but declined to promise a successor would be in place by that date, saying that she is “not setting any kind of artificial timetable” for the process.
The search launched in February with the creation of a 14-person search advisory committee.
“While I recognize that the sooner the better for me personally, my focus really is on identifying the right person, so I don’t have a calendar in mind,” she added.
Gay would not say if there would be an interim dean as the search continues. The last time the FAS had an interim leader was in 2006.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who is co-leading the search for the next dean with Gay, previously said in an interview with The Crimson that an announcement for Gay’s successor is not “imminent.”
Along with finding her own successor, Gay will also have to appoint deans for the School of Public Health, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Divinity School. Gay appointed an interim for the HSPH dean, and Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton announced he will be extending his time in the position by a few months, but neither position has been permanently filled.
When asked what advice she would have for her successor, Gay gave three pieces of advice: to listen to students, faculty, and staff, to “pace yourself,” and to engage with other parts of the University.
“This is a big place. It’s an ambitious place. There’s so much that you can do,” Gay said. “But it is a marathon.”

Billionaire and philanthropist David M. Rubenstein will step down from the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — at the end of June after six years on the board, top Harvard administrators announced Wednesday.
The Corporation instituted term limits as part of a sweeping set of reforms in 2010, but Rubenstein — who became a member of the board in 2017 — will step down with six years remaining on his term.
His departure from the Corporation comes as he is concluding the first year of his term as chair of the University of Chicago’s board of trustees.
Outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, and Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 thanked Rubenstein for his contributions to University in a joint email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday afternoon.
“We are deeply grateful to David for his leadership and service — to Harvard and to higher education more generally,” they wrote.
The search for Rubenstein’s replacement on the Corporation will “begin soon,” they added.
Rubenstein joined the Corporation as one of the co-chairs of a University-wide capital campaign that hauled in a record-breaking $9.6 billion.
A co-founder and co-chairman of the private equity firm the Carlyle Group, Rubenstein served as a major donor to Harvard for years, making several multi-million donations to the Harvard Kennedy School.
Most recently, Rubenstein made a gift late last year to support the establishment of Harvard’s first University-wide conference center, which will also serve as a welcome area for its future Enterprise Research Campus in Allston. The conference center will bear his name as the David Rubenstein Treehouse.
Rubenstein, with decades of experience running a private equity firm, made the Corporation more financially savvy when he joined the board in 2017. His departure, however, comes as the University is gearing up for its next capital campaign.
During his tenure on the board, Rubenstein participated in two presidential searches, serving on the committees that selected Bacow in 2018 and Gay late last year.
In an article in the Harvard Gazette — a University-run news publication — Pritzker said that Rubenstein “brought a remarkable range of qualities and experience to the Corporation.”
“He is one of a kind,” Pritzker said. “We will miss his many contributions to the Corporation, but I’m confident that Harvard will continue to benefit from his perspective and counsel.”
Rubenstein told the Gazette that his time on the Corporation was a “wonderful and memorable chapter of my engagement with Harvard.”
“Working with this group of smart, dedicated colleagues to advance the university’s essential mission has been both an education and a pleasure,” Rubenstein said.
Despite his departure from the board, Rubenstein will remain involved with Harvard, according to the Gazette article. He will continue to serve as the founding chair of the Global Advisory Council, a group of prominent alumni who advise the University president about international engagements, and as chair of the Kennedy School Dean’s Executive Board.
“I look forward to continuing my relationship with Harvard in other ways, and to helping support the university’s work at the leading edge of research, education, and opportunity,” he said.

More Than 70 Harvard Students Call for Academy of Arts and Sciences to Review Comaroff’s Membership
Timothy R. Barakett ’87 will replace Paul J. Finnegan ’75 as the University’s treasurer beginning July 1, Harvard announced Wednesday afternoon.
Barakett, who became a member of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — in 2019, will remain a member of the Corporation and its committee on finance in his new role.
He will also become an ex officio member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, and continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of Harvard Management Company.
Finnegan is set to step down from the Corporation after the 2023-24 academic year as he reaches the end of his two six-year terms, but he will remain as chair of the HMC board of directors during his final year. Previously a member of the Board of Overseers and president of the Harvard Alumni Association, Finnegan stepped into the role of University treasurer in 2014.
In a University-wide statement, outgoing Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, and Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 praised Finnegan for his years on Harvard’s highest governing body.
“Paul has served Harvard with extraordinary commitment and effectiveness, including his role in helping the University navigate the financial challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” they wrote. “We look forward to opportunities to celebrate his outstanding service in the year to come.”
Bacow, Gay, and Pritzker also announced in the message that as Finnegan prepares to step down from his role in the Corporation next year, the University will soon begin a search for his successor.
A graduate of the College and Harvard Business School, Barakett co-chaired both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences fundraising committee and the committee on financial aid during the University’s most recent capital campaign, which raised a record-breaking $9.6 billion.
Barakett currently serves as chairman and CEO of TRB Advisors, a New York-based private investment company. He also founded and served as chairman and CEO of Atticus Capital, which was one of the world’s largest hedge funds in 2007.
In an article in the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication, Barakett applauded Finnegan for an “outstanding job as treasurer” and said he looked forward to helping “Harvard thrive in the years ahead.”
“He will be a tough act to follow, and I’m glad I’ll have another year of partnership with him on the Corporation,” he said. “I’m also excited at the prospect of taking on my new role alongside a new president.”
Finnegan, also a graduate of HBS, is co-founder and chairman of the Chicago-based investment firm Madison Dearborn Partners.
Like Barakett, Finnegan served in leadership positions during the University’s most recent capital campaign, co-chairing the planning committee and the executive committee for The Harvard Campaign. He has also served on various councils and advisory boards at the University.
On the Corporation, Finnegan participated in two presidential searches and served as chair of the Harvard Management Company. In his capacity as HMC chair, Finnegan led the search that culminated in the selection of current HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar and oversaw major changes to HMC’s investment strategies.
Finnegan also praised Barakett in the Harvard Gazette for his “financial expertise, deep knowledge of Harvard, sound judgment, and a collegial, collaborative approach.”
“Tim Barakett will do an excellent job as Harvard’s new treasurer,” Finnegan said.
Finnegan said his time as treasurer was a “genuinely fulfilling experience.”
“I’m looking forward not only to helping Tim in whatever ways I can during my final year on the Corporation, but also to supporting our terrific new president, Claudine Gay, as she moves to Massachusetts Hall,” he said.
Correction: May 24, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Paul J. Finnegan is the co-CEO of Madison Dearborn Partners. In fact, Finnegan is the chairman.

At Harvard Class Day 2023, Comedian Larry Wilmore Calls on Graduating Seniors to Pursue Their Passions

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Emmy Award-winning television writer and comedian Larry Wilmore addressed the Harvard College Class of 2023 Wednesday, encouraging students to view success as a journey rather than a destination.
Class Day, which traditionally occurs the day before Commencement, celebrates the accomplishments and identity of the graduating senior class. This year’s installation included orations from students, addresses from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and incoming Harvard Alumni Association President Tracy “Ty” Moore II ’06, and a keynote speech from Wilmore, who was selected by the senior Class Committee.
Wilmore’s writing credits include the television shows “In Living Color,” “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” and “Black-ish.” He is also known for serving as the “Senior Black Correspondent” on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” and creating the sitcom “The Bernie Mac Show.”
On Wednesday, Wilmore reflected in his speech on his childhood job selling books door-to-door and how he developed a vision for the meaning of success in his life.
“Sometimes people ask me, when did I consider myself a success, and I tell them, ‘The minute I decided to follow my life’s passion,” Wilmore said. “Success wasn’t a destination. It was a journey.”
Wilmore also offered three pieces of “pseudowisdom” to the graduating seniors, or phrases to use as they go forth in their lives: “It is what it is,” “Do what you gotta do,” and “Play better.”
“It’s for when you’re trying to take it to the next level or see some kind of improvement in your life, or you’re just unsatisfied with where you’re headed: ‘Play better,’” Wilmore said of his third “pearl” of wisdom.
Wilmore concluded his speech with a call for graduating seniors to pursue their passions in the face of hesitancy.
“One of the biggest obstacles you’ll face in the years ahead is fear,” Wilmore said. “Fear can be so destructive in our lives. On a global scale, fear is at the root of war. It’s at the root of hatred, of bigotry, of division, and some of the ugliest human movements.”
“I want you to be fearless in your lives. I want you to do the things you never imagined you could do,” he added.
Preceding Wilmore’s speech, Khurana gave an address where he highlighted his philosophy on serendipity.
“It’s one of the endearing charms of Harvard, that its elaborate structure of campus life invites the impromptu conversations on the shuttle bus that lead to a new interest, a thesis topic unveiling itself in the midst of a dining hall conversation, a friend for life discovered because you were late for class and sat in a different seat,” Khurana said.
Class Committee First Marshal Athena Q. Ye ’23 delivered opening remarks, which discussed ways that the class adapted to hurdles created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the importance of establishing connections with others at Harvard.
“As we burst the Harvard bubble and enter into the real world, I challenge you all to continue tying knots to the people and communities you love the most,” Ye said. “These will be the relationships that make you the best person you can be.”
“I have a knot in my chest saying goodbye to you all this week,” she added.
Sterling M. Bland ’23 delivered the Harvard Oration — an original speech titled “What Were You Born to Do” — where he encouraged his classmates to discard the idea that specific people were “born to do great things.”
“It becomes too easy to believe the lie that we were somehow destined for greatness, while others were not,” Bland said. “It’s too easy to believe that somehow we’re exceptional. Don’t believe the lie.”
Ivy Orator Amelia M. Cossentino ’23 gave a humorous speech that poked fun at myriad aspects of Harvard’s campus culture — from partying at final clubs to entering careers in finance — and featured an impromptu selfie with Khurana.
“We have all experienced very different Harvards; some of us were Widener fiends, others Lamonsters. Some of us did improv, others had sex,” Costantino said. “Going forward, some of us will do finance, others will do finance, others will do finance.”
Class Committee Second Marshal Chibuike K. “Chibby” Uwakwe ’23 delivered the closing remarks, where he also invoked the class’ fortitude in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Witnessing our class’ resilience and fortitude during our time here has been both a privilege and an honor,” Uwakwe said.
During the ceremony, friends of Arda Cataltepe ’23 and Sergio A. Diaz ’23 — seniors who died during the fall semester — also took the stage to deliver words of remembrance.
Actor and filmmaker Tom Hanks is set to address the Class of 2023 on Thursday during the University’s 372nd Commencement exercises.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Ruth J. Simmons — a former president of Brown University and the first Black leader of an Ivy League institution — told the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Class of 2023 to “nourish and inspire generations of learners” during the school’s convocation ceremony Wednesday, one day before University-wide Commencement exercises.
Simmons’ keynote speech was preceded by opening remarks from HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long, several speeches from graduating students, and a faculty address delivered by HGSE lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93. Several HGSE faculty members also received awards for excellence in teaching.
Simmons previously served as the president of three universities, most recently leading Prairie View A&M University until she unexpectedly resigned from the role in late February. She will begin a new part-time role at Harvard on June 1 as a senior adviser to the president of Harvard on engagement with historically Black colleges and universities.
Facing an audience of graduates and their loved ones, Simmons stressed the importance of educators in a world where education is coming increasingly under attack.
“Educators are now frontline workers with the task of not merely providing a service but the duty to bring to the world a vision of what is possible, even when signposts read, ‘Danger ahead, do not proceed,’” she said.
With school shootings on the rise and an increase in political attacks on educational curricula, Simmons also said students themselves are increasingly anxious about the future.
“What new tragedy they must ask will arise tomorrow to unsettle further their future? What old hatreds will reemerge, slamming shut doors that heretofore stood ajar?” she said. “More and more often, it seems such doubts are the ever-present companions for students from the time they start school until they graduate from college.”
Simmons said educators will have to contend with classrooms of students who question whether there is any hope for the future.
“Fortunately, you will be called on to provide that hope to those who face ever-present doubts as they attempt to focus on doing their best,” she said.
Simmons recounted the importance of education in her experience growing up during the 1940s in the Jim Crow South, when “unknowing demagogues ordered that every person of my ilk should be relegated to limited education and achievement.”
“I was born at a time of darkness and limitations,” she said. “Enlightened individuals resisted the calls for permanent enslavement of our minds, and aspirations. And with the help of educators, I was able to have access not only to learning — not only to learn, but to hope in the future.”
Simmons praised the graduating class for their choice of profession and urged them to take an “oath of office” to “exemplify and defend the bedrock values of education, truth, open-mindedness, independence and rigor of thought, and a commitment to the advancement of society.”
“If you accept these values — and, more importantly, if you live up to them — you will forever be hopeful, forever strong in your views of what matters and forever, forever able to heal this nation,” Simmons said.
Closing out both her speech and the HGSE Class of 2023’s convocation ceremony, Simmons reminded the graduates that they, as educators, have the “capacity to shape the future.”
“By embracing education, you’re clutching the lifeline to a sane and sensible future for our children,” she said.
“Yours is a calling above all others,” she said. “Thank you for embracing this magnificent profession.”

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
The value of Harvard Management Company’s direct public investments increased by 18 percent during the first quarter of 2023 as key tech stocks in its portfolio rallied.
HMC, responsible for managing Harvard’s $50.9 billion endowment, saw the value of its direct stock holdings rise to nearly $952 million in the first quarter of 2023 — which ended March 31 — up from $806 million at the end of 2022.
The increase was primarily due to significant gains in HMC’s tech investments, including Meta Platforms — formerly known as Facebook — which saw its stock price rise by more than 76 percent in the first three months of 2023.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and chief investment officer at Beacon Trust, wrote in an email that the growth in HMC’s direct stock holdings mirrors the performance of other investment portfolios during the first quarter.
“The S&P 500 increased 7.5% in Q1, so most diversified equity portfolios rose over the reporting period,” Longo wrote.
As of December 2022, HMC’s holdings in Meta totaled $136 million, representing more than 16 percent of its stock portfolio. By the end of the first quarter in 2023, the company’s Meta stocks were worth more than $240 million — more than a quarter of the value of HMC’s direct public investments.
Longo also wrote in an email that Meta’s stock “has been one of the best performers YTD in 2023.”
“The firm has embraced cost-cutting as well as growth in AI, while seeming to scale back its investments a bit in the metaverse,” Longo said. “Investors seem to like this shift in strategy.”
Other tech stocks held by HMC also rallied. In the first quarter of 2023, HMC’s NVIDIA holdings rose in value from $9.6 million to $18.4 million, an increase of 91 percent. The company’s investments in Alphabet, the parent company of Google, grew from $212 million to $250 million, an 18 percent increase.
Consistent with previous quarters, HMC’s tech stocks comprised the largest share of its direct public holdings, with Alphabet maintaining the top spot from the previous quarter. Following its rally in the first quarter, Meta moved up to HMC’s second-largest position — a spot held by Scientific Games in the previous quarter.
HMC also drastically cut its investments in the California-based biotechnology companies Revolution Medicines and Pliant Therapeutics during the first quarter, slashing its positions by 53 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Pliant Therapeutics has experienced steady declines in recent months, while Revolution Medicines has been recovering from a steep decline earlier this year.
Additionally, HMC invested in UiPath, Pardes Biosciences, and El Pollo Loco in the Q1 of 2023, representing a wide diversity of industries from software to food and beverage. Collectively, these new investments represented just over 0.1 percent of HMC’s total stock holdings at the end of the first quarter.

Former President of Costa Rica Carlos Alvarado Quesada addressed the Harvard School of Public Health’s Class of 2023 at their convocation Wednesday, encouraging graduates to “do what you love, love what you do.”
Outgoing HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams, who has led the school since 2016, shared words with the graduates before Alvarado took the stage. The event also featured speeches from student speaker Hailey Hernandez, a master’s degree graduate, and Trishan Panch, president of the HSPH Alumni Association.
During his keynote speech, Alvarado — who served as the 48th president of Costa Rica — sought to reassure students who had doubts about politicians’ willingness to follow scientific guidance over other agendas.
“Considering that reality, can we remain hopeful about the path ahead of us?” Alvarado asked. “My categorical answer is ‘Yes.’”
“Tools such as science, knowledge, and service are not the ones failing us,” he said. “It is the human character that has been put to the test and the one that fails or rises to the occasion.”
Alvarado said he was “hopeful” that the graduating class possessed the character to face the world’s challenges.
“Now is the time to go out there and unleash those abilities and potential, to show your character and capacity for empathy and come up with new ways to bring about change in the world,” Alvarado said.
“Be good. Do good,” he said.
Alvarado also touted the accomplishments of his own presidency, highlighting Costa Rica’s decarbonization efforts, which he called a “key driver” for protecting air and water quality.
Following the featured speakers, the graduating class received their degrees. Doctorate graduates ascended the stage in red robes to be draped in their newly earned graduation hoods, while master’s graduates arrived at the ceremony with crimson hoods already fixed to their black robes.
Addressing a sea of graduates and their loved ones seated inside an indoor track for the ceremony, Williams praised the HSPH Class of 2023 for having “chosen a worthy profession.”
“Your courage, your commitment, and your capacity to create a healthier and more resilient society has never mattered more,” Williams said. “You are poised to take this moment and turn it into a movement that embraces health as a human right.”
Williams also pointed to the difficult task that faces public health graduates as they are “running towards the challenges” in a world still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
“I know that the world is challenged and fraught — and some would even say perilous — but you all are a force for good. I know that you will push back injustice,” Williams said. “I know that you will bring hope.”
“In an enduring sense, this is your time,” she said. “This is your world, for better or for worse.”

Reviving the Past: The Attic Brings 70s Fashion Back to Harvard Square
Harvard student groups hosted affinity celebrations for graduating students across the University on Monday and Tuesday, bringing together students of shared identity as part of this year’s Commencement festivities.
The affinity graduations — which included ceremonies for Arab, Black, LGBTQ+, and first-generation, low-income students — were organized with support from Harvard’s Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. The University also hosted the school’s inaugural affinity group graduation ceremony for graduates with disabilities Monday morning.
On Monday, FGLI graduates gathered for a ceremony that kicked off with a performance by the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, a student a capella group. The event featured a faculty address from Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Nancy E. Hill, a keynote speech by endocrinologist Stanley Andrisse, and a student address from graduating HGSE student Alex M. Murillo.
In his speech, Andrisse discussed his journey from being sentenced to 10 years in prison to becoming a doctor and assistant professor.
“Education was my game changer,” Andrisse said. “As first-generation graduates, you have the power to inspire and pave the way for future generations in your families and your communities, to inspire them to use education as this game-changing transformative tool.”
Murillo recognized the sacrifices made by friends and family to enable her success.
“We have triumphed over the limitations and obstacles of the system that was never designed with us in mind,” Murillo said. “In doing so we have paved the way for those who will come after us, leaving an indelible mark on the path to progress.”
An affinity celebration in Sever Quad on Monday brought together Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Desi American graduates. The ceremony began with an Apsara dance performance by the Angkor Dance Troupe, a Cambodian performing arts group based in Lowell, Massachusetts.
The event also featured addresses from Alexander L. Chen, founding director of Harvard Law School’s LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic; graduating Harvard Divinity School student Jennifer Sun-Fay Louie; and Coalition for a Diverse Harvard co-founder and former Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance president Jeannie Park ’83 — the ceremony’s keynote speaker.
During her address, Park spoke about how she “became an Asian American” during her time at the College, calling it the “one thing I did right at Harvard.”
“Coming here from my white suburban Ohio hometown was like reaching a lush oasis,” she said. “While studying Asian-American texts for the first time, I was jolted by seeing my life experience reflected in scholarship and by a new understanding of systemic injustice.”
After the ceremony concluded, Chen, Park, and members of Coalition for a Diverse Harvard posed with attendees for a photo, holding up signs that called on the Supreme Court to protect affirmative action.
Native American graduates came together for a celebration on Monday with an opening address by Brandon N. McIntire ’21, program coordinator of the Harvard University Native American Program. McIntire’s remarks were followed by student speakers Amy E. Chalan ’23 and graduating Harvard Kennedy School student Joy M. Lacanienta.
On Tuesday, Black graduates celebrated their accomplishments at an affinity celebration. Graduating Harvard Business School student Jourdan M. Henry delivered the student address. HKS visiting fellow George “Chip” Greenidge and civil rights activist DeRay McKesson also gave speeches.
The Lavender Celebration, which honors LGBTQ+ graduates, took place on Tuesday afternoon at Harvard Divinity School. The event featured several speakers and performances, including a performance by drag queens Destiny and Chanel, a keynote speech by Schuyler M. Bailar ’19, and a student address by graduating HBS student Sapan Shah.
Later in the afternoon, Arab graduates gathered for a ceremony in Memorial Church — the first official University-wide affinity celebration of its kind. The event featured addresses from Harvard Arab Students Association President and soon-to-be HKS graduate Yasmin A. Kayali, Harvard Society for Arab Students President Sam M. Saba ’23, and Harvard Arab Alumni Association President and HKS graduate Luma Al Saleh.
At the graduation for Latinx students, graduating HGSE student Alejandra Ramos Gomez delivered the student address, HGSE professor Gabrielle Oliveira delivered the faculty address, and former Miss Dominican Republic Andreína Martinez Fournier gave a keynote speech.
“I want to remind you that it absolutely matters where you come from, because our countries, our communities, our families and our ancestors are where we draw our courage and determination from,” Martinez Fourier said.
“I look around and I see people that look like me, people that look like my family, people that look like my friends,” she added. “You make it very clear today that people like us don’t just go to Harvard — we graduate from Harvard.”

Reviving the Past: The Attic Brings 70s Fashion Back to Harvard Square
Harvard Business School graduating students, affiliates, and families gathered on Baker Lawn Wednesday for the school’s class day ceremony, which featured an address from Wall Street executive Raymond J. McGuire ’79.
McGuire, a graduate of the Business School, the Law School, and the College, was named president of Lazard Asset Management in April 2023. Previously, he served as Global Head of Corporate and Investment Banking at Citigroup. McGuire also ran as a candidate for the Democratic nominee for the New York mayoral race, but he fell short in the 2021 primary.
Entering the stage to the sounds of “Started From the Bottom” by Drake, McGuire began his speech by recognizing his family and friends in the audience, including Clarence Jones — Martin Luther King Jr.’s lawyer, speechwriter, and counsel.
“Looking into this gavel reminds me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald would say, of my younger and more vulnerable days,” McGuire said. “If someone asks me how it is that I made it here. And I tell them, the four P’s: prayer — because this has been a walk of faith — preparation, performance, and paranoia.”
McGuire said he was raised by a single mother and his grandparents who encouraged him to pursue his education because they knew “only the educated are free.”
“As an undergrad I majored in what would inform life on Wall Street — not Economics or Math,” McGuire said. “I concentrated in English and American Literature.”
“See, if you want to learn about leadership and organizational behavior, read Macbeth,” he added. “If you want to learn about the streets — cheating, decision making — read Hamlet. If you want to learn about estate planning, read Lear.”
Upon graduating and beginning a career in finance, McGuire said he had few role models who looked like him.
“Each step of the way, I encountered every imaginable obstacle: embarrassment, classism, and racism,” he said. “I once had a boss that ignored me — didn’t talk to me for six months — never quite understood what was behind being ghosted.”
“While I was lonely, I had not only to endure, but I had to prevail,” McGuire added. “I had no plan B. If I hadn’t performed, the majority would have said, ‘I told you so.’ Forty years later, the record shows that I have competed amongst the best.”
McGuire urged graduates to “make the most” of their opportunity.
“The world you’re in is facing unprecedented uncertainty, and with that comes unprecedented opportunity to make a difference,” he said.
The event included opening remarks from 2023 HBS Student Association Co-Presidents Zoe Matthew and Sebastián E. Negrón-Reichard, followed by student speaker Adán C. Acevedo ’13.
Matthew and Negrón-Reichard said the graduating class demonstrated their resilience by enrolling at HBS amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Perhaps, that is our legacy,” Matthew said. “A generation of leaders who is uniquely prepared to ride the roller coaster of life. Collectively, we have witnessed the heights of success and the depths of adversity.”
Acevedo said his parents were forced to flee their home country during the Salvadorian Civil War, and they immigrated to the United States without speaking the language.
“In the United States, my mother was a housekeeper in the Hollywood Hills, and my father worked on the factory floor of an airplane break company,” Acevedo said. “They are exactly the kind of individuals that I implore you to support and have compassion for in your daily lives.”
Acevedo said the world needs more “leaders with a conscience and a penchant for doing good” rather than “CEOs that know what to say.”
“We are meant to be global opportunity creators, global innovators, and global amplifiers for the greatness of those around us,” he said. “We are meant to not just contribute to the social and economic structures of society, but to change and challenge them to improve and reimagine them until they reflect our highest dreams and aspirations.”

Ban Ki-moon, who served as secretary-general of the United Nations between 2007 and 2016, slammed the Russian invasion of Ukraine and called on Harvard Kennedy School graduates to take action on the climate crisis during the school’s graduation address Wednesday afternoon.
Ban, himself an HKS alum, was introduced by HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf as someone who has “demonstrated a commitment to public service, the same commitment we see in our graduating students who plan to serve their communities, their countries, and our shared world in a wide variety of ways.”
“Indeed, through his lifetime of public service, Secretary-General Ban is an admirable example for anyone seeking to become a principled and effective policymaker and public leader,” Elmendorf said.
Ban said that meeting President John F. Kennedy ’40, a former Crimson editor, during a trip to the White House as a teenager inspired him to pursue public service.
He said when he came to HKS as a student, he told people his name, too, was “JFK” — “Just From Korea,” he clarified, to laughter and applause.
During his address, which lasted just shy of 30 minutes, Ban focused on the Russia-Ukraine war, saying that the Russian invasion of Ukraine “flagrantly violated the rule of international law that has been maintained since the end of the Second World War, and it has paralyzed the United Nations Security Council and its ability to respond.”
“I am deeply concerned and disappointed that many countries around the world have been keeping silent,” Ban continued. “Neutrality is not an option. You must speak out against this injustice.”
Ban said that he and former Colombian president and 2016 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Juan Manuel Santos, who was sitting in the second row and has a son graduating from HKS this year, visited Ukraine last summer to witness the impact of the war.
“We saw firsthand the terrible, unacceptable atrocities committed there,” Ban said.
Ban told the crowd of graduating HKS students and their families to pursue an ethic of global citizenship as an antidote to the aggression of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“A grave consequence of Putin’s reckless and passionate push to resurrect Russia’s past glory, in the absence of compassion, is the current brutal war in Ukraine,” Ban said.
Global citizens, Ban said, “care and collaborate beyond national borders” and are “compassionate and tolerant of other people and other cultures.”
“To be a global citizen and leverage the power of compassion is a significant step as an individual to create a brighter future for all of humanity and our planet,” he said.
“Justice will prevail. If not today, tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then surely in the near future,” Ban said.
The former secretary general ended his speech by stressing the urgency of the climate crisis, which he called an “impending existential threat.”
“The fact of the matter is that today’s world leaders have thus far failed miserably by putting selfish national interests ahead of urgent global needs,” Ban said.
He encouraged HKS graduates in the audience to “challenge” their political leaders to take action on climate change.
“The world leaders must muster the necessary political will,” Ban said. “The developed countries should fulfill their promise of $100 billion per year in climate finance, and all the countries — especially those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change — have access to the resources and technologies to adapt.”
“Please remember that you have benefitted immensely, and you should be ready to return those benefits to others,” he continued.
Ban called the challenge to realize a sustainable future “our moral responsibility.”
“The challenges we are facing now — simply unprecedented. So, our response must be equally unprecedented,” he said.

Reviving the Past: The Attic Brings 70s Fashion Back to Harvard Square
Harvard alumni elected five new members to the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, the University announced Thursday morning.
The newly-elected Overseers included Sylvia M. Burwell ’87, the president of American University; Jeffrey D. Dunn ’77, the interim president and CEO of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for European and Russian affairs; Vanessa W. Liu ’96, a former Harvard Alumni Association president and tech entrepreneur; and Robert L. Satcher Jr., an associate professor at the University of Texas and former astronaut.
All five members were elected for full six-year terms on the board.
Low voter turnout continued to plague the election, with a participation rate of less than 8.11 percent. More than 400,000 Harvard degree-holders were eligible to vote, but just 32,440 ballots were cast in the Overseers election.
Three of the five Overseers were previously endorsed by the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an advocacy group that seeks to increase diversity and promote equity at the University.
Harvard Forward, a student and alumni campaign that promotes climate action and increased transparency on the University’s governing boards, did not put forward any candidates for the second straight year.
Three Harvard Forward-backed candidates won election to the board in 2020 and another in 2021, all of whom qualified for the ballot through the petition process. After reforms to the Board of Overseers in fall 2020, only six members who joined the ballot via petition may sit on the board at any given time.
In an article announcing the results of the election published in the Harvard Gazette, a University-run news publication, incoming Board of Overseers President Meredith L. “Max” Hodges ’03 said it “will be an exciting year ahead.”
“All of us on the Board of Overseers look forward to welcoming President Gay and supporting her in her new role,” Hodges said. “We warmly welcome our five newest Overseers, and I know we will benefit from their perspectives and experiences in the coming years.”
The Harvard Alumni Association will also see six new elected directors: Barbara R. Barreno-Paschall ’07, vice chair and commissioner of the Illinois Human Rights Commission; Judith L. Norsigian ’70, former executive director of Our Bodies Ourselves; Yvonne O. Osirim ’01, executive director of human health ethics and compliance at Merck; Theodora Skeadas ’12, a public policy associate at Twitter; Angela A. Sun ’96, a board director of Western Union, Cushman & Wakefield, and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital; and Jason W. Young ’04, managing partner at Totally Human.
Chosen from a pool of nine candidates, the new HAA elected directors will each serve three-year terms. Harvard alumni cast 33,565 ballots in the directors election. Consistent with recent years,  Harvard degree-holders cast more votes in the directors election than in the Board of Overseers election.
Incoming HAA president Ty Moore ’06 told the Harvard Gazette that he was “thrilled to welcome these six newly elected alumni.”
“I know they all share a deep commitment to ensuring our dedicated, passionate alumni around the world forge new connections and are part of Harvard’s efforts to create positive change for our community and society at large,” he said.

In his final Commencement as University president before departing Massachusetts Hall at the end of June, Bacow said that he, like the Class of 2023, is “wondering what the future holds.”
Bacow said that his Harvard education raised his own expectations for himself.
“At my Commencement, I never imagined that someday I would be standing here giving the final remarks at your Commencement,” he said. “I hope — as you find your way through life — that you will have similarly pleasant surprises.”
Bacow concluded his speech by saying goodbye to Harvard.
“To the Class of 2023: thank you, farewell, and godspeed,” he said, returning to his perch in the Holyoke chair as the audience rose to their feet in applause.
The sheriff once again took the stage — this time to declare the meeting adjourned — as the Memorial Church bells tolled in the background. The Harvard University Band also struck up a festive tune as the recessional began.
With that, Harvard University’s 372nd Commencement exercises drew to a close.
Just as Hanks was about to rise for his speech, Garber interrupted with another “surprise” — a group of students from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals performing a 3-minute musical skit recapping Hanks’ filmography.
“Tom Hanks is like a box of chocolates,” the performers concluded, referencing “Forrest Gump,” the movie that helped Hanks win his second Oscar. “You never know what you’re gonna get.”
“Dr. Hanks, top that,” Bacow joked by way of introduction.
Clad in Harvard’s graduation regalia and boasting a new honorary Harvard degree, Hanks stepped up the podium to deliver his address to the graduating class.
“It’s not fair, but please don’t be embittered by this fact,” Hanks began. “That without having done a lick of work, without having spent any time in class, without once walking into that library — in order to have anything to do with the graduating class of Harvard, its faculty, or its distinguished alumni — I make a damn good living playing someone who did.”
“It’s the way of the world, kids,” he said.
Hanks poked fun at the student speeches that preceded his Commencement address.
“I don’t know much about Latin. I have no real passion for enzymes, and public global policy is something I scan on the newspaper just before I do the Wordle,” Hanks said, as audience members chuckled. “And yet here I am closing — closing for Josiah, Pallas, and Vic.”
Hanks called on graduates to not remain indifferent in the face of those seeking to spread “alternative facts” in an attempt to undermine the truth.
“Propaganda and bald-faced lies will erode over time,” Hanks said. “Idolatry and imagery lose luster and effect.”
“Ignorance and intolerance can be replaced by experience in the wink of an eye, but indifference will narrow the vision of America’s people and make dim the light of Lady Liberty’s symbolic torch,” he added.
Following the deans’ presentation of their degree candidates to the president, Corporation, and Board of Overseers, Bacow conferred six honorary doctorate degrees.
Garber introduced the first four candidates and Bacow announced their new degrees: Admiral Mark Mullen with a doctorate of laws, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Jennifer A. Doudna with a doctorate of science, radio executive Hugo N. Morales ’72 with a doctorate of humane letters, and historian David Levering Lewis with a doctorate of laws.
While introducing Lewis, Garber noted that Lewis was also celebrating his 87th birthday on Thursday. The thousands assembled in Harvard Yard serenaded Lewis with an abridged version of “Happy Birthday.”
Garber continued his introductions, with Bacow presenting biochemist Katalin Karikó with a doctorate of science and finally Commencement speaker and acclaimed actor Tom Hanks with a doctorate of arts.
“As the President of the United States said in presenting him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he ‘has always saved his best role for real life,’ earning ‘the best title you can have’ — ‘a good man,’” Garber said of Hanks. “Having him here makes this a beautiful day in our neighborhood.”
After Garber finished his lengthy introduction for Hanks, the crowd rose to its feet in a standing ovation for the actor affectionately known as “America’s dad.”
Bacow then invited Hanks to the lectern to deliver the Commencement address.
Bacow finished conferring degrees upon 9,110 graduates during the 372nd Commencement.
During the degree conferral portion of the ceremony, HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82 also congratulated his son who graduated from the College on Thursday.
“By virtue of the authority delegated to me as a parent, I wish to express my love and pride for my son, Nicholas E. Daley ’23, graduating today in the Harvard Class of 23,” he said, his voice uneven with emotion.
Before Bacow conferred degrees on the College’s summa cum laude graduates, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 asked the students to approach the stage on the steps of Memorial Church.
As the students celebrated, Tom Hanks stood up from his chair and went down a line, giving the summa cum laude graduates celebratory fist bumps.
Overall, 1,850 graduated from Harvard College, 1,020 from Harvard Business School. 60 from the School of Dental Medicine, 469 from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, 151 from Harvard Divinity School, 715 from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 1,476 from the Harvard Extension School, 711 from the Harvard Kennedy School, 800 from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, 765 from Harvard Law School, 479 from Harvard Medical School, and 614 from the School of Public Health.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 took the podium to begin summoning deans of Harvard’s schools to present their candidates to the president, fellows of the Harvard Corporation, and the Board of Overseers.
Garber then introduced President-elect Claudine Gay to the podium, acting in her capacity as outgoing dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences one last time to give an overview of the degree conferral portion of the ceremony.
Gay was welcomed to the microphone with thundering, lasting applause from the students. When the applause died down, she quickly said to them, “This is your day, not mine.”
Harvard College senior Arhan Kumar ’23 sang the national anthem before Harvard University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 delivered a land acknowledgment.
After two prayers from University chaplains, outgoing President Lawrence S. Bacow delivered opening remarks.
“To everyone who is assembled here today to celebrate the Class of 2023, welcome,” Bacow said.
Bacow also called on the graduates to stand up and give a round of applause to their guests and loved ones sitting in the audience who helped them throughout their journey.
“Welcome to all, for our joyous gathering. Now, let’s actually begin,” he said.
The Latin Salutatory — delivered by Josiah Ethan Meadows ’23 — was titled “The Value of a Harvard Education.” In his spirited intonation, Meadows greeted the audience, acknowledged Commencement speaker Tom Hanks, and elicited cheers from the students by calling on each College House during his speech.
During his speech, Meadows paid homage to how the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the class’ college education, forcing them to shift to remote learning for over a year.
“Some of us spent great effort meditating on the principle of the philosopher René Descartes, Cogito, ergo sum — I think, therefore I am,” he said. “But soon, all of us learned a similar dictum: Covido, ergo Zoom.”
Bacow then introduced Pallas Chou ’23, who delivered the Senior English address entitled “Enzymes.”
“I love enzymes,” she began.
Chou also reminded the graduating class that through a year of “ups and downs,” they all played a role in “shaping each other.”
“Just as enzymes bring molecules together to catalyze chemical reactions, I have seen so many of you bring people together to catalyze change,” Chou said. “As we leave Harvard, we will continue to shape and be shaped by the world around us, serving as enzymes of Veritas.”
Kicking off the graduate student addresses, Vic Hogg, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, spoke about how their Harvard education almost derailed when they were shot in a carjacking accident.
“​​While I waited for the EMTs, my mind was racing and all I could think about was ‘I’m one semester from graduating. Will my family have to attend my funeral instead of my Commencement?’” Hogg said. “‘Am I really going to die before I’ve even gotten started?’”
Hogg also urged their classmates to recognize the strength of the bonds formed during their time as students on campus.
“In the process of chasing your dreams, you will need people to comfort you, to coach you, to tell you that there’s spinach in your teeth,” they said. “Look to your left and right—maybe those people are sitting beside you today.”
Harvard University’s 372nd Commencement has officially begun.
Striding to the podium, Middlesex County Sheriff Peter J. Koutoujian struck his scepter on the ground three times and bellowed, “As the high sheriff of Middlesex County, I declare that the meeting will be in order.”
All students and guests took their seats and the President’s division concluded with Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow taking his seat in the notoriously uncomfortable Holyoke Chair.
Attendees will listen to student orators deliver their speeches. Then, the University provost and all the school deans will introduce the candidates, and the president will confer their degrees before the awaited Commencement speaker Tom Hanks takes the stage.
As Harvard College seniors continued processing into Harvard Yard, Commencement speaker Tom Hanks, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, and other members of Harvard’s top ranks greeted each other and took selfies — mostly with Hanks — on the steps of Memorial Church.
Dressed in a Harvard graduation cap and robe, Hanks’s apparel is reflective of the honorary degree he will receive during the ceremony.
The Commencement exercises are expected to begin momentarily.
Accompanied by the sounds of bagpipes and “Fair Harvard,” the Yard exploded with festive cheer. Shouts and whistles erupted from proud loved ones as long lines of advanced degree students processed into seats in front of Tercentenary Theatre.
The 7,260 advanced degree students graduating from Harvard today have quickly turned the once-empty Yard into a blur of black and red as they take their seats and wait for the ceremony to begin.
Raucous sounds of applause spontaneously burst from the graduate student section as Harvard School of Public Health affiliates use the plastic clappers they received from the school as a prop gift.
Graduate students traditionally receive small props from their respective schools, many of which hold symbolic meaning as they prepare to embark on their professional careers.
The red plastic clappers from HPSH have a sticker reminding their owners that “handwashing is a cornerstone of public health.” Harvard Kennedy School graduates were gifted small inflatable globes, Harvard Law School students received gavels, the Graduate School of Design gave out legos, and the Graduate School of Education students held children’s books.
Harvard Law School graduate Andrew Hyun explained that the gavel is “supposed to be a symbol of the justice we’re supposed to carry forward.”
While most graduates arrived with bare black caps, others opted for a more commemorative approach.
Katherine A. Lutz, who is graduating from the Graduate School of Education, donned a cap adorned with flowers and a Winnie the Pooh quote: “A Grand Adventure is About to Begin.”
“I’ve always decorated all my caps — all high school, undergrad, and now grad,” she said. “My high school cap was a Winnie the Pooh quote, so [I] did full circle and ended with one again.”
About to receive her master’s in Human Development and Education, Lutz felt the quote applied well to Commencement.
“I’m about to go out into [the] real world,” she said. “It’s time for the next big adventure.”
Some students wore colorful stoles that they received during University-wide affinity celebrations earlier this week that honored graduates representing LGBTQ+, Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Arab, and pan-Asian identities, as well as those with disabilities and from first-generation, low-income backgrounds.
In about 15 minutes, the ceremony will officially kick off as the Middlesex County Sheriff calls the Commencement exercises to order.
The doors to Harvard Yard have officially opened, and families have been swarming in.
Tercentenary Theatre stands a sea of white plastic chairs, University staff rushing through the rows with last-minute adjustments.
But some of the first seats taken by parents and guests were not the white chairs, but the steps of Widener Library. Belinda J. Reinis and Kevin A. Reinis sat on a picnic blanket as they perched themselves at the top of Widener steps to watch their daughter graduate from Harvard Divinity School.
Belinda Reinis said it was their first time at a Harvard Commencement ceremony, but they did their research ahead of the event by asking a friend of a friend for seating advice.
“They said to come with a blanket because the cement is cold and to be at the top of the library steps to get the best view,” Reinis said. “So far so good.”
Chantel Pagan and her five-month-old baby, Keziah, flew in from Dallas, Texas to congratulate her husband Joel Pagan Castillo on graduating from Harvard Extension School. They sat with Joel’s brother Albert Pagan — who made the trek from Tulsa, Oklahoma — right behind a white barrier separating families and the soon-to-be graduates.
“This morning he had shared that he was just overwhelmed with the reality that it’s finally here,” Chantel said of Joel. “It’s been a long time in the making — semester over semester, one class at a time, for five years.”
Chantel added that she is “so excited” and “so proud” of her husband’s milestone and that he has been “extremely dedicated” in getting to this point.
“You cannot really see all the work that it takes, like the study sessions till 2 in the morning and the papers,” Chantel said. “So a big sacrifice but well worth it.”
Albert said he’s “overwhelmed with joy, gratitude, and feeling blessed” to watch his brother receive his degree.
Out at the edges of the Yard, graduates have begun gathering, swaths of crimson and black preparing to process to their seats.
In the background, the Commencement Choir — with students from various musical clubs across campus — is warming up to serenade the arriving audience.
Decked out in her graduation regalia, Yishu Li stood out from the crowd of parents and families. Having just completed her master’s degree in Human Development and Education at the Graduate School of Education, Li had been awake since 4 a.m., eagerly awaiting the chance to enter Harvard Yard.
Draped in black and crimson robes, Li said it was “so exciting” to be standing in line — she had already been there for 20 minutes. As a first-generation student, Li was particularly grateful to have her mother with her as she graduates.
“If I’m not here, my mom’s not gonna be here at all,” she said.
Robert N. Sorensen stood first in line outside Widener Gate to enter Harvard Yard, arriving at 4:45 a.m. with his two children. Sorensen said his early arrival was less about snagging the best seats in the house and more about “participating fully” in the ceremony with his wife, who is graduating with a master’s degree in history.
Sorensen said that even Tom Hanks, the Commencement speaker, is just a nice supporting act.
“He’s second fiddle to my wife for sure,” he said.

Billionaire David Rubenstein to Depart Harvard Corporation Next Month
Academy Award-winning actress Michelle Yeoh addressed Harvard Law School’s Class of 2023 during the school’s Class Day ceremony at Holmes Field Wednesday afternoon, sharing advice for graduates as they embark on the next stage of their legal careers.
Two months ago, Yeoh became the first Asian woman to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Evelyn Wang in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Over the course of her career, she has appeared in a number of other critically acclaimed movies, including “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “Crazy Rich Asians.”
The Wednesday event precedes Thursday’s Commencement festivities, during which the Law School will confer 735 total degrees to JD and Master of Laws candidates. The Law School’s Class of 2023 will participate in a University-wide ceremony Thursday morning that will feature addresses by Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow and actor Tom Hanks in Tercentenary Theatre, followed by a diploma ceremony at Holmes Field.
Last year’s Class Day address featured a speech by former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch ’81, who spoke at the Law School’s first in-person Class Day in three years.
Yeoh opened her remarks for the graduating class by likening their situation as soon-to-be graduates to that of “a high diver poised to leap into the void.”
“As you know, I am not a lawyer. I can’t even say that I have played one on the screen, so why am I here? Why have I been asked to deliver the keynote speech to you on this pivotal day in your lives as you dive headfirst into a presumably bright but unpredictable future?” she said. “Well, maybe the reason I’m here is because I happen to have some experience leaping off high perches into scary voids.”
“So, do allow me to offer some simple pointers that I’ve picked up along the way in my career full of leaps and dives: ‘How to Survive the Fall in Three Easy Steps,’ by Michelle Yeoh,” she added.
The three steps, according to Yeoh, are to “stay loose,” to “know your limits,” and to “find your people.”
For the first step, Yeoh reflected on advice from her principal in dance school to “stay loose” after suffering a spinal injury.
“With my dreams of dance crushed, I credit the principal of my school for giving me the encouragement that ultimately led me to a career beyond my imagination,” she said. “When falling, the tendency is to tighten up to brace for impact. But in truth, the safest thing one can do is remain calm — even curious — about the shifting world around you.”
Yeoh also discussed her experience wanting to portray action roles at a time when they were “reserved exclusively for men.”
“I was prepared to do everything the men were doing — the choreography, the stunts, taking the blows, the wire work, all of it. What, like it’s hard?” she said, referencing a line from the 2001 film “Legally Blonde.”
“When the chance finally came, I knew it was make-or-break. I had one shot to prove my bankability as an action star and if I failed, I would not get that opportunity again. So, I seized the moment with everything I had and as it turned out, thankfully, audiences were more than ready for a female star in action comedies,” Yeoh added.
This, according to Yeoh, was among many external limitations that she overcame in her career. However, she said, limitations can be both internal and external.
“Internally, knowing your limits keeps you humble, motivated, and focused on a goal to point your finger toward,” she said. “Externally, knowing the limits that are set for you by others gives you a place to point a different finger — I am talking about the middle one.”
“Every demeaning role I was offered, every rejection I was handed, and every time someone underestimated me, I found energy and renewed motivation,” she added.
And for her last point, to “find your people,” Yeoh said, “Life is not always a zero-sum game.”
“For every winner, there doesn’t have to be a loser. In fact, most success stories are less about competition and more about collaboration,” she said. “The truth is, I could not have done any of this alone.”
During the event, Law School professor Crystal S. Yang ’08 was named the recipient for this year’s Albert M. Sacks-Paul A. Freund Award for Teaching Excellence, whose awardee was selected by members of the graduating class.
“I implore you to find your North Star. Figure out what you stand for and what you will stand up for no matter how great the cost. This North Star will help you live a life of purpose and it will help you reorient yourself any time you find yourself lost,” Yang said in her acceptance speech, addressing the Class of 2023.
“I have no doubt that you will achieve great professional success, but remember that you are so much more than the credentials on your resume,” she added.

Breaking records left and right, marking new tournament and Ivy League titles in its record book, and sending athletes across the country to take podium places at every meet, Harvard track and field has earned itself the honor of Team of Year — both on paper and in the hearts of its members — who will remember the 2022-23 season as a season like no other.
The Harvard track and field/cross country team has had a historic year, winning four championships over the course of the three seasons. Their most recent win — the Outdoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championship victory — marks the first time in program history that both the Harvard men’s and women’s teams have won the meet. For the men’s team, it marks the first time they’ve won the outdoor Heptagonal championships since 1983 — 40 years ago.
“I feel like we’ve just had an incredible year,” head coach Jason Saretsky reflected. “The team has progressed in so many ways and it’s really wonderful to see all their hard work and dedication paying off.”
“We always try to emphasize enjoying the process,” he continued, “but at the same time it’s nice to be able to have the end result be what you hoped for as well.”
The women’s team set a high standard for their success, beginning in the fall with a victorious season. In late October, the Crimson women raced to first place in the Ivy League Heptagonal Cross Country Championships with junior Maia Ramsden taking the lead for Harvard in the championships race. Ramsden won the individual title in the women’s 6K, with a time of 20:42.4 seconds. The team ended up scoring 54 points, leading by nine points more than the second place finisher and famed Harvard track and field rival,Princeton.
The men’s team finished in second place in the Ivy League the fall. It was junior Acer Iverson for the men’s team who secured the individual title, running a time of 23:59.3 seconds for the men’s 8K to win first place. Sophomore Graham Blanks was the second place finisher, running 24:04.1 seconds to follow his teammate. Their first and second place finishes marked the first time since 1969 that the Crimson had two male runners take the gold and silver medals at Heptagonals.
Harvard also had seven runners earn All-Ivy Status during the Cross Country Heptagonals. At the conclusion of the meet, assistant head coach Alex Gibby was awarded the Ivy League Women’s Cross Country Coach of the Year.
The Ivy League Champions, Ramsden and Iverson were also awarded the All-Ivy Award, which recognizes student-athletes who have contributed majorly to their team, as well as maintained a GPA of 3.0 or more. The men’s and women’s team overall was named All-Academic team by the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCA).
For Harvard, having a culture that cultivates community is a big proponent of their success.
“There’s a genuine [care] for one another and a feeling that this is a big family,” said Sarestsky about the team’s culture and its relation to their success. “When you have that sense of belonging to something that’s much bigger than just yourself, it allows you to do so much more than you otherwise could.”
In the indoor season, the women’s team continued to dominate. They won the Heptagonal Ivy League Championships with 177 points, a full 25 points more than second-place Princeton. Ramsden was named the women’s Ivy League Most Valuable Track Athlete for her two wins in the women’s mile and 1000 m run. Senior Stephanie Ratcliffe was named women’s Most Valuable Field Athlete for her Ivy League record-setting weight throw performance.
In a heartbreaker, the men’s team came even closer to the championship title during the indoor Heptagonals. By just one point, they narrowly lost with 163 points to Princeton’s 164. Sophomore Kenneth Ikeji was named men’s Most Outstanding Track Performer.
At the conclusion of the championships, 27 Athletes earned All-Ivy Status. Sarestky was also named the Ivy League Women’s Indoor Track and Field Coach of the Year. Harvard also sent six athletes — who had all obtained a top sixteen spot in their event — to the indoor NCAAs.
“I think it’s a credit to our student athletes and our coaching staff, for the hard work and dedication they put in,” said Sarestky about the recognition that the program has gotten from both the league, as well as USTFCCA. “We try to really emphasize enjoying the journey, and it’s more about the process. It is really nice to see that extra recognition and to have that recognition coming from those two groups is really rewarding.”
Heading into the outdoor championship season, the team was looking to carry on their legacy of success, and they managed to do just that.
The women’s team completed their triple crown, winning the Outdoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships with 193 points, 33 more than second place Princeton. Ramsden was again recognized as the Women’s Most Outstanding Track Performer for her 1500 m and 5000 m wins.
The men’s team finally came victorious, winning the Outdoor Championships by 66 points. Their win marks their eleventh outdoor title. Ikeji was also recognized as the men’s Most Outstanding Field Performer. The men’s team had also bumped up to 22 in the NCAA top 25 rankings after their Ivy League win.
At the conclusion of the meet, Harvard had 32 athletes named All-Ivy, and Coach Sarestky was recognized as the Ivy League Men’s and Women’s Coach of the Year.
“There’s so many, it’s hard to pinpoint just a few,” said Sarestky about his proudest moments and accomplishments of the team. “Starting on the women’s side, to be able to complete the triple crown is such an amazing achievement.”
“Every Ivy League school is gunning for those championships each and every time, every school is filled with really talented, hardworking student athletes, and they’re all well coached,” he continued. “The end result is on the day. It’s a real testament to our women’s team. We were one point shy of [the championship] last year. This team operated with the idea of trying to be the best version of themselves, each and every day, and trying to get better.”
“On the men’s side, coming so close in cross country — and even closer on the track indoors — to finally sort of breakthrough, and in a record setting way for Harvard was really wonderful,” Sarestky continued. “Forty years is a long stretch, so we’re really happy and proud of our student athletes.” =
The Harvard track and field men’s and women’s team has maintained a number one Northeast Regional Ranking throughout the course of the outdoor season. The team is currently gearing up for its next target: the NCAAs.
“First and foremost, we don’t feel like our season is done,” Sarestky made clear. “Our attention is now squarely on the NCAAs, and we’ve got a large contingent that will be representing Harvard at the NCAA first round, and we’re trying to advance as many athletes as we can to the NCAA final round.”
“It’s something we try to continue to emphasize, being present, and being in the moment,” he said. “I’m fairly sure we’re gonna have a record number of Harvard track and field student-athletes at NCAA first round, so that’s what I’m most excited about and focused on.”

Awarding a title of “Game of the Year” at a school with such an historic rivalry as Harvard vs. Yale might seem a bit trivial. It seems to be the obvious choice to praise such a game for its history and hype. However, this particular year, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team pulled off a comeback victory against No. 4 Cornell that altered the trajectory of its season, put it back in contention for a spot in the Ivy Tournament, and proved that despite not performing to the same level as last year, that the team did indeed deserve to be lauded amongst the other top schools in the nation.
In a performance that was the best of the season for the young Crimson team, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team shocked the lacrosse world with a decisive 10-8 comeback upset against No. 4 Cornell. Coming into the contest battling a slump that included losses against Boston University and Dartmouth, the team played with a fire and intensity to dig out a win and topple the Big Red.
In head coach Gerry Byrne’s signature fashion, the game was attended by thousands of fans who brought energy to Jordan Field. Harvard hosted the most spectators in the Ivy League for the second season in a row, and this energy helped create a vivacious atmosphere that propelled the team.
“The combination of nearly 3000 fans, a sunny day ,and a top-five opponent created a Holy Trinity that propelled our team to play its most complete game of the year,” Byrne remarked.
The Ivy League as a whole produced powerhouse men’s lacrosse programs in the 2022 season, and the competitiveness between programs heightened as the coveted slots for the League tournament became necessary to secure an NCAA Tournament bid. This carried into 2023, a season which marked a decisive decrease in the number of Ivy League schools in the NCAA Tournament from six teams (out of seven total) to just two: tournament winner Princeton and wild card bid Yale.
The victory over Cornell was a pivotal moment for the Crimson because up to that point, the team’s performance throughout the season had been markedly more sluggish than the previous season. Earning a win against the Big Red was a victory not just for the team’s record, but also for its confidence. The win proved that Harvard had the capacity to play top teams, and that it could hold its own.
“Defeating the NCAA Championships runner-up from 2022 in front of a packed house is a predictor of where this program can go in future years, and we hope for many more wins like this as we welcome not only our Ivy League rivals to campus every year but NCAA powerhouses like Duke and Virginia as well,” Byrne noted.
The game proved to be a triumphant four quarters of lacrosse for the squad. After a rocky start where Cornell took a quick three-goal lead, the young squad showed poise in regrouping in a timeout called by Byrne.
It then returned to the field, scoring twice in the first before eventually tying the score and remaining neck-in-neck for the remainder of play. This poise was evident as well in how the Crimson strung together cohesive plays across the field. Struggling throughout the season to excel both offensively and defensively in the same game, this particular contest showed that the team had what it takes to rally back and defend its home turf.
Led by junior goalie Christian Barnard — who with a 66% save percentage was named the Ivy League Player of the Week — as well as the standout first-year attackman Teddy Malone — who was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week for his performances against both Dartmouth and Cornell — the team shined on both ends of the field. Cornell played with a speed that challenged the Crimson squad for that first few minutes of play before the team was able to adapt and then excel against it.
“They are a high-energy, high-skill team, and you can’t meet it, you have to exceed it. So, I challenged our guys in the locker room before to be great,” Byrne said. “You know that you’re going to be imperfect, so you’ve got to move through mistakes, which is a good life lesson, and we just needed to compete with them.”
“They are one of the most competitive teams, high-energy, ferocious, physical teams, and we had to meet it and exceed it,” continued Byrne. “I think that when we were playing well — which was a lot of that game — we did that.”
On the defensive end, sophomore defenseman Collin Bergstrom locked-down Tewaaraton Award Finalist C.J. Kirst, who was third in the nation in points and first in goals. Mitigating the threat allowed the defense to play aggressively off-ball and work as a unit. This unit consisted of sophomore defender Tommy Martinson and first-year defender Charlie Muller, who together held the 28th most efficient offense in the nation — averaging 14.56 goals per game — to only eight goals and a 16.3% efficiency rate, allowing just eight goals on 49 possessions.
“I think we put it all together today. The offense was scoring goals, and the defense was playing very well,” Barnard stated at the time. “They have one of the best players in the country in C.J. Kirst and I think that we did a really good job trying to minimize him. You can’t contain him completely, but you [have to] minimize his plays — I think our defense did an extraordinary job of that.”
This solid play on the defense translated into the team’s most stellar performance on offense of the entire season. Despite having trouble settling down for the first few minutes of play, the offense looked fast. Gaining a step on defenders, making crisp passes, and moving the ball allowed the attack to penetrate the seams, initiate one-on-one dodging, and play clean team offense. Similarly to the defense, which plays a team-style rotation without one player taking on a specific matchup, the offense showed incredible depth as well. Eight different players tallied goals, which proved that the team was able to capitalize on those looks.
While the season did not end the way that the squad would have liked, this game shows just how great the team can be when it strings together four cohesive and aggressive quarters of lacrosse. In a season that was touted as a breakthrough by lacrosse insiders, only to then fall short of that goal, this performance showcased the grit of the men’s team to battle against one of the toughest opponents in the nation, and come out victorious.

Although junior Maia Ramsden has only competed on the Harvard track and field and cross country teams for two seasons, her name is quickly taking up a lot of real estate in the Harvard Athletics record book.
After a strong sophomore campaign in 2021-22, Ramsden emerged as an anchor of the women’s track and field program in 2022-23, captaining the team to a historic season that included victories at the Ivy League Cross Country, Indoor, and Outdoor championships.
A native of New Zealand, Ramsden has been a star on the track even since her years before Harvard. Ramsden won the U20 New Zealand National Championship in the 1500 m and the 800 m, and she earned New Zealand National Silver honors in the 800 m at the U18 levels.
Ramsden was also a decorated performer during her time at the International Community School of Addis Ababa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. She holds the International Schools of Southern and Eastern Africa (ISSEA) records in the 400 m, 800 m, and 1500 m, and she was twice honored as an ISSEA All-Star.
Ramsden kicked off her campaign with a cross country victory in the 5000 m race at the Sept. 10th HYP meet against Yale and Princeton. In late September, she finished seventh at the Oklahoma State Cowboy Jamboree in the 6000 m with a time of 20:32.7, and took home another seventh place ranking at the Nuttycombe Invite in Wisconsin two weeks later, improving to a time of 20:04.5.
At the Ivy League Championships on Oct. 28th, Ramsden won the Ivy League individual title in the 6000 m with a time of 20:42.4, leading the Crimson to a league title. Less than two weeks later, Ramsden secured a spot in the NCAA Championship meet with another 6000 m win at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships, this time posting a 20:20.6 result, but she saved her best time of the season for the mid-November national championships, finishing in 11th with a time of 19:52.3 to cap off a stellar fall cross country season.
After posting a season-best time in cross country’s biggest meet of the year, Ramsden hit the ground running at the start of the track and field indoor season, setting a school record in the 3000 m with a time of 8:54 at the HBCU and Ivy Challenge. Ramsden picked up her record-setting ways soon after winter break, setting a program record in the 1000m at the HYP Meet in late January.
“I’ve never run the 1000 meters before, so I knew I was going to PR since I didn’t have any other time,” she noted. “I really wasn’t sure what was going to happen — it was a really pleasant surprise, I’d say.”
Despite another strong performance, the junior noted that there were lessons to be learned in Harvard’s team defeat to Princeton.
“Our coach is pretty keen on us peaking at the right time,” Ramsden said. “I think that at first that means on the scoreboard — Princeton beats us, but in the long term, it’s better because we’re learning to adapt to new races.”
The next weekend, Ramsden broke a 43-year-old school record in the mile run in a time of 4:30.19 at Boston University’s Scarlet and White meet. Ramsden finished first in the entire collegiate field in the race and rose to second place in the entire NCAA with her historic time. While she could not match her school record at the Ivy League Indoor Championships in late February, Ramsden won two gold medals with first-place finishes in the mile and 1000 m. Her stellar performance earned her the Ivy League Most Valuable Track Athlete award.
After finishing the Ivy League season with a dominant performance, Ramsden earned First-Team All-American honors in two events at the NCAA Indoor Championships in N.M. in mid-March. In her first event of the meet, Ramsden finished fifth in the mile with a time of 4:36.54, and she followed up with a ninth-place finish in the 3000 m only hours later, securing a spot on the podium each time to complete a brilliant outdoor season, one that saw the track and field team send its biggest group of athletes to the national championship in 17 years.
“I was incredibly proud of Maia,” said track and field head coach Jason Saretsky. “She certainly is the epitome of a student athlete, pursuing academic and athletic excellence, and for her to have that recognition in front of her peers was just a testament to her hard work and how dedicated she is as a student athlete.”
With the outdoor season in full swing, Ramsden posted a dominant performance at the 126th biannual Harvard-Yale Oxford-Cambridge meet. After winning the 1500 m in 4:15.77, Ramsden dominated the 5000 m, setting a personal record of 16:08.27 and securing victory by a margin of 15 seconds. She posted another strong 1500 m time two weeks later to finish fourth at Wake Forest, taking second place in the Harvard record book and rising to 13th in the nation.
In the final Ivy League competition of the season, the captain defended her 2022 title in the 1500 m, winning by three seconds in a time of 4:12.54. She won the 5000 m title only five hours later, taking the lead in the final lap to earn the individual Most Outstanding Track Performer award. The women’s team won its sixth ever Ivy League title, and first since 2017, behind Ramsden’s dominance.
“I think that’s a lot different than last year, where I was just going to race with the field, sit on the leader, and kind of make it fast if we have to,” Ramsden said after the championship. “This year we kind of had some goals for what the first half of the race should look like, and that was to go out pretty hard. I ended up going out a little too hard, but it worked out in the end.”
The junior captain has another chance to secure some national hardware at the upcoming NCAA Regionals and Indoor Championships in June, but regardless of the outcome, Ramsden’s consistent brilliance on the track has entrenched her place in the Harvard record books, and her leadership and teamwork has helped push the Crimson to a historic and unforgettable season.
“I think it’s a reflection of our program, the more qualifiers we can have at NCAA Regionals. So definitely trying to help and support and motivate as many people as we can this first weekend.”

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Showing grit and determination throughout a highly-anticipated season, first-year attackman Teddy Malone made an instant impact on the Harvard men’s lacrosse team.
Appearing in all twelve games and starting in ten, Malone finished the year tied for the second-most points on the team, finishing with 18 goals and six assists. Working his way into the first-line attacking unit made up of sophomore Sam King and senior Hayden Cheek, Malone was so key in the team’s successes that he was twice named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week.
The first-year star grew up in Philadelphia, Penn. and graduated from Haverford. He started playing lacrosse in the second grade after watching his older brother TJ — a fifth-year senior and standout attacker at Penn State — who inspired him to pursue the sport as well.
Malone ultimately played for Mesa, a club team run out of his high school, where he continued throughout the entirety of his recruiting process. In deciding where he would ultimately take his talents, Malone considered Harvard, other Ivy League schools, as well as Penn State. However, when the coaching staff for the Crimson reached out to him, it made the decision to play for Harvard incredibly easy.
“Hailing from Philly powerhouse The Haverford School, Teddy brings a ferocity mixed with joy to every practice, lift, and drill and that mixture bodes well for what I see as an All-Ivy and All-American caliber career as we aim for an Ivy League and National Championship,” head coach Gerry Byrne noted.
Lacrosse is not a family tradition for Malone beyond him and his brother. His mother ran track at Richmond and his father did not compete in a sport collegiately, although he was a competitive soccer player. Despite this, Malone’s love for the sport runs deep.
“I play lacrosse because it can be such a creative sport,” Malone reflected. “Having your own stick that you can customize makes it so that there are endless things you can do. I’m always learning something new, there are so many ways to get better and it’s just so much fun to play”
It is this joy that drives him to excel both in the classroom and on the field. Balancing a rigorous schedule of Harvard classes, lacrosse lifts, meetings, and practices, Malone has adjusted well to the fast-paced environment in Cambridge. However, even with his instant impacts, he recognizes the stresses of being at such a lauded institution.
Malone remarked that attending Harvard, he realized just how talented everyone is. Everyone was the best at their niche, whether that be art, sports, or music, and so trying to perform well amongst his peers has been a challenge due to the competitive nature of his class.
“I think that makes it extremely competitive. In the classroom you're surrounded by people that seem way smarter than you — and same thing on the lacrosse field,” he said. “Every single person that is recruited to go to Harvard for lacrosse is the best person on their high school team, the best player in the area.”
“I think just going from this side of the river, in the Yard, from classes, being surrounded by super smart, talented individuals, and then going to lacrosse also surrounded by super smart, talented individuals, they just push you,” he continued. “It can be really challenging if you fall behind, and it's easy to get down on yourself, but I think ultimately makes everyone a better person, a better student, a better athlete”
At a school noted primarily as being the best academic institution in the nation, there can be situations in which student-athletes feel pressure from professors as a result of their having to juggle both pursuits in the classroom as well as on the field. However, Malone has not only not felt this, but he has been supported by his faculty.
“All my teachers have been super interesting — they're super curious about lacrosse,” Malone said. “I know some of my professors have even come out to the games. From my experience, the heart, my Harvard professors have been super supportive, and just super interested in my own life, which is really nice to see”
Building confidence has been a hallmark of Malone’s rookie season. Rebounding from an injury in the fall, Malone was forced to sit out fall ball, which meant that he entered this year without much game experience. Slotting into the starting attacking unit and working with a slew of underclassmen, Malone noted that he thinks there is room for the team to grow and outperform this past performance.
“You see all the sophomores contributing, and even a lot of freshmen contributing this year. As a freshman class, we've all discussed with ourselves how we have such a bad taste of losing at the end of the season,” the first-year noted. “We don't want that to happen again.”
“I know a lot of us took the blame for that,” he continued. “A lot of us will be working over the summer to have that not happen again. I think we have a lot of room to grow, but I think we are completely able to do so.”
This blame stems from a lack of experience in some big moments on all ends of the field. However, making those mistakes as a rookie rather than as an older player shows that despite this naivete, the team boasts potential and talent in its younger classes, so these players will be able to gain experience and learn from those difficult situations on the field.
Malone is one of those talents. In the first game of the year against No. 1 Virgina, Malone scored two goals and tallied an assist. Against Dartmouth, he scored the first four goals of the game and also notched an additional four in the win against Brown.
He is far from a silent impact on the field — his successes had an immediate effect on the outcome of each game, and his lacrosse IQ continued to develop over the course of the season as he played more collegiate games.
With his season ending before his brother’s —who is still in contention for an NCAA title with Penn State — Malone did not allow defeat to stymy his appreciation for the sport and for his teammates.
Coach Byrne is unique in that he delegates responsibilities to the upperclassmen to foster a cohesive bond within the units. Malone emphasized this tightness within the team and how it is an integral aspect in the team’s successes.
Looking onto the next three seasons, Malone has his goals set high.
“Win a National Championship and win an Ivy League championship,” Malone said. “And I think just have a great time playing lacrosse together — just really enjoying the sport together, and making it fun — I think that's how it should be played.”

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
It was a difference of one shot.
In the highly-anticipated, annual duel of Boston’s best collegiate hockey teams, the No. 9 Harvard Crimson fell to the No. 16 Northeastern Huskies in a shootout.
The heartbreak took place on the second Monday of February, at Boston’s iconic TD Garden, in the final of the 2023 Beanpot Tournament — the 70th edition of the historic competition — and the first time Harvard faced Northeastern in the finals. The Crimson had fought hard to earn their spot in the championship, with first-year forward Marek Hejduk playing hero in the first round with two goals, including the overtime winner that gave Harvard the victory over the Boston College Eagles.
The title match, of which Harvard had not returned to since its last victory in 2017, was a hard-fought battle, one in which both Harvard’s former senior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson and the Huskies’ Devon Levi played instrumental roles in the game. Both allowed only two goals in regulation and none in overtime, with Gibson recording 27 saves while Levi chalked 32.
Levi was eager to revisit the Crimson, with Harvard having scored eight goals against the top-10 Hobey Baker finalist in a 8-4 New Year’s Day win earlier in the season. “They put on a clinic against me,” Levi said at the post-game press conference. “I wanted revenge.”
And revenge was just what Levi led the Huskies in serving. After former sophomore forward Matthew Coronato got by him twice in the second period to give the Crimson the lead, Levi stopped all 14 of the Crimson’s shots on goal in the third period. His teammate Gunnarwolfe Fontaine scored his second of the game to tie the score five minutes into the third period, sending the game to overtime.
After an action-packed 3-on-3 overtime — the first of its kind in Beanpot Championship game history —the game was sent to a shootout. With the entirety of TD Garden on its feet and silenced with anticipation, Harvard’s own top-10 Hobey Baker finalist, former junior forward Sean Farrell, skated in on Levi but was stopped by the Canadian, as was Northeastern’s first shooter Jack Hughes by Gibson. In the second round, Levi refused to allow Coronato to get past him a third time, stopping the Crimson’s second attempt.
However, the Huskies’ tallied a mark with captain Aidan McDonough getting a wrister by Gibson. With the game on the line, Harvard’s choice was junior forward Alex Laferriere, who, like his teammates, could not get past Levi. The Beanpot trophy went home with the Huskies for the eighth time in program history, and the Crimson were sent packing with their tails down.
“I think it's an incredible opportunity to [have] play[ed], in that environment,” Harvard head coach Ted Donato ’91 said at the time. “For us, it's certainly a learning experience. If we want to have success at the end of the year, we're going to have to play in tough environments and play in high stress situations.”
“I think we'll look back at this as a real growing opportunity,” he said. However, for the remainder of the season, heartbreak would become a recurring theme.
In the weeks following the Beanpot bungle, the Crimson played some of its best hockey of the whole season. The team rode a four-game winning streak to finish out the regular season, taking on and taking down four ECAC opponents: Union College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, St. Lawrence University, and Clarkson University, respectively. With the win over Union, it secured a first-round bye in the ECAC Tournament.
In the second round and quarterfinals of the contest, Harvard hosted the Princeton University Tigers, and sent them back to New Jersey in decisive fashion, needing only the first two of the potential three-game series. With the series win, the Crimson earned a spot in the semis in Lake Placid, and the team headed back to the famous Herb Brooks arena with high hopes to defend their ECAC title.
Taking on rival No. 10/11 Cornell in the semi-finals, the No. 6 Crimson were ready for a dog-fight. Though winning both regular season games against the Big Red, Harvard had already lost the 2022-23 Ivy League Crown to Cornell, as it is awarded relative to conference points.
The Crimson, a dominant force in the Ivy League, struggled with putting away its conference foes in regulation, having beaten Cornell, Princeton, and Yale in overtime, as well as dropping a pivotal game against Brown on January 21st. At the end of the season, they were short of the Ivy title by a single point.
The game remained scoreless through regulation, as Gibson again put on show to match Cornell goalkeep Ian Shane save for save. Laferriere secured the team’s championship appearance with a quick goal in the first five minutes of overtime, capping off a swift passing sequence with first-year Joe Miller and senior captain and forward Baker Shore.
The Crimson faced the unranked Colgate Raiders in the finals the next night. Having upset the No. 2 — and eventual 2022-23 NCAA Champions — Quinnipiac Bobcats the night before, the underdog Raiders came in hoping to continue its unexpected momentum. Scoring within the first minute of the game to gain a lead they refused to give up, Colgate continued to roll, beating Harvard with a final score of 3-2.
Unlike in 2021-2022, when its ECAC title triumph automatically secured its spot in the NCAA tournament, Harvard’s regular season success persuaded the selection committee to grant it a playoff berth. The No. 7 Crimson took on No. 8 Ohio State in the first round in Bridgeport, CT., on Friday, March 24th.
The game provided a crushing end to a season that had started with so much hope, as the Crimson fell to the Buckeyes 8-1. By the end of the second period, it was 7-1. Harvard’s typical explosive offense was completely silenced; its lockdown defense beat. Gibson was pulled for the start of the third for junior goalkeeper Derek Mullahy, though returning to the goal with five minutes remaining for the final minutes of his collegiate career.
“It’s a career-ending loss that was probably the worst loss I’ve had in my hockey career so far,” said former senior forward and captain John Farinacci. “It's not one that I’m used to — being down by that many goals, it's a tough one — I can’t really put it into words right now. I have to digest it and move on.”
After the end of the season, the Crimson saw five of its stars sign professional contracts. Farrell, after being named ECAC and Ivy League Player of the Year, signed and made his NHL debut with the Montreal Canadiens. His first-linemate Coronato did just the same with the Calgary Flames, and Laferriere followed suit with the Los Angeles Kings. By signing, all three chose pro over their remaining collegiate years, with Farrell and Laferriere being juniors, and Coronato a sophomore.
Former senior captain and ECAC Defensive Defenseman of the Year Henry Thrun joined the San Jose Sharks for their final weeks of the season, while Gibson signed an amateur tryout contract with the Washington Capitals and joined their AHL team, the Hershey Bears. Farinacci was expected to sign with the Arizona Coyotes — the club that drafted him in 2019 — but failed to come to an agreement.
Graduating alongside Thrun, Gibson, and Farinacci will be forward and captain Baker Shore, first-pair defenseman Ryan Siedam, forwards Wyllum Deveaux and Austin Wong, and defensemen Jace Foskey. After the loss — though neither originally drafted by NHL organizations — Shore and Deveaux signed minor league tryout deals. Shore signed with the South Carolina Stingrays, an ECHL affiliate of the Washington Capitals, while Deveaux inked a deal with the Wheeling Nailers, an ECHL affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins.
“I think this [was] a really special group. I think coaches say that kind of normally, but I think this group is probably as close a group as I've been able to be around as coach 19 years,” said Donato in the Ohio State post-game press conference.
“It was a really close group. We had a group of guys that felt it was a privilege to play for Harvard and treated [that] way,” he continued. “This season won't be defined by this [NCAA first round loss]. It's disappointing, but these guys have had a great year and certainly, I'm proud of not only their performance but how they care for each other and how they carry themselves- they were an amazing group to coach.”
All in all, the Crimson’s season was filled with highs and lows, provided by a team of majority returning players. Next year — down 11 familiar faces and names on the roster — Harvard will look to have another surprisingly successful season as it did in 2021-22, filled with younger players. Newly-named captains, sophomore defenseman Ian Moore and sophomore forward Zakary Karpa, will look to set the expectations in the locker room and excite their teammates for the potential success the 2023-24 season can bring.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
In a year that saw some fantastic individual performances across all sports for Harvard, women’s soccer’s sophomore forward Ainsley Ahmadian took the crown.
With a team featuring two All-Americans, the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, two other First Team All-Ivy selections, and one Second-Team and Honorable Mention, the Crimson put up phenomenal individual performances every match — but Ahmadian’s two-goal thriller to lift Harvard above No. 17 North Carolina State (NC State) was the performance of the year.
The Crimson entered its fourth game of the season on Sept. 4 with a record of 3-0-0 (0-0-0 Ivy League), coming off a dominant 4-0 performance two days prior over UNC-Greensboro. Temperatures in the eighties would make for a grueling contest, not to mention the big home crowd atmosphere for NC State.
In soccer, no individual performance is possible without a strong team effort, and it was Harvard’s defensive line and sophomore midfielder Hannah Bebar who helped create the chances for Ahmadian to score. The Crimson held the Wolfpack — who averaged just under eleven shots per game the whole season — to just six shots all game, only two of which were on goal.
“Our defense and midfield were doing a great job of bringing the ball up with lots of energy throughout the first part of the first half,” Ahmadian said. “The mentality and fight they had to stop NC State’s top-level forwards was very motivational.”
Ahmadian credited the team’s decision-making and variety of attack to get good looks on goal. It was yet another Bebar-Ahmadian connection that netted the first strike of the match. The two Illinois natives have played together since the start of middle school, and it shows on the pitch. In the 31st minute, Bebar delivered a beautiful pass over a throng of Wolfpack players to Ahmadian about thirteen yards from goal, splitting the last two defenders before putting it home past NC State’s Maria Echezarreta.
Coming into the second half with some real momentum, it took Ahmadian just five minutes to silence the Wolfpack crowd and expand the cushion yet again. From over twenty-five yards out, she split the defense again and upon seeing an opening, fired a laser into the top-right corner, catching Echezarreta a bit off-guard and with no play on a save.
“I just saw a little bit of an opening and thought I would go for it, and it ended up working out,” said Ahmadian, perhaps downplaying the absurdity of the brilliant goal.
Ahmadian said head coach Chris Hamblin and the coaching staff were great in preparing the team both strategically and mentally for the early road trip, which certainly showed with its polished performance in just the fourth game of the year.
"They did a great job of not making things too complicated and just focusing on some of the key tactics in our defensive strategies, because we were going up against great offensive players, but also how we would break them down [offensively],” Ahmadian said.
“They also did a fantastic job of mentally preparing us,” she continued. “This was the hardest game that a lot of us have played in college soccer.”
The victory set the tone early for the Crimson, proving to itself and others that Harvard was going to be a threat this year. The match saw Harvard launch from unranked in the United Soccer Coaches top twenty-five poll to No. 20. The 2-0 away win was by far the biggest win of non-conference play, and rivaled if not beat out the 2-2 draw with No. 17 Texas Christian University on Sept. 17 for the most thrilling non-conference matchup.
“One of the things we talked about before the game was just making sure that we’re paying attention to all the details, all the little pieces that add up to a good performance,” said head coach Chris Hamblin back in September after the road trip. “I think the team executed incredibly well on both sides of the ball — I was really proud of how they took the challenge on against a top-25 team and made a statement.”
Harvard continued its success after the North Carolina road trip, finishing the season 12-2-3 (5-0-2 Ivy League), just narrowly losing the Ivy League title to Brown, but earning an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament and advancing to the second round, before losing a thriller to South Carolina.
This upcoming season, the Crimson will get another marquee matchup versus the Wolfpack — this time at home on Jordan Field, where Ahmadian and Harvard’s returning team will be ready yet again, this time joined by the talented new Class of 2027.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
After four years of being called to step up for Harvard football on Saturdays, Truman Jones ’22 and senior Aidan Borguet were hoping to hear their names called in a different way last month so that they might play football on Sundays instead.
While that wish didn’t come true during the National Football League’s (NFL) draft in Kansas City, their broader goal of playing football on the world’s biggest stage is still alive. As they have in the past, the two former Crimson stars will simply take the road less traveled.
Jones — an Atlanta, Ga. native and defensive end who graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering last December — signed a free agent contract with the Kansas City Chiefs the day the draft ended and will compete for a roster spot as the summer goes on.
Meanwhile, Borguet — the engine of Harvard’s offense this past season and a finalist for the Walter Payton Award (the “Heisman of the FCS”) — was invited to multiple NFL teams’ rookie camps and is hoping to sign with a team in need of support in the run game.
Tim Murphy, the Thomas Stephenson Family Head Coach for Harvard Football, pointed to both players’ intangibles as an essential part of their journey to where they are today.
“Their overall character transcended what people thought was the limit on their ability and because of that, they got better and better every year, to the point where now they would fit in on any NFL preseason roster,” Murphy said.
For Jones, as he begins his professional career with the Chiefs, he’ll be able to draw on his experience working his way up a depth chart. After starring in high school for Westminster, where he won state championships in football and lacrosse, Jones was recruited into Murphy’s program as an outside linebacker. After seeing action in just three games as a freshman, Jones moved to defensive end and found immediate success as a sophomore.
Despite being set back in his development by the Covid-19 pandemic and having a down year as a junior in 2021, Jones rediscovered the “prove-yourself” mentality he had in 2019, leaving it all on the field in 2022. Jones recorded 40 tackles, six sacks, and three blocked kicks for the Crimson last season, and continued to display a skill that’s been evident in his character since high school: leadership. After captaining his Westminster squad in 2017, Jones served as the 148th team captain in Harvard football history.
Because he took the fall semester of 2020 off, Jones graduated last December and was able to return to Atlanta after the season to train and be with his family for the draft. However, he still describes that week as a whirlwind: after going undrafted during the day on Saturday, April 29, Jones received the call from the Chiefs that night, and news of his signing made the rounds among NFL scouts the following day.
Within a week, Jones had flown out to Missouri for rookie camp, where he participated in drills and walkthroughs with 70 other rookies. After a brief sojourn back to Atlanta, Jones was back in Kansas City by May 14 to participate in voluntary team workouts, a chance to practice and learn from veterans.
It is hard to envision a better landing spot for an undrafted player than the 2023 Super Bowl champion Chiefs, who boast a coaching staff led by Andy Reid, one of the most well-respected coaches in the league, as well as a defensive line stacked with veteran playmakers like Chris Jones and Danny Shelton. Jones will join a crop of edge rushers looking to fill in the gap left by the departure of Frank Clark, who started 15 games at defensive end for the team last season and had five sacks. In addition to signing Jones, the team spent its first-round pick in the draft on a pass rusher, Felix Anudike-Uzomah of Kansas State, as well as its fifth-round pick on Stephen F. Austin’s BJ Thompson.
“We each have a lot to learn from each other because it’s a big step from collegiate football to professional,” said Jones of his fellow rookie edge rushers. “It’s been great to have those guys by my side. We build off of each other and we’re all going to grow together.”
One luxury that Jones has already enjoyed since becoming a professional is the ability to focus solely on football. As a biomedical engineering concentrator, Jones balanced an intense course load with his responsibilities to the Crimson; he listed time management as one of the biggest lessons he took away from his four years in Cambridge. While medical school will wait for now, his former coaches don’t doubt his ability to excel in the field down the line.
Jones displays “an unbelievably amazing pursuit of excellence in everything he does,” according to Coach Murphy. “You can try to coach that — but you either have that intangible, that character, or you don’t.”
Joining Jones on the 2022 Academic All-America Team was Borguet, whose soft-spoken demeanor belies a powerful rushing style on the field which allowed him to become one of the most accomplished rushers in recent Ivy League memory.
Unlike Jones, Borguet saw significant action as a freshman coming out of Delsea Regional in Franklinville, N.J. The player who came to be known by the nickname “AB” set the record for most rushing yards in the 136th playing of The Game in 2019, scorching Yale for 269 yards and four touchdowns on just 11 carries. Murphy remembers this game as the moment when the coaching staff realized Borguet was special, and special he continued to be: after averaging a prolific 7.1 yards per carry as a freshman and a solid 5.2 yards per carry as a sophomore, Borguet saved his most impressive season for last.
Throughout last season, the Harvard offense lived and died with Borguet: he carried the rock more than 15 times in all 10 games, gaining over 100 yards in seven of them, in which Harvard went 6-1. At the end of the season, his 1182 yards on the ground represented the highest total from a Harvard back since Clifton Dawson ’07 set the single-season record with 1,302 in 2005. Going into the final game of the season against Yale, Borguet was 182 yards off of Dawson’s record, an imposing total but not much more than the 179 yards he had garnered against Dartmouth earlier in the year.
However, Borguet was stymied for only 62 yards as the Crimson fell to the Bulldogs 19-14. Still, after the season, the awards piled in: in addition to First Team All-Ivy and the Walter Payton Award finalist designation, he was the Bluebloods Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the Bushnell Cup.
“He was always working as hard or harder than anybody on the team. He was never satisfied,” said Murphy of Borguet, who added that the running back has “the combination of work ethic, that toughness, that amazing pursuit of finding little ways to get better.”
Now, Borguet is attempting to match the success of Dawson, who signed with the Indianapolis Colts after going undrafted and played 15 games in the NFL for the Colts and the Cincinnati Bengals from 2007-2008. He can also look to more recent members of the Harvard rushing corps who have gone professional: Aaron Shampklin ’21, who started for the Crimson during Borguet’s freshman year, recently signed a futures/reserve contract with the Colts.
Notably, Dawson and Shampklin both faced concerns about their size, as they played at 5’10” for the Crimson, while the average height of an NFL running back is closer to six feet. Borguet, who listed at 5’10” but was tabbed at 5’9” by some draft evaluators, has faced similar headwinds, but he has also demonstrated exceptional strength in other areas. At Harvard’s Pro Day in March, Borguet put up 35 repetitions on the 225-pound bench press; the record at the NFL combine for the position is 32.
If the lens is expanded to every position, Borguet and Jones will look to follow in the footsteps of a cadre of former Harvard standouts who went on to have productive NFL careers, including Ryan Fitzpatrick ’04, Kyle Jusczyk ’13, and Cameron Brate ’14. Fitzpatrick, the former quarterback and 121st captain in team history, and Brate, an undrafted tight end who won the Super Bowl with the Buccaneers in 2021, even played on the same Tampa Bay Buccaneers team from 2017-2018. On October 15, 2017, the two connected for a Harvard-to-Harvard touchdown reception, the first such “Crimson Special” in recorded history.
Though Jones and Borguet won’t ever be able to share a scoring connection by virtue of their positions, it is possible that they could start their careers on the same team. In addition to rookie camp invites from the Miami Dolphins and Philadelphia Eagles, Borguet received an invitation from the Chiefs, who have dealt with injuries to running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the past two seasons. Borguet’s rushing style shares some similarities with Isaiah Pacheco’s, who is the Chiefs’ likely starter this coming season and a back who was billed as a tough, physical runner coming out of Rutgers in 2022. Another New Jersey native, Pacheco rose from a seventh-round pick and back-up to become the Chiefs’ starter in the Super Bowl in February, perhaps a sign that the organization might be willing to take more fliers on sleeper running backs in the future.
Whether their NFL careers end up taking off in Kansas City, Miami, or somewhere else, Borguet and Jones will continue to represent the Crimson wherever they go.
“They will represent Harvard well, and I think they’ll find a way to get it done,” Murphy said.
Murphy’s biggest piece of advice for the two burgeoning professionals? Believe in themselves.
“Self belief is no small thing. Sometimes it’s easy to say, ‘What the hell am I doing here?’” said Murphy. “Just stay with it, because we’ve had so many kids that were not highly recruited that have played in the league.”
“I feel reassured that this has been done before,” said Jones. “I’m just trying to do my best to follow in those footsteps and take what is expected of a Harvard student, to be an intelligent football player, and bring that to the NFL.”

Since joining the Harvard squash team in 2018, Marwan Tarek has drawn crowds and headlines alike. During a four-year tenure at Harvard, the senior has accumulated a collection of trophies and titles that could fill the case at the Murr Center on their own.
Now, after what has been an impressively dominant senior season for the Harvard squash program, Tarek has added another set of achievements to his resume — another Potter Cup, the prestigious Skillman Award, and, of course, The Harvard Crimson’s Male Athlete of the Year.
Harvard has had a great year packed with athletic successes across the sports spectrum. For the teams and individuals competing in the male division of their sports, there have been many notable season-long performances: ice hockey, basketball, and skiing, have all seen Crimson athletes excel at the highest level of competition. However, nobody stood out amongst teammates and competitors the same way that Marwan Tarek has excelled on the squash court.
Of course, like any accomplished athlete, Tarek’s dominance can be understood in the numbers even by the most casual observers. To start, 60 is the number of matches that he has played wearing the Crimson colors. A regular season has twelve matches in it, so for Tarek to have even played 60 over four years means he not only qualified for the post-season every year he has been at Harvard but also done well enough to play the maximum of three playoff games every year to reach this impressive total.
Of these 60 matches, the now-seasoned veteran has managed to post an all-time record of 56-4. To put this in perspective, the legendary 1996 Chicago Bulls ended the season with a 72-10 record. If Tarek had his record extrapolated into a standard 82-game NBA season, he would clock an unfathomable 77-5 season, steamrolling the Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman power trio.
Yes, Tarek wins. Yes, Tarek makes the finals. But does he win in the finals? Yes. The Cairo, Egypt native has won four Potter Cups with the Crimson, and in finals play, Tarek has been a perfect 4-0 in his individual matches.
In Harvard’s biggest games this season — the Ivy League-clinching win over the University of Pennsylvania and the Potter Cup final against Trinity College — Harvard’s go-to-guy has delivered. In a regular season game outside of Ivy League competition, Tarek secured a win over Trinity College’s Mohammed Sharaf, three games to one. A month-and-a-half later, he then repeated this performance in an entirely different context to score an essential point that brought Harvard its fourth straight national squash title.
With a true championship mindset exemplified in his on-court grit and rigor, spectators watching Marwan Tarek compete are reminded that athletes do not ever play to lose. In both of the Trinity College matches this season, one with no stakes, the other with the highest stakes in college squash, Tarek maintained the same level of focus and precision to close out his opponent. In both instances, Tarek won the first game comfortably and then proceeded to drop the second. Whether winning or losing, Tarek is always focused, composed. His ability to come off a lost game and string together two straight victories against an opponent as undeniably skilled as Trinity’s Sharaf is a true testament to Tarek’s unique talent as an athlete.
It is not that he is ever visually bothered. It is the opposite actually: it is generally difficult to tell what exactly the Crimson’s No. 1 is thinking when he is locked into a match. This makes Tarek exceptionally dangerous to an opponent. Maybe he is fazed by making an error and losing a point? Maybe he is so confident in his skill that he never feels the pressure of a single point? Regardless, an opponent that conceals his emotions until the very end, when he is able to drop his racquet and cheer to his fans is a terrifying adversary, especially when composure is just an additive to an already bursting kit of squash IQ and skillful shots.
The on-court persona of a silent killer, however, immediately dissipates after the 23-year-old economics concentrator leaves the confines of the squash court. Once his match ends, Tarek will jump quickly out through the plexiglass door in search of one of his teammates playing, so that he can cheer them on loudly. Tarek certainly holds himself in a way that reflects expertise and experience, which could be easily interpreted as unapproachability. But Tarek could be seen all season fully engaged in his mentor role, shouting motivation and conversing one-on-one with teammates about specific points of a game or opponent tendencies.
“When you’re on the court alone, you’re not actually alone. You have your guys there supporting you,” teammate Tate Harms elaborates on the importance of getting energy and advice from the team. And this is the true sign of a gifted athlete: a generational talent on the court who also uses his abilities to elevate the play of his teammates. After all, college squash is a team sport, and Tarek has led Harvard to the most successful four years of competition it possibly could have had.
The most notable deviation from his reserved style requires a look back once again to Harvard’s final game of the season against the Trinity College Bantam in the finals of the CSA National Championships. Tarek had won games one and three, dropping the second game. The bigger picture is that while the Crimson’s best player is on the court, the overall score of the matchup is 4-3 in favor of Harvard.
The spectators and players alike begin to realize that Tarek could secure the fifth point for the Crimson and clinch the title with one more game victory over Sharaf. An already sizable crowd was locked in on the number-one ladder game; however, once the stakes were realized, every eye in the building fell onto the Egyptian national champion. Dancing around his opponent, Tarek, on surely tired legs, looks just as fresh as he did in the first game of the season. But now he wears the familiar look of a man hungry for another title.
Up two games to one, Tarek ran the score up rapidly on Sharaf, until match point, and champion point, were established. Tarek and Sharaf traded drives down the line on this crucial point, until Tarek switched the flow of the rally unexpectedly — slithering past Sharaf to deliver a high volley to the top of the wall. The high shot forced Sharaf to reach for a difficult spike shot that ultimately errored into the bottom runner.
With the bang of the ball on the metal, a collective breath slips from the mouths of the entire crowd. And then the Harvard team erupted into cheers. While his teammates celebrate outside of the court, jumping up and down and hugging. Marwan Tarek shakes his opponent’s hand and then lets emotion take over. His hands rise up and rest on his head as he realizes what he has just accomplished: a fourth title for him and for the Crimson. And right on cue, the team floods through the plexiglass door, swarming their hero — their champion — jumping onto him and collectively collapsing onto the floor as one big pile.
In recognition of his exceptional season and overall career, this Crimson ace was awarded the Skillman Award by the CSA — the highest honor in collegiate squash for an individual athlete. A coalition of coaches determines the recipient of this award annually, and it is always an athlete who embodies college squash skill and sportsmanship. Nominees are judged for the Skillman on criteria surrounding six areas: on-court poise and demeanor, skill level, and ability in squash, team play, contributions to college squash, leadership, and cooperation with players, coaches, and tournament officials. It is safe to say that Tarek excels in all fields. Tarek joins a very high company of Crimson Skillman Award winners, including last year's recipient, Victor Crouin ’22, and former Professional Squash Association World No. 1, Ali Farag ’14. Tarek, who boasts one of the most successful college squash careers ever, will go down in history as a Harvard squash legend, and one of the best to step on the college squash circuit.
Looking now to his future in squash, the 2023 graduate shows plenty of promise, already participating in PSA competitions alongside former Crimson stars Crouin and Farag, who are both active professional squash players, with the latter recently claiming another PSA world championship title this month. The Harvard squash program has been very successful at springboarding its athletes into successful professional squash careers. With talent and drive as special as his, Tarek will likely begin making noise professionally very soon. Until then, squash fans can reflect and revel in Marwan Tarek’s collegiate career and admire his fitting season finale that earns him the Male Athlete of the Year award for 2022-23.

Coming into collegiate athletics, an uncomfortable adjustment for many Division I athletes is no longer being in the starting lineup, playing in every game, or racking in the most minutes played.
For Bronte-May Brough, a first-year on Harvard’s top-notch field hockey team, it was quite the opposite.
Leading the team in games played (17), games started (17), goals (12), shots (73), game-winning goals (3), and overall points (25), the defender was at the heart of each game in the 2022 season. Despite this, she hands off most of the credit to her team.
“Field hockey is a team game,” the Uttoxeter, England native said. “Without the other 25 girls around me, the season wouldn't have even happened.”
Brough and other first-years on the team began their first season with the Crimson following a tremendous, history-making 2021 season by Harvard field hockey where it made it to the Final Four of the NCAA tournament, losing in a double overtime heartbreaker to Northwestern, who went on to win the entire tournament. This made the 2022 season very highly anticipated, one with high expectations and even higher standards — two things Brough was well aware of in moving across the Atlantic to Cambridge.
“I feel like most of that expectation was within the team and driven by us,” she stated. “Obviously, this season, we didn't quite achieve what we'd hoped. [It] all came down to the one Princeton game, and we didn't quite achieve that.”
Despite holding an impressive 13-4 record, in which all four losses were against top-15 opponents, Harvard fell short of the ending it had worked for, ending the season without an Ivy League championship nor a bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I Field Hockey Tournament. Instead, this right was granted to another Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) team, most likely Louisville or Wake Forest.
The Crimson had toppled Louisville in 2021 during the NCAA tournament to reach the quarterfinal round for only the second time in program history. At the time in 2022, Harvard was in a strong position to gain the bid, sitting at 16th place in the nation and holding a 0.765 winning percentage. Princeton had received an automatic bid from the Ivy League — which is given only one ticket — while eight other teams received at-large qualifiers, with four from the ACC and four from the Big Ten.
Historically, Princeton field hockey is the main rival of Harvard. Each year, the Ivy League title switches off between the two schools. In 2021, Harvard earned the title after a well-fought penalty shootout, ending the game at 2-1.
In 2022, Princeton had the advantage of an older squad, whereas many of Harvard’s starters and key players were first-years and sophomores who had not yet experienced the Harvard-Princeton intensity — one where Ivy titles and NCAA tournament bids are at stake.
This year, Brough and her classmates will have more experience in playing in Tiger territory and are motivated to earn the bid they missed out on last Fall.
“We have Princeton week, which is the week before the Princeton game, [where] we [are] especially driven towards the game, adapting our training sessions, but mostly like focusing on ourselves and what we're going to control,” described Brough about the way Harvard prepares for the Princeton game.
“I think the team deals with it really, really well in a way that it's more excitement rather than nerves — everyone's really up for it,” continued the Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
“That was such a different vibe that I was getting from the team that week, everyone was so excited, so ready,” Brough said. “I think everyone loves the competition, which is such a nice feeling rather than the other. Everyone's out there ready to go for it instead of shying away.”
There's no doubt that Harvard field hockey is fired up about the way its season ended so abruptly last fall and that it will return in full force in August. Once considered the underdogs, they are far from underdogs.
Following Harvard’s surprising lost chance at an NCAA tournament run, the NCAA will change the way the single Ivy League bid to the tournament is chosen: rather than the Ivy League tournament deciding both the named Ivy Champion and NCAA ticket holder, the two will be mutually exclusive.
The Ivy League will now have a regular season champion — the Ivy Champion — and an Ivy League tournament will follow, which decides who gets a bid to the nation’s Division I tournament. If Harvard wins in the regular season and loses the tournament, there is still a chance it can receive an at-large bid from the NCAA, given that it would still be the Ivy League Champion.
“We all know we want to go further and potentially win, so that's what we're aiming for,” Brough said. “Before, [we] were considered underdogs, and [we are] trying to adapt to ‘Oh wait, maybe we're not underdogs anymore.’ That mindset is kind of hard, but I think we're getting there.”
After beating ranked opponents and playing well-matched games against many other schools, such as Saint Joseph’s University, Maryland, and the University of Connecticut, the Crimson knows that it has what it takes to make statement victories and gain an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
“The feeling of disappointment when we didn't get a bid for the NCAA, taking it through to next year, we have a really strong list of teams we are planning for next fall,” Brough said. “Taking that feeling into every game is going to be really important for the team instead of letting others decide whether we get through the NCAAs, making sure we win the Ivies and the Ivy Tournament, ensuring we get in on our own is going to be massive, I think.”
And Brough will continue doing just that and more that this fall as she embarks on another impressive season with Harvard — possibly, one with more shots and goals scored than she already has racked up — but definitely one with more confidence, skills, and knowledge in how to play her best game in collegiate field hockey.

Carrie Moore’s career as Crimson basketball coach tipped off to a tremendous start in the 2022-23 season. In her first year at the head of the program, the former Western Michigan standout and retired professional basketball player led the team to a 9-5 Ivy League record and a deep run in the WNIT tournament — one that made program history.
“Unity, grit, integrity, and joy,” Moore said. “If you look back and you watch our games, [...] you’ll be able to witness a lot of unity, a lot of joy, you will have seen some really gritty moments and you’ll just really believe in the fact that we have a ton of integrity within our program.”
Moore and her staff settled on these four principles before the preseason began, and they carried the team through the trials and tribulations of the season.
“We definitely nailed those down into our culture,” senior co-captain Maggie McCarthy added.
Establishing this new culture was a top priority for the team. As the College’s first new coach in 40 years, the arrival of Moore and her staff offered an opportunity for a program-wide refresh, and as they set goals, they aimed high.
“That championship focus,” McCarthy said. “We always wanted to win games, but coming in from a coaching staff that expected you to give your all every time, [we began] realizing that it all comes down to little things, and that’s what wins championships.”
The Crimson did all the little things but ended up heartbreakingly short of an Ivy championship title.
After stunning Columbia with a 72-65 overtime win in the first round of Ivy tournament play, Harvard faltered in the final, ultimately falling to a fourth-quarter Princeton comeback, 48-54.
Despite the strength of the conference, only the champions landed a spot in March Madness, leaving the Crimson with a spot in the WNIT.
In that tournament, the team tore through Towson, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Rhode Island before falling to conference foe Columbia in the Great Eight.
Though disappointing, these losses did not define the season. Persistence and resilience were far greater headlines. Young players stepped into big roles, and grit carried the group through tough stretches of injury.
In fact, “[injuries] benefitted us later in the year in the playoffs because we could play different lineups that we had to play with,” McCarthy said. Adversity forced “team growth and making up for some of the experience that we might have lacked in some areas towards the end of the year.”
Moore’s championship mindset and perfectionist drive trace to a growing love of the game and a personal understanding of the grind.
The Michigan native put together a remarkably impressive playing career. In her four years at Western Michigan University, the guard amassed a program record of 2,224 points. In her senior year, she even led the entire country in points-per-game, averaging 24.5.
A competitive dancer until discovering basketball midway through middle school, Moore remembers her quick progress and discovery of joy on the court.
Of her prowess, Moore said, “[It] totally took off and [I] started to fall in love with it more and more each day.”
Love and excellence brought Moore two WNBA contracts — Phoenix Mercury and Chicago Sky — then all the way to Poland for a one-year stint with the professional team KSSSE AZA PWSZ Gorzow Wielkopolski.
In time, she was subbed off to take a new spot on the sideline, adjusting to a coaching role that has taken her around the country. Since the end of her playing days, Moore has been a part of the programs at Princeton, Creighton, the University of North Carolina, and, until accepting the Harvard position, Michigan.
Each stop through her coaching career has reinforced her purpose and passion.
“You've just got to figure out how to get other girls to play at their best. That was something that I really wanted to master,” Moore said. “[To] give back to the game that gave me so much, [and to] inspire younger players the way that my coaches inspired me to be great.”
Moore is only the fourth women’s basketball coach in Harvard history, and her direct predecessor put together a tough act to follow. Kathy Delaney-Smith was the leader in Lavietes for forty years, compiling a conference record of 367-168, winning eleven league titles, and making six NCAA appearances.
Despite the fact that Delaney-Smith coached Harvard for more years than Moore has been alive, the newcomer already has the veteran beat in one category: since joining the Princeton staff in 2009, Moore has been a part of eight trips to the tournament.
Princeton, Creighton, UNC, and Michigan all made it to the big dance with her help. In 2022, Michigan took a No. 3 seed all the way to the Elite Eight.
In other words, Moore knows what it takes to be great. Her championship focus has already taken root, and she is confident that her crew can compete with the best. Securing an Ivy Championship and punching a ticket to March Madness are first up on the agenda.
“We’ve definitely got the pieces,” she said. “Learning how to win those [big] games — that takes time.”
“I think we are well on our way."

Harvard track and field has had a dominant three seasons this year, creating a powerhouse within its sprints and distance group. At the head of this distance dominance was sophomore Graham Blanks, a Georgia native who has taken Harvard and the Ivy League by storm.
Blanks began the season as Harvard’s No. 2 returning runner at the 8K distance and its top seed at the 10K, having posted times of 23:41 and 29:21 in the year prior.
With the regular season consisting of 8K’s and five-mile races, Blanks and junior distance runner Acer Iverson formed one of the best two-man duos across the country. The pair snared top-30 finishes at both the OSU Cowboy Jamboree and the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational against fields containing the best runners in the country before moving into postseason play, beginning with the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in New York, N.Y.
Facing off against conference rivals for the Ivy League crown, Blanks and Iverson replicated their regular season dominance, claiming the top-two individual spots in the Ivy League against the talented Princeton and Cornell squads. Blanks finished in 24:04.1 over the 5-mile Van Cortlandt Park course.
At the front of the pack, Blanks and Iverson tactically broke away from their competition near the midpoint of the race to become the first finishers of the race.
“It was basically just to sit in the pack in the first 6K or so,” said Blanks about his coach’s advice going into the race. “There’s a really big hill called Cemetery Hill, which is kind of like a renowned hill in the cross-country world in the U.S., and that was kind of where we were gonna make our move.”
“So, [we] let our competitors do all the hard work during the race and then put a big surge up that hill, which is already hard enough,” Blanks recalled. “That’s what I did when we hit that hill, and Acer just followed right along with me, and we only had one other guy challenge us from Princeton, and then on the downhill we were able to shake him loose.”
Despite these performances and strong races from first-year Vivien Henz and senior David Melville, the Crimson came up just short of Princeton 41-38, losing the team title to the Tigers for the second-straight year.
“We were looking to win the [Ivy] League, hopefully,” Blanks said. “We had a really good program, we’d run a few good races that season. We knew it would be tight with Princeton at the top, so the goal individually was to win the race or just get the first two spots with Acer, which we were able to do which was great.”
“Definitey a sense of accomplishment crossing the line with him, and getting to turn around and watch as our guys came in,” he remarked. “But when the dust settled, we lost by two points which hurt a little bit. It put some fire underneath us. But it was definitely in retrospect probably our best race that year as a team.”
After Blanks’ performance at the Heptagonals, he then raced at the NCAA Regional Championships, and came out with a win at 29:14.00 seconds. His first-place finish earned him a spot to compete and on the national stage in the 10K at Stillwater, Okla.
“I love the NCAA cross country meets,” Blanks claimed. “[It’s] definitely ‘the best day of the year,’ [which] is what I tell all the guys on our team.”
“The year before in Tallahassee, I had a really good race by the standards of how my season went,” he remembered. “So I was looking forward to hopefully doing something pretty big and [match] that this year. I didn’t really have a season that would indicate where I would finish that day.”
For Blanks, the change in competition scenery between the Ivy League conference and the National League helped his racing.
“It's actually kind of nice being in such a competitive conference, which brings along a lot of pressure, especially with how few competitors there are,” said Blanks about the different racing environments. “There’s no hiding from any mistakes when you’re racing a small field like in the Ivy League.”
“It’s nice to get into the NCAAs, where you’ve got hundreds of people from all around the country, and you can really just kind of focus on flowing with the race, putting yourself in spots that you need to without being seen, and without having to worry about team tactics as much,” he added.
Blanks put that racing strategy to the test and ended up running 28:58:40 seconds to earn sixth place in the nation. With this time, he earned himself a personal best in the event.
“The goal for me is always to win. I wanted to put myself in a position where I’d be fighting for that win in the last half mile,” Blanks said.
“It worked out pretty well — I had to make a few decisions, there was a split in the front pretty early on, and I didn’t want to risk going with a hot pace if I didn’t know I’d be able to hold it,” he reflected. “So, three people went ahead and I was able to hang on to that chase pack and fight on for that fourth spot, and ended up getting sixth, which I was ecstatic about, and I think my coach was as well.”
Blanks’s sixth-place finish at NCAAs earned him First-Team All-American status, an honor that’s awarded to athletes who finish in the top 15 places.
“It felt good,” said Blanks about his sixth-place finish. “It was self-reassurance. I’d like to imagine that all the best runners in the country think they are the best, and I do think I’m pretty good as well, so it was nice to get a result and finish in the single digits at NCAAs.”
“It was definitely a big confidence booster,” he added. “I would credit that race to a lot of my success this track season because it brought a lot of self-belief that I might not have had up to that point.”
With Blanks’ finish, combined with the efforts of the rest of his teammates, Harvard finished 17th at NCAAs, six places higher than their ranking coming into the meet. The Crimson also finished as the top Ivy League program in the nation.
“I was lucky enough to finish on a high note,” said Blanks about the end of his season. “I had to reset going into the track season, but for me, it was a pretty smooth transition just because I had that excitement.”
“This year we had a much greater team mindset on the track team than we’d had years before, just because I think with the Ivy League Championships, we were able to show our guys back home, not necessarily on the distance team, but sprints, throws and jumps as well, that we’re here to compete this year,” he added. “I think we set the tone for the team.”
Blanks continued on through the indoor and outdoor track season, setting new records at Harvard and in the Ivy League, including in the men’s indoor mile and 3K, as well as the men’s outdoor 5K. He also earned the indoor Ivy League title in the men’s 3K and 5K, and the outdoor Ivy League title in the 5K and 10K. His times have already qualified for the NCAA Regionals, where his season will continue.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Theresa Moore is not only a decorated Ivy League track star but a storyteller committed to shedding light on those whose tales have not been told. The former Harvard track and field captain has been an influential member of many communities beyond the track squad, including ESPN and now her own production company, T-Time Productions.
As a child, Moore had a passion for all sports. She and her two siblings played in various youth leagues in Rhode Island. She continually found herself on the softball diamond, the basketball court, the volleyball court, or the ice rink. Her brother was an avid hockey player and the family every winter built their own rink in the backyard for the kids to skate.
Playing multiple sports helped Moore develop a high level of athleticism. While she was great at all the sports she played, she excelled the most in track and field. In high school, she dominated competition in her state, winning ten state championships in the long jump and the 100 and 200-meter dash. Her athletic career coincided with the passage of Title IX, which afforded her many opportunities that past female athletes did not have — opportunities of which she took advantage.
“To find out that just 15 years earlier, that you had people that weren't even able to use the track at the same time as the men at Harvard was just crazy to me,” Moore reflected. “It's really afforded me opportunities from friendships, from life skills, from travel.”
The life lessons she learned in her youth as an athlete contributed to the development of her deep passion for athletics, which continued through college. Moore’s impressive high school career earned her offers to both Stanford and Harvard. Ultimately, the East Coast native chose to stay close to home and continued her track career at Harvard.
In Cambridge, Moore was a textbook example of what it means to be a student-athlete. She was a superlative sprinter, a teammate, all while being a hard-working student. Track and field — one of the largest teams at Harvard — most often calls for individual competition. Balancing this individual and team mentality is difficult for its participants, yet Moore understood this challenge very well.
“I'm having a great day, but the team is still losing. So let's figure out how we get other people to have their personal best,” said Moore when discussing how she balanced her personal and team achievements during the competition.
Her skillset earned her the title of team captain as a senior. In addition to being a supportive teammate, she sure was a fast one, winning the 100-meter dash at the Ivy League Championships in 1985.
On the other side of the Charles River, Moore spent her time as a resident of Kirkland House. Like many students, she started out as an economics concentrator before switching to history.
“I loved history. I love the stories. I love the narrative,” Moore said.
This passion for storytelling manifested into a career in media and production. She found her way into a job with ESPN. At ESPN, she worked with various departments including sales, advertising, media, and programming. There she created the series “The Block Party” and the documentary “Images in Black and White,” the latter of which was a part of ESPN’s Black History Month program. The film has been nominated for awards including the Peabody, Sports Emmy, Billie, and the NAACP Image awards.
In 2006, Moore founded her own production company — T-Time Productions — where she could lead in telling the untold stories of sports to the public.
“I just found a way that I could take my love of history and storytelling and take sports and combine them into my work and so that's kind of what we're doing.”
Third and Long, a T-Time Productions documentary, explores the history of African Americans in the NFL. Both educational and entertaining, the film is a great characterization of Moore’s and the larger company’s work.
While she has certainly mastered the domain of sports, she has also produced and written pieces that go beyond the world of sports which includes the documentary License to Thrive: Title IX at 35.
Throughout her athletic and professional career, Moore has been dedicated to the betterment of the student experience in the Harvard community, especially for students of color.
“We have the responsibility, to make the future even better, for the generations behind me. We should always be pushing and making sure that change is underway for the better,” Moore said.
“I feel that responsibility to the students that came behind because I know, as they say, I stand on the shoulders of people who were there before me.”
Today she is a Chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers Visiting Committee for Athletics and also serves on other boards at the Harvard Varsity Club. Not only did Moore contribute to the Harvard community as one of the school's fastest sprinters in history, but through continuing to support the University by giving voices to all students and creating a more inclusive campus.

Some Harvard students devote most of their time to studies, others spend hours split between the classroom and the field, while others begin their morning in one jersey and end their day in another. Well, just one: graduating senior and women’s basketball captain Maggie McCarthy.
In a college experience defined by waking up near dawn for lacrosse practice, heading back across the river for class, rushing to the dining hall for to-go dinner, and racing back to Lavietes Pavilion for basketball practice, McCarthy’s two-sport life will soon come to an end.
“I tell my friends, jokingly, they never saw me semester-time at Harvard,” she laughed.
The Medfield, Mass. native was initially recruited to Harvard for basketball, a program to which she has made immense contributions and which made program history this year by making it to the Great Eight of the NCAA’s WNIT. Her high school experience was shaped by the routine of sports and schoolwork, something she wanted to continue this regimen through college athletics.
McCarthy’s parents and her two older brothers are graduates of Amherst College, a Division III school, and somewhere she always thought she would attend. That was until her freshman year of high school at Medfield — where she was playing soccer, basketball, and lacrosse — Harvard reached out to her, though she wasn’t completely sold on the Ivy League.
“I just loved Amherst and thought I was going to follow in my family's footsteps,” she recounted.
But what ultimately gave Harvard the green light was her conversations with the legendary Harvard basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith.
“As they kept talking to me, and I kept trying to make the right decision, ultimately, it was Kathy Delaney-Smith, who was the basketball coach at the time.”
Delaney-Smith — a 40-year veteran of the Harvard basketball program — racked up 630 victories, eleven Ivy League championship victories, and six NCAA tournament appearances during her time as head coach. Though she retired last year, new head coach Carrie Moore has not disappointed in her first season at the helm.
It was strong and talented powerhouses in the field of collegiate athletics — in addition to world-renowned academics and opportunities like no other — that locked in McCarthy’s decision to play at Harvard, a common sentiment shared by many Ivy League athletes.
“That's why I made the decision,” she said. “I wanted to be surrounded by great and impressive people all the time, especially the female role models like Kathy, and then Devon [Wills], the lacrosse coach now.”
In the 2018-19 season, her freshman year with the Crimson, McCarthy only played on the basketball team. But after basketball season finished, something was missing: her natural routine of practice, school, eat, practice, repeat. So, McCarthy followed her gut and walked on to the women’s lacrosse team her sophomore fall in 2019.
However, the Covid-19 pandemic stripped McCarthy of what would have been her first year in college playing two sports, let alone halting the women’s basketball team's 2020 playoff run. She then took a gap year in 2020-21, making the long-awaited 2021-22 season — the Ivy League’s official return to collegiate athletic competition — her first time playing in games for both basketball and lacrosse.
“Sophomore year, I was following my instinct — and I'm so glad that I did.”
The captain has since split her time between the two sports, which requires her to plan her weeks according to how many hours the NCAA allows her to practice and play for even multi-sport athletes, which is 20 hours per week.
“If you just look on paper, I don't even know how many hours I've spent over the river. So much of my experience [at Harvard], I'm learning in class a lot,” McCarthy said. “But the number of hours of the day [I spend at] basketball, I'd be there for like five hours, [and] in lacrosse would be like two hours in the same day because I would go to lacrosse in the mornings to watch even if I couldn't play and [then] go to basketball.”
The two teams are very different: while basketball has nearly thirteen active players, women’s lacrosse has over thirty names on the roster. This year, as captain of women’s basketball, McCarthy had to balance the dynamic of leading one squad and then switching to another with more voices, and different captains, but with the same senior status.

Last year, she worked her way up into the starting lineup for lacrosse, currently making her a starting player for both teams. The avid athlete heads into each new lacrosse season fresh off a playoff mindset from basketball, an experience she tries to share with the lacrosse team.
“Going through a whole long season with basketball, where it's a smaller team, you're getting to know like the ins and outs of every player and kind of how teams work, and the ups and downs of the season,” McCarthy reflected. “Being able to bring what I learned from my basketball season to lacrosse, especially [since] I would have just gone through playoffs — how that is, and the heat of that — and coming into lacrosse where they haven't quite reached that point yet.”
This switch wasn’t the easiest to pick up on, however. Some of the sliding and movement skills between basketball and lacrosse are pretty transferable, but the one hump McCarthy had to get over was the stick skills. She turned to a simple practice familiar to many athletes that only requires three things: a stick, a ball, and a wall.
“Junior year, I hadn't picked up a stick since like, senior year of high school. So I was like, ‘Okay, gotta get the wall ball,’” she remembered. “I remember during J-term, winter term, we're here for basketball. I would get a stick on the wall.”
“I think I did it outside of Winthrop [House] one time and it was hitting someone’s room, and they came out and were like ‘Can you stop?’” the senior captain joked.
Though this year might have been smoother since she had a year of playing both sports under her belt, an unforeseen challenge presented itself to McCarthy during the start of her basketball season: injury. It was the first time she had been truly injured during sports.
In November, during an 85-63 loss to Purdue at the team’s Cancun Challenge in Mexico, the captain fractured her foot in an unlucky play while stepping on an opponent’s foot when changing directions, though she played on the fracture for the remainder of the game. The stint put her on the bench for the remainder of December.
Shortly after returning in January, McCarthy injured her wrist during a 66-53 win over Cornell. In an attempt to draw a charge on defense, a Big Red player knocked McCarthy down to the court, forcing her to use her wrist to break the fall. Despite the break, she wrapped it up and returned to play the remainder of the game somewhat one-handed.
This was the first time McCarthy had been truly out of competition. This time, it forced her to step back and reflect on how deep her love for sports ran.
“I remember having a conversation with my brother and my mom, and I was like, ‘I just love competing and love sports,’” she said. “I can't imagine my life or my future without [them]. That’s why I decided to apply to graduate school.”
After working with the NCAA Eligibility Center, McCarthy discovered she had a fifth year of eligibility to use due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Massachusetts native will take her talents to the women’s lacrosse program at Duke University.
One dream McCarthy had — shared by her teammates and coaches in the women’s basketball program this season — was to win the Ivy League title. With a 20-12 overall record, supported by a 9-5 conference record, and a great deal of agility built from bouncing back from consistent injuries, the team’s chances appeared very strong.
In a devastating six-point loss to the Princeton Tigers, the Crimson couldn’t pull it off, granting Princeton its fourth Ivy title and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
“Losing the Ivy championship this year was terrible,” McCarthy reflected. “We had success, high hopes.”
The silver lining, however, was the way her team came together after the loss.
“I remember I had a tougher time than I ever had losing a game,” she remembered. “Usually, I feel like I can get over it pretty quickly because you can move on, but I think it was also [because of] being a senior.”
“Everybody was upset, but like the way we came together as a team, I realized [that] a game is a game, that’s something out of our control,” she continued. “But just focusing on what I can control and what has been so valuable to me over the years, it was the funny memories that we made, even after losing together as a team. Going on that run in the WNIT that we had this year in the playoffs. That kind of gave us the perspective to give it all you have in every game.”
McCarthy will take this new, optimistic perspective not only to her new team in North Carolina, but the rest of her life — a sentiment and experience that forms many collegiate student-athletes, especially the ones here at Harvard, who spend much of their time on both sides of the Charles River.
“[The] learning experiences and relationships and memories built across the river are invaluable.”

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Earlier this month, Harvard women’s lacrosse’s sophomore defender Grace Taylor earned her second All-Ivy Honorable Mention accolade as a key member of the defense that led the Crimson to the Ivy League women’s lacrosse tournament. Impressive, yes, but even more impressive is how Taylor was using her stick as a cane less than six months earlier.
The Dedham, Mass. native is the middle of three children, in a family of avid athletes. Her mother played collegiate lacrosse and while it wasn’t her favorite growing up, Taylor was enticed by the speed and aggression of the game she now loves. When deciding where she would further her lacrosse career, she was drawn to the culture head coach Devon Wills was building at Harvard.
“I wanted to be part of a team that was like creating a new standard. And then I also have a younger sister, so I really wanted to be close to her. I wanted her to be able to come to my games and to be part of her life as well,” Taylor said.
Having her family close would prove to be indispensable when last August — less than an hour before fulfilling her duties of a Peer Advising Fellow to the class of 2026 at first-year orientation — Taylor was diagnosed with an aggressive variant of papillary thyroid cancer. She had been sent by her primary care physician to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) after they discovered swelling in her thyroid at a routine visit. Taylor had prior experience with injuries, but there is no game plan for a Division I student-athlete battling cancer.
Following her diagnoses were countless medical decisions to be made. For most people, the easier choice would be to step away from school and sports and focus on their health. Instead, Taylor leaned into her communities for support, remaining enrolled for her sophomore fall.
“People thought I was crazy. They told me I was crazy, but I think it was like, I knew if I came home, I would be so wrapped up in my own misery and pain,” commented Taylor when asked about the decision. “I think it was like partially the distraction and then it was like a big part was being part of my team. And I wanted to fight to be able to compete again.”
In mid-September, Taylor underwent two procedures to have the cancer and metastasis removed. After being bedridden for two weeks postoperatively, she commuted to Cambridge. While there were certainly moments when she doubted herself, she made it work with the support of her family.
“I'm fortunate that I have parents that were able to support me and sacrifice for me. My mom was getting her master's and she took a semester off so [that] I didn't have to,” Taylor recounted.
Her second family, Harvard women’s lacrosse, as well as her roommate, both played a huge role in supporting Taylor through her diagnosis and treatment. Taylor was clear in her plans of returning to competition early on and her team backed her up every step of the way.
“The biggest thing my coaches did was believe in me and even if they doubted me, they never showed that,” Taylor said. “I think that was really important because so many people around me were starting to doubt [me].”
“I think on the days that it's really hard, it's easy to amplify the doubts, but I had coaches and teammates who believed in me that I was able to like to amplify their voices,” Taylor said.
Over winter recess, when she underwent radiation treatment, which left her isolated for the holidays, two gift baskets were delivered to Taylor — one from her Harvard teammates and another from Columbia’s women’s lacrosse program. Stripped of much of her strength, but determined to return to lacrosse, she turned her sights to the 2023 season.
Taylor adopted and began sharing the motto “We Can Do Hard Things.” When asked where this phrase came from, she shared it was a feeling, an adage she had adopted as an athlete, not as a cancer patient.
“I can do anything for 24 hours. Sports showed me that I can compete for 24 hours. I can endure for 24 hours. You don't have to go win a marathon or win a race — we can do hard things,” Taylor shared.
“It's just like taking one step forward, sometimes I just had to literally crawl forward, and sometimes other people had to carry me,” she said. “It's not like you're doing something hard alone —you're doing something hard with a support system, with a group of people that can move you forward.”
On February 19th, five and half months after being diagnosed, Taylor returned to the field for the Crimson in its season opener against Michigan. She had been cleared by her physicians and trainers for “diet and exercise,” thereby defining a return-to-play plan for an athlete battling cancer. After months of deservedly maintaining her privacy within a close circle, she decided it was time to use her story to help others.
At MGH, Taylor is a part of the Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Program (AYA) which was formed under Dr. Annah Abrams. The program aims to acknowledge the unique circumstances that young adults face in making their own medical choices and leading social and developing lives. Harvard women’s lacrosse decided to honor the program that had done so much for one of its own by dedicating its April 15 home game against Yale. Taylor and her teammates were able to raise over $6500 for the campaign.
“That was one of the happiest days of my life, I think,” Taylor reflected. “I love beating Yale, but [the AYA] program has been really instrumental in helping me balance a lot of like the nuances of being a cancer patient, [of] trying to be a student and an athlete.”
She also hoped to create a new narrative and community surrounding cancer in Division I lacrosse and athletics. Taylor wanted to help create a blueprint where there hadn’t been one — a place for other athletes to turn for some much-needed guidance that she had been missing.
“I think being back on the field and showing myself and other people that I could play gave me the courage to share my story,” she said. “When I was going through it, I had no one to look up to, and I didn't even know how to come back from surgery —I didn't know how to come back to radiation.”
“There were like a lot of things that I wish I knew or that I could have changed, but I had no one to talk about it with.”
Following the game, Taylor heard from many other athletes who embraced her message of “We Can Do Hard Things,” receiving countless direct messages on Instagram and even a message from the HEADstrong Foundation — a non-profit organization dedicated to helping families affected by cancer — which offered its support.
While Taylor’s battle is not over, her perseverance and initiative have inspired others and pioneered a support-based forum. She has blazed her own path forward, leaving no room for those who doubted her or held her back. She has had hard days — some of the darkest of her life —but Taylor has also gained a new perspective on lacrosse and life.
“There was a moment where I was told I was really sick and I had a moment where I was like ‘Nothing I've done matters,’” she recounted. “It's like, the grades aren't going to save you like nothing that I've really done felt significant except for the love that I had for my people and the love that they had for me.”
She also experienced this shift in perspective on the field, saying, “To compete is such a privilege — that's been part of the culture that we're building [here at] Harvard. [Harvard] women's lacrosse is like, ‘We are hungry to be [here], we want to compete, we sacrifice a lot,’ and I think like I had to fight like hell to be able to return to the fields.”
Taylor played in all but three games for the Crimson this spring and led her team in groundball pickups — six of which she made against Yale. The sophomore has two seasons left, but she has already made an immeasurable impact on those around her by leaning into those who know her best — her teammates and her family — despite the unknowable challenges the past year has thrown at her.
