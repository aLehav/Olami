After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
KATHMANDU, Nepal—I am standing next to the ruins of Dharahara. This tower, built almost two centuries ago, was once the tallest structure in the Kathmandu Valley. Over the years, the tower has been a witness to multiple political and social changes.
In the recent earthquake, Dharahara crumbled to the ground, killing seven people as it fell.
Along with the tower, several temples in the three major “durbar squares” of Kathmandu valley have been destroyed. The squares are plazas where old royal palaces and temples stand, and have become central to the public lifestyle. But now the pedestals where towering temples once rose are empty and lifeless.
This architectural heritage contributed to the bulk of tourism in Kathmandu. With the temples gone and the palaces defaced, the tourism industry has been affected. At the same time, Kathmandu has lost icons its residents cherished.
Since all available resources in the city were used for humanitarian aid following the earthquake, many ruin sites were left unguarded for too long. During this absence of oversight, pedestrians were seen to have walked away with the old bricks from the ruins.
The artifacts once housed inside those temples were even more tempting. The intricately carved windows, the bells, and the idols of Hindu gods are valuable and could garner a substantial sum in illegal antiquity markets.
Local volunteers have been trying to guard the rubble, but their best efforts have proven inadequate. The government has started assessing the losses, though it is doubtful that all parts of the monuments can be accounted for.
The government does plan to rebuild its fallen heritage. Swarnim Waglé, a member of Nepal’s National Planning Commission and an alum of Harvard’s Kennedy School, said that the government considers it its responsibility to restore the structures the earthquake destroyed, many of which are listed as UNESCO world heritage sites. And fortunately, the artisan skills responsible for the temples’ beauty have been passed down through generations, and Nepal has many indigenous craftsmen in a position to rebuild what has been lost.
Still, the inevitable juxtaposition of wood carvings with modern construction materials has raised concerns. While it is necessary to make the rebuilt structures resistive to similar natural tragedies, it is also important to make sure that concrete and steel do not defile historic facades.
As with all disasters, the earthquake has not only taken lives, but it has also destroyed history. But unlike material property or economy, history does not easily recover from the ruins. What Nepal will make of its marred treasure remains to be seen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s 2015-2016 holiday plans are set.
The Crimson will compete in the Notre Dame-hosted Shillelagh Tournament during Thanksgiving weekend (Nov. 27-28) in South Bend, Ind., before ringing in the New Year at the University of Minnesota’s Mariucci Classic (Jan. 1-2) in Minneapolis.
While Harvard has yet to announce its official 2015-16 schedule, Notre Dame debuted its full schedule last week, and Minnesota debuted its schedule on Wednesday.
The Crimson will be a first-time participant in the Shillelagh Tournament, which Notre Dame has held five times since 2009. Harvard will face the Fighting Irish in the first-round Friday nightcap and will play either Western Michigan or Rensselaer the next day.
Harvard’s participation in the Mariucci Classic, meanwhile, will mark the team’s first appearance in the 25-year-old tournament since the 2004-2005 season and its fourth appearance overall. The Crimson will play Ferris State on New Year’s Day before meeting either Minnesota or UConn in either the final or consolation the next day.
The Shillelagh Tournament will be held at Notre Dame’s Compton Family Ice Arena (capacity: 5,022), where Nebraska-Omaha eliminated the Crimson in the first round of last year’s NCAA tournament. The Golden Gophers’ Mariucci Arena (capacity: 10,000) will host the Classic.
With the Crimson guaranteed to participate in the 64th annual Beanpot in February, the 2015-2016 season will be the first in which a Ted Donato-coached team will compete in three midseason tournaments. The tournaments will also allow Harvard to match up against teams from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, National Collegiate Hockey Conference, and Big Ten—conferences that were unrepresented on the Crimson’s most recent regular season slate.
