After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
These past few days, my thoughts have been drowned by the violence of the news —  bullets, bomb threats, bodies. Erasure, marginalization, cruelty. While the world falls apart around us, the sadistic laughter coming from the Oval Office seems only to get louder, deafening, almost like shrieks that our ears were not made to process.
As I bear witness, as the videos and headlines and articles and raw pain make their way into my bloodstream, I feel my cells transforming into sparks which fuel the fire that burns inside me. Each tear I see on the news becomes a flare, each story of fear and trauma and pain intensifies the rage. I find some comfort in its warmth; anger is nothing new for me, and the familiar sensations activate the muscle memory from my Semester of Rage, the four months I spent living  — breathing, eating, sleeping, advocating, dancing, writing — incensed, embracing the flames fully and allowing them to engulf me. Now, I fall into old patterns, etching dark words into my journal, waking up drenched in sweat, snapping at people I love, melting into hopelessness.
I know this anger is hardly sustainable. My Semester of Rage was quickly followed by my Semester of Struggle where I became forced to care gently for my singed insides. My therapist’s office on the fourth floor of Harvard University Health Services became a space for healing, where together we applied salve and gauze to my rougher wounded parts. The intense emotional whiplash of it all required critical self-reflection. I had no choice; parts of me were burned beyond repair and parts of me were dying, festering in hatred.
In the midst of this healing process, I rediscovered Martin Luther King, Jr. as an overwhelmingly complex and intensely human figure, one who had reckoned also with his role in the face of catastrophe, one who had come out of these struggles more unwavering and more radical. This King looked vastly different from the sanitized version my education had previously acquainted me with. I began reading his work voraciously and found, very quickly, a spiritual guide and mentor. Central to King’s moral philosophy is the idea that by embodying love in ourselves as individuals, we can begin to address treat the injustices and traumas that have global impact.
This past week, I’ve felt myself sinking back into a destructive, loathful anger in response to the hatred shown to my siblings in solidarity. So many parts of me want to flip desks and cuss and scream in the faces of those who do harm unto the people I care about, harm unto me. But, I know that if I stay in this place for too long, the gentler and joyous parts of myself — the parts I must tend to — may not make it out alive. King recognized this also: “Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence. It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and the objective center of your life.”
Moments of crisis call into question our most deeply held values. I’m asking myself what to do about recent catastrophes, how this collective society will respond. I see a response formulating already, a troubling one: The prosecutors against the man who shot 11 innocent people in their synagogue in Pittsburgh plan to pursue the death penalty. Death provokes violence, anger provokes anguish, hatred provokes more of it. The fires of rage scorch our espoused principles of the disavowal of violence, commitment to redemption, and respect for humanity. We fall deeper and deeper into a moral illness that blinds us.
Our fundamental challenge in these moments of crisis is to process the death, anger, and hatred this world hands to us and find a way, still, to respond with deep love. This is the answer King gives us: To save our souls, we must push back against our deepest instincts to pursue revenge and retribution and instead find a path to individual and collective redemption. We must respond with agape — a universal and all encompassing love, a love for all, a love for our enemies.
And it is a challenge. Loving those who hurt us can be immensely painful. And the ironic unfairness of it all never fails to sink under my skin, to ignite further fires inside of me. In the fights for justice I have been a part of, it is always those who are most marginalized — queer women of color — that are asked to do the grunt work, the personal transformation required to bend the moral arc of the universe.
Why does the burden of progress fall on me and those I stand in solidarity with? Why is no one else implicated in our struggle? What do the traumas and catastrophes we internalize do to our insides before we transform them into more beautiful things to give to the world? And how are we expected to maintain our humanity, to honor our raw emotions, if we are so often simply vessels for change? In the moments I confront these questions, I resent King. I know logically that he is right, that love is necessary in our fights for liberation, but still I am exhausted.
As I survey the destruction that has been taking place around me, though, I recognize that this is a burden that we must step up to bear, for no one else will. The survival of our moral spirit and the moral spirit of this society depends on it. And this way, leading with love, we can begin to fix our world.

As the Harvard admissions lawsuit proceeds, the College’s previously confidential admissions information has been made public. Based on these materials, we believe that despite the presence of unfortunate imperfections and perhaps implicit biases in the process, the College is making a strong effort to give each student a fair, holistic review.
This conclusion is based largely on the reality that the number of talented applicants deserving a spot at Harvard far exceeds the number that Harvard is able to admit. Given this harsh competition, SAT score and GPA become obsolete metrics of comparison when the majority of applicants have acceptable scores. Harvard is therefore hard-pressed to make its admissions process more “meritocratic” than it already is. As a result, the Admissions Office must use softer metrics to choose students that align with its values. As a private educational institution, Harvard should be allowed to make such value judgements in what will always be an imperfect science of predicting each applicant’s potential for success.
That being said, we do not in any way endorse racial discrimination, whether that be explicit or implicit. The evidence that Harvard could be systematically assigning lower “personality scores” to Asian Americans is therefore highly disturbing and should not be tolerated. As this lawsuit has made clear, more training for racial bias, explicit reminders that race cannot be considered in personality scores, and the hiring of admissions officers from diverse backgrounds are all important steps that Harvard must take. Most importantly, the admissions office must proactively and regularly review its performance in upholding the value of non-discrimination.
While there is certainly room for progress, a review of Harvard’s 2012 Casebook for admissions officers supports the conclusion that the College does not discriminate intentionally. Harvard makes a good-faith effort to get a complete understanding of its applicants prior to each admissions decision. For instance, the committee does not mindlessly accept letters of recommendation — instead, it calls the recommender in question, the school, and even the student to gain a fuller picture. This type of outreach is above and beyond what one would expect of a university with such a large pool of competitive applicants.
Although this trial has served as a good opportunity to understand the thought process of the admissions office, it is noteworthy that this newfound transparency may not level the playing field for applicants. We agree with Harvard’s assessment that providing this information may worsen inequality in the application process by giving wealthier students a greater edge. Knowing which character traits the University looks for will make it easier for expensive college counselors to perfect their services and give students from wealthy families an even greater boost. We thus call upon Harvard to continue its outreach to low-income and minority students and do whatever it can to erase barriers to success.

I love Harvard University Dining Services. This might be an uncontroversial statement to some people, but to those who have heard me expound, at length, my hatred for all dining hall-related foods — and for Annenberg Hall in particular— this statement might come as somewhat of a surprise.
But so far this year, I’ve eaten at least two meals a day, with the majority of these meals in the dining hall. I’ve also come up with a winding list of my favorite HUDS foods, a few of which are the dining hall's Tuscany chickpeas, spinach and garlic, Italian sausage subs, meatballs and spaghetti.
To emphasize the gravity of these statements, let me contextualize a little further. Contrast this to last year, when going to Annenberg (and therefore eating a proper meal) only once a day was the norm for me. And this was on weekdays, when I had class in the Yard — on weekends, in my room 500 miles away from the Yard in Pennypacker, I refused to entertain even the thought of Annenberg. On those days, it was time to crack open that trusty ramen stash, or a bag of the ever-reliable Deep River dill pickle chips occasionally sold at Lamont. (I’d buy 10 bags at a time).
This was in small part because of the distance from my room. Yes, I know, it’s barely a 10-minute walk. A seven-minute walk even, when I was really craving that Italian Wedding Soup or Tabbouleh. But, just think … seven minutes to get there, 14 minutes back and forth for dinner, 21 if you include coming back from lunch, 28 if you’re getting lunch and walking from your room … in the cold, dreary streets of Cambridge, past the squat, blocky Art Museum and the Carpenter Center, and the triangle of road that doesn’t have a sidewalk on one side — a fact that I always forget, to the detriment of the passing cars and my peace of mind — with no one to accompany me because my privileged friends have been blessed by the gods of the Freshman Dean’s Office to live in the Yard.
But, in large part, it was because I simply hated HUDS food: the vegetables that were rarely seasoned except for when they were excessively so, the green enchiladas, which had no discernable texture, Red’s Best Fresh Local Fish with Lemon Butter, Capers, and Parsley. No description needed.
In large part, it was because I hated Annenberg itself, with the noisy tables, the lines that, if you went at the wrong time — normal mealtime — would stretch out the doors and between the tables. The hundreds of strange faces, repeating the same words again and again. (What House are you in? What’s your major? What did you do over the summer / weekend / break? What classes are you taking?)
In large part, it was because I was homesick. The kitchen wasn’t a few steps away. I couldn’t cook the way I wanted to, or eat my mom’s food the way I wanted to, or see my sister, brother, mother, father, the way I wanted to. I couldn’t really go home — I mean, I could, technically, with a Greyhound bus and four-and-a-half hours — but not in the way I wanted to. Not in the way that mattered. That is, I wouldn’t truly be living there anymore — I was living here, in my dreary room with thin walls, seven (ten) minutes away from sustenance. I wouldn’t be living back home ever again. My home now was really my home, past-tense, my home, with the qualifier “childhood.” It was no longer the constant, the place to which I would return and recharge. That was now my dorm room, and I had better get used to that, I told myself, sternly, two months into the new school year.
Well, it took me the rest of the year to absorb that, and most of the summer too. But, when I came back to school this year, it was with a renewed drive, a concentrated effort to love that which I could not change, namely HUDS food. And it was with considerable surprise that I found it easy. It was easy to love the ever-reliable pasta bar, or the grill that always had my back (thanks Jose, Gary, Carlo, and Vinny!) , or the never-ending stock of Lactaid.
It was easy (or, at least, easier) to love Harvard now that I had accepted that, well, I wasn’t going back home anymore. And if I ever find myself craving my mom’s roselle fish soup or beef curry or fried noodles, I crack open my mini-fridge and dredge up some kimchi, maybe make some instant rice. Or, I head down to the Adams dining hall, where a bowl of Marshmallow Mateys will assuage the craving. Or, sometimes dinner is so good that I forget to crave my mom’s cooking, at least for a little while. To discover my love for HUDS was to discover the things about Harvard that made it feel more like a home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A handful of incarcerated youth traveled around Harvard's campus Thursday to learn about possible professional and educational paths they could pursue after their release from prison.
The delegation hailed from the Eliot Community Human Services, an organization that supports court-involved youth. Pedro R. De Abreu, a fellow at Harvard's Phillips Brooks House, and Keith A. Thompson, an assistant director at Eliot, set up the visit. De Abreu took two incarcerated youth and three Eliot Treatment Center staff members on a tour spanning several University schools and including stops at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, the Law School, the Graduate School of Design, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Thompson said he planned the trip in part because he wants the youth to think about career and educational opportunities they could pursue after their release.
"[The kids] have a lot of things set up for them out in the community, but I also was looking for an opportunity to show them something that they probably would never think of themselves that they really could do," he said.
The group viewed artwork at the Cooper Gallery and visited the Hip-Hop Archive & Research Institute as part of their trek. In the kids' eyes, De Abreu said, the Hutchins Center demonstrated Harvard’s commitment to minorities.
“They didn't think that Harvard would even care about African Americans in general, let alone about having a center of African American studies on campus," De Abreu said. "The message that they got is that hip-hop is an important part of… culture here in the United States, and we are honoring that.”
The group also visited the Law School, where they spoke with David J. Harris, the managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice. Harris spoke to the group about about issues ranging from community engagement to the justice system.
Harris said he wanted to show the two students that there is a role for them in society after they are released.
“We care about what happens to them, that we believe in them, and that we believe there’s a place for them and a contribution to make,” he said.
Thompson said he hopes the program allows kids to discover careers and pathways beyond what the juvenile detention center can offer them after their release. He said he wants the visit to Harvard to inspire the youth to work hard going forward.
“Us coming to Harvard, us feeling what Harvard really is about, and it's showing them that [the students] are regular people just like them,” he said. “If they got a little bit of dedication, a little bit of a want, a little bit of people supporting them, that this is very achievable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Drew G. Faust took the stand Thursday afternoon as the final witness in the Harvard admissions trial, spending most of her testimony defending initiatives she pursued during her 11 years in power to promote diversity across the University’s schools.
“I feel that my tenure has been committed in considerable part to expanding openness, access to Harvard,” Faust said. “There is no place for discrimination of any kind at Harvard.”
Though University President Lawrence S. Bacow now holds the school's top job, Faust — who stepped down in June 2018 after steering the University for over a decade — helmed Harvard through the 2014 filing of an unprecedented lawsuit that alleged the College discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Four years later, that suit — brought by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions — is now being litigated in a high-stakes and high-profile trial that could shape the fate of race-conscious admissions in the United States.
Faust is among the most high-profile witness to take the stand in the trial, which has drawn national media attention and revealed long-kept secrets of Harvard's notoriously private admissions process.
After Faust introduced herself to the judge, Harvard lead trial lawyer William F. Lee ’72 questioned the former president for nearly an hour Thursday. He asked the former president about established Supreme Court precedent that supports the College's admissions policies. The Supreme Court has ruled on three prior affirmative action cases; each of those rulings — in the University of California v. Bakke, Grutter v. Bollinger, and Fisher v. the University of Texas — upheld the use of race in admissions.
Harvard, alongside other major American universities, submitted amicus briefs in those three cases meant to back affirmative action. Faust said in court that the Supreme Court precedents “underscored” the importance of diversity in education.
“There are a wide range of types of diversity that matter to us,” Faust said. “Racial diversity is important because race is an element of importance in our society.”
SFFA lawyer John M. Hughes later grilled Faust about Harvard's 1920s-era discrimination against Jewish applicants; at the time, then-University President Abbot Lawrence Lowell debuted a system of admission meant to limit the number of Jews attending the school. Faust objected to SFFA’s claim that the anti-Semitic behavior has any bearing on current policies, adding she would not “make an equation” between the two processes.
“It was not a proud chapter in Harvard’s history,” Faust said.
In her testimony, Faust also canvassed several programs she spearheaded to promote diversity at Harvard, particularly emphasizing her execution and expansion of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. The initiative, which launched in 2004, currently provides aid to roughly 60 percent of students at the College and covers the full cost of attendance for around 20 percent.
The Financial Aid Initiative was “an absolute essential act” in order to fulfill Harvard’s mission, Faust said.
She spoke about prioritizing the program throughout the 2008 recession, during which she said she increased — rather than cut — financial aid programs.
Faust also testified about increasing racial diversity at the College, noting that her tenure saw a marked increase in the number of Asian-American students and faculty in Cambridge. Faust said SFFA’s claims of discrimination against Asian Americans are “completely at odds to the history of Harvard in recent decades.”
As one of her final initiatives as president, Faust convened a University-wide task force on inclusion and belonging. That task force, which included students, faculty, and administrators, issued a report on efforts to promote diversity in spring 2018. She appointed John S. Wilson — the former president of Morehouse College and a former member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers — as a senior adviser and strategist meant to help the president implement the task force recommendations.
Friday marks the final day of the trial’s regular proceedings. Lawyers for Harvard and SFFA are slated to deliver closing statements.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government Professor Michael J. Sandel spoke about the importance of civic education Thursday evening at a talk titled “Civic Education Goes Global.”
Sandel, a pioneer of and advocate for “massive open online courses,” highlighted the importance of creating a global community of respectful discourse through education. Bridget Terry Long, the dean of the Graduate School of Education and a professor of education and economics, moderated the conversation. The discussion formed part of the Askwith Forums, a public lecture series currently taking place at the Harvard School of Education.
In the discussion, Sandel said his goal is “to take the distance out of distance learning” and to replicate an engaging classroom experience for online learners.
The event opened with a video of a class he facilitated for the British Broadcasting Corporation in which 60 people from around the world vido-called in to debate the legality of hate speech.
One woman from Somalia advocated for outlawing hate speech and was backed by a Canadian, while another from the Netherlands found support from a South Korean in urging unimpeded free speech. Though people hailed from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds, each came ready to share and exchange ideas with an open mind.
“Once it became clear that lots of people in lots of places are interested in watching [these courses], I wanted to see if we could use new technology to move beyond access to participation to enable people who are interested in these questions to talk back, to give voice to their views and opinions,” Sandel said. “The project is to take the distance out of distance learning.”
Despite increased access to online civics courses in recent years, Sandel criticized institutions of higher education for their general approach to promoting civic education and engagement.
“We have not done enough to equip students to be citizens,” Sandel said.
He said the classes that are available, though, have a huge impact on people’s lives.
On a recent trip to Brazil, Sandel met Reginaldo, a middle-aged favela resident. After learning to read at age 25, Sandel said Reginaldo fell in love with philosophy. Through these online lectures, Reginaldo was able to formalize this knowledge and shares lessons from Platonic dialogues and the writings of Socrates with his friends and neighbors, Sandel said.
Sandel highlighted his College course “Justice” — Harvard’s first-ever made available for free online — as a blueprint for private institutions hoping to foster greater civic engagement with the world.
“Higher education can be a public good, not just a private privilege,” Sandel said, listing several examples of people who have applied things they learned in his course to their daily lives.
Audience members leaned forward in their seats and took notes as they listened to the discussion, which touched on a range of issues including education, diversity, dating, social media, and the midterm elections.
“His work feels more relevant than ever,” Long said as she introduced Sandel.
Natasha L. Raisch, a student at the Graduate School of Education who attended the forum, said the timeliness of Sandel’s work made the forum more engaging.
“I really liked that it’s super relevant to what we are living today and how he related it back to trends in education like technology and engaging globally,” Raisch said.
Annelisa K. Lee ’22, another attendee, said she appreciated the chance to explore a new topic through the discussion.
“It’s pretty enjoyable to come to things like this that are about things that you don’t really know anything about, and just learn a little bit about what people are talking about,” she said.

On the penultimate day of the Harvard admissions trial, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70 faced grilling over how and when the College adopted unprecedented written rules detailing how admissions officers can use race to evaluate Harvard hopefuls.
McGrath had previously testified that no such rules exist. Under cross-examination a week ago, McGrath — who has served as admissions director for more than three decades — repeatedly said Harvard has never produced written guidance telling application reviewers how they can weigh race when calculating the “personal rating,” one of several metrics the College relies on to assess high schoolers.
Not even “a post-it on the coffee maker?” Adam K. Mortara, a lawyer for Students for Fair Admissions, the group suing the University over its race-conscious admissions policies, asked at the time.
“In written form, no,” McGrath said.
That didn’t turn out to be fully true.
Harvard added explicit guidance on race to its application “reading procedures” for the Class of 2023, according to a document submitted as evidence at the end of the trial’s second week. The new guidelines state that “an applicant’s race or ethnicity should not be considered in assigning the personal rating.”
The provision had never before appeared in writing in Harvard admissions paperwork.
Mortara spent much of Thursday quizzing McGrath on why she said before that no written guidance existed — and on how the new rules came to be.
McGrath admitted Thursday that Harvard added rules on race “in more recent reading instructions,” which the school produces every year. She said the reason she originally testified no such guidance exists is because she assumed she should consider only procedures released between 2012 and 2014. Most of the exhibits submitted in the trial date to that period, as do the documents McGrath used to prepare for her testimony, she said.
“I was not, in my answer to you, referring to anything more current than that,” McGrath told Mortara Thursday.
The way the College assigns personal ratings forms a key and contentious issue in the three-week-old admissions trial, itself the latest development in a four-year-old lawsuit leveled against Harvard by SFFA.
SFFA charges that the College discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process — partly by assigning them disproportionately low personal ratings. Court filings in the lawsuit revealed Harvard admissions officers rank applicants on a variety of metrics including personal, academic, and athletic qualifications. An applicant with a top-scoring personality demonstrates “truly outstanding qualities of character,” while low-scoring candidates show “questionable or worrisome qualities of character.”
A series of email exchanges presented in court Thursday offer insight into how Harvard decided to add race to its 2023 reading procedures. Admissions staffers started pondering the change as early as August of this year, some time after they participated in an annual retreat meant to help them prep for the upcoming admissions cycle.
McGrath noted in court that Harvard updates its reading procedures routinely.
“We make changes every year, some large, some small,” she testified. On this scale, the addition of race-specific guidelines clocks in at “moderate,” McGrath said.
Race first earned a direct mention in a draft of the 2023 guidelines that Associate Director of Admissions Christine C. Mascolo ’00 sent to McGrath and other admissions officials early this fall.
Mortara presented a copy of the draft dated Sept. 11 that contained four new sentences instructing admissions officers how to assign overall and personal scores. Someone had marked up the document with a thick black marker — though the suggested changes were mostly grammatical.
The copy states in an introductory paragraph that “readers should not take an applicant’s race or ethnicity into account in making any of the ratings other than the Overall rating.”
Under a later section specifying how to assign these ratings, the document goes into much more detail.
“In assigning the Overall rating, readers may consider whether a student’s background, including his or her race or ethnicity, may contribute to the educational benefits of diversity at Harvard College. The consideration of race or ethnicity may be considered only as one factor among many,” the document states. “In addition, the consideration of race or ethnicity should be in connection with the application’s discussion of the effect an applicant’s race or ethnicity has had on the applicant, not simply the fact alone that an applicant has identified as a member of a particular race or ethnicity.”
Under the guidelines for personal ratings, the draft copy again states that “an applicant’s race or ethnicity should not be considered in assigning the personal rating.”
Harvard officially learned that it would face off against SFFA in court when Allison D. Burroughs, the judge presiding over the case, ruled on Sept. 28 that the case would require a trial.
All the language in the Sept. 11 draft regarding race and applicant ratings made it into the final draft — except for one provision. Harvard cancelled the suggested rule declaring that admissions officers cannot consider “the fact alone” of an applicant’s ethnicity.
McGrath told the court the rule was cancelled because it was “an incorrect instruction.”
She also repeatedly stated that she did not remember at what point she first read various iterations of the reading procedures. When Mortara showed her copies of the emails, McGrath replied that she “think[s] she did not” read some of the attached drafts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four prominent economists proposed policy changes they say will promote economic equality at an Institute of Politics event Thursday.
At the event, titled “What’s the Next Big Economic Idea?”, the panelists discussed universal basic income, a federal job guarantee, and job incentives in front of a group of over two dozen Harvard students and affiliates.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Jason Furman ’92 moderated the forum, which included Annie M. Lowrey ’07, a contributing editor for The Atlanti; Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy at The New School; Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute; and Will Wilkinson, vice president for research of the Niskanen Center. The speakers shared specific proposals they believe hold the most promise for American economic policy.
Lowrey, a former Crimson magazine editor, joined the panel via Skype and advocated for a universal basic income. She argued for the benefits of guaranteeing everyone of working age a fixed amount of money, regardless of employment status.
“There is currently no form of social insurance that helps people, regardless of circumstance, save for income,” Lowrey said.
Hamilton made his case for a government-funded job guarantee, saying that it would improve both infrastructure and the lives of the working class.
“The policy that I’m talking about is a mandated right for empowerment for people, and that relates to [Lowrey]’s policy,” Hamilton said. “It would enable workers, particularly those at the low end, to bargain for better wages and benefits without the fear and threat of destitution from unemployment.”
While Hamilton said he had no “big objections” to Lowrey’s proposals, he also pushed back on Lowrey’s support of a universal basic income.
“I like the intent around the U.B.I., but I have concerns with the universality of it,” said Hamilton.
Cass said he supported a government-funded wage subsidy to help low-wage workers while encouraging work.
“When we’re looking for our prosperity as a society, what really matters is that people can find productive work to do and that they can, through that work, support their families and their communities,” Cass said.
Wilkinson criticized the current state of housing regulations in cities.
“When restrictions make housing too expensive, it makes it impossible for workers to move to the labor markets where they’re most productive,” he said.
Though their ideas of implementation differed, each economist said they generally support for their colleagues' ideas. Cass noted the importance of thinking “boldly” about policies and the large impacts they can have on the American working class.
All four speakers agreed on multiple occasions that each proposal would be better than the policies currently in place and lauded each other’s large-scale thinking.
“I’m not timid in my belief that we can actually do this,” Hamilton said.

Munching on sweets and sporting festive costumes, more than 75 visitors packed into the Peabody Museum Thursday to celebrate the Mexican holiday Día de los Muertos.
Families honor their deceased loved ones during the festival, an ancient Mexican tradition that lasts from Nov. 1 to Nov. 2. Although celebrations differ by geographic region, participants generally decorate tombs, cook large feasts, share stories, sing, dance, and build altars to invite the spirits of their ancestors into their homes.
“We think their souls are coming that night, and they’re enjoying that time with us,” said Michelle Arroyo Fonseca, an officer of cultural affairs from the Mexican consulate in Boston who attended Thursday’s event.
She said the Day of the Dead, which mixes Mesoamerican Aztec rituals and Catholic symbols, marks a unique way of remembering and celebrating — rather than mourning — dead relatives.
At the Peabody gathering, guests munched on “bread of the dead” and sipped Mexican hot chocolate while listening to performances by the musical group Son Jarocho Boston and by College students who participate in the Holden Voice Program, which offers lessons to University affiliates.
Elizabeth Eschen, the director of the Holden Voice Program, said she included both laments and “fun songs” in the program in order “to show the evolution of both pain and suffering and also joy and laughter.”
Diana X. Munn, who coordinated the event, said she appreciates the holiday’s emphasis on joyous remembrance rather than somber grieving.
“We like to remember those who have passed away and celebrate their lives,” she said. “So obviously it’s sad to lose someone, but at the same time it’s wonderful to have a space or a date when you remember them and you do things in their honor.”
Munn wore a yellow marigold pin, which she said was “inspired by the flowers that are often used in the celebration” of the holiday. She said the flowers, called “cempasúchil,” serve as guiding pathways that “attract the souls to the altar.”
Some visitors to the Peabody participated in a costume contest to celebrate the holiday. Many donned skeleton-themed makeup and elaborate clothes to dress up as Catrina, a figure who represents death in Mexico and has become an iconic image of Día de los Muertos.
Elaborate altars decorated with art created by Harvard students and Mexican folk artists alike served as the focal point of the gathering. Students in Societies of the World 30: "Moctezuma’s Mexico: Then and Now," taught by Davíd L. Carrasco and William L. Fash, chose this year’s altar theme of “Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.”
Addressing the crowd at the celebration, Carrasco said the “real gift” of the holiday is that it offers participants from all over the world — not just Mexico — a chance to honor their ancestors.
“This is a night of inclusion, not exclusion, not of menace, but of love,” he said.
The Peabody Museum’s Día de los Muertos celebrations will continue Saturday with a family-oriented event.

Harvard Medical School on Thursday slammed the Trump administration's reported plan to eliminate federal recognition of transgender, intersex, or gender non-binary individuals, calling the proposal “overly simplistic, medically inaccurate and antithetical to our values as healthcare providers.”
“Harvard Medical School is staunchly opposed to any efforts by federal agencies to limit the definition of sex as an immutable condition determined at birth,” Gina Vild, an associate dean for communications at Harvard Medical School wrote in a statement Thursday evening.
The New York Times reported last week that a leaked government memo — drafted by the Department of Health and Human Services — shows the government is considering defining one’s gender as solely determined by biological sex at birth. Per policy put in place by the Obama administration, the government currently treats gender as an identity determined by personal choice.
If the Trump administration enacts this new definition, it would eliminate federal recognition of the roughly 1.4 million Americans who identify as a gender that does not match the biological sex with which they were born.
The Department of Health and Human Services could not immediately be reached for comment late Thursday night.
Vild wrote in the statement that the proposal “demonstrates blatant disregard for federal civil law protections of transgender people.” The school vowed to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming patients throughout the school’s medical system.
“Throughout our community, HMS clinicians provide individualized care to transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming patients with sensitivity and respect. We will continue to do so as we fight to protect the rights of our patients. We will defend our values both as clinicians and as members of a civil society that treats everyone with dignity. We will be unwavering in safeguarding the rights of individuals regardless of sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation,” the statement reads.
The School’s announcement came on the same day that Harvard medical and dental students gathered on campus to protest the proposal.
The LGBTQ and Allies of Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine and the Racial Justice Coalition at HMS planned Thursday’s protest as a part of a national movement held in coordination with other medical schools. The Medical Student Pride Alliance — a national BGLTQ medical student initiative — encouraged medical schools across the country to organize on Nov. 1 to demonstrate support for transgender rights.
During the demonstration Thursday, roughly 100 Harvard medical students donned white coats and scrubs in Tosteson Medical Center Atrium and lofted posters reading “Won’t be Erased” and “Equality for All.” The protest culminated in a group photo taken and posted online in support of the national demonstration.
The participating students also chanted “Yes on 3” as they posed for their photo, referencing their support for Question Three on the Massachusetts voting ballot this year. The question asks whether current gender anti-discrimination protections should be retained.
First-year medical students and LAHMS co-chairs Angela R. Perfetti and Casey Orozco Poore organized the HMS protest.
“I want to put a spotlight on the people who are most affected… these are people who are underinsured, already afraid to go to the doctor’s, already afraid to access their civil rights.” Orozco Poore said. “Transphobia is still abundant and thriving.”
Several students who attended the protest said they wanted to demonstrate medical students’ support for BGLTQ rights.
“We don’t want biological science to be misused as a tool for hatred and bigotry,” first-year medical student Alison E. Farrar said.
Some protesters, like first-year medical student Jade A. Connor, saw the protest as particularly pertinent for students of medicine.
“It’s important to acknowledge the reality that biological sex and gender are not the same thing and to deny those things is just not factually correct, but then it’s also going to lead to the detriment of our patients,” Connor said. “We’re just all here to stand with them and to show solidarity as a medical community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students called on Harvard to divest from the prison industry during the first public event held by the newly formed Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign Thursday evening.
The event, hosted at the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall, featured students speakers addressing a near-capacity crowd of roughly 100. Hakeem Angulu '20 and Jackie Wang, a graduate student in African and African American Studies and author of "Carceral Capitalism," began the event by speaking about the history of the American prison system as well as racial disparities in conviction and incarceration rates.
Soon afterwards, organizers projected the campaign’s organizing statement onto a screen.
“The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign seeks to sever the university’s financial ties to the prison-industrial complex by advocating for Harvard’s total divestment from all corporations whose existence depends on the capture, caging, and control of human beings,” the statement reads.
During the event, organizers also shared an audio tape recorded by Derrick Washington, an inmate at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, a maximum security prison in Lancaster, Mass. Washington, who said he had been convicted of murder, described his experiences in the state prison system as well as his later involvement with the Emancipation Initiative, a group that advocates for prisoners.
“Because prison is all of misery and hopelessness — and Harvard readily profits from it — in fact I see as Harvard endorsing every single prison suicide, murder, recidivist and fallen tear drop from the effects of 21st century slavery,” Washington said.
Jarrett M. Drake, a graduate student in Anthropology who co-founded the campaign, said the initiative originated last fall as part of a project for a class on incarceration. He said he developed the campaign with Design School student Samuel A. J. Matthew.
Initially, the two envisioned the project as a way to better inform school affiliates about Harvard’s investments in the “prison industrial complex.” But, after the course ended, he and Matthew decided they “wanted to do something more with the information project.” The duo eventually brought on several organizers to implement a broader initiative.
This October, Drake — along with Anneke F. Dunbar-Gronke, a third-year student at Harvard Law School, and Paul T. Clarke, a graduate student in African and African American Studies — penned a Crimson op-ed criticizing Harvard’s investments in companies associated with the prison industry.
The authors specifically pointed to Harvard’s investments in ETFs that contain stock in private prison operators CoreCivic and GEO Group; Tokio Marine Holdings Inc., an insurer in the bail bond industry; and Axon Enterprise, Inc., the manufacturer of Tasers.
Harvard’s SEC filings for the quarter ending June 30 of this year show holdings in these firms of approximately $67,000. The filings disclose a total $420 million in holdings.
Organizers said they have not directly contacted the Corporation about prison divestment.
Over the years, University administrators have consistently opposed student proposals to change Harvard’s investment strategy — especially when it comes to divesting from fossil fuels, a common undergraduate rallying cry in recent years.
Responding to a question on prison divestment in an interview Tuesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that investment decisions should not be used as political tool.
“We’ve stated many times, my predecessors have stated this going back to Derek Bok’s days 40 years ago, that the University should not use the endowment to achieve political ends or particular policy ends," he said. "There are other ways the university tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don’t think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.”
Bacow’s response parallels the position of previous Harvard presidents on divestment movements. In 2013, President Drew G. Faust wrote in a statement on fossil fuel divestment that Harvard’s endowment is “not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
In an interview during the event, Dunbar-Gronke said they believe the University’s investments in prisons are intrinsically political.
“We would like for a depoliticized endowment, and that would mean divesting from a system that is inherently politicized by the fact that it disproportionately affects black, brown, and poor people, and undocumented people, and we as students are in a unique position to hold the University accountable.”
Dunbar-Gronke also said they think Harvard's investments run contrary to the University’s efforts to address its ties to slavery.
“Harvard has expressed remorse for its institution in slavery, but that we are currently still investing in a legacy of slavery, so cannot be fully contrite until we stop investing in it," they said.
After presentations by speakers Thursday, participants broke off into smaller, off-the-record group discussions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few people on the periphery of the Harvard men’s hockey team truly know John Marino. Of course, they know that he wears No. 12, plays a sturdy two-way game on the Crimson’s blue line, and is a prospect of the National Hockey League’s Edmonton Oilers. But they don’t really know him.
And it’s easy to see why. The junior keeps a low profile and maintains a steady composure on the ice. His impact might not always show on the score sheet, and he certainly isn’t seeking out the nearest microphone.
“As a coach, it’s nice when you have guys that are level-headed and always focused and ready and determined, but not wearing their emotions on their sleeves,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 of Marino. “His calm demeanor on the outside disguises the fact that he’s super competitive on the ice.”
John’s demeanor disguises much more than his inner drive. During John’s time in Cambridge, there has always been a grander story that has obscured his talent and personality: a senior-led team reaches the Frozen Four in 2017; then, Ryan Donato shines on the college, Olympic, and NHL stages in 2018.
But the North Easton, Mass., native has one of the more noteworthy college experiences within the Crimson program. While John puts in the work on the ice, in the film room, and in the weight room, his twin brother, Paul, is busy splicing and preparing video for the team.
“He’ll point out little things that we may not see,” John said. “But it’s pretty cool to have him around the guys and contribute to everything we do [and] travel with us on the road. He’s always there.”
Interestingly, it is Paul who was indirectly responsible for introducing the duo to hockey, one of the most important facets of the twins’ lives.
“When I was born, my legs were deformed,” Paul explained. “At that point in time, the doctor said, ‘As soon as you can walk, put skates on.’ And that’s how me and John started playing hockey. At 18 months old, we were on the ice every day — seven days a week…. And my dad wasn’t going to bring one kid to the rink.”
From that moment on, the Marino twins shared a bond over the game of hockey that, in part, has defined their relationship as brothers.
After learning to skate together at such a young age, John and Paul competed on the same team for the South Shore Kings hockey program. Eventually, John broke out as a young player and began “playing up” with older teams — not the least bit unusual for precocious skaters.
“Every once in a while, we’ll still get on the ice together, and it’s fun and it’s somewhat competitive. Not really,” Paul joked. “It’s always been a good dynamic for us to have hockey to talk about, if nothing else. While I might suck on the ice, I can kind of think the game on his level…. It’s always been nice to bounce ideas off each other and talk about hockey.”
While John was skating with top competition, Paul was often watching from the stands. There, coincidentally, he got to know coach Donato, who was at the rink supporting his own sons. Paul credits much of his passion for hockey to his rink-side chats with coach Donato, as well as with Peter Chiarelli ’87, formerly the General Manager of the NHL’s Boston Bruins and currently the Oilers’ GM who drafted John in 2015.
Coach Donato looks back fondly on his early relationship with the Marino twins. He recalls John playing on a local “superteam” of sorts, containing much of the elite talent from the Massachusetts area in recent years and giving rise to multiple NHL mainstays. The Crimson bench boss also remembers Paul’s leg injury, which played a part in keeping Paul in the stands while John thrived on the ice.
“It’s funny, I probably have a unique perspective of it all, because I knew Paul also,” coach Donato started. “I remember Paul breaking his leg and being on the sidelines, and having two twins, one on the ice and one watching.”
In typical brotherly fashion, Paul broke his leg while racing John, sliding feet-first into the boards in a desperate attempt to prevent his younger twin from winning.
By the time John and Paul were teenagers, their relationships with hockey had clearly diverged: John continued to pursue top competition on the ice, while Paul took more of an interest in the cerebral side of the game.
“I don’t think it’s completely uncommon that, you see it with twins sometimes, they kind of share traits, or one guy might be really good at this and the other guy decides to be really good at that,” coach Donato noted. “I’ve seen their interactions away from the rink, and I know that they’re both very, very close, even though you would think that they have much different personalities.”
Whether playing, watching, or discussing hockey, the sport has seemingly always been a central element in the brothers’ relationship. Plus, the game introduced the twins to coach Donato, opening doors for both Marino boys to be a part of the current Harvard program.
“[Coach Donato] is still just a really good guy,” Paul said. “He’s helped me out a lot. He’s given me this opportunity which I appreciate a lot, and he’s given my brother the opportunity to play college hockey. So I try to do what I can to help him out with the team or just in general.”
For John and Paul, spending another four years together at school has been a privilege, but one that they scarcely expected. John originally committed to Yale after bonding with an assistant coach there but rescinded his pledge after the coach left the program. Shortly thereafter, John signed at Harvard. Meanwhile, Paul’s performance in high school put him in academic contention for a spot in the Crimson’s class of 2020, so he took his chances.
“As with most people who get into Harvard, my opinion is: I was never waiting for that letter,” Paul reflected. “It was definitely a tense situation. I had no clue whether I would get in, but I thought it was worth a shot.”
When Paul learned of his acceptance, it took all of 10 seconds before the reality sunk in: he would be reuniting with John, who had been living away from home while skating for the Tri-City Storm of the United States Hockey League.
“It was two months into him being away and us finally getting used to [him] not [being] around anymore,” Paul remembered. “And then in a matter of two months later, we were like, ‘Well, let’s try this again for another four years.’”
The two twins, who had spent most every day of their childhoods together, would not yet have to part ways. Both brothers benefitted from having a very familiar face around campus, especially in the early days of their freshman year.
“Having someone to go to [was great],” John said. “I didn’t really know too many faces coming in, and having someone like that just to feel comfortable with around the guys [was important], and [Paul] was always there.”
When the duo finally arrived on campus, John’s schedule was, predictably, devoted primarily to hockey. Paul, on the other hand, had more options when it came to activities outside of school.
With passions for both hockey and statistics, he reached out to the Harvard coaching staff in search of an analytical role with the team. Thanks to a longstanding relationship with coach Donato, as well as the skill set to perform the job, Paul was the team’s video manager from that point forward.
“It’s pretty funny, spending our whole life together and then going to college [together], too, and being so close,” John said. “And [Paul is] always around the team, so he’s kind of part of the team. It’s a pretty cool dynamic.”
With such close ties to the Crimson program, it’s no surprise that John’s and Paul’s social lives overlap extensively, too. The brothers are in a Dunster House blocking group rife with hockey players, and they mingle with more or less the same friend group.
“We’ve always hung out with the hockey kids because we’ve always played hockey,” Paul noted. “We’ve always been pretty close. We hang out together outside of all this — outside of hockey — and just on a weeknight I’ll go over to his room or he’ll come over to mine.”
As much as the twins’ Harvard experiences are similar, in some respects John and Paul could not be more different.
“We have pretty polar opposite personalities,” John admitted. “He’s more of the academic guy, I’d say, and I’m more of the sports guy. I think [our dynamic] is kind of a cool mixture of both, and we find a way to get along.”
Stretching after practice one September afternoon, senior defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy laughingly forewarned that an interaction with Paul would be vastly different than one with John. Most obviously, Dombrovskiy was referring to the brothers’ distinct social presences: John is quieter and more reserved, whereas Paul is notoriously outgoing and talkative. In fact, Paul is often the more loquacious one even around John’s teammates.
“Paul’s been answering questions for me since I was a little kid,” John said with a laugh. “He’s always been the talker, and if you ever have a question about me, I’m sure he has an answer.”
When it comes to chatting about hockey, John is particularly hushed. When his hockey commitments are over for the day, it’s the last thing he wants to talk about, despite Paul’s analytical appreciation for the sport.
“I remember one day, me and John were just hanging out in his room, and… he was just getting annoyed with me over talking about hockey,” Paul recounted. “And so me and John would go back and forth, and... eventually it just got to the point where we started wrestling in the middle of the room until [junior forward] Colton [Kerfoot] had to pull one of us off the other.”
Routine brotherly antics add a unique element to John’s hockey experience at Harvard, as well as to that of his teammates. Paul is known to call out John for a variety of academic, social, or hockey-related matters in front of the team, precipitating cheers and laughter from the players within earshot.
“It’s an interesting dynamic,” coach Donato said. “I think it adds a little bit of spirit to the group overall when you get a set of twin brothers that are different and both bring things that bring a smile to guys for maybe very different reasons.”
John Marino’s story is more interesting than his quiet and private demeanor might let on. While John logs big minutes for the Crimson squad and will only assume a larger leadership role this season, it is his extroverted twin brother, Paul, who provides a unique way to get to know the blue-liner.
After all, Paul has been there at every phase of John’s life. He was on the ice with John when the twins laced them up for the very first time. He was consistently in the stands cheering on his brother and picking the brains of great hockey minds like coach Donato, John’s eventual NCAA bench boss. And now, he roams the halls of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, rides on the team bus, and hangs out around the locker room, experiencing Harvard hockey alongside his younger twin brother.
“Hockey has definitely shaped both of our lives in indescribable ways,” Paul began. “The amount that I’ve fallen in love with the sport and the success that John’s had, it definitely changed a lot.
“I don’t think it’s changed our dynamic as brothers too much. In a way, it does bring us together, and in a way, it’s just another aspect of who we are that we share. I think we’d be close no matter what. We both care about each other, we both love each other, and we both know that we’re better together than we are apart.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike most incoming freshmen in college, Leo Tarantino didn’t spend the summer after graduating high school relaxing and sleeping in.
Tarantino was still getting up early, doing his lifts, and making sure his wrestling technique was in top form. When the Tarpon Springs, Fla., native arrived on Harvard’s campus for pre-orientation, he made sure that he had one-on-one sessions with his wrestling coaches before the rest of the team even arrived in Cambridge. This sort of level of dedication and commitment made Tarantino one of the best wrestlers in the country.
While still in high school, Tarantino and the rest of the freshman class—five rookies in total—were some of the most decorated wrestlers in the nation. They were national champions in their weight classes, won almost all of their matches in high school, and competed on some of the best teams in the country.
It’s not just about the accomplishments on the mat, though. What makes this freshman class especially unique is that the cohort has the ability to impact the future of Harvard wrestling’s culture.
Head Coach Jay Weiss recognized the excellence of this class during the recruiting process, before they were ever part of the team.
“We are very excited to have these student-athletes join our wrestling family in September,” Weiss said. “I enjoyed the recruiting process with each one of these guys, as it was clear they have the ability and character to be great on and off the wrestling mat.”
Upperclassmen and veterans on the team are cognizant of how the rookies have been transcendent as a class in respect to their character. Just a few months after the freshmen arrived on campus, captain Tyler Tarsi is already singing their praises.
“Across college athletics, it’s rare that freshmen contribute immediately to the team, but throughout preseason and the first few weeks of the season, these guys have totally bought into our program,” Tarsi said. “They’re not only great athletes but have stepped up as leaders already.”
The freshmen have realized that their age and inexperience as college athletes should not deter them from stepping up and being role models. They are also aware of how the ability to change the culture of the team can directly lead to better performances and results.
Tucker Ribman, a two-time Texas prep state champion and a native of Dallas, Texas, wants to make sure that impacting the culture of the team is one of the foremost goals of the freshman class.
“This freshmen class really wants to make an impact on the culture and our coaches always tell us that if we have a good culture on the team, the results will follow that,” Tucker said. “That’s why one of our main goals this year is to continue to contribute to the positive culture on the team.”
These importance that character and a positive culture has on these freshmen was evident based on their priorities during the recruiting process. Tarantino, who was ranked No. 5 nationally in his weight class, could have gone almost anywhere he wanted to. He chose Harvard because of the coaching staff’s emphasis on the individual person and not just the athlete.
“I felt that the coaching staff here was a staff that really cared about you as a person before what they thought you would pan out as a recruit,” Tarantino said. “I felt the importance that our coaches put first and foremost as us as individual people. That is something I noticed here way above anywhere else, and I really took that to heart.”
Morality and personal development aren’t always prioritized by young athletes coming into a new level of competition. The fact that the freshman class prioritize the two demonstrates a clear sense of maturity.
The freshmen have also distinguished themselves by exhibiting camaraderie and teamwork. Phoenix native Bobby Groves recognizes that this companionship has led to a seamless transition to the team where the freshmen have even been capable of motivating the members of the team much older than them.
“It is important to remember that even as freshmen we can push the older guys and make them work harder,” Groves said. “Our ability to help each other out is what makes us a family.”
Along with their teamwork and character, the freshmen also have a reputation on the team for being able to have fun. On a team that stresses discipline and hard work as much as any team on campus, it is important to have a sense of humor that can lighten the mood. Pierce Bausano, a freshman whose father was a captain of Harvard wrestling, recognizes the significance of having energy and positivity on the team.
“I think the freshman bring a lot of energy,” said Pierce. “I know I myself try to integrate a sense of light-heartedness and positivity to the team.”
The freshmen have already proven themselves superb athletes across a variety of weight classes with skills sure to have a direct contribution to the team. Nevertheless, what has stood out about this class and why it can change the future of this team are the intangible aspects that cannot be measured by any statistic.
They have established themselves as the class that has discipline, exceptional character, incredible teamwork, and of course an impeccable sense of humor and positivity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, both men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams captured their respective Ivy League titles. With the offseason nearing its completion, both squads are well placed to replicate the feat in the new year.
THREE-PEAT
After capturing its 25th Ivy League title — its third in five years — the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team is setting high hopes for the upcoming 2018-2019 season. After going undefeated last year in what led up to a near 400-point margin of victory in the Ivy League championships, the team is looking for a third title this season.
“We’re in a really good spot right now in terms of having people who qualified for NCAAs,” senior freestyler Logan Houck said. “Training-wise, a lot of our emphasis is on Ivies as well as NCAAs.”
The 32-member team is welcoming 10 new freshmen, including butterflier Jake Johnson, who competed on the international stage at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina on Oct. 6 through Oct. 18. Also new to the team is freshman Andrew Acosta, a butterflier and freestyler from Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, freestyler Daniel Puczko from Chicago, Ill., and freestyler Emmanuel Ngbemeneh from Union City, Calif.
Among the 22 returning to the team is junior Dean Farris, who will represent the United States at the 2019 World University Games in Naples, Italy. Also back for another season is senior distance swimmer Logan Houck, a 2018-2019 USA Swimming National Team member for his 800 Freestyle with a time of 7:54.80. Head coach Kevin Tyrrell was also named a coach for the 2018-19 National Team and will be returning to the helm for the Crimson this season.
“We train 20 hours a week and have weight lifting in addition to the pool,” senior Grant Goddard said. “Also, there are anaerobic practices that work on power, speed, and technique. Most practices are around 5,000 to 8,000 yards.”
In regards to meets during the season, the team has quite a schedule lined up with some heavy travel early in the season.
“We’ll travel down to Texas in early December and have Columbia coming into town at the start of the season,” Goddard added. “We’ll only taper once a season, so that will be either for the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet or the Ivy League Championships.”
With a possible three-peat looming, the team has taken efforts to not place too much emphasis on a historical record, but rather focus on individual accomplishments and times that will lead to a championship.
“I don’t think we’re putting too much emphasis on the Ivy League Championships until we get a bit closer,” Houck said. “[The three peat] is always in the back of our heads, but we’re going to take every meet as it comes.”
GOING FOR THE ODD
2012, 2014, 2016, 2018: Like the San Francisco Giants, the Harvard women’s swimming team appears to have established a pattern of even-year championships.
“We’re going for an odd year this time, adding 2019 to that list,” sophomore Elizabeth Holmes said. “We’re really excited to go back to back in the Ivies this year.”
Coming off of a 2018 season which ended in a decisive 125.5 point win over the second place Bulldogs in last year’s Ivy League Championships, the women’s side is back with newfound hunger.
“Every year, the team always has a different dynamic to it,” tri-captain Meagan Popp said. “This year, the freshmen have been absolutely amazing and really hard working. It’s been really awesome to have a group of freshmen coming in already knowing what they’re doing.”
The team, with 28 returning swimmers and divers, is welcoming nine freshmen from across the world. Among them are diver Morane Herculano, a member of the Swiss National team since 2012 and a three-time junior European Championship Finalist; swimmer Mikki Thompson, a 2016 US Olympic Swimming Trials Qualifier, 2017 World Championship Trials Qualifier, and 2017 US Open Swimming Championships Finalist; and backstroker Maddie Heilbrun, a 2017 World Championship Trials Qualifier and 2016-17 Nationals Qualifier and Finalist.
Both Holmes and Popp anticipate lots of opportunities for the team to demonstrate their abilities for the upcoming season, with trips to Hawaii, California, Texas, and along the northeast corridor.
“We’re travelling up to Cornell soon and travel meets are always fun, especially when bringing the freshmen along for the first Ivy League dual meet of the season,” Holmes said. “Our home meet against Columbia during the weekend of Harvard Yale is going to be full of spirit. Also, when we’re racing down in Texas, there’s always a lot of Division I schools that show us what is out there on a NCAA level. And obviously, our end of the season meets, especially the Ivy League championships are super exciting.”
In preparing for the season, the 36-member team has already been in and about the water for several weeks, with preseason starting weeks before the first days of class. As of now, members are focusing on each of their individualized workouts, with the coaches creating specific sets and practices for the sprint groups, mid-distance groups, and distance groups.
“We have some practices where there’s all out sprints with lots of rest and some with long sets for conditioning,” Popp said. “Regardless, the practices are mixed up pretty evenly so that it’s never too repetitive.”
However, there’s more to just swimming for the team, especially when preparing for end of season meets.
“Everyone is in the water for two hours about eight times a week and in the weight room for two one hour sessions a week,” Holmes said. “Outside of the pool, the focus is on making sure that we’re eating well and getting a lot of rest. As we get towards the end of the season, the yardage goes down a lot in practice and there is more focus on power and sprints. Sometimes, we get a couple of practices off near the end of our taper which is really nice.”
With high hopes and an end goal in mind, the Crimson hopes to best its previous season which saw the 2017-2018 championship team receive 13 All-Ivy honors and break six Blodgett Pool records. This year, going back-to-back and the return of the Frank Keefe Trophy back in Cambridge is on everyone’s mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As seasons come and go, there is one constant in the Harvard women’s ice hockey team: the quest for victory. Regardless of who is lacing up her skates, whether it be a new freshman or a returning upperclassman, the search for hockey supremacy remains the same.
“As a member of Harvard hockey, we have a very similar outlook every year,” senior defender Kaitlin Tse said. “That is getting ECAC championships, NCAA tournament, Beanpot, and gaining home ice for the playoffs. Those do not really change from year to year.”
RECENT REFLECTIONS
Last year, the team’s campaign for ECAC dominance came to a bitter end at the hands of No. 4/4 Colgate. The Raiders won the first two games of the three-game series, eliminating the Crimson in the quarterfinals of the playoffs.
“We lost first round of the playoffs,” Tse said. “When things don’t go your way, you have to find a way to learn from that, gain some perspective, and figure a way to move on.”
Many months have passed since those games against Colgate, but the lessons learned still remain fresh in the team’s collective memory. Harvard’s head coach, Katey Stone, reflects on those lessons and comes away with a sense of optimism for the upcoming season ahead.
“I think we took a step forward last year,” Stone said. “We need depth in our roster, we want that hammer mentality. If somebody is not going, there is someone in the line-up who is scratching and clawing to be that next person. I think we have that now, we have depth in every position.”
SHIFTING DYNAMICS
As graduating seniors depart Harvard, they are replaced by a wide-eyed, eager group of freshmen excited for the upcoming year. The raw energy of these new players permeate the team atmosphere, giving everyone a new sense of possibility.
“We have kids that are hockey players,” Stone said. “They are excited to come to the rink, work their tail off, compete against each other, so that they are better off to compete against the opponent.”
This year’s group of talented freshmen has already made its mark in the first three games of the season. Rookie forwards Anne Bloomer and Dominique Petrie have already netted two goals apiece, and first-year goalkeeper Lindsay Reed has recorded 74 saves, including a staggering 49 against Colgate.
The departure of the graduating seniors also leaves an opportunity for new leaders to emerge. When talking about who these new leaders that are stepping up to the plate are, Stone already as a clear image in her mind.
“Our senior class, there is no question,” Stone said. “There are four of them, they are four strong and what they do for the program on and off the ice is significant. They have been great with our younger players and bringing them along. They understand that that is the most important thing.”
Captain and senior forward Lexie Laing and senior defender Kaitlin Tse are some of the leaders that guide the young freshmen.
“For me personally, I lead by example,” Tse said. “You help them fill roles as best as you can.”
Laing stresses the importance of communication. Whether it be verbal or non-verbal, communication ensures everyone is on the same page.
“It is helping each other out,” Laing said. “Being your teammates eyes and ears and seeing things they cannot, like if someone is coming from behind them.”
Along with the addition of new players, the team also adds a familiar face to its coaching roster. Assistant coach Sydney Daniels graduated from the college in 2017 and was a member of the team as an undergraduate. After graduation, coach Daniels played for the NWHL’s Boston Pride for 2017-2018 season before joining the coaching staff last May.
SO FAR THIS SEASON
Harvard has already displayed some of those lessons learned this year in its first three games against Dartmouth, Cornell, and Colgate, respectively. Playing at home against Dartmouth, the Crimson skated to a 3-1 victory, thanks to goals scored by freshmen Anne Bloomer and Dominique Petrie. However, the next two games against Cornell and Colgate would result in back-to-back losses.
Despite the two early losses, the team’s outlook for the rest of the season remains positive.
“If you compare us from last year, it’s like night and day,” Tse said. “We are competing with these teams, and I think that is a big positive for the [team].”
Looking ahead, the Crimson has two road games next weekend against Quinnipiac and Princeton. After that, the team travels back to its home ice to take on Holy Cross before hitting the road again for a doubleheader against Wisconsin, the top ranked team in the country.
Harvard's strategy for these and all other remaining games on its schedule is a simple but powerful one. Their strategy emphasizes hard work, dedication, and the belief that there are no shortcuts to success.
“The way we approach things here is every game is a championship game for us,” Stone said. “We need to play our best at every opportunity we have, if we do that, good things are going to come our way.”
Using this strategy of hard work and perseverance, Harvard hopes to accomplish the goal of elevating its game to the next level.
“One of our big mentalities and goals of this year is to be the hardest working team in the league,” Laing said. “[To the point where] every time someone plays us to say, “Aw man, we have to play Harvard today!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard squash program fell three wins shy of perfection last year. The women’s team went undefeated for the third consecutive year while the men dropped just three matches en route to a second straight runner-up finish to Trinity College in the College Squash Association (CSA) National Team Championship Finals.
With a new season at hand, the Crimson women will seek to maintain their stranglehold atop the college squash world while the men hope to finally get over the hump.
SUSTAINED DOMINANCE
The women’s team went 15-0 last season, and even that record understates just how dominant Harvard was. The Crimson never came close to losing. Squash team matches are composed of nine individual matches, with each school’s top nine players facing each other. Harvard swept 11 meetings, 9-0, winning the other four by scores of 8-1. On the season, Crimson players went 131-4 (.970), with 114 of those individual match wins coming in 3-0 sweeps.
“It’s a good position to be in, being the one who holds the title,” junior Gina Kennedy said. “You don’t want to lose the title.”
This level of dominance is nothing new for Harvard. In winning the championship, the Crimson captured its fourth consecutive — and 18th overall — Howe Cup, the most of any program in the nation.
The undefeated season, too, was familiar territory. Harvard’s winning streak is now 53 matches, the second longest in program history. The Crimson last lost on Jan. 11, 2015, in a 5-4 squeaker to Penn. Nobody on the roster for the upcoming season has ever been part of a losing effort while donning a Harvard uniform.
“There is a bit of pressure, but it’s not at the core of what we think about,” Kennedy said. “I think it’s more that we’re not really that scared of losing but we’re more just determined to win. We try not to think about the broad aspects of it — the winning streak — and instead focus on individual aspects.”
Harvard appears to be positioned well for another dominant season. Just two women’s squash players — Alyssa Mehta and Sue Ann Yong — graduated last year, and the Crimson welcomes a strong incoming class of freshmen that includes standout Egyptians Hana Moataz and Amina Yousry along with Philadelphia native Grace Steelman.
“Because it was a small class that graduated, everyone’s very familiar with the team culture,” Kennedy said. “I think it’s been a really easy transition for the freshmen, and they’re coming into the season really familiar with everybody.”
The freshmen join a stacked team that has four of its top five players — Kennedy, senior Kayley Leonard, junior Amelia Henley, and captain Sabrina Sobhy — returning. In addition to dominating for the Crimson last season, the four also played exceptionally well at the CSA Individual Championships in March. Kennedy, Henley, and Sobhy all broke to the semifinals of the tournament.
While Harvard has a scrimmage at Yale next week and a match against Dartmouth in December, the Crimson’s season kicks off in full-force with a trio of home matches on Jan. 12 and Jan. 13.
“I think we’re all really looking forward for the season to start,” Kennedy said. “It’s a long buildup, because our season starts in January so we have a long time of practicing throughout the fall, so everyone’s really hyped for it. We’re excited to hopefully try and defend our title again this year. We’re looking forward to it.”
SO CLOSE
For the second straight year, Harvard men’s squash rolled into the CSA Team Final with 13 wins on the season and victories over Ivy League rivals in the quarters and semifinals. Again, the team came up just short against Trinity, losing 6-3 to the Bantams and improving its previous year’s score, 5-4, by one game.
The Crimson hopes that it will again have the opportunity to play for a national championship and that this time around, result will be different.
“When matches are that close — it was a really tight one last year — it comes down to the little things over the whole season,” junior co-captain Sean Hughes said. “We’ve made some changes to our preseason routine. I think from the mental side of things and also just physical training we’ve improved in different areas and I think that’s going to make a big difference when it comes to the end of the season.”
If Harvard wants to win its first national championship since it went undefeated in 2014, it will have to replace a few senior leaders, including David Ryan, who became the first Crimson player since Ali Farag ’14 to win the CSA Individual Championships. In addition to his individual title, Ryan went undefeated in his matches for the team throughout the season.
The Crimson has recruited a standout freshman class coming in to help it do just that. Marwan Tarek, George Crowne, and Victor Crouin have all already represented their countries — Egypt, Canada, and France — at the world championship level, something that should help them acclimate quickly to the college game.
“Everyone’s been in big situations before, especially the freshmen, which is definitely new,” junior co-captain Timothy Brownell said. “Having that team experience is really going to help them coming into this year. I think if we can look for them to show similar amounts of composure that they’ve shown in the past, we’re in a good spot. I think this year as a team we’re definitely more experienced.”
The freshmen will add even more quality to a roster than includes a number of experienced returning players, including First Team All-Americans Brownell and junior Saadeldin Abouaish, both of whom joined Ryan in the semifinals of the CSA Individual Championships.
The Crimson’s season starts earlier than usual this year, with November matches against regional rivals Northeastern, Tufts, and MIT. But Harvard has proven in recent years that it can roll through the regular season; the goal now is to defeat Trinity, winner of two straight national championships and three of the last four.
Brownell thinks the Crimson is well positioned to do just that.
“I really think that in general we’re a strong team, just as we were last year,” Brownell said. “Just now we’re a little bit more experienced, a little bigger, a little tougher. I think that it should be a great year. As long as we can keep everyone healthy — and that’s all we can ask for — the results will speak for themselves in the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lodge was giddy with dissent. On one side of the table sat the galvanizers, and on the other, their challengers — each canoodling with, yet remaining far from, the idea of victory. Around them: the crowds, eavesdropping without engaging. It was a debate without a moderator, a clash far from ceasefire. For the members of Harvard’s Nordic ski team, the feud was far from their most strenuous activity of the day. Nonetheless, they chose to cross swords right then and there, smack in the middle of the Craftsbury Outdoor Center Lodge.
“There are always some really good conversations when we go up to Craftsbury,” said Lily Koffman, now a captain of the team. “There’s no Wi-Fi or cell service in the dining hall, so you can’t use Google to settle anything. So basically, a couple years ago, we had this two-hour debate over whether or not pasta is a noodle. It’s still team legend to this day – it got insanely heated, and the teams around us were all wondering what was wrong with us Harvard nerds.”
Some say that ski legends are made on the slopes, yet for the cross-country skiers in crimson, true team folklore is born from their time in the lodge — even if that time happens to be defined by starchy squabbles.
“I do think that pasta is a noodle,” Koffman said, albeit with a laugh. “I would definitely say I’m on Team Noodle.”
However, lodge-talk and off-kilter debates are far from the only responsibilities held by the Crimson. While most Harvard students spend their winters attempting to shield themselves from the snow, for the nordic ski team, snow-time is a synonym for go-time.
“Training can be anything from a three-hour easy ski to intervals with high heart rate and speed,” said Christopher City, who’s entering his 11th season as the Crimson head coach. “We spend a lot of time working on technique when we get on the snow to ensure that our aerobic capacity can carry us as far as it can.”
Because Nordic ski competitions are held on flat trails, two of the most important aspects of the sport are technique and stamina. Thus, constant training is essential to Harvard’s success on the snow.
“On a typical practice day, we get to the track at about 5 p.m.,” captain Jacob Meyerson said. “[We] either do a workout — usually a pre-race workout or distance workout where we ski for around two hours — or we do technique work where we ski back and forth and the coaches work with us to improve our skiing technique. We do this on a pretty small loop, so there’s definitely a lot of time to talk and catch up with our teammates.”
The bonds formed between team members are the Nordic ski team’s trademark. Though skiing is an individual sport, the amount of time that the skiers spend with each other, coupled with the fact that the Nordic ski squad is one of Harvard’s smallest teams, means that a positive team environment is crucial for the Crimson.
“We spend a lot of time together — that’s part of why I love the team,” Koffman said. “The sport is really hard, so it’s only fun if you’re doing it with people you really like spending time with, whether that be by pushing each other in practice or by just joking around.”
Koffman’s mantra is near-identical to that held by members of the Nordic team’s downhill counterpart: the Harvard alpine ski team. Two types of skiing exist at the collegiate level: Nordic and alpine, both of which the Crimson field a team for. Though the squads compete on different terrains – the former on trails, and the latter on the slopes – a positive team environment is essential to both.
“With such a small team, [being tight-knit] is really the most important part of our success, and we try to emulate that early in the season,” alpine coach Scott MacPherson said. “In September, when we’re getting together to do dryland training it’s more about building that teamwork than getting in shape — figuring out how people work together, and what your identity is within the team. We really push them to develop that so by the time we get onto the snow, everyone knows each other well and how their teammates are going to react to success and failure. When you understand the people you’re competing with, you understand what your role is on the team. That’s really the hallmark of our program.”
When asked about team bonding, any skier on the alpine team will point you to one place: the van. Because of Cambridge’s distance from any suitable race slopes, the squad must travel to Vermont for pre-race practices. Their mode of transportation is the ski team van, a vesicle of everything from early-morning naps to post-competition chats.
“We leave campus at about 5:30 a.m. and get in the van,” said Nellie Ide, captain and last year’s leading scorer. “We all usually sleep on the way out because it’s about an hour-and-a-half drive to our training venue in New Hampshire. We start training around 7:30 a.m. and we’ll ski for about two hours – that’s mainly just going up and down on the course. After that, we drive the hour-and-a-half back to make it in time for noon classes.”
Of course, Harvard’s winter break falls toward the beginning of January — the primetime period for alpine skiing. However, instead of spending their full vacations at home, members of the alpine team can be found on the slopes during the earliest days of the calendar year, a time when scheduling is “a little more forgiving,” as captain Dennis Bao put it.
“Last year, we spent a week at Sugarloaf right before our first race there,” Bao said. “It was really great to just be training on the race venue, seeing that there are so many idiosyncrasies to each course. The chance to practice on the actual race venue in the week leading up to a competition is hugely advantageous.”
As the regular season approaches, the coaches of both teams are excited for the races that lie ahead. Both cite strong leadership and young talent as potential pinnacles of the upcoming season.
“We’re really starting to building something special here at Harvard,” MacPherson said. “The amount of interest in our program has skyrocketed recently. We definitely have our challenges, but looking at our program right now, sometimes I wish I were an athlete on the team.”
With the teams’ first competition, the St. Lawrence Carnival at Mt. Van Hoevenberg, on the horizon, it truly is time to grind for the Crimson. However, with a little bit of flow and a whole lot of snow, the skiers from Harvard should have no trouble doing what they do best: trekking up trails, sliding down slopes, and picking fights over pasta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Head coach Ted Donato ’91 is a large part of Harvard men’s hockey history — after all, he was voted the Most Outstanding Player in the Crimson’s national championship run in 1989. So it’s easy to forget that the other members of his coaching staff bring their own histories and experiences to the program.
In his days as a college hockey player from 2005 to 2009, Harvard assistant coach Rob Rassey skated in seven Beanpot games and tallied one goal and two assists. But he didn’t do it as a member of the Crimson.
For his part, Rassey spent his collegiate career as a forward at Northeastern. Though he cheered on his alma mater when the Huskies won the Beanpot trophy in 2018, Rassey’s five years and counting behind Harvard’s bench have changed his loyalties.
“Harvard for me all the way,” Rassey said with a laugh.
Rassey has become a mainstay of the Crimson coaching staff. But this summer, for the first time since 2014, the Harvard bench lost an assistant coach, Paul Pearl. Curiously enough, Pearl’s departure indirectly sprang from a personnel change in the National Hockey League. The New York Rangers hired then-Boston University coach David Quinn, prompting the promotion of assistant coach Albie O’Connell — who himself spent time as assistant coach for the Crimson. Pearl was nabbed for the vacant assistant job at BU.
Replacing Pearl is Jim Tortorella, most recently the head men’s hockey coach at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. While Rassey’s coaching career is relatively young, Tortorella has been behind a bench for over two decades. Before Saint Anselm, he coached Division-III hockey at Colby College for 16 seasons and also spent time at Providence College and the University of New Hampshire. That’s not even including his high school coaching stints, and his term as coach of the USA World Junior team. To him, his experience will be most valuable in settling into his new position.
“I’ve been around winning programs, been around enough people in this business,” Tortorella said. “What I brought to certain players, and what I bring to certain players today, is the details.”
“Certain players” include current NHL defensemen Trevor van Riemsdyk and Brett Pesce, both of the Carolina Hurricanes, whom Tortorella coached at UNH. Harvard’s veteran defensive corps will prove an interesting opportunity for the new coach.
“It’s real important, not only that we get qualified hockey people,” coach Donato said. “But it’s more important that we get people that share the same passion that we want the program to represent…. Just as you try to, as a coach, have a team that you want to coach, as the head coach you want to have a staff that you want to work with.”
Tortorella’s coaching roots are about family as well as experience: he is the younger brother of John Tortorella, current head coach of the NHL’s Columbus Blue Jackets. But if Rassey, who mentors the team’s forwards, has an instinctive place behind the bench, Tortorella’s focus is unusual. He coaches the defense, but played goalie at the University of Maine. The interesting perspective influences the way he thinks the game.
“For whatever reason, goalies tend to be a little bit more cerebral,” Tortorella said. “It’s allowed a well-roundedness of [seeing] how everybody connects, from the forwards to the D, and the D to the goalies, and vice versa.”
While the two assistant coaches have their own responsibilities, they attack one specific task as a unit: recruiting. It’s up to Rassey and Tortorella to ensure the program has the right pieces — not just those who will fit into coach Donato’s system of play, but those who will fit into Harvard and its culture.
“It takes a large sacrifice on their part, too, in terms of putting in the extra work academically,” said Rassey, referring to student-athletes who choose long careers at Harvard rather than a quick transition to professional hockey. “The guys that get it are here, the guys that really appreciate it.”
For Rassey, the results of several strong years of recruiting are apparent in the skilled forwards he’s been able to work with. Under his mentorship, the Crimson has seen the rise of now-NHLers Jimmy Vesey ’16, Alex Kerfoot ’17, and Ryan Donato — and with them, the Harvard hockey program’s return to the national spotlight.
Aside from “the obvious ones,” as Rassey refers to them, the Crimson has also witnessed the talents of Kyle Criscuolo ’16, Sean Malone ’17, Luke Esposito ’17, and Tyler Moy ’17 in recent seasons. The latter three formed arguably the strongest line in all of college hockey — “The Three Amigos,” as they were playfully known — in 2016-2017 and became an instrumental force along the team’s Frozen Four run.
But the rotating nature of college hockey teams means that recruiting plays an even more significant role in keeping the program consistently competitive.
“We want to keep replenishing the cupboard with what we feel are high-talented players, and high-skill guys that can help us win,” Rassey said. “I think for us it’s a two-pronged thing: develop those guys when we have them, and make sure we get good guys here every year.”
Luckily for Rassey and Tortorella, Harvard is enticing in and of itself, despite the academic challenges it might pose. The coaching staff stresses to prospective recruits that they want players who will appreciate the educational and pre-professional opportunities they’re getting just as much as the team they’ll be a part of.
“If we put 25 kids in a room and say, ‘Hey, you’re going to get into Harvard,’ they’d say, ‘This is awesome,’” Tortorella said. He added with a smile, “Same thing in the coaching business. There’s 25 other guys that’d love to have my job.”
As the season progresses, the assistant coaches shift their focus from recruiting to the games at hand. Harvard is only one contest into the year, but there is already plenty of video to analyze and opponents to strategize for.
There are new challenges to look forward to and prepare for, and new firsts for a new assistant coach: first game at Cornell, first Beanpot, and possibly a first trip to Lake Placid.
“I wish I had a crystal ball to see, ‘Oh, here’s where we’re going to end up,’” Tortorella said. “But...we have some special guys and some really good players, and who knows what’s going to happen?”
Things can’t be left to chance and crystal balls, though, so Tortorella heads off to look at video with sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh. Practice is done for the day, but work goes on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of two lockdown performances last weekend, the Crimson (1-2-0, 1-2-0 ECAC) will look to maintain its defensive intensity this weekend against high-scoring Quinnipiac (2-4-2, 2-0) and Princeton (2-2, 2-0). The Tigers lead the conference in goals scored with 11 through just two games. The Bobcats have played good offensive hockey as well, having tallied a conference fourth-best six goals in their two wins. Defensively, Harvard will be up for the test in what should shape up to be two exciting matchups this weekend.
Last weekend, the Crimson fell short to No. 6/6 Cornell, 3-2, and No. 9/10 Colgate, 1-0, despite defensive and goaltending heroics. In each game, Harvard scrapped for a full 60 minutes but could not quite turn the corner to end up on the right side of the leaderboard. To tilt tight games in the team’s favor this weekend, the Crimson stressed tenacity in practice.
“If we had played with the same urgency we did once it was 1-0 [in the Colgate game], it could have completely changed the game,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “That’s something we’re really focusing on this week and going into the weekend.”
In addition to their strong offensive records in conference thus far, both Quinnipiac and Princeton have taken care of their defensive zones. The Bobcats sit at a plus-six goal differential in conference play and the Tigers tout a plus-eight stat line. To establish greater urgency early in the game and combat strong defensive capability, Harvard will look to play at a faster pace with more offensive aggression.
“We took a lot out of it [last weekend] and really recognized the importance of scoring first and jumping out right away,” Hughes explained.
Defensively, the Crimson has been stout so far, surrendering five goals in three games. Goaltending has been a critical component to the defensive prowess, as both net minders who have appeared in games — freshman Lindsay Reed and junior Beth Larcom —have posted save percentages above .900. Harvard goaltending has posted an aggregate .956 save percentage for the year, spearheaded by Reed’s Division I-leading .974 mark. To continue success, the Crimson defensive zone will have to remain solid.
“Going into games, if you know that you’re going to win the defensive zone, then you’re going to win games,” senior forward Kate Hallett elaborated. “Sticking to the basics and using a lot of communication in the [defensive] zone will hopefully provide for some good offensive opportunities.”
Obviously, defensive tenacity is a critical component of the Crimson’s young season, but not just to prevent goals. Going forward, Harvard will try to convert solid back line play into goals. In this weekend’s games, the Crimson will be looking to counter-attack and take some risks offensively.
“With our defense and goaltending obviously playing so well, it kind of gets the offense going,” Hughes said. “It’s really inspiring and kind of comforting to know that we can try something and our defense has our back. That sense of trust is really important.”
Finally, with both Quinnipiac and Princeton representing pivotal, conference opponents, intangible toughness and the ability to bear down in hectic game situations will be key for the squad. Having battled through three close finishes already, the Crimson should be up for the challenge of a nail-biter, but the squad will have to up the intensity even more through the final whistle.
“Those close games prove to us that we have to have more resilience,” Hallett said. “You’re not going to win games by just giving 40 minutes; it’s got to be an entire 60 minutes.”
The puck drops Friday night at 6 PM against the Bobcats, and the team will continue to New Jersey on Saturday to take on the Tigers at 3 PM.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia is in dire straits.
In last week’s come-from-behind victory over Yale — the team’s first division win this season — Lions medical personnel wheeled senior quarterback Ryan Suitt off the field after he landed on his head.
Columbia is no stranger to injuries. Entering last weekend’s contest, 20 starters have been sidelined. Suitt, after all, is Columbia’s fourth-string quarterback. Junior running back Lynnard Rose joined his teammate on the medical table in the first quarter of play against the Bulldogs.
At last count, injuries sidelined four of Columbia’s quarterbacks, a running back, two wideouts, the team’s top rushing threat, and various other starters.
“They’ve had some tough teams on their schedule and they’ve fought through them,” captain Zach Miller said. “They’ve fought through some injuries facing those teams, coming up short a little bit, but based on their schedule I think they fight like us. They’re above .500 so they’re doing a great job adapting to those injuries and battling through their schedule.”
The team is being led by its backups, and — discounting the end result in the contest with Yale — it’s playing like it. Even against the Bulldogs, looking at everything but the score would’ve predicted a Columbia loss.
Yale led in total yards (428-157), first downs (21-11), possession time, and sacks. Columbia led in penalties, yards lost, and fumbles.
While he was in, Suitt went 3-for-16 for 32 yards through the air, fumbling twice as he escaped pressure. In his first piece of game action, fifth-string junior quarterback Matt Dame tossed the ball three times, completing one pass for 19 yards. Freshman Ryan Young led the team’s rushing effort with 98 yards and a touchdown.
If Dame gets the start this week, it will be the first of his career. That does not mean much though. Harvard first-string quarterback, senior Tom Stewart, started his second career game this season and picked up a victory over Holy Cross. The senior’s first-ever start was a 10-point loss to the same team two seasons prior.
“They have athletes. They’re going to fight hard. They’re a good program, coached by great coaches,” Miller said. “So we’re going to get their best shot. We have to prepare for anything, we have to over prepare because we don’t know what’s going to come at us.”
In Saturday’s contest, the two teams in blue completed a total of 22 passes and punted 20 times — a testament to their offensive ineptitude but also plenty of practice for the punters. Columbia’s punter, sophomore Drew Schmid, was the lone highlight of the team’s last contest. In a school record seven times, Schmid pinned Yale within its 20-yard line.
The name Schmid should sound familiar to anyone who has been keeping up with Harvard football. He is the younger brother of Harvard’s previous punter, Zach Schmid.
Since senior wide receiver and punt returner Justice Shelton-Mosley’s injury, it’s been his classmate, wide receiver Henry Taylor that’s been flagging down the boots.
“Really, we don’t have that complicated of punt schemes,” Taylor said. “We’re just going to man up and try to block you. I believe in our guys up front. We’ve done a great job all year. We haven’t returned a ton of punts but I believe this year we’re going to break one one of these days.”
Despite Columbia’s troubles this season, its record is so far on par with Harvard’s. Both team enter 2018’s last contest in Harvard Stadium with a single division win and three Ivy League losses.
So far this season, Harvard has yet to lose by more than eight points. Of the team’s three division losses, two came to Princeton and Dartmouth. Cornell dealt the third blow. The Tigers and Big Green consist of half the remaining undefeated teams in the FCS currently.
Princeton and Dartmouth similarly downed Columbia. Penn accounted for the team’s third loss.
Harvard takes the field for the last time at the Stadium this season, as The Game will be hosted at Fenway Park. Harvard has chosen this weekend as its Senior Day.
“I’m savoring every moment out here,” Miller said. “We only have about seven practices left. [It] feels like it’s flying by, but I’m just really going to enjoy it and have a good time with these guys out here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Tommy Amaker’s 10 seasons as head coach of Harvard men’s basketball, the Crimson has earned four NCAA Tournament appearances and captured six Ivy League titles, the most recent division title coming in the 2017-2018 campaign. Despite this slew of success, Harvard has faced growing competition from other Ancient Eight programs and now fields a roster with no NCAA Tournament experience, a first for Amaker since the 2011-2012 season.
Although the Crimson came up a basket short of joining the Big Dance after losing to Penn in the 2018 Ivy League Tournament Championship, Harvard will return 99.4 percent of its scoring from last season, good enough for second most in the country. In order to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015, the Crimson will once again rely heavily on its prestiged group of juniors while receiving additional support from a highly touted group of freshman recruits and other complementary pieces.
The Roster
Returning Roster
With two seasons of collegiate play in the books, youth or inexperience can no longer be excuses for the much heralded group of juniors that comprised over 76 percent of the Crimson’s total scoring and over 67 percent of the team’s total minutes played last season. Harvard will pose arguably the most dynamic trio of offensive weapons in the Ivy League next season, spurred by the return of a healthy guard Bryce Aiken. The 2016-2017 Ivy League Rookie of the Year suited up for only 14 contests last season, battling a knee injury for much of early 2018 before shuttering his season in February.
Even through an injury-riddled sophomore year, Aiken displayed impressive early performances including a 30-point outing against UMass and a 26-point showing against Northeastern. With an important part of his game deriving from his quickness and rim-attacking abilities, the Crimson will likely have to wait patiently for its point guard to return to full form and reap the full benefits of Aiken’s playmaking.
Guiding the Crimson offense throughout Aiken’s absence was last season’s Ivy League Player of the Year, forward Seth Towns, as well as All-Ivy first team awardee Chris Lewis, whose dominant interior play saw him convert a league-best 60.1 percent of field goals. Towns and Lewis combined for 28.8 points per game last season and trailed only classmate Justin Bassey in various non-scoring metrics such as rebounding totals and steals. Towns, who was second only behind Cornell’s Matt Morgan in Ancient Eight scoring last season, will likely be again competing with the Big Red senior in terms of end-of-season offensive accolades.
The aforementioned Bassey will continue to be a critical defensive cog for Harvard after he held opponents to a league-best 66.5 points per game in 2017-2018. The Colorado Academy product was lauded as the defensive team MVP by Coach Amaker and was consistently matched up with the opposing team’s greatest scoring threats throughout his sophomore campaign. Starting 27 out of 31 games last season, Bassey logged a team-high 184 rebounds and also led the team with 79 assists.
Complementing this cast are two upperclassmen, junior guard Christian Juzang and senior captain Corey Johnson, who earned significant playing time last season but have fewer guarantees in this season’s campaign. Juzang began last season battling for fringe minutes on Amaker’s bench but was quickly thrust into a starting role due to Aiken’s continued health issues, before playing nearly every minute as the sole point guard by the conclusion of the campaign. Scoring in double digits in nine Ivy contests and averaging 40.9 percent from the field, the Tarzana, Calif., native will need to continue his consistent play in the face of competition from returnee Aiken and newcomer Spencer Freedman.
A different narrative is in play for senior captain and sharpshooter Corey Johnson, who struggled in non-conference play from deep but improved in Ancient Eight challenges with strong outings in both Columbia contests and the victory over Penn for a combined 46 points. Amaker will still rely on the senior captain for his long range shooting abilities that saw him finish his sophomore season with a 41.3 accuracy rate, as compared to the 33.1 percent average he posted last season.
Amaker needs continued growth from guard Rio Haskett and forward Danilo Djuricic, both of whom saw significant playing time in their first season in Cambridge. Haskett and Djuricic were key cogs for Harvard in the back stretch of the year, and were fixtures in Amaker’s rotations at the Ivy League tournament in Philadelphia.
Rounding out the returning players include frontcourt complements Robert Baker and Henry Welsh, who saw limited minutes in 2017-2018 as energy boosters off the bench. Seniors Tommy McCarthy and co-captain Weisner Perez will also fight for minutes on the deep Harvard roster.
The Freshmen
Along with returning nearly all of last season’s scoring, the Crimson will add the highest-rated recruiting class in the league based on 247Sport’s Composite Team Rankings. The four incoming freshmen will bolster a medley of positions on the Harvard roster and address several team needs, including ball distribution, wing versatility and frontcourt length.
Four-star combo guard Noah Kirkwood joins the team after spending last year at Northfield Mount Hermon, a nationally-ranked New England prep school which had 11 of its former players in the Ivy League in 2015-2016. The 6’7” native of Ottawa, Ont., was a Gold Medalist alongside fellow countryman Djuricic at the FIBA U-19 World Championships in 2017, following a stellar four-year stint at Asbury College High School in which Kirkword and broke almost all major school records in points, assists, rebounds and wins. Boasting a physical frame, strong rebounding skills and agile defensive ability at a variety of positions, Kirkwood’s aggressive play and versatility may create opportunities as a wing contributor similar to that of junior Justin Bassey.
The nephew of WNBA MVP and four-time Olympic gold medalist Tamika Catchings and grandson of 11-year NBA veteran Harvey Catchings, Missouri native Kale Catchings is certainly no stranger to basketball royalty. Nonetheless, the 6’6” forward and school valedictorian at Liberty High School holds plenty of accolades under his own name, including winning all-state honors and shattering single-season records in his sole year at Liberty. A mentee of current NBA All-Star and fellow St. Louis native Bradley Beal, Catchings can similarly catch fire from long range while also displaying athletic finishing at the rim.
Hailing from the greater Sacramento area, Mason Forbes received offers from West Coast schools including San Diego State and St. Mary’s but decided to pursue his college education in the frigid Northeast. With a 6’8” lanky athletic frame, Forbes will likely be known initially as the “AfroKid” by many onlookers. Regardless, the Folsom, Calif., native hopes to impress on the court in more serious ways, as a domineering shot blocker and stretch big on the beneficiary side of interior lobs. The son and grandchild of former Harlem Globetrotters, Forbes looks to continue a legacy of entertaining basketball amongst the Harvard frontcourt currently led by more traditional back-to-the-basket players such as juniors Chris Lewis and Henry Welsh.
Possessing his own Wikipedia page and boasting an impressive resume from his time at the famed Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., four-star point guard Spencer Freedman rounds out the 2018 recruiting class. Freedman enters his freshman year as a 20-year old and may be quickly propelled into an important contributing role, with likely starter Bryce Aiken still on the upswing from a knee injury. Standing at six feet even, Freedman was a three-time captain at Mater Dei and possesses strong passing and three-point acuity. Having faced fierce competition in the Orange County circuits throughout his childhood including the likes of the Ball Brothers, Freedman will be no stranger to packed crowds and the bright lights of the Ancient Eight.

Projected Starters
Guard: Bryce Aiken-JR
Guard: Justin Bassey-JR
Forward: Seth Towns-JR
Forward: Corey Johnson-SR
Forward: Chris Lewis-JR
Key Opponents - Non-Conference
UMass - November 13, Amherst, Mass.
The Crimson will travel to play the Minutemen in the second year of a home-and-home series with its in-state foes. Despite ultimately finishing 13th out of 14 teams in the Atlantic-10 conference, UMass pushed Harvard to the limit in Cambridge last November.
In that contest, Bryce Aiken hit a game-winning three-pointer in the dying seconds to lift the Crimson to its second win of the young season. The then-sophomore also tallied a career-high 30 points in front of a sold-out Lavietes Pavilion crowd, as Harvard topped UMass for the first time in the teams’ previous four matchups.
Key to repeating last year’s final result will be Harvard’s attention to Minutemen’s leading scorer Luwane Pipkins, who registered over 21 points per game as a sophomore. The Chicago, Ill., native tallied 23 points in last year’s meeting and will likely remain the focal point of UMass’ offensive sets as a crafty playmaker.
Second-year coach Matt McCall will welcome a slew of transfers who were required to sit out in his inaugural season leading the Minutemen, including Vanderbilt transfer Djery Baptiste. Big man Rashaan Holloway, who tallied fifteen points and nine rebounds against the Crimson last season, will also return for a graduate year.
After last season’s nailbiter, the early-season matchup with the Minutemen should prove an apt measuring stick for the team as the out of conference slate heats up. 
MIT - November 6, Lavietes Pavilion, Cambridge, Mass.
For the eighth straight year, Harvard’s season kicks off at home against its Cambridge neighbor, hosting MIT in the first game of the schedule for both squads. The Engineers will make the one mile journey down the Charles River in attempt to spoil the opening of the Crimson’s campaign.
Harvard’s trio of juniors—Towns, Lewis, and Aiken—all shined in last year’s matchup with MIT and will look to start the 2018-2019 season with a similar bang. Lewis recorded his first career double-double with 13 points and a then-career-high 10 rebounds, while Towns led the Crimson with 20 points to kickstart his campaign as the first sophomore Ivy League Player of the Year in 10 years. Aiken, the 2016-2017 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, added on another 12 to help defeat the Engineers.
MIT, a team even younger than Harvard that did not feature a single senior on its 2017-2018 roster, is coming off of a NEWMAC Conference Tournament Championship that earned it a bid in the Division III NCAA Tournament. The Engineers finished the season nationally ranked 19 following a loss in the Elite Eight of the Division III Tournament to Ramapo. Harvard, a similarly youthful team, will look to its gained experience from last season to launch the season in strong fashion.
St. Mary’s (Calif.) - November 24, Moraga, Calif.
Harvard will travel to the West Coast over Thanksgiving weekend hoping to avenge last season’s defeat at the hands of St. Mary’s. The Gaels, then ranked 21st in the nation, topped the Crimson 89-71 during the Wooden Legacy Tournament.
Harvard will face a tough challenge, as St. Mary’s finished last season at 30-6, second in its conference only to Gonzaga. Despite concluding the season ranked in the top 25, the then-number 25 Gaels were excluded from the tournament after dropping its WCC Tournament semifinal game to BYU. Despite what was criticized as a soft schedule, St. Mary’s felt its omission from March Madness was a snub and will look to avoid a similar absence from the tournament.
A very different team will take the court for the Gaels than the squad that prevailed over the Crimson last November. While Harvard is returning a second-best in the nation 99.4 percent of its scoring, St. Mary’s saw the departure of three of its top four scorers. This includes its star player of the 2017-2018 season, Jock Landale. The Australian center averaged 21.1 points per game last season, an average he surpassed in a 26 point showing against the Crimson.
Gaels coach Randy Bennett welcomes five new international recruits this season, including two New Zealanders, one Australian, one Estonian and one Brit. This array of talent with plenty of international experience at the youth level will bring plenty of new energy and excitement to Moraga after the departure of its “Golden Generation.”
Harvard hopes that the gained experience from its last season will be enough to tip the scales from last year and overcome the new-look Gaels.
Mercer - December 29 or 30, State Farm Arena, Atlanta, Ga.
Over the holiday break the Crimson will take on Mercer under the bright lights of State Farm Arena, home of the Atlanta Hawks. The trip to the Peach State will be a homecoming for junior forwards Chris Lewis and Robert Baker, both of whom hail from Georgia.
A basketball program most noteworthy for its 2014 NCAA Tournament upset over third-seeded Duke, Bob Hoffman’s Bears will field a young roster heading into this season. With the graduation of leading scorers Ria’n Holland and Jordan Strawberry, Mercer has retooled with eight freshmen.
The Bears finished in the middle of the pack in the Southern Conference last season, after compiling a 11-7 record against league opposition. Harvard played Mercer in 2002 and 2007, both handy wins for the Crimson in Cambridge.
The Crimson was handed a gut-wrenching, one-point road loss by the Wofford Terriers last season. The Terriers compiled a 1-2 record in 2017-2018 against the Bears, in Southern conference play. Mercer should, as Wofford did last season, provide an intriguing road test for a Harvard team that will attempt to block out the distraction (and excitement) of playing in an NBA arena. 
University of North Carolina - January 2, Chapel Hill, N.C. 
If playing at the Dean Smith Center, one of the most historic buildings in college basketball, does not provide enough motivation for the Crimson, facing off against coach Roy Williams and a perennial championship-contending program should.
The Tar Heels represent the most vaunted team on Harvard’s out of conference slate, and will in all likelihood open the season as a top-10 ranked team in the country. Despite losing centerpiece guards Theo Pinson and Joel Berry, UNC will mix a talented recruiting class featuring multiple five-star recruits with veteran players like Luke Maye, Cameron Johnson and Kenny Williams.
A mere three days after the team’s tilt with Mercer, the Jan. 2 date with the Tar Heels will serve a similar function as last year’s matchup at the University of Kentucky, testing the Crimson’s resolve against one of college basketball’s blue bloods.
Last season’s nine-point loss in Lexington, Ky., provided encouragement that the team could compete against the best teams in the country, and Coach Amaker will surely hope for similar competitiveness from his players.
And although the timing of the game might preclude the Dean Smith Center from featuring its typical student-driven fervor, playing on the road against a three-time national champion in Roy Williams will prove a daunting test for Amaker and the Harvard team.
Key Opponents - Ivy League
Cornell - vs. February 9, @ March 9
Harvard completed the rare three-game sweep on Cornell last season. The Crimson secured victories in a game decided by a three-point margin, going into double-overtime and a conference tournament runaway. Cornell proved to be the surprise of last season thanks to guard Matt Morgan and forward Stone Gettings, but will not be able to benefit from the same starpower this season.
The Big Red rode its pair of stars to surprisingly secure the final spot in the Ivy League Tournament. The worst defense in the Ancient Eight (80.4 points allowed per game) relied on offensive firepower from Morgan and Gettings. Morgan led the conference in scoring at an impressive 22.5 points per game, good for ninth in the country.
Gettings, however, has left a gaping hole on the Cornell roster. The Ivy League standout announced in May that he would be sitting out the 2018-2019 to become a graduate transfer. The forward committed to Arizona last fall and will graduate in December in order to join the Wildcats for the 2019-2020 season. If the Big Red hopes to challenge Harvard and shock the conference yet again by returning to the Ancient Eight tournament, it will have to find a way to fill the big shoes Gettings has left empty in Ithaca.
Princeton - @ February 15, vs. March 2
Following a disappointing campaign in 2017-2018, Princeton will hope to bounce back when conference play starts in 2019. The perennial powerhouse struggled under Mitch Henderson for the first time in several seasons. The Tigers finished the 2016-2017 season undefeated in the Ivy League, winning the inaugural conference tournament and even taking heavily favored Notre Dame to the buzzer in a dramatic NCAA Tournament loss. Princeton was without three top players last season, but faltered compared to preseason predictions in failing to make the Ancient Eight tournament.
The Tigers will look to its pair of newly minted senior guards, Devin Cannady and Myles Stephens, to lead the team back to the top of the Ivy League standings. Cannady and Stephens were the teams top two scorers, averaging 16.7 and 15.3 points per game, respectively. The pair contributed to a Princeton squad that shot the best in the league from beyond the arc at 37.4 percent last season.
The Crimson swept the Tigers last season, with a 15-point victory at home and an overtime thriller on the road. Both teams return key players this season and should compete in a pair of decisive heavyweight battles.
Yale - vs. February 1, @ February 23
Harvard’s oldest rival, like the Crimson, will field a very familiar team in this season’s campaign. Yale returns all five of its starters from last season, including star junior guard Miye Oni. Oni, the Bulldogs’ leading scorer with 15.1 points per game, stepped up to the occasion following a disappointing finale to the Yale chapter of 2016-2017 preseason Ivy League Player of the Year Makai Mason. Mason, who missed the entire 2016-2017 season following a preseason injury, played in only one game in his senior season. His next collegiate appearance will come as a member of the Baylor Bears.
Despite Mason’s absence, Yale safely made the Ivy League Tournament as the third-seeded team. Oni and company were not enough to move forward at the Palestra, being trounced by Penn in the first round.
Harvard swept Yale in two of its best defensive performances of the year last season, allowing only 52 and 49 points to the Bulldogs in the Crimson’s two wins over Yale. This time around will look similar, as both squads will return all of its starters as of last season’s end, with the addition of previously injured juniors in Aiken and Yale forward Jordan Bruner entering into the mix. These circumstances paired with the always-exciting Harvard-Yale rivalry set the scene for a pair of anticipatory matchups between the two squads this season.
Penn - @ February 16, vs. March 1
The reigning Ivy League Tournament champions that shared the regular season title with the Crimson will look to earn a second straight trip to the NCAA Tournament. Last season, Harvard and Penn split their regular season series, each winning at home. The deciding game, also played on Penn’s home court at the Palestra in Philadelphia, swung in the Quakers’ favor.
Although Penn lost guards Darnell Foreman and Caleb Wood, two of the team’s top four scorers, it returns its top two scorers, juniors Ryan Bentley and AJ Brodeur, who combined for 33 of the Quakers’ 68 points against the Crimson in the Ancient Eight tournament championship. Brodeur recorded a double-double in the contest with 16 points and 10 rebounds, which was not a rare sight for the forward, who finished second in the Ivy League in rebounds.
Penn’s balanced team won games on both ends of the court last season through solid play, with its third-ranked offense and second-ranked defense combining for a leading +7.0 average scoring margin. Harvard finished with a distant second-place at +1.7.
The Quakers will have to avoid letting off-the-court distractions get in the way of repeating last season’s success. This summer, it was revealed that former head coach Jerome Allen was incidentally caught up in a bribery scandal when a Miami businessman that had retained the coach for his son was indicted for Medicaid fraud. Although Allen is no longer with Penn and is now a coach for the NBA’s Boston Celtics, the recruiting scandal is unlikely to disappear from the media throughout the season. Nevertheless, the talented Quakers squad that earned itself a trip to the NCAA Tournament last season is sure to grapple with the Crimson for the top spot in the Ivy League.
Season Outlook 
After coming up four points shy of an Ancient Eight title and an NCAA Tournament berth last season, the Crimson will look to go the distance this season. Losing under one percent of last year’s scoring, the return of a healthy Aiken and another talented recruiting class for coach Amaker, the Crimson appear in good position to return to its first Big Dance since 2015.
Harvard will open its season at home, hosting MIT on November 6 at Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In order to be the best, you have to beat the best.
This cliché permeates the sports world frequently, but for Harvard women’s basketball, it’s a mindset they must adapt to as the start of the 2018-2019 campaign draws near. There will be no warm-up game designed to spoon-feed the team’s confidence.
For the Crimson, the season will start in South Bend, with the unenviable task of taking on defending national champion Notre Dame. But for a Harvard team looking to return to its first NCAA tournament in 12 seasons, playing the Fighting Irish will serve as a measuring stick against the very best that the country has to offer.
“I think it's a win-win for us, and it's an unbelievable opportunity, it’s gonna tell us where we are,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I think we are better than where we've been in the recent past, and this is the test. Who better than to play against than last year’s national champions with all their stars returning? It's a big challenge for us and we really have nothing to lose. And doesn't that set up the greatest athletic matchup? And to be able to compete, let’s just give it a try.”
The road matchup means even more to one of the team’s veteran leaders.
Captain Madeline Raster, entering her final season, will be travelling home to South Bend to face off against Notre Dame.
“It’s something I’ve been looking forward to for awhile, and I know my family is really looking forward to it,” Raster said. “I grew up going to Notre Dame basketball games.”
This year, the Crimson will look to improve upon an encouraging Ancient Eight season that ended at the hands of Ivy Madness hosts Penn. A nail-biting semifinal in which Harvard had several opportunities to tie the game in the final seconds ended in heartbreak, and the resulting loss relegated the Crimson to the NIT, where they suffered an opening round loss at Fordham.
“Coming off of last year we were very disappointed in how it ended up, and this year it's all about change, so we’re establishing new rules, new traditions, new habits to form this championship culture to result in a championship in March because at the end of the day that's our main goal,” said junior point guard Katie Benzan. “We have the talent to get there, but just little changes here and there will help us push over that edge and actually get to the top versus right there. That's just the worst type of pain to be right there and able to do it, but it just didn't go your way.”
In game that felt like a hangover from the loss to the Quakers, Harvard leapt out to a nine-point first half lead before the Rams outscored them 41-14 in the second half. The disappointing loss marked the end of Taylor Rooks’ and Kirby Porter’s collegiate careers.
“We came off of last season pretty disappointed, knowing we had to make some dramatic changes, and we feel we did,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think the staff and I and the captains and everybody just said ‘we gotta make a change.’”
The narrow loss in the semifinals of the Ivy League Tournament, coupled with the second-half collapse in the Bronx will serve as motivation for a re-invigorated Crimson team that will open its season at Notre Dame and Big Ten foe Purdue. For Harvard to reach its potential early and often throughout the season, it will rely heavily on Benzan, the team’s leading scorer and three-point shooter. The Wellesley, Mass. native set several Ivy League records last season, and will look to continue her prolific career for the Crimson as the team’s main contributor and distributor.
“We’re just so excited, for one to play against someone other than ourselves, but also that our first two games in Indiana are at Notre Dame and at Purdue, and those games are gonna be high intensity and high energy, just very competitive,” Benzan said. “It’s the best competition out there and the biggest test. We’re just all excited to go out there and test ourselves and see where we’re at and whether we’re in a good place and where there's room for improvement.”
While the loss of Porter and Rooks will hurt Harvard, the team will add a talented duo of freshman from the Boston area, as Maggie McCarthy and Tess Sussman will help fortify the Crimson’s depth at guard.
McCarthy was a four-year starter at Medfield High, earning Tri-Valley MVP honors in three consecutive seasons. Sussman, a native of Needham, Mass., was a four-year starter and two-year captain at The Rivers School, scoring over 1000 points in her high school career.
“We feel this is a pretty veteran team, and the two freshmen are maybe two of the quickest learners I've ever coached,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re just local kids and they’re close with each other and close with our team because they’re local, and they just haven't missed a beat. I feel like I’m coaching a lot of returners and a pretty veteran team.”
The local Sussman also saw some now-familiar faces in her high school career.
“Tess Sussman played for my rival high school,” Benzan said. “We definitely went head-to-head multiple times.”
McCarthy and Sussman will begin their careers at Harvard under the guidance of senior guards Raster and Sydney Skinner, who will serve as co-captains this season.
Raster and Skinner will play a crucial role, both as emotional leaders and as replacements for some of the scoring lost with Rooks’ departure. The graduating senior tallied 12.5 points per game last season, just a point off of Benzan’s team-leading mark, and will be sorely missed as an offensive spark for the Crimson.
A familiar face will also help shore up Harvard’s depth — forward Maria Guramare will return for her second season in Cambridge after missing the entirety of the 2017-2018 season. The Bedarrides, France, native will rejoin a frontcourt anchored by junior Jeannie Boehm and sophomore Jadyn Bush.
Boehm continued to improve in her second season for the Crimson, registering nearly 10 points per game and chipping in seven rebounds, alongside an impressive two-and-a-half blocks per contest. The junior will look to the free-throw line as a potential area of improvement — through her first two seasons at Harvard, Boehm has shot 25 percent from the charity stripe.
The squad starts the season with its tough road trip through Indiana, playing on the road against the unanimous number one team in the country in Notre Dame before traveling to Purdue. The remainder of 2018 holds a slew of non-conference opponents including Rutgers, BU, and Cal. Following the turn of the year, Harvard will head into conference play. Although they refuse to get ahead of themselves, the Ancient Eight always looms.
“I think the Ivy League is a tremendous conference to play in and it gets better and better every year, and I think it's gonna be at its highest every year,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think it's a tremendous conference to play in and I think every program in the Ivy League has a lot of positives that they can attach to their seasons and preach to their players that they have these things to go on, and that's going to make for a very exciting Ivy League conference for sure.”
Before the scheduled games, however, the team was hard at work in preparation — this year’s offseason took an international route.
“Something that was different this year is that in the last week of August we went to Spain together as a team and spent two weeks there visiting all the tourist sites,” Benzan said. “Then we played three games in Spain against three different professional teams in Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia.”
The Crimson won all three of its matchups in the Spanish exhibition slate, showing promise for the upcoming season. Harvard also implemented some unique methods of preparation completely outside the realm of the basketball court.
“In preparation, we worked with this program that hires former Navy SEALs that leads a leadership and mental toughness program,” Benzan said. “We did that for two days working on the football field, running with sandbags on our back, lifting a log of wood, and the next morning at five am we had to go down to the pool and did some stuff down there, so it was different.”
Discipline has emerged as a strong theme for the squad this season, with multiple players echoing mental toughness this season. This sentiment starts right at the top with the returning captain.
“The big thing for us this year is the idea of discipline, and that manifests itself in a lot of different forms,” Raster said. “Last year we had a lot of good talent and the basketball skill, but it was more on the mental side where we sort of struggled, so reorienting our mindset towards more of a disciplined mindset is going to hopefully be the difference this year.”
Delaney-Smith and the rest of the coaching staff hope to see the hard preseason work pay off quickly in a tough slate of early games. Despite the anxiousness behind a new season, Delaney-Smith feels confident in her team.
“All coaches feel [at the start of the year] like they don't have everything in that they want, but I feel pretty good,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think our team is smart, I think they’re very focused, and I think they’re more disciplined than we've had in awhile, and I think that's going to lead to good things.”
Now matter how the team feels, the season is coming on November 9th. The Crimson have done all they can in preparation, and it is now time to see some different competition in games that count.
“If you ask the players, they're ready to get started,” said Delaney-Smith, echoing Benzan. “They get very tired of playing themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last tournament of 2018, the Harvard women’s tennis team hosts Harvard Invitational this weekend. The team will see competition from Boston University, Syracuse, Georgetown, Cornell, and Michigan State. The team has had a successful preseason so far and is coming off a 15-3 win in the Harvard Fall Scramble a couple weekends ago.
On Friday, the Crimson will split up the team to compete against Georgetown and Michigan State. Syracuse serves as Saturday’s lone opponent, and a matchup with Boston University will cap off the weekend on Sunday. All matches will consist of singles and doubles play.
“We are really excited because we know these teams are going to be strong,” sophomore Anna Li said. “We’ve seen how they have been competing and we’re excited to see how we do against them this weekend.”
For freshman Rachel Lim, the focus on the doubles play over the past week has been key to preparation. Harvard is an impressive 21-9 in doubles matches over this offseason, yet the team sees room to improve. Practices have have been emphasizing aggressiveness and communication.
“Our doubles play is improving; that is very essential to the college tennis format and we have been getting some really strong doubles play in against other teams,” Lim said. “Communicating well on the court and staying aggressive as a team in our game plan and mindset [will be key to doubles pairings].”
The freshmen on the team, Annika Bassey, Rachel Eason, Chelsea Williams, and Rachel Lim have proved to be a strong force for the team. They won seven out of their eight matches in the Harvard Fall Scramble, and Eason and Lim both went undefeated in singles play. The combined freshmen singles record over this preseason is a remarkable 18-5.
The freshmen are clearly making a positive impact on the team’s success, and perhaps that is because of the team’s focus on building a positive, cohesive team for all classes. The team has been emphasizing teamwork and bonding, particularly with the freshmen.
This past weekend, the team invited two military servicemembers to speak about holding each other accountable, and they took this practice into action through a 7:00 AM hike in 40 degree rainy and windy weather.
“That was something we really bonded over,” Li said. “We are all in pretty good physical and mental shape. The thing we think that will set us apart is the team bonding and holding each other accountable. It brings us to the next level.”
Heading into the final match of the season, the team has been clearly been focused on building camaraderie and accountability.
For mental toughness, the team speaks to a sports psychologist to obtain that mental edge that is absolutely key for success in tennis. The team recognizes that mental preparedness and mental toughness is just as important as consistent fitness and strong physical shape.
While emphasizing the team dynamic, the team has also been encouraged to search for how they individually contribute to the success of the team. The team is only as strong as the individuals who make it up.
“Find our one more,” is the motto the team has been following, Li said. “We are going to spend time on figuring out what that is… so that we can come back and make the team as strong as possible.”
This tournament is not only an exciting opportunity to see great tennis matches, but it is also special for the teams, because it includes a social event for all schools. The Saturday night banquet serves as a social event for all the schools in which all players get to know each other over dinner and dancing.
However, the Crimson sees this weekend as an opportunity for important, competitive matches, more so than bonding with the other teams. It will be a strong judgement of their potential success in the spring season.
“We are really looking forward to this match experience to help continue our training for the upcoming season,” Lim said. “We are basically just looking to finish strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team begins the home portion of its 2018-2019 schedule on Friday night, hosting No. 15/12 Quinnipiac at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The Bobcats (5-0-0, 0-0-0 ECAC), as suggested by their ranking, have enjoyed a promising start the campaign, rattling off five victories to open the year. After finishing the 2017-2018 schedule under .500 for the first time in its Division-I history, this is just the start Quinnipiac needed.
Harvard (0-1-0, 0-1-0) looks to improve upon its performance last Saturday at Dartmouth, ceding seven goals in an tough —but exciting — overtime loss. For Crimson coach Ted Donato '91, who has jumbled the lines and given Friday's starting net-minder duties to backup Cameron Gornet, team defense will be a point of emphasis this weekend against two dangerous scoring teams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the question after the Harvard men’s hockey team’s season-opening overtime loss was whether the Crimson would be able to maintain a high enough compete level through three periods to keep the game in its control. In many ways, though, the nature of Friday’s home opener against No. 15/12 Quinnipiac, if not the result, was decided in its early minutes.
“The game’s most important at the start,” said head coach Ted Donato ’91. “‘Catch-up hockey is losing hockey.’ I had a coach that used to tell me that all the time, and it is.”
That, in essence, summed up Harvard’s failed comeback effort, as the hosts (0-2-0, 0-2-0 ECAC) fell to the Bobcats (6-0-0, 1-0-0) by a score of 5-3. A pinballing puck squeaked past junior net-minder Cam Gornet, putting the visitors up less than three minutes into the contest. Quinnipiac began full-throttle and looked the part of the confident team a ways into its season against the relatively untested Crimson squad — a fact that probably did not help Gornet, who was making his first career start at home, and his first start since the Beanpot consolation game on Feb. 12.
Immediately after conceding the goal, Harvard was prevented from gaining momentum as senior defenseman Adam Baughman headed to the penalty box. Later in the first period, as the hosts seemed to have found their footing, the Bobcats struck again on a Crimson slip-up. Sophomore forward Odeen Tufto made his way to the slot unguarded, and was in just the right place to one-time home a pass from the behind the net. The visitors left the ice jubilant after 20 minutes, leading 2-0.
“We’re yet to play a full 60 minutes,” said co-captain and forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage. “We had a lot of promising moments in the game, and I think that if we kind of string that together, then there’s a lot of hope for this team…. We have to sharpen things up.”
As a second blow, Harvard started the middle frame on the penalty kill again. This time Quinnipiac capitalized just 55 seconds after the puck had dropped with a seeing-eye shot from senior defenseman Brandon Fortunato. Only a minute later, another Crimson skater was whistled for a minor — but to the relief of Harvard fans in the rink, the Bobcats committed a penalty of their own. 4-on-4 play opened the ice up well for these fast-skating teams, but Quinnipiac was not done yet. Another tally followed; the Crimson had now fallen behind 4-0.
Score effects notwithstanding, though, Harvard was racking up shots, searching for the cracks in Bobcats sophomore goaltender Keith Petruzzelli’s steadiness. A mere half minute later, rookie defenseman Jack Rathbone found that crack with a snapshot near the top of the right circle, and nabbed his first collegiate goal.
“We’re all really satisfied about how our younger guys have been,” Zerter-Gossage said. “This team has been one that’s gotten a lot of production out of young guys in the last few years when we’ve had success, and [Rathbone is] definitely no different than that.”
That first goal energized the Crimson once more. A flashy display of stick-handling from junior blueliner Adam Fox put Zerter-Gossage on the receiving end of a chance in front of Petruzzelli; with a cool head fake, the senior forward tucked it into the net. Harvard had notched two goals in less than a minute, and looked as if it could ride that momentum even further.
“The pace of the game was great,” said Quinnipiac head coach Rand Pecknold. “It was a really good hockey game…[but] we weathered the storm.”
There was to be no comeback that night. Yet another goal from the visitors ended the second period; the Crimson spent the third period with long shifts in the offensive zone, but could not finish on its chances. Though co-captain Michael Floodstrand did add a goal early in the third, it proved to be too little, too late.
The Bobcats were strong contenders coming into this matchup, but the chippy, back-and-forth nature of the game meant a few strong shifts could have turned the tide either way. In fact, it was the visitors’ quick strikes on Harvard lapses that put the game away. Most importantly, though, Quinnipiac’s star players, from Tufto to captain Chase Priskie, made the most of their chances.
“[Quinnipiac] played a smart game; they didn’t make many mistakes,” coach Donato said. “Overall we did a lot of things that are helpful to winning, but I don’t think we really had a winning recipe…. In general, we needed to be better in almost all facets of the game.”
With Gornet (.833 SV%) starting this game, the Crimson faces a continuation of its goalie debate from last season. The junior certainly made some dramatic saves, going cross-crease to rob rookie forward Ethan de Jong and silencing the already-cheering Bobcats fans. But Harvard is staring at an ugly 5.99 goals against average, which might warrant increased focus on overall team defense.
The turnaround time to answer these questions is not long; on Saturday, the Crimson plays host to Princeton, which is fresh off a triumphant 7-1 win at Dartmouth and returns much of its high-power scoring.
“[Princeton is] a great measuring stick for us,” coach Donato said, “I think we’re a resilient group, and we’ll dust ourselves off, and be excited to come out and play against a very good Princeton team tomorrow night.”

Totally bamboozled about your concentration? Stressed beyond words about the upcoming declaration deadline? We asked Flyby sophomores why they picked their field of study — or the fields of study they're still choosing between. Welcome to Why I Declared 2018.
Applied Math: Trula J. Rael
I came to Harvard without the faintest idea of what to concentrate in, but after taking SLS20 freshman fall, I became fascinated with psychology. I wanted my concentration to answer the question “How do I want to explore the world?” As the ramifications of what I was learning in class began to pop up in daily life, psychology seemed like an interesting lens to take. Harvard’s intro Math M sequence sat quietly in the corner as a non-negotiable everyday occurrence until freshman spring, when I realized I’d happily do a pset over a reading response any day. Embracing my inner math nerd, I discovered I was fascinated by the idea of learning one technique and using it to solve an incredible array of problems, how I loved the little thrill I got after figuring out the key.
Meanwhile, as I memorized terms for Social Psych, I loved the concepts but couldn’t get past the methods. Even though Applied Math began to look like a potential avenue for combining my interests, I had never really considered a concentration in anything math-related. Having not even gotten to Calculus before college, the climb seemed steep and I wasn’t sure if I had a place in the math community — I still feel a twinge of shame when I tell anyone in STEM that I started with Math Ma.
While I don’t know if I’m making the right choice, and I certainly don’t know where this choice will lead me, I want to explore the world through numbers and equations and formulas without leaving the fascinating implications of psych behind. I chose Applied Math with an application in Psych because I’m hoping that it will let me do just that.
Integrated Biology: Ben S. Rhee
Ever since I got to Harvard, I knew I was interested in pursuing something related to STEM, and I figured that I would be able to narrow down my options with time. After freshman year, I zeroed in on biology, but had no clue which kind. After getting advice from upperclassmen friends, advisors, and the course websites, I decide to take OEB10, the gateway course for the integrative biology (IB) concentration.
Two months have passed, and so far, I can sum up my experience in this path with three words: accessible, interesting, and familiar. Not only is the staff friendly, but the class is just small enough that one can actually feel recognized. The subject matter is refreshing: after a year of molecular biology and chemical reactions, learning about biodiversity and exotic invertebrates was a breath of fresh air and a new perspective on how to approach STEM. Finally, the class is very hands-on: section is filled with relevant experiments, and my class actually took a field trip to Boston Harbor Island a few weeks ago.
All in all, I feel secure and excited about declaring a concentration in IB this fall. I look forward to exploring this subject further and enjoying the company of the staff and the other students who have already demonstrated how awesome IB will be.
Neuroscience: Claire J. Hoffman
As someone really interested in medicine, I've always loved to know how things work and what makes people tick, and on the most basic level, that’s what neuroscience is. I get to learn about how and why the brain works the way it does, which is super cool in my opinion. It gets better though, because I’ll also study how things such as diseases and drugs can impact the brain, and therefore the rest of the body in in different ways, which I think is fascinating.
Not to mention, neuroscience combines a few different disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and psychology, and I think it’s really fun to be able to take classes in a pretty wide distribution of fields — it means I get plenty of choices on how I fulfill my requirements! After all, the brain is running the show when it comes to the human body ­— understanding cognitive function at both the chemical and behavioral level helps us understand so much about why our bodies work the way they do. Finally, on a more practical level, neuroscience fits the premed requirements super nicely, and who doesn’t love to make life a little easier when you can?
Neuroscience: Linda Lee
I am concentrating in Neuroscience on the Mind, Brain, and Behavior track with a secondary in Computer Science. No, I’m not pre-med. But what made me stay on the path of neuroscience was my rooted passion for the brain and how its molecular and biological pathways influence how we think, learn, and feel, and ultimately, who we are as people. The MBB track allows me to approach my studies in neuroscience with this more niche angle. It can be difficult to choose within the life sciences, especially when there are so many at Harvard. Personally, although I love studying biology in general, I’m more interested in how biological concepts apply toward a more specific field. Also, the brain is cool. I would recommend asking yourself not just “What am I interested in and hope to pursue in the future?” but also “What can I devote myself to for four years that won’t drive me to the edge?”
I also decided to pursue CS secondary because CS50’s marketing tactics actually worked on me. Working on CS challenges me in a new way, and the possibilities of the field are endless. Tech is truly everywhere, and those skills can be applicable for any career. It can be frustrating when you have no idea what you’re doing, but the rush of dopamine from finally solving a pset is just enough to carry you to the next one. CS is a field where you are constantly learning, no matter how high up you are in the workplace, so you’ll never be bored.
