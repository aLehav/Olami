After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just under eight minutes to go in the final frame and the Harvard women’s hockey team holding on to a 2-1 lead, junior forward Lyndsey Fry was called for hooking, providing Rensselaer with a crucial power play opportunity to even the score.
18 seconds later, teammate and fellow junior forward Gina McDonald joined Fry in the penalty box on a cross-checking call, giving the Engineers nearly a full two minutes of having a 5-on-3 advantage on the ice.
But freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who completed a third-period shutout, thwarted any RPI attempts at a late comeback, making two critical saves, and the Engineers couldn’t convert on the special teams opportunity, despite taking five shots during their power play.
“Honestly, it’s not something that happens to us very often, to be on a 5-on-3, but we practice our penalty kill a lot, and we’re prepared for any situation,” Fry said. “ I think we’ve only had one goal against us on penalty kill, and it brings confidence to our game. We trust each other, we trust our goalies, and we do the little things to make sure that nobody gets by us.”
The Crimson (11-1-1, 9-0-0 ECAC) held on for the remaining five minutes on Saturday afternoon at Houston Field House to eke out a 2-1 victory over RPI (6-12-2, 4-6-0 ECAC), keeping its league record unblemished. With the win, No. 4 Harvard broke a four-game Engineers winning streak and catapulted over Quinnipiac into the top spot in the ECAC with 18 points.
“RPI is definitely a tough team; they always give us a tough game,” sophomore defender Michelle Picard said. “They’re physical and strong and they battle hard, so they’re a fun team to play against, and we always know that it’s going to be a tough one. It was a great win for us, especially coming back to start off 2013 with two wins.”
The final period was rife with special teams opportunities, as both teams were penalized three times. The Engineers came up empty-handed on all three of its power plays, all of which came in the third frame.
The Crimson only converted on one of its four power play opportunities, but that was enough to take home the victory. With RPI’s junior defender Madison Marzario on a penalty for checking early in the third period, Harvard quickly took advantage of the situation to break a 1-1 tie.
Senior defender Kelsey Romatoski sent the puck down the ice to sophomore forward Hilary Crowe, who found her shot blocked by sophomore goaltender Kelly O’Brien. But sophomore forward Samantha Reber was there to collect the rebound, and she passed it to Romatoski, who slid it past O’Brien to give the Crimson the lead for the remaining 14 minutes.
After lighting up the arena with nine goals against Union the night before, Harvard was held scoreless in the first period, where goaltenders on both sides achieved shutouts. But when the second frame began, the Crimson came out firing.
“It’s kind of tough coming off of a huge win like that, where the goals are just coming one after the other, to come and play a team that’s going to be a lot better in their defensive end,” Fry said. “ [Harvard coach Katey Stone] normally doesn’t have to say much because we’re pretty good at figuring out what we have to do as players, but we regrouped [after the first period] and realized that every game is different, and the way we won last night was a lot different from the way we had to win today,”
Less than three minutes into the second, senior forward Jillian Dempsey intercepted the puck from sophomore defender Kathryn Schilter behind the Engineers net and sent it to a wide-open junior forward Kalley Armstrong. Armstrong, who was waiting in the slot, slapped the puck past O’Brien’s pads to put Harvard on the scoreboard first.
The Crimson outshot RPI 26-20, taking half of its shots in the third period. Maschmeyer recorded 19 saves on the day, while her RPI counterpart notched 24 to hold Harvard, ranked sixth in the nation on scoring offense with 3.59 goals per game, to just two.
Engineers freshman forward Mari Mankey notched RPI’s only goal, which came near the end of the second period. Mankey appeared to be passing from the left of the crease, but instead of finding a teammate, the puck ricocheted off of Maschmeyer’s leg into the back of the net, knotting the score at one apiece.
With 1:08 left before the final buzzer, the Engineers pulled O’Brien from the game, opting to go for six attackers on the ice, but the offensive advantage failed to force an overtime period.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team opened its dual-meet season Saturday morning at the Malkin Athletic Center with a win over Rider, 24-17. The Crimson (1-0, 0-0 EIWA) took five of ten matches from the Broncs (4-2, 0-0 CAA) to secure the victory.
Freshman 125-pounder Jeffrey Ott pulled Harvard ahead just over a minute into the eighth match of the meet with a fall over Rider freshman Patrick Skinner. The win came on the heels of a 2-1 overtime victory by sophomore heavyweight David Ng.
"That was just a gutsy match," said Crimson coach Jay Weiss of the performance from Ng, who prevented an escape in the second overtime period to hang on for the win.
In the next match, Ott opened strong to swing the meet in Harvard's favor.
"[Ott] is just a goer. He can just put guys on their backs at will," Weiss said. "He went out there and took charge right away."
The rookie from Chelmsford, Mass. was energized by Ng's win and home state support.
"I knew if I won with Steven [Keith] and Ryan [Osleeb] coming behind me that we'd be in good shape," Ott said. "I had a bunch of people from Massachusetts coming out to support me, so it was great in my first home match to get the pin and basically put the match away."
The Broncs struck first as Rider freshman Curt Delia recorded a technical fall over Crimson sophomore Alexis Wagener in the 149-lb. division. But No. 9 co-captain Walter Peppelman responded for Harvard in the next match with a lightning-quick pin ten seconds into the 157-lb. grapple to record the fall over Broncs junior Patrick Sabatini and push the Crimson ahead, 6-5.
"That is pretty remarkable," Weiss said of Peppelman's ten-second pin. "That doesn't happen often in college. [Peppelman] likes to do that kind of stuff, so that was a lot of fun."
While Harvard keeps no official records about match length, Peppelman's match ranks among the quickest in Crimson history. Peppelman claims to have recorded a six-second pin earlier in his collegiate career.
After the fourth match, Harvard remained one point up on Rider. Broncs junior Ramon Santiago won a 7-4 decision over Crimson freshman Devon Gobbo in the 165-lb. division, but junior 174-pounder Cameron Croy put Harvard back on top, 9-8, with a 6-3 decision over junior James Brundage.
Rider won back-to-back decisions in the fifth and sixth matches to surge ahead, 14-9, as sophomore 184-pounder Clint Morrison defeated Crimson sophomore Josh Popple, 9-2, and unranked sophomore Donald McNeil surprised No. 20 James Fox, 8-2, in the 197-lb. division.
"Fox has still got some rust on because he hasn't competed all first semester. He didn't wrestle his best, but I know that was kind of his first time back," Weiss said. "I think he's going to just keep getting better and better."
Ng and Ott's back-to-back victories in the next two matches sealed the final lead change of the meet to give Harvard an 18-14 advantage with two matches left. Rider 133-pounder Jimmy Morris won a narrow 5-4 decision over Crimson sophomore Ryan Osleeb in the penultimate match to push the Broncs within a point of the lead, but a shorthanded Rider squad opted to forfeit the final match of the meet in the 141-lb. division to No. 10 Steven Keith.
For the first time, Harvard Athletics will offer live and on-demand online-streaming of wrestling for all five Crimson home meets this season. Saturday's installment featured color commentary from two-time wrestling All-American Dennis DeNuzio '98.
"It's really exciting. Our video department is doing an outstanding job," Weiss said. "I got emails from fans today saying it was really cool to watch us. We're just trying to get to the next level, to get people aware of what we're doing as a team."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cruising through the first half without ever giving up its lead, the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself battling for its second consecutive win in a contentious second period.
Tied at 49 with four minutes to play, a three pointer by senior forward Victoria Lippert sparked a 14-7 run to close out the game and hand Harvard (9-5) its last non-conference win over Rhode Island (5-10), 63-56.
“We were kind of taken aback that it became such a close game,” said co-captain and forward Emma Golen, who knocked down back-to-back treys in the opening minutes of the game. “At the end we finally dug in and realized the power was in our hands.”
The Crimson held a five-point lead coming into the second period, but the Rams came out firing, tying up the game in just over a minute. Over the next 15 minutes, Harvard fought to stay in the game, tying up the score three more times before taking the lead at the sixteen-minute mark.
“We just didn’t flow as well offensively,” Golen said of the second half. “There was no connection on the floor and our energy was lacking. We just weren’t playing team Harvard basketball, which was a little disappointing.”
Junior guard Christine Clark led the way down the stretch, adding seven of her game-high 21 points in the final four minutes. Clark shot 8-14 from the field, and tallied four points from the charity stripe. Back-to-back free throws by Lippert with four seconds on the clock iced the hard-won victory for the Crimson.
“I thought we were a better team, and we wanted to keep the game at a higher level,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we had just inexplicable defensive errors, and it wasn’t just one person. It was a snowball effect of not being on the same page as a team."
The Crimson opened the matchup in a dominant fashion, jumping out to a ten-point lead five minutes in and holding the Rams to just one score, a jump shot by leading scorer Brianna Thomas. The freshman guard tallied 15 points and was spelled by sophomore guard Megan Strauman, who added 10 points.
With Harvard up by eight points in the final minutes of the half, Rhode Island crawled within five, driving to the basket and making three consecutive layups without a Harvard score after the Crimson committed turnovers on the two punctuating possessions. Turnovers continue to plague the Crimson down the stretch, handing the Rams 17 points to Harvard’s nine.
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle—who added nine points for the Crimson—helped spell the defensive lapses with strong post play. Fagbenle led the team for the fifth straight game with 10 rebounds—including nine on defense—against a physical Rams squad.
“Unfortunately [Fagbenle] didn’t get the calls going her way,” Delaney-Smith said. “For a young kid that’s a frustrating situation, and that’s not going to be unusual for her. Regardless of how the calls go she just has to understand how valuable she is to this game.”
Senior Elle Hagedorn was crucial to the defensive effort off the bench, adding four rebounds and three steals. The guard—who averages 2.3 points per game in 17 minutes of play—led the team with a season-high four assists and matched her season-high eight points, shooting 2-2 and knocking down four free throws in 29 minutes of play.
“[Hagedorn is] a defensive stopper and a sparkplug off the bench,” Delaney-Smith said. “She can beat anybody off the drive, and she took it to the hole really well tonight. I think she defaults to some of our statistical leaders when there are times that we would like her to be a scorer as well."
Five of Hagedorn’s eight points came late in the second half. Down by four with eight minutes to play, she hit a layup to bring Harvard within two. After Clark hit two free throws, Hagedorn drove to the basket a second time, drawing the foul and completing the three-point play from the stripe to put the Crimson on top.
In its victory, Harvard outshot the Rams across the board, capitalizing on its three-point prowess to make up for its 68.2 free throw percentage, which dipped below its 75.5 season mark. The Crimson made more than half of its shots from the perimeter for the fifth time this season, and its 41.7 season record is good for third in the NCAA.
Harvard’s win moved the team to 9-5 on the season entering Ivy League play and marked the Rams’ fourth consecutive loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team’s midseason slide hit another low point Saturday night, as the Crimson dropped a 6-2 decision at No. 5/9 Quinnipiac that leaves it winless in its last six games.
The Bobcats (16-3-2, 10-0-0 ECAC) scored two goals in the first ten minutes and never looked back, as Harvard (4-7-1, 3-5-0) junior goaltender Raphael Girard allowed five goals for the third time in four contests.
“It was a tough game,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “[But] I don’t really think the result reflects the game itself. I think it was a lot closer.”
Playing without leading scorer Jimmy Vesey—who was in Ufa, Russia helping the United States win gold at the IIHF World Junior Championships—the Crimson struggled to get anything going offensively, especially on the power-play, as it managed just one goal on its eight man-up opportunities against the ECAC’s best penalty kill.
At the other end, Girard made just 12 saves in 17 attempts before being pulled midway through the second period in favor of freshman Peter Traber, who for the second time in three games was forced to fill in for the junior who last year was dominant down the stretch in sparking the Crimson’s run to the ECAC Championship Game.
It was in a February contest against the Bobcats last season that Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 called on Girard to replace a struggling Steve Michalek in net.
Girard saved all 26 shots fired at him that night to energize a Harvard comeback win. From there the junior was on his way to the ECAC Goaltender of the Month award and owned the nation’s fourth-best save percentage by the end of the year.
Eleven months later, it was another game against Quinnipiac that could force a struggling Girard back into a platoon.
“I’d put the loss more on me than on my teammates,” the goalie said. “I need to step up my game.”
The Bobcats got on the board early and often Saturday night in front of a sellout crowd at the TD Bank Sports Center to extend their unbeaten streak to 14 games.
Bryce Van Brabant scored just 1:51 into the match with a shot over Girard’s shoulder from the left faceoff circle, and minutes later Travis St. Denis put home a one-timer off a two-on-one to extend Quinnipiac’s lead to 2-0.
Senior forward Luke Greiner cut the Bobcats’ lead in half later in the period. Classmate Marshall Everson emerged from a four-player scrum behind the net and pushed the puck to Greiner, who fired a one-timer past Eric Hartzell for the score.
But coming out of the first intermission, the Bobcats tallied three goals in the period’s first nine minutes to extend their lead to 5-1 and send Girard to the bench.
Matthew Peca scored first, putting a rebound away over the goalie’s shoulder on a power-play following a tripping-the-goalie penalty on freshman Brayden Jaw.
Just over two minutes later, Fallstrom scored a backhanded goal but was called for interference, negating the score and giving Quinnipiac another man-up chance. The Bobcats took full advantage when Loren Barron beat Girard to make it 4-1.
At the 8:43 mark of the period, Cory Hibbeler added Quinnipiac’s fifth score off a draw in the defensive zone.
“It was a game of mistakes,” Girard said. “For every team it’s the same.... If you turn the puck over you’re going to [allow] shots.”
Fallstrom added a power-play goal—his third goal of the season—with four seconds to go in the period.
“We were on the five-on-three,” Fallstrom explained. “[Freshman] Colin Blackwell got the puck up to [captain] Danny Biega at the point. He shot it and it just kind of hit my stick—it was lucky—and it went in.”
Traber saved 21 of 22 shots in the third to limit the bleeding. Mike Dalhulsen scored the Bobcats’ lone goal of the period with six seconds remaining, putting the icing on the cake of the dominant win.
Harvard was outshot by a 39-to-23 margin on the night and Quinnipiac won sixty percent of the contest’s faceoffs.
“Everybody’s got to step up their game,” Girard said. “We’ve got a tough schedule, but we’re a tough team. We’ve got a lot of talent; we’ve got to lay it on the line, keep working hard, and the results will come.”
“We’re obviously disappointed,” Fallstrom added. “But we can’t think too much about it, since we’ve got a big one coming up Wednesday against [No. 6/9] BU.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a four game losing streak, the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-7-1, 3-5 ECAC) will be happy to have one of its key offensive contributors back in the lineup.
Freshman Jimmy Vesey was missing in action the past few weeks for the Crimson. The forward was busy helping USA’s U20 national team win gold in the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. On Saturday, the U.S. topped defending champion Sweden, 3-1, in the gold medal match. The victory was the first for an American squad since 2010 and a marked improvement over last year’s seventh place finish.
Vesey saw action in all seven games for the U.S., registering four assists for the tournament and one goal in the semifinal match.
The United States went 2-2 in group play before topping the Czech Republic, 7-0, in the quarterfinals. The semifinal game pitted the Americans against perennial powerhouse Canada, but the U.S. came out on top with a decisive 5-1 win to advance to the finals.
The Crimson will have its top scorer back on the ice after a tough stretch of losses. Harvard went winless in December and dropped its first two matchups of 2013 to conference foes.
In his first year with the Crimson, Vesey has been a formidable part of Harvard’s offensive line. In his first outing with the Crimson, the freshman registered two goals and added an assist in Harvard’s victory against Bentley, earning ECAC Rookie of the Week honors. Vesey leads the Crimson with a team-high five goals in addition to three assists on the season. His eight point total thus far is the second highest on the team.
Harvard will next see action when it visits cross-town rival Boston University Jan. 9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christine Clark’s passing 1000-point milestone and impressive play won the junior guard on the women’s basketball team the first Athlete of the Week honors of the new year, but several other athletes rang in 2013 with their own stellar performances, earning them recognition by The Back Page.
 
Jonah Travis, Men’s Basketball
 
Two days after notching nine points to help his team pull off an upset against Cal, the sophomore forward doubled his scoring average on the season against St. Mary’s, netting 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting to tie his career high. Although Harvard would drop the game, 70-69, after holding the upper hand for all but the final second, Travis’s performance helped the Crimson extend its lead to as large as 18 in the first half. The Minnesota native also tallied 10 points and four rebounds in Harvard’s rout of Rice, 92-62.

Siyani Chambers, Men’s Basketball
 
The freshman ball-handler recorded 19 points in the heartbreaker against the Gaels, including a perfect 5-5 from behind the arc. Chambers outscored St. Mary’s point guard Matthew Dellavedova, a member of the 2012 Australian Olympic team, by 15 points as the Crimson defense effectively shut him down for much of the evening. The rookie guard also posted a double-double against the Owls, tallying 14 points and 10 dimes on the night.
Victoria Lippert, Women’s Basketball
 
A clutch trey from Lippert put Harvard ahead of Rhode Island, 52-49, near the end of a hotly contested game. Crucial free throws by the senior guard and teammate Clark sealed the win for the Crimson, 63-56. With her 11-point performance, the San Diego native surpassed Emily Tay in the record books to move into 10th place for career points with 1,274 points. The veteran also helped her team blow past UMass, 85-59, on the second day of the new year, netting 17 points and tying her career-high of five assists.
Jillian Dempsey, Women’s Hockey
 
The senior co-captain led her team to an unblemished start to 2013 with victories over Union and Rensselaer, both on unfriendly ice. The trip to New York began with Dempsey matching her career-high of five points against the Dutchwomen, scoring twice and tallying three assists as Harvard bested Union, 9-0, marking its biggest margin of victory of the season. The forward added another assist against the Engineers, allowing junior forward Kalley Armstrong to one-time the puck past the RPI goaltender in a 2-1 victory.
Kelley Romatoski, Women’s Hockey
 
With the game against the Engineers tied at one apiece in the third period, the RPI goalie blocked a shot attempt, but before she could corral the puck to survive the Engineers’ penalty kill, sophomore forward Samantha Reber sent it up the ice to Romatoski. The senior slapped it past the goaltender into the back left of the net, giving the Crimson a 2-1 lead that it would not relinquish. The game-winner was the Romatoski’s fifth goal of the season. The defender also netted a goal and an assist against Union the previous night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into this week, the Harvard women's basketball team needed a spark. The Crimson was looking to bounce back from its first three-game losing streak of the season as Ivy League play loomed on the horizon.
With a familiar shooting ace at the helm, Harvard (9-5) found its way back into the win column as it closed out its nonconference slate. Junior Christine Clark led all scorers in Crimson wins over UMass, 85-59, and Rhode Island, 63-56, as she became the 18th women's basketball player in Harvard history to reach 1,000 career points. On Monday, the junior guard received her fifth career Ivy League Player of the Week nod.
Clark arrived at the milestone in an anticlimactic yet fitting fashion Wednesday night at Lavietes Pavillion, sinking two free throws early in the second half to put the Crimson up 21 on UMass. The Tucson, Ariz. native has reached the charity stripe more often than any other Harvard player this season and ranks fifth in the Crimson record book for career free throws made.
"I don't think that she had any idea [as a recruit] that she was going to score a thousand points, but we're not one bit surprised because she can score in so many different ways," Crimson coach Delaney-Smith said." We can post her up, she's a great offensive rebounder, she can shoot the three, and she can go to the basket, so she's really multi-dimensional in her attack. She's an impact player. "
Clark is the fastest Crimson player to reach 1,000 points since Reka Cserny in 2004 and joins senior Victoria Lippert as the only active players on the squad to have passed the milestone. Lippert reached a new milestone of her own Wednesday, scoring 17 points to crack the top ten of Harvard's all-time career scoring list.
"I'm just so honored to be a part of that group," Clark said. "It just makes me feel good about all the hard work that I've put in over the years."
Delaney-Smith can vouch for Clark's hard work.
"There isn't a better competitor in the world…. She'll go through a wall to have you win," Delaney-Smith said of the player known as "Clarky" to teammates and coaches. "She puts in a lot of extra time to do film work and to keep getting better."
Clark started every game her freshman season after choosing Harvard over traditional top programs DuPaul, Kansas State and Arizona State. Delaney-Smith has seen Clark improve on the court throughout her years in Cambridge.
"She's getting better at shooting the three," Delaney-Smith said. "She has a nice midrange game. When she was younger, she would go all the way in. Now, she's developed a beautiful, midrange, very athletic pull-up."
At Rhode Island, Clark recorded a game-high 21 points and shot 8-of-14 from the field. She scored nine of Harvard's last 16 points to help the Crimson put the brakes on a comeback bid from the Rams late in the second half.
"I think it was a great win to pull out [Sunday]," said Clark, who leads all Harvard scorers this season with 16.6 points per game. "I don't think we really played our best game, but I think it does show a lot that we were able to pull out the win even with a lot of areas to improve in. We have so much potential, and I'm really excited for conference play."
The achievement of team-based milestones is now at the top of Clark's to-do list.
"I want to win an Ivy League championship more than anything," Clark said, "and I would want to win some games in the NCAA tournament."
Meanwhile, Delaney-Smith hopes that Clark can perfect her passing game and cut down on turnovers. Clark's role as one of the Crimson's primary ball handlers has tested her playmaking abilities.
With Clark's work ethic, though, encouraging her to put in the hours shouldn't be much of a problem.
"Any coach," Delaney-Smith said, "would love to coach a kid like Clarky."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After his team blew an 18-point lead to St. Mary’s less than a week ago, men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker probably wasn’t counting his chickens, even heading into halftime with a 43-21 lead over Rice at Lavietes on Saturday night.
But when the final buzzer sounded and the scoreboard showed a 92-62 advantage for the home team, the Virginia native notched something that had just slipped from his grasp on New Year’s eve: his 100th career win as a Harvard coach, a record reached only by three other Crimson leaders.
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard and sophomore guard Wesley Saunders both tallied 21 points on the night to help lift the Crimson to victory, while freshman point guard Siyani Chambers turned in a double-double performance to contribute as well.
The milestone isn’t the only one that the former Michigan coach has accomplished in Cambridge since his start in 2007, however. In just Amaker’s second season coaching in the Ivy League, the Crimson, led by then-junior guard Jeremy Lin’s 27-point performance, upset No. 17 Boston College, a team that had just recently upset No. 1 UNC. The win was the first in Harvard’s history over a ranked opponent.
A year later, Amaker led the squad to a school record 21 wins, a record which he surpassed in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons with 23 and 26 victories, respectively.
Last season, a key win by Princeton over Penn helped the Crimson earn the automatic Ivy League berth to March Madness, its first trip to the NCAA tournament since 1946, marking a near-complete turnaround during his tenure. From an 8-22 record in his first season to a 26-4 record in the 2011-12 season, the former Duke star turned a league bottom-feeder into an Ancient Eight champion.
Harvard travels to Hanover next week to begin Ivy play against Dartmouth as Amaker inches closer to all-time record of 178 wins, held by Frank Sullivan.

Harvard’s football season may be long over, but the awards keep coming for quarterback Colton Chapple. The senior was named the recipient of the 2012 CFPA Quarterback Award, an honor given annually to the nation’s top FCS quarterback.
Chapple has racked up the accolades this offseason after his record-breaking senior year. Earlier this month, Chapple was named the recipient of the 74th George “Bulger” Lowe Award, presented by the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston as New England’s “Heisman Trophy.” In December, the senior was presented with the Asa S. Bushnell Cup as the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Chapple also nabbed the Division I FCS Gold Helmet after being named the New England Player of the Year by the New England Football Writers’ Association.
Chapple finished the year with the country's second best passer rating. The senior registered a school-record 24 touchdown passes for the year. He completed 194 passes on 294 attempts, good for a career best .660 completion percentage.
In the Crimson’s loss to Princeton this season, Chapple set a school single-game record with 448 yards on 31-of-45 passing.  His five touchdowns against the Tigers tied a career best.
Chapple has firmly cemented himself in the Harvard record books alongside the best Crimson quarterbacks of all time.

Home team knocked out of the playoffs? Still reeling from Fitzpatrick’s fourth place AFC East finish? The Back Page has you covered on who to root for, given a Harvard allegiance.
Houston vs New England
Former Crimson football legend Clifton Dawson ’07, once the all-time Ivy League rushing leader, made his final stop of his NFL career in Houston. The Texans aren’t the only Houston franchise making headlines. Point guard Jeremy Lin ’10 has helped the Rockets to lead the NBA in points per game and currently sit in sixth place in the Western Conference. Texans linebacker Connor Barwin was happy to lend Lin a hand when he made the move down south. We hope our alum will return the favor and cheer on the Texans.
Our pick: Houston
Baltimore vs Denver
Two prominent members of the Ravens franchise have their roots with Harvard football coach Tim Murphy. Center Matt Birk ’98 played for the Crimson under Murphy and contributed to winning three out of four Harvard-Yale contests during his time. Birk has started 113 consecutive games, the longest current streak among centers in the NFL. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh served as special teams coordinator at the University of Cincinnati for six years, four of which occurred during Murphy’s tenure as head coach there.
Our pick: Baltimore
Green Bay vs San Francisco
The Wild Card round saw the Packers down Minnesota, thus eliminating the Vikings and Kevin Murphy ’12, a member of their practice squad, from title contention. Offensive lineman Murphy, who was originally signed by the 49ers as a free agent back in May, started all 20 games during his final two years with the Crimson at left tackle and has been the only member of his class to successfully go pro. Additionally, San Francisco is coached by Jim Harbaugh, the brother of John Harbaugh. The Harbaughs are the only pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history, and we’re all for family success.
Our pick: San Francisco 
Seattle vs Atlanta
Once upon a time, Paul Allen dropped out of Washington State University and convinced Bill Gates to do the same at Harvard. The two went on to found Microsoft and now Allen is chairman of the Seahawks. Furthermore, the last time Seattle won a conference championship, it was with Isaiah Kacyvenski ’00 on its roster. Kacyvenski, who played seven seasons with the Seahawks, was signed in the fourth round of the 2000 NFL draft, the highest pick in Harvard history.
Our pick: Seattle
