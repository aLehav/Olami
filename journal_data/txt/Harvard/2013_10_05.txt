The Science Center Plaza is home to many things: a giant chess set, massive bean-bag chairs, tantalizing food trucks, and most recently an upright piano. Bearing the inscription “Play me, I’m Yours,” the piano is the latest installment in the long-running Street Pianos art project started in 2008 by artist Luke Jerram. The project places pianos in cities around the globe, seeking to change the way citizens interact with their space and each other.
The project came to Boston with the help of Celebrity Series of Boston, a group that brings in world-class artists to perform in the area. Celebrating its 75th season, the group is presenting “Play Me, I’m Yours - the Street Pianos Boston Festival” from September 27 to October 14. There are 75 pianos located in various Boston and Greater Boston neighborhoods, including 13 in Cambridge and Somerville. 
 
The Science Center Plaza piano has already found a number of fans. From music concentrators who clearly know what they’re doing to small children banging on the keys, the instrument is open to anyone, regardless of talent. It’s a fun addition to the always-bustling plaza, and a great opportunity to practice your signature piece (Chopsticks, anybody?) without having to sign out a practice room. Be sure to sit down and play for a spell before the festival ends on October 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team battled Yale at New Haven this weekend in an attempt to put a nearly 10-year long losing streak against the Bulldogs to an end. The Crimson, winless against its Eli rivals since 2004, has not even picked up a set since 2010.
Both streaks, however, are still alive, as Yale (8-3, 2-0 Ivy) handedly defeated Harvard (6-5, 1-1) in three sets.
It was all Bulldogs during the match, as the Crimson managed to gain the advantage only once throughout the entire game, a 1-0 lead in the second set.
The home team led by sophomore middle blocker Jesse Ebner and junior outside hitter Mollie Rogers, who each had 11 kills. Additionally, Ebner and freshman libero Tori Shepherd contributed three aces apiece. The offensive game was aided by the play of senior setter Kendell Polan, who registered 27 assists.
Yale also had multiple strong defensive performances, as Polan led the team with 12 digs, while junior libero Maddie Rudnick added 11. Shepherd and Rogers also came close to the double-digit mark for digs, but fell short by one and two digs, respectively.
Harvard, on the other hand, had no players that recorded double-digit values for any of the aforementioned statistics. Three players had a team-high four kills, while freshman setter Corinne Bain aided the squad with a team-leading eight assists. Sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte, one of the Crimson’s most dynamic scorers, had a goose egg in the kills column.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER--The game hung in the balance for over three hours. Starting in the fourth quarter, the Harvard football team traded scores with Holy Cross. Each team scored crucial touchdowns in the closing minutes of play.
The trend continued in overtime. On each squad’s first two possessions, the Crusaders and Harvard both managed to push the ball into the end zone. But for Harvard, the third time was the charm.
After the defense forced a Holy Cross missed field goal, the Crimson finally had a chance to put the game away. And sophomore running back Paul Stanton would not be denied. On the Crimson’s third possession of overtime, the sophomore running back took the ball into the end zone from 17 yards out for the game-winning touchdown.
It took three overtimes to get there, but Harvard ended on top, winning 41-35 in Worcester, Mass.
“For much of the game they really outplayed us and outcoached us,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “Our defense was really heroic in keeping us in the game. At the end of the day, our kids showed tremendous resiliency and I’m so proud of the character of our football team.”
The Crimson demonstrated resilience all day long. While Holy Cross outgained Harvard 461 yards to 342, the Crimson made vital plays down the stretch when it needed them most.
With just over three minutes to go in the fourth quarter, it looked as if Harvard was down and out. Holy Cross had marched from its own nine-yard line down the field into Crimson territory. Then, on a second down, Crusaders quarterback Peter Pujals found wide receiver Nate Stanley streaking down the right sideline for a 20-yard touchdown completion. For the first time all game, Holy Cross had seized the lead, 21-14.
But Harvard quarterback junior Conner Hempel did not let that last long. On a crucial third down, Hempel dipped and dodged to evade several Crusaders defenders and pick up the first down. Three plays later, senior tight end Cam Brate found an opening in the back of the end zone. Just like that, the game was tied at 21. Harvard needed just under two and a half minutes to march 84 yards down the field.
“We had a play drawn up for [Brate],” Hempel said. “He beat one guy and was double-covered, but force it to Brate, that’s my motto. For a clutch play, you can throw it to Brate because he’s going to make it.”
In the first overtime, both teams punched the ball in for touchdowns. After Pujals converted a third-and-five pass for a score, Hempel responded with a short touchdown pass to senior tight end Tyler Ott.
The same thing happened in the second period of extra time. Stanton, who finished the game with 158 total yards and two touchdowns, pushed his way through the Crusaders line for the score. Pujals responded in turn with another touchdown pass.
Finally, in the third overtime, the Crimson defense made the crucial stop, and the Harvard offense would capitalize to seal the hard-fought victory.
The win was the team’s first at Holy Cross since 2005.
Nearly forgotten in the dramatic affair was that Hempel left the game midway through the first half with a hyperextended knee. The junior was replaced by senior Michael Pruneau, but Hempel returned to the game in the third quarter and seemed to be at full strength.
The Crusader defense didn’t seem to mind which of the two Crimson quarterbacks was in the game. Despite eventually coming out on top, the Harvard offense struggled to move the ball for much of the game. Holy Cross won the time of possession battle, controlling the ball for 35:21 in regulation, as the Crimson offense struggled to keep its defense off the field. At halftime, Harvard only accumulated 88 total yards. Through the end of the third quarter, Harvard had only thrown for a total of 80 yards.
While the Harvard offense couldn’t get anything going for much of the game, the defense more than picked up the slack, forcing four turnovers, all fumbles by Pujals.
On the first Holy Cross possession of the second half, junior defensive end Zach Hodges continued to make his presence felt up front. Hodges beat his blocker, got to Pujals, and hit him from behind, forcing a fumble that was picked up by sophomore linebacker Eric Medes in the end zone for the score.
The play, which put Harvard up 14-7, gave the Crimson defense a touchdown for the third straight week. Just a few plays later, senior linebacker Matt Martindale broke through the line untouched and forced yet another Pujals fumble.
Although the Crimson failed to take advantage of two fumbles, the team made Holy Cross pay after senior defensive end Nnamdi Obukwelu applied a big hit to force a fumble late in the first quarter. Four plays later, junior running back Andrew Casten capped a 33-yard touchdown drive by bullying his way up the middle through defenders into the end zone for the first score of the game.
Holy Cross responded in turn in the second quarter when Pujals found wide receiver Mike Fess running a fade route in the corner of the end zone to tie the game at seven. Pujals would finish with 345 yards through the air.
“When the play would break down, he just seemed to have it today,” captain Joshua Boyd said. “It’s unbelievable as a freshman to have that kind of poise. He made some great plays today.”
The Harvard special teams unit also made its presence felt early in the game. On the Crusaders’ opening drive, senior defensive back Norman Hayes came flying through the line to block a punt, which bounced back into Holy Cross territory.
But the Crimson didn’t take advantage. Three plays later, Hempel threw an interception after scrambling to his right.

Dunkin' Donuts on Bow Street, the scene where Matt Damon so famously said "How do you like them apples?", announced recently that it was closing. But after four days of distress from coffee lovers, they announced they would remain open. Or at least, we think they will be. In the case that they are staying open, The Crimson wanted to know, how do you like them apples?
With varsity recruiting season in full swing, high school athletes across the country are committing to play for their dream schools. But for athletes being recruited to the Ivy League the process is slightly different.
The league’s Academic Index (AI) provides a high academic barrier for athletes to meet. The metric, shrouded in privacy (the institutions are forbidden from releasing the scores), is a composite measure of students’ high school GPA, class rank, and SAT I and SAT II scores.
Each Ivy League applicant—recruited athlete or not—is given a number between 60 and 240, comprised of three different categories. The first two reflect SAT I and SAT II scores and the third is a combination of the student’s GPA and class rank. League rules dictate that any student-athlete must score at least a 176 on the AI to be offered admission, which corresponds roughly to an 1140 SAT I (on a 1600 scale) and a 3.0 GPA (on a 4.0 scale).
Students must meet different criteria, however, based on the school to which they apply. The average AI of each athletic team must remain within one standard deviation (estimated to be within 12-16 points) of the average AI score for that school’s student body.
According to The New York Times, the average AI for recruited athletes across all conferences is 150, but no Ivy League institution has an average AI below 200. Harvard’s is estimated to be around 220.
While prospective Ivy League recruits draw attention for what they do on the field, their admission is just as dependent on what they do in the classroom.
