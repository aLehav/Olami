After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season finale faces the unfair challenge of resolving one tale and planting the seed for another. It must satisfy yet frustrate the audience. It must provide closure, yet still provide enough intrigue to inspire further viewing. This 90-minute finale buckles under the lofty expectations to which the show has beholden itself over the course of this season: continually promising Negan as the force of change that will derail the narrative from its frequent, undeniable inertia. Overlong, disjointed, and overwhelming, “Last Day On Earth” undoes itself as it progresses, muting what could have been an even more electrifying Negan reveal.
This episode’s problematic half deals with Morgan’s pursuit of Carol and his attempt to save her soul in his typical role as the group’s zen master. It is a protraction of the prior dull clash between Morgan’s humanity and Carol’s callousness. The writers have made it a point to show that neither extreme is superior and that both ends are necessary for survival. Carol and Morgan seemingly swap beliefs, with Carol feeling guilt over the act of killing and Morgan nonchalantly violating his mantra of not killing to save her life. The moment is made most poignant from the genuine shock of witnessing Morgan’s tragic lapse into the dangers of moral flexibility, unraveling all of the work he has done this season to treasure all life.
The process by which Carol and Morgan’s arcs come to this resolution is inexcusably ludicrous, however, no matter how well-intentioned it is. Carol’s captor somehow caught up to her from last episode’s massacre, in which she gunned down all of his friends. How he was able to track Carol, avoid running into Morgan, and pin her down, all with a gun wound, is another mystery that the show’s writers could never reasonably explain—which is why they tend not to bother with those details. Carol’s still-implausible reasoning for her histrionic departure was to avoid killing in order to protect her loved ones. In her mind, already heavily burdened by her extended history of murder sprees, she loves these people so much that she must abandon them in order to stop killing for them? Yet her abandoning them means they might also be better off? Her reasoning does not make sense. The show does its best to contextualize Carol’s logic as a sacrificial, noble act for others when in reality it appears obtuse, selfish, and pouty.
The other half of the episode, in which Rick and the remaining main cast transport Maggie to Alexandria, is handled slightly better. What is baffling is how Maggie’s mysterious birth complication happened to synchronize itself with the apex of all of the group’s other problems, particularly the Saviors. In scene after redundant scene, the group hits the Savior’s roadblocks, descending further into desperate panic. An effort is made to emphasize the Saviors’ frightening omnipresence and militant power, which have a tangible effect on these survivors. The Saviors toy with the survivors, picking them apart psychologically like a toddler playing with its food. They shoot at their feet and lead them into shows of power, at one point hanging a Hilltop member in front of their faces. Rick’s hubris gradually turns into abject horror upon his realization of his powerlessness and inability to control his fate: Crazy Rick, driven even crazier. The same effect, however, could have been accomplished with 10 fewer minutes dedicated to watching Rick and company run amok in general panic.
There are a few rushed moments of character growth, with Eugene affirming his “survivor” status by ostensibly sacrificing himself for the rest of the group in his suicidal plan of action. There is a touching moment between him and Abraham, wherein they genuinely reconcile their differences over past transgressions. Here, in another offbeat moment of musical melodrama, Bear McCreary composes a Giacchino-like piece, echoing something out of the saccharine depths of “Lost” to entrench these characters in sentimentality. After all, it just might be their last day on earth.
Finally, the moment viewers all over the world have been waiting for is tortuously delayed to the episode’s very last 10 minutes: Negan’s entrance. Virtually the entire show’s main cast is made to kneel in front of the group’s commandeered RV. McCreary applies playfully heinous tunes from the organ. Out comes Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s (The Comedian from “Watchmen”) Negan, with a chain-linked bat named Lucille brashly set upon his shoulder, waltzing about with the bravado of Captain Barbossa. Morgan’s performance is theatrical and indulgent as he shouts phrases such as “It’s pee-pee pants city around here” to demystify and clarify Negan’s type of psychopath; that is, he does not come off as conventionally psychopathic at all. He is boyishly charming rather than aloof and somewhat reasonable rather than irrational.
To make the inevitable comparison between Negan and Billy Bob Thornton’s recent, conventionally frightening, and compelling villain from “Fargo”, Negan is more transparent and down-to-earth. He speaks as he feels. Thornton’s antithetical villain was unnervingly quiet and twisted, making him a more unpredictable force of an insidious nature. Negan, not necessarily less compelling or interesting, is a pragmatic businessman first and foremost and seems to make more sense than any other character this season. He might extort and abuse, but only as driven by his strict adherence to the tenets of his “New World Order.” Follow his rules, and he will be fair. Violate them, and he will be unforgiving.
It is a joy to see Negan virtually twist the knife in Rick’s wounds, threatening Rick’s pride and family by taunting his bat in their faces with impunity. He even eeny-meeny-miny-moes the survivors to leave it up to chance who will die. Might his monologue have been overlong, overwritten, and overly divulgent? Maybe. Was it still a harrowing and viscerally uncomfortable experience to see our characters beaten down to a psychological pulp? Yes. In spite of the lofty expectations and hype surrounding the character, Negan’s introduction as post-apocalyptic judge, jury, and executioner—reiterating the theme that Rick and company were the real sinners here—is an unqualified success.
It is a shame, then, that the show cops out in its last moment. Negan’s presumed murder of one of our main survivors is depicted through a shameless POV shot, leaving the victim’s identity up in the air and the viewers with a screen full of tacky computer-generated blood. If the writers wish to remain consistent with the comic book lore, Glenn dies from Negan’s beating. If not, however, this would not be their first deviation from the canon.
Why not model the final shot after Jon Snow’s “death” scene in the most recent “Game of Thrones” finale: a close up of his bleeding body in the snow that still leaves wishful viewers believing he might still live? Not showing the victim is a cowardly directorial decision that blatantly serves to frustrate and suspend viewers into sticking around for next season, revealing a lack of faith in the story’s own staying power. This was not a “bad” finale, but it was not very good either due to the glut of plodding scenes that severely hampered its better moments. Still, Negan alone is enough to justify continued viewing—although loyal Walking Deadites are already locked in at this point anyway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Philosophical nonfiction author Sarah Bakewell has written the upcoming "At the Existentialist Café" in the spirit of delving further into existentialist thinking. The book follows the existentialist movement and its leading thinkers in a blend of biography and philosophy, exploring how existentialism can affect how we approach life today. Prior to her reading event at the Harvard Bookstore, Bakewell spoke with The Crimson about her newest work and her own story.
The Harvard Crimson: What was the inspiration behind ‘At the Existentialist Café’?
Sarah Bakewell: Well, it’s something I’ve been interested in [all my adult life]. I came across existentialism when I was about 16, and it just fascinated me—this weird thing that was a kind of philosophy but also about people’s lives and sort of a strange feeling of alienation from the world. I mean, all of this when you’re 16 has an immediate impact because you recognize something of yourself in it. I became interested in what the philosophy was underlying all of this and wanted to learn a bit more about it. There was one summer when I was doing a job actually selling ice creams on the beach…. In between selling ice creams I was reading, [and] I just found by random the autobiography of Simone de Beauvoir, which I really enjoyed…. She writes about her friends; her ideas; all the things that they discussed between the history, the war, and all the things that were unfolding at the time. It completely absorbed me, and I realized that she too was involved in this existentialist movement. By then, in fact, I’d started studying philosophy, so one thing led to another. I started a PhD in the thought of Heidegger, but… I kind of lost interest in his way of thinking for a while, so I dropped out and did lots of other things. About 30 years came by, I came back to it in recent times as being something that I could approach from a different angle and [something] that actually meant something different to me now.
THC: Your website mentions that ‘At the Existentialist Café’ has been ‘six years long in the making’. Over the past six years, have your views on existentialism expanded or changed, and has this impacted the dynamic of your new book?
SB: It did change while I was working on it, because I didn’t really know what to expect….  Increasingly, I just found I was more and more interested in the lives of all these thinkers and how they interacted with each other. There were so many quarrels that they had, so many times that they would disagree about some key idea and the politics of philosophy or literature, and really, all those disagreements and those fallings out and friendships that ended and passionate encounters became the focus of the story for me—but always in conjunction with the philosophy, because it was the philosophical disagreements that made them so argumentative.
THC: Do any particular existentialists serve as inspiration for you?
SB: I’m still very inspired by Simone de Beauvoir—just the fact that she was such a pioneer…. I also still really admire her autobiography, and I find that I enjoy going back to that more and more. She remains a great inspiration for me— the way that she tried to tangle with the ideas of her time and the history that was unfolding. Also, I really admire Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who comes into my book a lot. He’s not really an existentialist; he was a phenomenologist. He tried to write about the way that we’re not just disembodied creatures. We’re conditioned by having perceived things, and even when we think in the abstract, it’s not really abstract because we think in terms of the physical world. He wrote about human experience in a way that really just tries to understand the most basic things. He also writes a lot about childhood—how we become the person that we are and how we develop through life. He’s fascinating.
THC: How has existentialist thinking had an impact on your own life?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard police are investigating allegations that an audio recording device illegally documented sensitive conversations Harvard Law School activists held in a hall they are occupying.
Several students with the activist group Reclaim Harvard Law School said they found a recording device on Tuesday that was taped under a table in the Caspersen Student Center Lounge and contained recordings of their conversations and events since last Saturday. According to a press release Reclaim Harvard Law published Friday, the recorder captured discussion that included personal conversations between students, a sexual assault bystander training at which victims recounted their assaults, and Boston-area residents sharing stories of eviction from their homes.
“It was just really scary,” second-year Law student and Reclaim Harvard Law member Simratpal Kaur said. “We were really surprised that anyone who maybe disagreed with our movement would go to this length.” 
Students in Reclaim Harvard Law have been occupying the Caspersen Student Center Lounge—which they term “Belinda Hall”—since February in order to create the space they say has been denied to minority students at the school.
The students said they waited several days to report their discovery to the school so they could seek legal counsel and ensure that the people recorded on the device would be protected. They came forward with their finding in the press release Friday, and once notified, Law School spokesperson Robb London said administrators referred the matter to the Harvard University Police Department.
“Our mission as an institution of higher learning depends on protecting and promoting the free exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect. We deeply prize those values,” London said. “The Law School administration is troubled by an allegation that anyone in our community would attempt to surreptitiously record anyone else's conversation.”
Massachusetts state law states that all parties must consent to being recorded, and prohibits secretly recording communications. Violators of the law can face up to $10,000 in fines and five years in prison.
HUPD sent one officer to investigate Friday afternoon, but students declined to provide HUPD with evidence, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in a statement.
While the school placed surveillance cameras in the adjacent Wasserstein Hall after a racially-charged incident of vandalism in November, it did not install cameras in the student lounge.
The incident comes as activists are embroiled in an intense debate about free speech at the Law School. Kaur said the discovery of the recording device has had a “chilling effect” on Reclaim Harvard Law activists’ occupation, since students feel uncomfortable speaking freely in the lounge.
“Students are shocked that this would happen, especially since Reclaim has been in this space for months and is super open,” Kaur said. “This almost seems like an intimidation tactic or a threat to say ‘this space was never really yours.’”
Kaur said activists are worried that the incident will create an environment of mistrust in the space. “We’re really going to push back against that, because that’s not the spirit of our movement,” she said.
Catalano said the HUPD investigation is continuing and officers are waiting for students to come forward with evidence and information.
