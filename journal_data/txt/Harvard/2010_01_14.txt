After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citizens of Cambridge and several neighboring towns will vote in a special election this spring to fill imprisoned ex-senator Anthony D. Galluccio’s vacant seat in the Massachusetts state legislature, Senate President Therese Murray announced Wednesday.
Galluccio was sentenced to a year in jail after violating his probation for a hit-and-run accident by failing a series of breathalyzer tests. After Galluccio resigned his seat last Tuesday, Senate rules gave Murray 14 days to determine whether to hold a special election.
A primary election will be held on April 13, and a general election on May 11.
“We have an important budget coming up this year as we continue to deal with this recession," Murray said, in an explanation for her decision. "The Senate and the constituents from that district deserve to be fully represented before we begin Senate budget deliberations."
Several contenders have announced their intention to run for the seat, and others are considering a campaign.
Timothy R. Flaherty—who competed against Galluccio for the Senate seat in 2007—has announced that he will run again.
“I’m prepared to run a very vigorous and spirited campaign,” he told The Crimson last week.
Daniel C. Hill, a lawyer from Charlestown, has also declared his intention to run. On Tuesday, Chelsea real estate broker Michael Albano told the Boston Herald that he planned to formally announce his candidacy on Thursday, and the Boston Globe has named Sal DiDomenico, Galluccio’s chief of staff, as a potential candidate.
Marjorie C. Decker, who is currently serving her sixth term as a Cambridge City Councillor, told The Crimson, “I am strongly considering this and there’s a strong chance I’m going to run."
“She would be a major long shot,” Robert Winters, who maintains the political commentary website the Cambridge Civic Journal, said last week about Decker’s possible candidacy. “I don’t think she’s well known outside this district at all."
Winters said he thought that the decision to fill the seat by special election rather than leaving it vacant until the fall would benefit Flaherty, who has run for the seat before and garnered name recognition throughout the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex district—which includes parts of Cambridge, Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, Saugus, and Somerville. The Boston Globe endorsed Flaherty in 2007.
“A lot of people who like Anthony Galluccio didn’t mind Tim Flaherty," Winters said. "A lot of that support might carry over."
Galluccio—a Cambridge City Councillor for 14 years who once served as the city’s youngest mayor since 1940—is now serving time in the Middlesex House of Correction. He was elected to the Senate seat in a 2007 special election after Jarrett T. Barrios resigned to run a healthcare company.
Paul R. Nowicki, who came in second in the 2007 race, told The Crimson last week that he would not seek the seat again.

Harvard natives and visitors will be able to explore the historic expanse of Harvard Yard and Harvard Square with greater ease as a result of a partnership with a mobile social networking application called foursquare, the University announced on Tuesday. 
Foursquare—the first location-based social networking tool to be implemented at Harvard—provides information about venues in cities around the world. Currently, 23 venues are featured on Harvard’s foursquare site, including the John Harvard statue and Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage, but more locations may be included in the future since foursquare's content is user-generated. 
“The true goal is to create a powerful social networking utility," said Tristan J. Walker, foursquare’s vice president of business development. "The inspiration for foursquare came from what Amazon has done with book and other product recommendations for their users—we want to do this with locations." 
Foursquare’s mobile application—which is available for download for several smartphones, including the iPhone—incorporates an interactive video game aspect. Application users earn points by visiting different locations featured on foursquare. When a user arrives at a venue, the application’s GPS recognizes the location and prompts users to “check-in”, earning points for the user.
Users who accumulate the requisite number of points can earn various badges, which now include a “Harvard Yard” badge. In addition, the user who frequents a particular venue the most becomes the “mayor” of that location—for example, a user could become the “mayor” of Widener Library or the Science Center.
The mobile application also includes push notifications, which pings tips to users about locations in their immediate area, and a friend finder, which includes logs of the user’s friends that have checked into a certain location in the past three hours.
“Foursquare is one of many ways to drive discovering connections among students, faculty and visitors. It is one of many routes to help individuals experience and discover Harvard’s rich history,” said Perry Hewitt, the director of digital communications and communications services for Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. 
Harvard’s participation with foursquare  marks the latest move in the University’s push to make itself more accessible to students, faculty, and the general public, according to Hewitt. Other efforts have included the creation of Harvard’s own official Facebook page and Twitter, whose content is edited and updated by HPAC employees.
“We’ve been putting a large effort into how Harvard presents itself online,” Hewitt said.
Hewitt said that Harvard Public Affairs and Communications plans to spread the word to University affiliates in the hope that foursquare will become widely used on campus, adding that information about foursquare will be given to visitors at the Events and Information Center, located in Holyoke Center.

CORRECTION: January 15, 2010
An earlier version of the Jan. 14 news article "Harvard Partners With Mobile Social Networking App" stated that information about foursquare will be available to visitors at the Agassiz Information Center. In fact, the Events and Information Center will be providing information.

History Professor Nancy F.  Cott testified on Tuesday in a federal case against California's Proposition  8—which currently restricts same-sex marriage within state borders—to  provide an overview of the various marriage restrictions in American  history.
In Perry v. Schwarzenegger,  the various plaintiffs sued their respective county clerks and several  state officials, including Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, after they  had been denied marriage licenses in different California counties after  Proposition 8 passed in November 2008.
The plaintiffs’ lawyers  called upon Cott, an expert in the history of marriage and a scholar  of 20th century gender relations, to the stand on Tuesday. In her testimony,  she drew connections between the current restrictions on same-sex marriage  and former marriage restrictions, such as the laws that once forbade  white women from marrying Chinese men and the infamous miscegenation  laws repealed in 1967 that prohibited white women from marrying black  men.
But several points made by  Cott—for example, that families are just as important to children  as marriages—proved unconvincing for several members of the opposing  counsel.
Cott responded in an e-mailed  statement to The Crimson on Thursday that her point had not been about  importance in any absolute sense but rather importance from the perspective  of the state with the authority to create marriage rules.
The state, Cott said, is concerned with responsible adults supporting the dependants  in their households, and whether the adults are the biological parents  of those dependants is less of an issue—which the history of domestic relations law makes clear.
Also, The New York Times quoted  a lawyer for the defense who believed Cott’s testimony to have backfired  on the plaintiffs because, in his view, Cott did not explain why certain  restrictions—such as polygamy—are legally permissible while others  are not.
Cott responded that she  had indeed explained monogamy as the  “American way of marrying,” which has always been viewed in direct  opposition to polygamy, as evidenced by the federal government’s 19th century campaign against the Church of the Latter-Day Saints.
Theodore J.  Boutrous, Jr. of Gibson, Dunn &  Crutcher—one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs who put  Cott on the witness stand—wrote in an e-mailed statement that  Cott was a strong addition to his case.
“She was a tour de force," he wrote. "[H]er testimony was powerful, compelling and the cross examination  didn't lay a glove on her.” The defense could not be  reached for comment on Wednesday.
For many equal rights advocates,  her testimony can be used to support a historical argument—namely,  that previous marriage restrictions are now unconstitutional and that  same-sex restrictions should follow suit—that is essential in establishing  the legality of same-sex marriage.
“I think it’s imperative  that we make as convincing a legal argument as possible in the case  to overturn Proposition 8,” wrote Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, director  of the Human Rights and Social Movements Program at the Harvard Kennedy  School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and a founding member  of Barack Obama’s National LGBT Leadership Council, in an e-mailed  statement. “Placing the LGBT marriage fight within the context of  other historical struggles to overturn similarly discriminatory marriage  statutes is a critical part of that argument.”
But for others the historical  argument is not enough to overturn Proposition 8.
“I'm unsure if this is the  most important [argument] to make,” wrote Christian L. Garland ’10-’11, co-chair  of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, in an e-mailed statement.  “Personally, I think it has to be used in tandem with any number of  other legal arguments. Refuting Scalia’s and other justices’ argument  of 'special rights' is going to be more important.”
Cott herself, who will teach  a history course this spring entitled  “Men and Women in Public and Private: The U.S. in the 20th Century,” is unconvinced that the historical argument should be enough  to solve the legal issue at hand.
“I've never said or implied  that historical parallels or analogies should be dispositive in a legal  case,” she said. “What we know of history is simply the best guide  we have for the future.”
Even if Cott’s testimony  fails to convince a judge that same-sex marriage restriction is a civil  rights issue akin to the miscegenation laws of the early 20th century,  supporters of marriage equality such as Marco Chan ’11 have sworn  to continue their fight.
“As a member of the queer  community and an activist on the ground,” Chan wrote in an e-mailed  statement, “I can say for certain that whatever the outcome, queer  and their allies will continue to work tirelessly to achieve marriage  equality.”

The University's top finance official has described the Internal Revenue Service's decision to include Harvard in its audit of 40 institutions of higher education as a natural consequence of Harvard's large and diverse operations.
  
“Given the size and complexity of our institution, it is not a surprise that we were one of the several institutions selected for the follow-up examination,” University Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson.
 
The University has clashed with federal regulators in the past—especially Senator Charles E. Grassley, who has investigated Harvard’s ties to pharmaceutical companies and applauded the IRS’s decision in 2008 to examine U.S. colleges' and universities’ use of their tax-exempt status.
 
But Jill Gerber, Grassley’s press secretary, said Wednesday that the Senator's office had not pushed the IRS to audit Harvard and that the IRS tends to maintain a degree of independence in these types of decisions.
 
The coming audit will focus on the University’s unrelated business income (revenue streams that are not tax-exempt) and compensation practices—an issue which has drawn scrutiny from some alumni in the past. 
 
Much of the criticism of excessive compensation in recent years has been directed at money managers at Harvard Management Company, the organization that invests Harvard’s endowment.
In 2005, Jack R. Meyer, then-CEO of HMC who presided over a long period of endowment growth, left the organization with 30 employees to start a hedge fund after some alumni protests resulted in a flurry of negative media attention and salary decreases for top-performing HMC portfolio managers.
 
It was unclear Wednesday which University officers' compensation would be examined in the audit and whether the audit would also include HMC. The IRS did not return requests for comment. 
University spokesman John D. Longbrake said that notice of the upcoming audit was delivered to the University and added that the University and HMC are considered separate legal entities in several respects. For instance, HMC and the University file separate non-profit tax returns.
 
  
Though concerns have persisted over compensation at HMC—where managers can net millions of dollars—top officers at the University itself earn modest salaries in comparison with administrators at peer institutions like Columbia and Yale, and have avoided similar criticism.
 
During the fiscal year ending in 2008, University President Drew G. Faust took home $693,739—a salary that makes Faust the 56th highest paid university president in the country. 
 
“Of all the lists we top, I’m glad Harvard is not number one on this list,” former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 quipped to The Crimson when that news broke last fall.

Researchers at Harvard and the University of California, San Diego have discovered that mutations in the HIV virus work together to induce drug resistance—a finding that may offer new leads in HIV drug research and therapy.
Resistance arises when mutations in the HIV genome lead to changes in the viral protein structure, thus creating unfavorable conditions for drug binding. As a result of the ease with which the virus mutates, HIV patients eventually develop resistance to all antiviral drugs.
“If we can find the structural mechanism for the HIV virus’s drug resistance, we can see how those mutations will react with the drug molecules and better design drug therapy,” said Jing Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and the lead author of the paper.
Researchers have already identified 99 sites on viral proteins that are associated with resistance to HIV drugs, but inadequate data and the lack of advanced calculation techniques have hindered further research.
 
The Harvard researchers applied an innovative Bayesian modeling method to gene sequences from both untreated HIV patients and those treated with drugs. Having ran a comprehensive computer search for over a month, the researchers looked for patterns of mutation that were more prevalent among the treated patients—the more common the mutation, the greater the probability of it being responsible for the drug resistance, according to Jun Liu, a professor of statistics at the Harvard School of Public Health and one of the authors of the paper.
The statistical, rather than empirical, approach yielded some remarkable results, Liu said, citing as an example the combination of mutations found at sites 46, 54, and 82 in the HIV genome.
Liu said that analysis found that mutations at solely sites 46 or 82 lead to weak resistance to Indinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, but mutations at site 54 alone have no effect. More surprisingly, mutations at sites 54 and 45 actually made the virus even more susceptible to the drug.
After the Harvard researchers found possible combinations of mutation site interactions, scientists at UC San Diego digitally simulated the effects of each mutation on the protein-drug binding energies.
"The patterns of collaboration between mutations are very complex," Zhang said. “The fact that our statistical methods were actually testable and could be verified biophysically with computer modeling was one of the main reasons for our successful work.”
This knowledge could one day help doctors better design drug therapies by allowing them to sequence patients’ viruses and predict which drugs the HIV strain would be the most likely to become resistant to in advance, according to Zhang. Such an application could make treatments much more cost-effective, she added.
“It’s very encouraging that we can identify patterns of resistance so that we can understand something about why these patterns exist,” said Daniel R. Kuritzkes, a professor of medicine at HMS who has conducted extensive research on mechanisms and clinical significance of HIV drug resistance.
Describing the approach of the study as “putting a story together,” Kuritzkes said it may be possible to eventually design drugs with molecular structures that accommodate those mutations.
For the study, which was published on Monday, HIV sequences from both treated and untreated patients were obtained from the HIV Drug Resistance Database, an open access database of reverse transcriptase and protease sequences maintained by Stanford University.

Over 30,000 students—a record-breaking number—have applied for admission to the Harvard Class of 2014.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 attributed the increase—which represents about 5 percent more applicants than last year’s 29,114—to three factors: Harvard’s commitment to generous financial aid in an unpredictable economic climate, the continued effects of the elimination of early admission, and Harvard’s heightened reputation for excellence in engineering.
“A major factor was our financial aid program,” Fitzsimmons said in an interview with The Crimson today. “Certainly that’s made a big difference to us since the inception of the program. There’s been a major change in the amount of interest in Harvard around the country and around the world.”
Despite the impact of this year's budgetary cutbacks on admissions officers’ recruiting practices—the admissions staff was reduced by 10 percent and its travel budget decreased by 50 percent—admissions officers have been able to devote more time to recruiting students since the elimination of early admission two years ago, according to Fitzsimmons.
“One concern, obviously, when you’re making so many changes—especially so much less travel—is that we could have experienced significant decline,” he said. “The good news is...that the changes we made did not lead to a decline but rather to an increase.”
Fitzsimmons also noted that the number of applications from students interested in engineering, physical sciences, and computer science increased by a greater margin than did applications as a whole. He noted that there has been "quite a bit of interest" in the School  of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which was established in 2007.
“That’s one of the battles we’ve been fighting for a very long time, making the case to the world about the excellence of our engineering and applied sciences," Fitzsimmons said. "The fact that we now have a separate school and that there’s been a great deal of publicity over the past three years since it was established, are making certain that people know about our excellence in this area.”
Fitzsimmons predicted that the number of students to be admitted this year will be similar to that of last year—Harvard accepted 2175 students to the Class of 2013, an admission rate of 7 percent. The admissions office will be "very conservative" about its selection process, Fitzsimmons said, adding that he predicts Harvard will again offer admission to many students on the waiting list.
Admissions officers told the Harvard Gazette that applications were roughly evenly distributed between males and females, and the percentage of minority applicants is also similar to last year. Geographically, there was a larger than average increase in the number of applications from the western United States and abroad.
Notification letters and e-mails will be sent to applicants on April 1.

Senior soccer standout Andre Akpan has yet another accolade to add to his already impressive list.  In the past month, the forward from Grand Prairie, Texas was selected to Soccer America’s 2009 MVPs team and College Soccer News’ Team of the Decade, named New England Soccer News’ Player of the Year, and offered a contract with Major League Soccer.
Last Friday, the Missouri Athletic Club added another achievement to Akpan’s list, crowning him first runner-up for the prestigious Hermann Trophy.
The Hermann Trophy is awarded by a collection of NCAA Division I soccer coaches to the top male and female soccer player in that division.  This year, Akpan came in a close second to the University of Akron’s Teal Bunbury, while Stanford’s Kelley O’Hara captured the female title.
Akpan was a three-year semifinalist for the Hermann Trophy, and was the first Harvard player to ever receive a finalist spot.
In addition to captaining the 2009 Crimson to the third round of the NCAA tournament, Akpan holds the school record for points scored at 127 and assists at 33.  He remains tied with Chris Ohiri, the namesake of Harvard’s field, as the all-time leading goal scorer with 47 goals.
Akpan will look to continue his illustrious career on the professional stage, as he and other hopefuls await the results of the MLS Superdraft in Philadelphia today.

The Harvard men’s swim team made a splash in its first appearance of 2010, claiming an easy 183-117 victory over the Quakers of Penn on Saturday. The win boosts the Crimson’s record to 4-1 for the season, while remaining undefeated at 4-0 in the Ivy League.
“It got the new year off to a good start,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “There were a number of good races, and I was pleased with the guys’ energy and focus.”
Harvard began the meet with a bang, capturing a 1-2-3 finish in the 1000-yard freestyle event. Co-captain Alex Meyer led his team with a time of 9:30.61 for a strong first-place finish in the race. Junior Blake Lewkowitz and senior Mason Brunnick followed in second and third with times of 9:31.50 and 9:35.51, respectively.
The Crimson’s sophomore sprinters claimed a second 1-2-3 finish in the 200-yard butterfly. Nicholas Tan captured the race for Harvard, touching the wall in 1:51.65, while classmates Niall Janney and Ross Ford placed second and third in the event.
Tan also posted a first-place finish in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 50.16.
Meyer racked up his second first-place finish in the 500-yard freestyle, with a time of 4:36.09. The Ithaca, N.Y.-native was followed in this race once again by Brunnick, who finished in 4:37.70.
Sophomore Rob Newell was Harvard’s third swimmer to claim multiple first-place finishes during the contest. Newell won both the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke events, touching the wall in 51.91 and 1:51.38, respectively.
Further distancing itself from Penn, the Crimson captured 1-2 finishes in the 400-yard IM and 200-yard freestyle races.
Freshmen Greg Roop and Brendan McIntee led the way in the 200-yard freestyle event. Roop touched the wall in 1:42.08, while McIntee who posted a 1:43.48 time.
Janney and freshman Owen Wurzbacher followed, capturing the 400-yard IM with times of 4:02.86 and 4:07.27, respectively.
The Harvard swimmers finished the day with a victory in the 400-yard freestyle relay to seal the fate of the Quakers. The relay team of Tan, juniors Will Heyburn and Eric Taylor, and sophomore Nicholas DuCille recorded a 3:06.83 mark for the win.
“It was a really strong performance,” senior co-captain Tommy Gray said. “Our team came out firing.”
“Everyone was really ready to go, and I was pleased with everybody’s fitness level,” Gray added.
The Crimson will look to build on this victory as it embarks upon a weeklong intensive training trip in preparation of its final two home meets of the season. Harvard will be back in action on Jan. 22nd as it welcomes Ivy League rival Brown to Blodgett Pool before facing off against cross-town opponent Boston University on Jan. 23rd.

Let’s be realistic: even the weakest member of the Harvard Taekwondo Club could beat you up. After all, the club has been training students to spar, kick, and break boards for ten years now. It has even given some members an opportunity to fight (sort of) in a zero-gravity environment.
To see what the club has planned for its 10th anniversary, we called President Henry S. Xie '11, who spoke to us over Skype from his home in Sweden.
One event to expect is a visit from the club’s Grandmaster Keun Ha Kim, who will be traveling all the way from Canada to Cambridge in order to test Harvard's black belts. The Grandmaster, who last visited three or four years ago, only makes an appearance for special occasions, said Xie. (Cool fact: taekwondo Olympic silver medalist Mark Lopez, another special guest, helped jumpstart the celebrations last semester by coming to Harvard to run a training seminar.)
According to former club president Khoa Tran '10, the club will be reaching out to alumni through letters and events this spring. Tran said members will also be hosting the "Harvard Open" tournament in April and a “big shindig” with the Brown Taekwondo Club soon after. Since its inception, the Harvard club has had close ties with the Brown club, and the two groups continue to share instructors and partake in an annual retreat together.
The Harvard club, which boasts about 50 members and scores of connected (and fit) alums, hosts five practices a week and several tournaments each semester. The club is “really like a family more than just a club or just a team,” Xie said.
Last year, the club won in its division at the Eastern Collegiate Taekwondo Conference, with two of its female athletes taking gold at nationals. But the club is equally proud of its fun traditions—like Halloween parties, outrageous Secret Santa exchanges, and annual ski trips to Vermont.
“We’re making an effort every year to make new members feel welcome and make everyone bond with each other,” Xie said.
This friendly vibe can be a huge relief to newcomers, who may sometimes feel intimidated by one component of the sport: "sparring" (in which students face off against one another).
“It was really scary at first," Xie said. "It’s a full contact sport. People kick you, and yes you wear protection but it can still hurt. I remember the feeling was so intense, it was almost unreal.  But sparring is so dynamic—it’s a lot of fun.”
According to the Harvard Taekwondo website, the club was initiated in September 1999 as the "Harvard World Taekwondo Federation" by a group of students now known as "The Fellowship of the Kick." Under  the guidance of Master Peter Lee,  the team has gone on to dominate  tournaments at NYU, Cornell, Princeton and beyond, in addition  to doing taekwondo demonstrations at community events and holding kick-a-thon  fundraisers each year. The club was renamed “Harvard Taekwondo” in August 2003—and they've been bonding, growing, and kicking ever since.

Want to know what has your roommate glued to the DVD player on his laptop? The New York Times compiled a list of the most rented Netflix movies per neighborhood and created this nifty color-coded map. So if your roomie's taste matches that of most 02138 residents, he's probably watching one of the following.
1. Milk
2. Rachel Getting Married
3. Slumdog Millionaire
4. Doubt
5. Burn After Reading
6. Vicky Christina Barcelona
7. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
8. Revolutionary Road
9. The Wrestler
10. "Mad Men" Season 1, Disc 1
Besides basic rental information, the tool is bound to give you somewhat of an ego boost as well. The Times also organizes the films by scores from MetaCritic.com, and the top rentals in Cambridge were all well-rated by reviewers. Burn After Reading had the lowest score at a well-placed 63. The Wrestler, Rachel Getting Married, Slumdog Millionaire, and Milk all garnered scores well into the 80s.
Of course, the tool has its limits. Because it only shows Netflix rentals, we don't know what movies your roommate would pay a hefty $11 to see at Boston Common (or what he might watch illegally online), just those he would have delivered to his mailbox via Netflix.
Still, the map raises some interesting (if not really important) questions. Why, for instance, was there a complete absence of sci-fi flicks in the top 10 for 02139 (where our MIT neighbors live)? Are you surprised that, in the Boston area, "Mad Men" was rented more in Harvard Square than anywhere else? Or that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was the most rented film in all of America? Just some J-Term food for thought.
