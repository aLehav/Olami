After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an election season where issues of prejudice have come to the forefront of our national discourse, “The Submission,” tackling both racism and homophobia, seems almost doubly relevant. The play, which won playwright Jeff Talbott a Laurents/Hatcher Award before it premiered Off-Broadway in 2011, is coming to Adams Pool Theater from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 and looks to unsettle audiences with a searing examination of prejudice between marginalized groups.
The play centers on the relationship between the African-American and BGLTQ communities. When a major theater festival accepts his play about a struggling black family, Danny (Casey R. Goggin ’19), a white playwright, is understandably concerned about the obvious racial disconnect. His solution: hire Emilie (Meghan Onserio ’19), a black actress, to pretend to be the writer in his place. Tensions rise and prejudices are uncovered as Danny attempts to put on a successful play.
For director Carla Troconis ’19, “The Submission” is an intriguing twist on an already provocative narrative. “Often when we talk about racism or homophobia, we talk about it between the majority and the minority,” she says. “This show explores what happens between two members of different marginalized groups and how they can be oppressive toward each other.”
As a member of the Latinx community, Troconis says that she has seen the need for support between minority groups. “I was really aware of some attitudes in communities of color and queer communities that seemed harmful to me,” she says. “Support is not given to members of marginalized groups. We have a lot more to do in terms of intersectionality and support between minorities.”
Actor Ryan T. Kapur ’20, who plays Danny’s boyfriend, Pete, agrees with the need for support. For him, it’s especially personal: “My hometown, Charlotte, North Carolina, has been having a lot of riots and protests over the past couple nights over a police shooting of a black man,” he says. “So I know that a lot of the racial issues that are brought up in this show are very poignant. I see it in my hometown right now.”
For Goggin, the play offered a unique learning experience. “[Danny] is very racist and problematic, which is obviously challenging. I was very intimidated by it,” he says. “It forced me to access this internalized racism that is kind of pervasive throughout society. It’s been really helpful to me not just as an actor but as a person, learning to maintain a lot more empathy and support for communities that might not have the privilege that I do.”
Although the show has some strong language and deals with sensitive issues, Troconis is confident that the conversation that “The Submission” will start is worth it. “If you have a piece of theater that shocks you and you speak about that, it creates dialogue,” she says. “And that’s when change starts to happen.”

Boston quartet The Pixies have been hailed as influencers across the musical spectrum since their mid-’80s release “Come On Pilgrim.” They are inspirations for the likes of Radiohead’s Thom Yorke, U2’s Bono, and Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain. In a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, Cobain spoke of the Pixies’ influence on “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” the lead single from 1991’s “Nevermind.” “I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies,” he said.
After taking a 10-year break, The Pixies reunited in 2003. Their post-hiatus debut, “Indy Cindy,”  was amalgamated from a series of previously released EPs and received mixed reviews when it was released in 2014.
Their newest offering, “Head Carrier,” is significantly more cohesive. Aside from a strange screamo-esque departure (“Baal’s Back”), the album grooves along nicely, only pausing for a short, well-placed breather on “All I Think About Now,” where recent bass recruit Paz Lenchantin (formerly of The Entrance Band and Queens of the Stone Age) takes the reins on vocals. The album is assured; here is the sound of a band who now know themselves well after decades of honing their energy. They aren’t afraid to reminisce about the past, either—both “Head Carrier” and “All I Think About Now” gracefully allude to the departure of bassist Kim Deal, the latter track having been written as a thank-you to the founding member.
“Head Carrier” is a strong title track, with frontman Francis proclaiming, “You can’t be too chill,” and David Lovering showcasing his signature driving style on drums. Joey Santiago delivers his distorted lead guitar with fervor. Lenchantin also makes a secure debut as bassist, following on from longtime band-member Deal and recent departure Kim Shattuck. It’s a promising start to an album that is trying its hardest to rise above 2014’s “Indy Cindy.” This song and the subsequent track, “Classic Masher,” say one thing: The Pixies are back.
The only disappointment on the tracklist is “Baal’s Back,” a brief yet out-of-place attempt to hark back to a previous era. The track opens with a screeched, “I bet you thought that I was dead and gone,” and in just one minute and 53 seconds, it’s over, eliminating any hope that the listener might warm to the hasty genre switch. Francis wholeheartedly proves that his caterwauling abilities remain, but the context is less than ideal: Surrounded by the rest of the album, the track simply doesn’t make sense, and it falls short of exhibiting the Pixies’ genre-hopping diversity. “Baal’s Back” is frantic and forced and appears lost in this otherwise congruent album.
“Tenement Song,” on the other hand, is a particular highlight. In contrast to “Baal’s Back,” its nostalgia is well-executed. Lenchantin triumphs vocally, especially on the anthemic chorus, and the narrative is “Hotel California”-like in its rich lyrical content. “His drumsticks were his treasure trove / found in the ashes of the coconut grove,” Francis sings, before a tried-and-tested pre-chorus chord progression kicks in. That “Tenement Song” is able to subtly pull inspiration from The Pixies’ back catalogue, refining rather than rehashing their current material, is a true testament to the current lineup.
Throughout “Head Carrier,” it is easy to hear just how much the bands coming out of the Pacific Northwest, Nirvana in particular, were inspired by the band’s early material. The Pixies, although not notable in terms of album sales, were trailblazers in their field; we might be less shocked by their sound in 2016, but they remain as accomplished as ever. “Head Carrier” serves only to call attention to the successes of the Pixies—past and present.

As you watch “The Dressmaker,” a film adaption of Rosalie Ham’s best-selling novel of the same name, forget any notion of Kate Winslet in yet another period piece. If you do find flustered ladies fanning themselves in tight corsets, they’ll be curiously set against a background of sepia flashbacks, sultry Western melodies, and grotesque, bloody deaths.
Set in the fictional town of Dungatar in 1951, the story follows the return of protagonist Myrtle “Tilly” Dunnage to her hometown in the Australian outback after years of living overseas as a haute couture dressmaker. When we first meet the enigmatic Tilly (Kate Winslet), she emerges from her bus into the somber town to a Western theme, immediately setting the tone of the revenge story. Dressed in couture, lips perfectly lined in crimson, white-gloved hands fingering a cigarette, she is every inch the femme fatale, but one armed with a sewing machine instead of gun and holster. Ultimately, the elements encapsulated in this scene—Kate Winslet, the mystery, and the costumes—make the film compelling.
Tilly’s abrupt homecoming after 25 years instantly fuels the petty gossip that keeps her neighbors thriving in their dismal town, which cinematographer Donald McAlpine has effectively depicted with eerie desert-colored tones. We do not have long to admire the barren expanses of land, as Winslet’s Tilly is quick to steal each of the scenes with the confidence and defiant acts that provoke the horror of her scandalized neighbors. Equally as scene-stealing as the character herself are her extravagant, vibrantly-colored outfits, all of which conjure the spirit of early Hollywood sirens like Lana Turner.
We are drawn to why Tilly was removed from her town—her supposed murder of a young boy called Stewart Pettyman when they were children. Tilly enlists the help of her ostracized mother, “Mad” Molly (Judy Davis); the hilarious cross-dressing Sergeant Farrat (Hugo Weaving); and the virile force of a love interest, Teddy (Liam Hemsworth) to help her uncover the true cause of the boy’s death and remove the curse she believes haunts her. At every moment she is parried by clichés of small towns—the jealous small-town girl, the lascivious town councilor, and the wealthy snob. The colorful cast and their interactions with Tilly adds a much-needed humor to the occasionally dark film.
Indeed director and screenwriter Jocelyn Moorhouse (best known for directing and writing “Proof,” starring Russell Crowe) does a fantastic job of mingling comedy amidst the tragedy. There are many instances of witty dialogue, particularly between Tilly and the ailing Molly, whose long relationship is beset with many comical moments. The local snob Elsbeth (Caroline Goodall) and her attempts to prevent her son’s marriage to the grocer’s daughter are another point of hilarity and work perfectly to offset the strange macabre that permeates the rest of the film. If we can compare these comedic moments to Jane Austen, we can easily draw parallels to the revenge and tragedy found in Jacobean literature, as suggested by direct allusions to Macbeth. This balance of comedy and tragedy adds to the film a complexity that is both enjoyable and at times unexpectedly moving.
Where the movie falls remarkably short is in its attempt to cover too much ground with its multitude of subplots. The film also seems to contradict itself, splitting into two opposing parts because of thematic confusion. The first half of the film consistently propagates forgiveness over revenge, as seen when Tilly agrees to make over the women of the town with her avant-garde design. The revenge that has been perpetually insinuated by the Western music and by Tilly’s rebellious return after banishment doesn’t quite match with the scenes of tension being resolved.
Only upon Teddy’s death does the film returns to its original argument in favor of vengeance, with Tilly once again marginalized by the people she was beginning to win over. At this point, we encounter a more vulnerable, grief-stricken woman whom Winslet plays with a sensitivity and pathos reminiscent of her other celebrated roles, like Ophelia in “Hamlet.” Equally as touching is Davis’s Molly, who finally steps up to her role of mother to her abandoned daughter. While the excess of subplots and confused theme can feel overwhelming, the stellar acting of the leading characters make this movie striking and thoroughly entertaining.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Obviously, being free feels satisfying. But it does not necessarily feel good in a deep sense. Take for example something we all do once we are free from our obligations: watching Netflix.
Unless you were watching a truly fantastic show, satisfying your inner sloth’s desire to watch 12 hours of Netflix might lead to some post-binge regret. You’d certainly have some regret if you chose Netflixing over volunteering for an overnight shift at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
But we might say that comparing Netflixing and volunteering is like comparing apples and oranges—it is up to each of us to decide what to do with our free time, and we should allow ourselves the liberty to choose an apple or an orange whenever we want. No doubt, it is important to be committed to virtues like freedom and liberty: being unconstrained is a luxury like no other. But if we are committed to virtues at all, why stop at liberty?
It seems to me that we often do stop at liberty, though. Take for example the hot-button issue of single-gender social organizations at Harvard. A sizable portion of the community has vocally defended students’ liberty to join final clubs, sororities, and fraternities after administrators have shown that they are willing to use their powers to punish those who join. Despite this, punch season this year also shows us that students continue to exercise their liberty to join these organizations. However, these same people seem to forget that such institutions do not live up to other virtues—most notably, inclusivity—that are important to building a strong social fabric.
I have little doubt that most people in these organizations believe that empathy and inclusiveness are virtues that one should strive toward. As one final club alumnus stated to the New York Times, single-gender entities exist so that one can learn from others of the same gender, also adding that “It is not a rejection of anyone.”
But it is easy to forget what embodying virtues like empathy and inclusivity looks like when you are surrounded by people like you. A room full of men would find it hard to understand what it is like to be a woman, often reduced to an object that men compete over to possess. Similarly, a room full of women would find it hard to comprehend how difficult it is to be vulnerable as a man, especially when others expect men to be strong and self-secure.
However, many seem to ignore such a problem.  Defenders of single-gender groups make arguments that amount to one thing: let us be free to go about our own gender-based business. Even women who defend sororities as safe spaces seem to think that they should be unconstrained in participating in such groups.
The result of such commitments to liberty is that we become limited in how we achieve other virtues. Surely, safe spaces for women in the form of sororities are helpful. But the trade-off is that there is less incentive to seek out spaces that try to fix the harmful inter-gender relationships that are the reason safe spaces exist in the first place; more empathy among women is a good thing, but the opportunity cost is more empathy among men and women.
To put it directly, this is the problem: allowing ourselves the option to join such narrow groups often undermines other commitments we have. Just as having the option to watch Netflix can undermine the good of volunteering, having the option join single-gender groups can undermine empathy and inclusion.
This is not to say that administrators should use their power to limit our incentives and options. Rather, we should start asking ourselves the following question: Why do we often choose liberty despite its costs to other ideals?
I think we make this choice because it is easy—being free is the natural state of things. As libertarian thinker Robert Nozick noted, even if a society tried to distribute goods according to some virtuous ideal, the natural liberty people have to work and give away the fruits of their labor would upset that ideal. And insofar as work and giving is satisfying, we are hardwired to do whatever satisfies us, even if that often does not include working, giving, or being virtuous.
So yes, it is easy to laze around in your room all day or join organizations with others of your own gender. Yes, these things are natural and can be satisfying.  But if I am right in thinking that people have an impulse to do good while also having the liberty and incentive to do otherwise, then there is urgent reason to reconcile these two impulses by looking at the harder, more uncommon use of freedom: Using freedom to chain ourselves to virtue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before Donald Trump’s incorrect statements on stop and frisk during the first presidential debate on Monday night, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that judges must consider whether or not black men have reasonable reason to flee in a police encounter on a case-by-case basis.
The court held unanimously that black men could potentially flee in order to avoid the humiliation of racial profiling, rather than avoid arrest because they are guilty. In the wake of a long line of tragedies, we applaud this ruling for ensuring that justifiable fear and panic in an encounter with the police is not falsely equated with culpability. Nevertheless, this ruling—which is largely a legal technicality—is in no way a solution to persisting racial profiling in policing. More proactive measures, such as increased training, accountability, and structural reforms are the ultimate solutions to the plight of minorities before the law enforcement system, but until they are enacted, courts should accordingly exercise caution in their rulings and in their interpretations of evidence.
This court decision is the result of the case Commonwealth vs. Jimmy Warren. In December 2011, Warren was stopped by police looking for suspects in a break-in in Roxbury. The police were working off of a vague description of “two men in black hooded sweat shirts and a third wearing a red hooded sweatshirt.” Warren was asked to stop by two different officers, but his refusal caused the encounter to result in a chase at gunpoint, arrest, and a charge for unlawful possession of firearm, despite the fact that Warren was innocent of the crime the police officers were initially investigating.
Though the exact prudence of Warren’s course of action may be questioned, the police should have never approached him in the first place. Indeed, there is statistical corroboration that Warren had reason to believe they were unjustifiably biased against him. The ruling was based in large part on an American Civil Liberties Union report that found that black people accounted for 63 percent of field interrogations despite composing only 24 percent of Boston’s population between 2007 and 2010.
Racial profiling, however, is not endemic to Massachusetts; it has a long history in criminal justice and policing. In traffic stops alone, black drivers are more likely to be stopped for no major reason and punished for minor traffic infractions. Data from many states has shown that police target minority communities for drug offenses, even though marijuana and other drug use rates are usually the same as or even higher for white communities. Unarmed black people are also killed by police at five times the rate of unarmed whites.
These realities make it reasonable for the black community, particularly black males, to be concerned about their safety in police encounters. In addition to the “indignity of being racially profiled” that the court found as reasonable motivation for fleeing police encounters, both judges and police officers need to realize the role of fear. Often, there are very low levels of trust in highly-policed minority communities and that trust is only eroded by the tragedies that have occurred. As the court has ruled, a black man has reason to fear that the request to stop will escalate to a more dangerous situation.
Given the current situation of our criminal justice system, we fully agree that courts should consider how fear and racial profiling can affect a defendant’s actions. However, for real change to be made, greater structural reform is necessary. The fear and anxiety that people feel in encounters with the police needs to be realized not only by court justices, but by the policemen and women who initiate the interactions.

“The worst form of inequality,” quoth Aristotle, “is to try to make unequal things equal,” and so it is with dining restrictions.
For the less familiar, these strictures are a series of byzantine rules designed to control access to Harvard’s 13 dining halls. Since not all are equidistant to the Yard and other classroom buildings, some lay empty while others are bursting at the seams. The urge to redistribute is strong. In 2014, the administration indulged.
Of course, the rationale was couched in benevolently paternalistic terms: despite “restrict[ing] choice and convenience,” then-Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde wrote upon Community Dinner’s introduction two years ago, it was done to “enhance students’ sense of belonging at Harvard.” This move, itself predated by the advent of garden-variety dining rules, only marked the most recent step away from open dining halls. Sadly, these restrictions have hardly been wise. (And how could I be wrong when both the Undergraduate Council and The Crimson’s Editorial Board agree with me?)
At a very basic level, one might be forgiven for thinking that the true reason for interhouse restrictions is to make the tax code look simple by comparison. Dunster House, for instance, has separate rules governing access to athletes, Dunster residents, and their guests, each depending on the day of the week and with special carve-outs from 6-7 p.m. and 7:15-8 p.m. Multiple this complexity by 13, and even a seasoned senior will quickly be cowered into walking to Mather.
To make matters worse, each year the restrictions move further south, as limitations at Adams propel strictures at Quincy, in turn exacerbating crowding at Leverett. At this pace, Mather will soon have them too, and that will truly be a sad commentary on interhouse community at Harvard. 
I will admit that halting the unwashed masses at the gates of Quincy and Adams has a certain elitist appeal. (Imagine the abode of FDR, soiled with first-years. The place would go to the dogs.) But alas, I do not live in those two hallowed houses. Instead, I must queue at the swipe desk, final-club-like, waiting for a friend to utter that time-tested shibboleth: “oh, yeah, he’s with me.” 
These dining halls are truly un-inclusive, and rumor has it that such places do not align with the Mission of Harvard College. Despite the benefits of community bonding that the restrictions supposedly engender, none of my friends who live in Mather have experienced personal, social, or intellectual transformation on the long walk to their concrete eyesore’s sparsely populated dining hall. Even denizens of Quincy and Adams, the perennial poster children for the necessity of restrictions, might well benefit from a restriction-free dining hall. After all, if hordes of freshmen prevent them from eating at home, there are friends to be made on the walk to Leverett. 
More fundamentally, restrictions and Community Dinner aren’t working. I mustered some courage and snuck into Adams at lunchtime last week, and it was still overrun despite the limits. Like all planned economies, this Gosplan on the Charles is starting to crack. Telling me where to eat is socialism, and any proper Fox News pundit playing word association can tell you what that means: Long lines, shortages, and universal healthcare. It’s un-American. We didn’t win the Cold War for nothing.
A better plan: Deregulate the dining halls. A laissez-faire free-for-all seems more chaotic, but it’s the sort of good-natured anarchy that forces Harvard students to meet new people, even if it’s past September of freshman year. An extra lap around the dining hall, tray in hand, is a small price to pay. (Alternatively, if Adams is overcrowded, simply make their food worse. Weekday lunches too busy? Bring back the swai. Personally, I’d walk to the Quad if they started serving prime rib and lobster up there.) 
The irony is that Community Dinner ignores the communities that matter more: The broader, pan-house Harvard friendships centered around activities or friend groups. House life is indeed important, but as a practical matter, relationships that are the product of choice and mutual interest are more meaningful than those that are the product of the Office of Student Life’s computer program. As Marx might have said, we have nothing to lose but our restrictions.

UPDATED: September 30, 2016, at 9:30 p.m.
Columbia University endowment manager N.P. Narvekar will serve as the next CEO and president of Harvard Management Company, taking the reins of the world’s largest university endowment at a time of instability, the University announced Thursday evening.
Narvekar, who has managed Columbia’s $9.6 billion endowment since 2002, will be HMC’s fourth CEO in 10 years. Stephen Blyth resigned as the CEO of HMC in July after only 18 months at the helm, citing personal reasons for his departure, and Robert A. Ettl has served as CEO in the interim. When he begins as CEO on Dec. 5, Narvekar could continue to restructure Harvard’s investment model, which some have criticized as inadequate. 
The announcement comes a week after HMC posted its worst returns on the endowment since the financial crisis. In fiscal year 2016, HMC returned negative 2 percent on the endowment that, along with the $1.7 billion HMC distributes to fund University operations, contributed to an almost $2 billion reduction in the value of Harvard’s endowment. Harvard’s endowment now stands at $35.7 billion, down from its $37.6 billion valuation in fiscal year 2015. The losses, repeatedly characterized as “disappointing,” will constrain budgets across Harvard, according to University President Drew G. Faust.
Narvekar will lead an endowment whose performance has consistently lagged behind the funds the at peer universities, including Columbia. During a generally subdued year for large institutional investors, Yale returned 3.4 percent, MIT returned 0.8 percent, Stanford returned -.4 percent, and the University of Pennsylvania returned negative 1.4 percent; several other peer institutions have yet to report returns for fiscal year 2016.
While Columbia has not yet announced its returns for fiscal year 2016, its performance under Narvekar has consistently beat HMC’s portfolio growth. Every year since the financial crisis, Columbia’s endowment has grown at a faster rate than Harvard’s. In its 2014 annual report, the Columbia Investment Management Company wrote that it had returned an annualized 11.0 percent over the last 10 years; Harvard earned an annualized 8.9 percent over the same period.
This consistent underperformance has prompted some, including Faust, to consider if Harvard should change its investment model and adapt one closer to Yale’s. If his time at Columbia is any indication, Narvekar could lead a transition away from HMC’s “hybrid investment model.” Instead of  employing both an in-house staff of about 200 and retaining external fund managers, Harvard may now begin—as Columbia does—to rely more heavily on external funds.
Narvekar has served as the CEO at the Columbia Investment Management Company since 2002, an almost 15 year long tenure that stands in stark contrast to the recent trend of executive turnover at HMC. Several analysts have pointed to the absence of a consistent leader at HMC as a one cause of the firm’s underperformance, and Faust said during the CEO search that Harvard needed to find a “strong leader.”
“Harvard Management Company plays a critically important role in supporting the students, faculty and staff who advance the teaching and research mission of the university,” Faust said in a press release. “We are pleased to welcome Narv to Harvard and are confident that his leadership skills and deep experience at the highest levels of investment management will position HMC for long-term success.”
Before taking the helm at Columbia, Narvekar managed the University of Pennsylvania’s private equity and hedge fund portfolios; he has also worked at J.P. Morgan & Co.
“It is an honor to join such a prestigious investment organization and help support the mission of Harvard University,” Narvekar said in the press release. “HMC has an unparalleled investment platform among endowments and I look forward to working with the HMC Board and team and using my investment experience to serve Harvard in the most effective way possible.”
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Harvard was considering Narvekar and Rockefeller University’s Amy C. Falls for the top post at its investment firm.

Harvard Square has plenty of bars, but only last Thursday did it welcome its first dedicated to oysters.
The Hourly—an “Oyster Bar” restaurant that offers seafood and cocktails—opened its doors last week at 15 Dunster St. in the former home of Kennedy’s on the Square, a gastropub that closed last March after less than a year in business.
The Grafton Group owns the new bar, adding to its portfolio of restaurants in the Square. The Grafton Group already owns four other local establishments: Grafton Street Pub and Grill, PARK Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, and Temple Bar.
Grafton Group owner Patrick Lee said his company was inspired by the success of the fresh seafood “raw bar” at Russell House Tavern and wanted to open up a  “true oyster bar” in Harvard Square.
“As part of our full raw bar, we offer eight varieties of oysters—which provides a great way for students to learn about and try new kinds of oysters,” Lee said of the new restaurant. “Students 21 and over can choose from our curated selection of wine and beer and sip cocktails that are made to be enjoyed with seafood.”
In addition to staples like clam chowder and lobster rolls, the restaurant offers burger and pasta dishes. The Hourly also has two bars offering an extensive drink menu of signature cocktails, beer, and wine.
Lee said the group named the restaurant “The Hourly” as a nod to Harvard Square’s history. The restaurant is located on Dunster Street, which once served as a meeting point for horse-drawn wagons known as “Hourlies” because they departed each day on the hour for Boston.
Previously, Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson expressed concern that construction on the nearby Smith Campus Center might deter customers from frequenting the restaurant.
“We want people to know about The Hourly because many people don’t walk down that street because of the construction of the Smith Campus Center.” Jillson said.
Currently, the restaurant is only open for dinner from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.,  but is planning to add lunch and brunch service in the middle of October, according to Lee.
The restaurant can seat 96 people and is planning to open up a patio in the space next to Mike’s Pastry that will expand the seating capacity to 116 people.

Nieman Fellow Alisa Sopova and  Anastasia Taylor-Lind, a fellow from the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, presented their postcard project about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine Thursday evening and discussed the need to humanize victims of violence.
Their project, which sends postcards to individuals around the world containing idyllic photos of Donetsk, Ukraine juxtaposed with death notices, has sought to raise awareness of lost lives in Ukraine.
Sopova and Taylor-Lind said they hope to shed light on the realities of war.
Taylor-Lind, a photojournalist, began taking portraits of rebel soldiers in Kiev, Ukraine in 2014. Disillusioned with what she considered the mainstream media’s negative portrayal of Ukraine, she sought to photograph Ukrainian society more accurately.
“Just in the midst of photographing everything else, I began to feel a moral obligation to think about the way I was representing the Ukrainians,” she said.
Taylor-Lind’s partnership with Sopova, a Ukrainian journalist from Donetsk, began in 2015. Together, they bought hundreds of “Welcome to Donetsk” postcards to send abroad with names of individuals who had been killed during the conflict.
“At first I was skeptical of the project,” Sopova, Harvard’s first Ukrainian Nieman Fellow, said. “But then I saw people who were responding and feeling emotions about my city.”
The overwhelmingly positive social media response to the project fueled its continuation, according to the organizers. Following this outpouring of support, Taylor-Lind and Sopova used their personal expenses to purchase and mail out more postcards, at times relying on volunteers to help write cards.
Sopova also reached out to the United Nations, rebel organizations, and Russian social media sites to collect more than 2,000 names of the killed civilians, adding that there is no current, accurate count.
“This is what the government or the United Nations should be doing,” Taylor-Lind said, referring to Sopova’s investigative work.
Audience members, including other Nieman fellows, lauded Sopova and Taylor-Lind’s work.
“It’s really eye-opening, because as Americans we don’t always understand what goes on in other countries,” Nieman Fellow Felicia J. Fonseca said.
“The value [of the presentation] comes from challenging the way mainstream media typically delivers information to the public,” Design School student Hernan B. Bianchi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush presented his “bottom-up” approach to reworking America in the 21st century at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
Building on his experiences as governor, Bush advocated for moving beyond antiquated government institutions and promoting a system that empowers citizens to choose how to advance in society.
“It seems to me if we’re going to be successful in the 21st century we need a bottom-up country,” Bush said, describing a need for reforms in the United States' political system. “Why won’t we empower people in poverty rather than the institutions around them? I think they’ve been given their chance. Fifty years.”
Bush, who will be a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government this fall, called for “radical reform for our education system” and addressed Harvard affiliates directly by reminding them of their privilege and that their education prepares them for the future.
“If two-thirds of our children have to take remedial work to go to a community college and retake high school reading and high school math, or they don’t go at all, and they’re not career ready so they can’t get a job, who’s fooling who?” he asked.
As part of the “bottom-up” initiative, Bush discussed starting early by building an “early childhood literacy strategy,” universal pre-kindergarten programs, and a system of reading coaches in third and fourth grade to promote literacy.
Bush, throughout the forum, emphasized a need for unity and hope in America. Although he did not deny that there are faults in the current political system, he said people should focus on finding solutions to empower people rather than pessimistically ruminating on problems.
“There’s a consensus that we really need to start solving problems,” he said. “We have to give people a sense that they have the power to change their lives. The government’s role is not to take care of them per say, it is to assist them to rise up. Socioeconomic mobility should be the right of everybody.”
Bush discussed his other policy priorities, including poverty eradication and reforms in criminal justice, regulation, and taxation. Bush said that “across the spectrum our policy is stuck in the mid-1970s.”
Samuel A. Kessler ’19, a student on the IOP forum committee, said she thought the talk “humanized” Bush and appreciated that he avoided sensationalist election talk, instead steering the conversation back to “what he really cared about and, in this case, it was education reform, and there was a lot of substance there.”
W. Kent Haeffner ’18, a member of the Harvard Republican Club who wore a “Jeb!” shirt to the Forum, said it was important to discuss the real issues separate from the election.
“I think really what people are hungry for is folks who are focused on driving solutions that are going to make positive differences in people’s lives and I think education policy is a really salient and powerful way to do that,” he said.
Attendee Honey J. Skinner ’79 welcomed Bush’s optimistic approach to problem solving.

Deep underneath the intersection of Bow and Plympton streets, students now have a new party space thanks to the recent opening of the "Adams House K Space."
In an email last week to Adams House students, Adams House Resident Dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal and Faculty Deans Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and Sean Palfrey ’67 announced that new space—two rooms located in the basement of F entrywaywill be available for Adams residents to use for registered parties. The K Space can hold more than 50 people and provides an alternative to hosting social gatherings in smaller dorm rooms.
The move to open K Space was driven by students and House administrators. Both Adams House Committee co-chairs, Cecilia Laguarda ’17 and Tasnim Ahmed ’17, worked closely with Muri-Rosenthal and the Palfreys on the decision to repurpose the space.
“The House administration was confident moving forward with [the decision] because we had done such a good job with it,” Ahmed said of the first event hosted in April in the K Space. “I think that’s actually something that’s great about Adams House… our House administration, above all else, is into giving the students what they want.”
According to the co-chairs, the decision to open up the K Space came in response to student demand for more inclusive social spaces on campus. Given recent campus discussions surrounding social organizations, the House administration decided to increase the availability of venues for social events within Adams House.
“I think the point of Houses is that they should be the center of social life on campus, and I think that they were the center of social life on campus not too long ago,” Laguarda said. “Now that we have randomization in the Houses… if we could make the House an actual center of your social life, think about… the diversity you would get to experience.”
The K Space is one of several open social spaces in Adams.
Last year, the House renovated the “Molotov” to accommodate student parties. House administrators saw that the space was often overbooked, and they sought to increase the number of spaces for students to host events.
“We want our students to have parties, we want them to have fun, we want them to decompress on the weekends and have a good time,” Muri-Rosenthal said. “That’s really an important aspect of living in Adams House.”

A group of undergraduate and graduate students advocating an end to human trafficking and forced labor is teaming up with the Kennedy School of Government to support a research analyst position that will study Harvard’s supply chain labor practices.
The organization, the Harvard Coalition Against Modern Slavery, partnered with the Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy to create the position. The new analyst—who will either be a graduate or undergraduate student—will investigate some of Harvard’s supply chains to assess the equity of its vendors’ labor practices, according to Coalition member Diana E. Sheedy ’17.
Last semester, Sheedy and two other members of the group approached University President Drew G. Faust about a possible collaboration on the issue of forced labor.
“We proposed to President Faust that we wanted to learn more because it was an issue that we cared about,” Sheedy said. “[She] was wonderful and agreed.”
Members of the coalition worked with Kennedy School faculty to design a research position, which the Carr Center will fund, Sheedy said.
According to Tatum R. Williamson, a student in the School of Public Health and a member of the coalition, this semester’s research is a “very preliminary step.” The group hopes to first assess if Harvard has a problem within its supply chains, and then make recommendations, she said.
Now that the research position is filled, the group plans to expand beyond the handful of members who regularly engage with the group.
“Right now we’re interested in creating more of an established club, because it’s only been three or four of us,” Williamson said.
Sheedy said she hopes to attract other undergraduates to the Coalition, but that the diversity of Harvard schools represented is one of its strengths.
Elizabeth Kim, a member of the coalition and a student at the Kennedy School, wrote in an email that the group hopes to raise awareness of human trafficking and show students how they can address the issue in their professional or personal lives.
“Human trafficking is a heinous crime that continues to undermine rule of law, fuel illicit economies, and strip people of the freedom and ability to work towards their human potential,” Kim said.
The Coalition hopes not only to expand within Harvard’s walls, but to work with other universities, as well. According to Sheedy, members are planning an intercollegiate convention for the spring.
After the initial meeting with Faust, the group has continued to keep in touch with her chief of staff. Both Williamson and Sheedy said they have appreciated the level of administrative support their group has received.

Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 addressed the Faculty Council Wednesday and fielded questions about ongoing campus discussions regarding final clubs and Greek organizations.
They met with the Council ahead of this semester’s first full meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences scheduled for next week, when professors are expected to discuss a motion to oppose a historic College policy that penalizes members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations. The policy—which starting with the Class of 2021 will bar members of such groups from holding leadership positions and receiving top fellowships—has incited criticism across campus from both students and faculty.
“Shaiba and I sort of discussed the highly politicized moment at Harvard,” Banks said about the Faculty Council meeting.
According to Rather, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith invited the two UC leaders to talk to the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body.
While Rather and Banks would not comment on specific questions asked at the meeting, they said they had anticipated some of the topics.
“I think, at this point, Danny and I have wrestled with the questions they asked, as well as many people at this College,” Rather said.
“The questions we heard at the Faculty [Council] meeting are questions that have crossed our minds before,” she added.
The Council also discussed the College policy at their last meeting, at which former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and several other professors presented their motion to oppose the new penalties. The 12 professors who signed the motion argue that the policy infringes upon students’ freedom of association, writing that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
It is unclear whether a motion approved by the full FAS Faculty could strike down the policy.
Germanic Languages and Literatures professor John T. Hamilton, a member of the Faculty Council, said his position on the issue “is complicated.”
“I, on the one hand, appreciate a certain kind of freedom for students to belong to whatever organization they choose,” he said. “On the other hand, one has to be cautious in an effort not to discriminate, also trying to grapple with the issue of organizations that discriminate.”
Government professor Danielle S. Allen, a member of the Council, said she appreciated having students weigh in on the discussions about the policy.
“The Faculty Council is listening and learning,” Allen said. “They came and spoke about matters of concern to them, and it was absolutely helpful to have student perspectives.”
Allen said “these kinds of issues of campus culture are extremely difficult.”
“They’re difficult in the abstract and they’re difficult when you take a look at the particularities of institutions,” she added.
Rather and Banks plan to share their thoughts about their Faculty Council presentation and content of the meeting sometime next week, “most likely in an op-ed,” Rather wrote in an email. She said she and Banks appreciated taking part in the Council’s meeting, since “it’s very, very rare” for students to do so.
Students will join faculty, however, on a new committee charged with recommending how to implement the College’s single-gender social organizations policy, the College announced last week. The UC will aid the College in reviewing student nominations for the committee.
In addition to hearing Rather and Bank’s presentation on Wednesday, the Council also started to discuss an annual report on the Faculty, which FAS will publish in late October, Hamilton said, adding that the report will touch on trends in the Faculty, FAS finances, and capital campaign projects like House Renewal.
“Getting the general sense of where the University is at: that’s the major business,” Hamilton said.

Jewish Harvard affiliates are mourning the loss of former Israeli Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Shimon Peres, who died Wednesday at the age of 93.
Peres, who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1951, died from stroke complications. He served as a three-term Israeli Prime Minister, as Minister of Defense, Finance, Transportation, and Foreign Affairs, and as President.
Peres was known for his emphasis on Israel’s defense, positions on West Bank settlements, and technological foresight.
Emeritus Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz ’67 called Peres “a truly great man, a visionary” and described his legacy as one of a protective and innovative leader.
“He helped arm Israel when Israel needed to be armed against Egypt and Syria and Jordan, and he then turned to peace. He tried to beat swords into plowshares,” he said. “He was the originator of start-up nation in Israel, he was the one who saw that Israel’s future was in high technology.”
Israeli student Limor Gultchin ’17 described Peres as an integral part of Israel’s social and political fabric.
“He was part of our upbringing, part of our hope for peace, part of our hope for a better future,” she said. “And part of the main group that established what Israel has become… and what it was hoping to be.”
Peres received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, following his involvement in the Oslo Peace Accords. Gal Lin, Co-Chair of The Israel Caucus at the Kennedy School, said these efforts influenced Israelis’ perception of him.
“He was both instrumental in solidifying Israel’s security and in pursuing peace. And I think for Israel, he really symbolizes leadership with a vision. Not just concentrating on now, but imagining a better future and to pursue it,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Rabbi Jonah Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel, said despite some criticism Peres’ policies may face, Israel has lost an influential leader.
“Various turns of his political career will be critiqued, and there are differing strategic views, to say the least; but, to my mind, the State of Israel has lost a human reflection of its truest self,” Steinberg wrote.
Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat ended his trip to Boston early in order to return to Jerusalem for Peres’s funeral on Friday. Mayor Barkat is expected to be joined by President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, and Secretary of State John Kerry.

Louis A. DePasquale is Cambridge’s new “most powerful man”—the city manager— after a unanimous vote by the Cambridge City Council Thursday night.
The role is a promotion from his current position as assistant city manager for fiscal affairs, a post in which he has helped formulate Cambridge’s budget. Nine councillors at a special City Council meeting selected him.
“I think he gets finances in a way that no one else does,” Councillor Craig A. Kelley said. “I was super impressed at the way he has a vision for approaching our university and business partners, and how we can work with them to help our schools, help our non-profits, and help our communities.”
The city manager position is arguably the most powerful in the city. The city manager is is responsible for enforcing laws and ordinances, advising the City Council and implementing their decisions, appointing city officials, and creating the budget.
While the vote was unanimous, the meeting was not without controversy. Some councillors, including Jan Devereux and Nadeem A. Mazen expressed concern with the selection process and the lack of diversity of the three finalists.
“When I was running for office I said I hoped we would take seriously the chance to bring in a fresh perspective when we chose our next city manager,” Devereux said at the meeting. “The process that we’ve put in place has failed essentially to yield us a candidate from the outside that I think we can trust with these big opportunities.”
Mazen said the Council should have appropriated more funds to attract candidates from outside Massachusetts and New England.
“We could have really gotten excited candidates from across this country if we took the time to reach out,” Mazen said. “We did not, as a Council, negotiate from a position of strength.”
Councillors Leland Cheung and David P. Maher, members of the selection committee, defended the selection process and addressed critics from city residents who said there weren’t enough opportunities to meet with the candidates.
“We received many emails and letters and there was no shortage of opinion from folks who had seen the interviews.” Maher said. “In addition, we invited at every juncture the public to offer written comments and to turn that in.”
Addressing questions of diversity in the candidate pool, Cheung said that most city managers across the country are white males.
“This expectation that Cambridge should have just a more diverse candidate pool… That’s just not realistic,” Cheung said. “Cambridge is going to have to be a net exporter of diversity. We have a clear value of diversity in this city.”
Earlier this week, one of the finalists, Robert “Jay” Ash Jr., the secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, removed his name from consideration. In a statement, he expressed thanks for the opportunity, but opted to stay with the Massachusetts Governor Charlie A. Baker ’79 administration.
“In my heart, I believe that being part of the Baker Administration is more important to me than being part of any other administration,” Ash wrote.
Outgoing City Manager Richard C. Rossi is expected to retire on Friday, Sept. 30. After Thursday evening, the City Council will take a two-week hiatus and return to its weekly Monday night meetings on Oct. 17.

Washington Post religion journalist and current Nieman fellow Michelle Boorstein described the difficulties journalists who report on religion face, addressing an audience at the Divinity School Thursday afternoon.
The Harvard Divinity School’s Center for the Study of World Religions hosted the event, titled “A Reporter’s Dilemmas: What are the right words for a religiously changing world?”  as part of the first in its series on Religion and Media.
According to Francis X. Clooney, director of the Center for the Study of World Religions and co-organizer of the event, the series on Religion and Media focuses on current events in collaboration Harvard Nieman Foundation for Journalism. He said the Divinity School supplements its “long-term events, historical lectures, and study of texts with attention on religion as a lived reality today.”
Moderator Diane L. Moore, Divinity School professor and director of the Religious Literacy Project, said journalists who report on religion face difficult circumstances because they often have to educate readers about the subject.
“I think that reporters are not unlike teachers in school because you’re responsible for communicating about complicated topics in concise ways to general audiences,” Moore said. “It puts journalists in an untenable situation, because it’s not your job to teach Religion 101.”
Boorstein said an issue that comes from lack of education is the complexity of religious language and terminology, citing her recent coverage of Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine as an example.
“One of the last pieces I did before I went on the [Nieman] fellowship this summer was about Tim Kaine’s Catholicism,” she said. “I got ‘Who are you to say that he’s Catholic, he’s not Catholic—and those are very very daily conversations for me. ‘Why am I allowing somebody who does not subscribe to this, who does not ascribe to the definition of Catholic [to speak about it]?’.”
Nevertheless, Boorstein said that writing about religion, while a sensitive topic, is not fundamentally different than other reporting.
“We do feel a lot of responsibility, but in order to write organically and powerfully about something, you have to treat it like you’re writing about anything else. Other major things in life: sports, politics, sex,” she said.
The center will likely hold another four or five events in the series by the end of the year, to reflect on the different ways in which language about religion affects global audiences, Clooney said.

A blackout darkened most of Harvard’s River Houses and freshman dorms for about an hour Thursday night and into Friday morning, disrupting students cramming for midterms and stranding some in elevators across campus.
A transformer located at 8110 Memorial Drive malfunctioned, causing the outage, according to the Cambridge Fire Department. The outage lasted from around 11:45 p.m. Thursday to 1 a.m. Friday.
An Energy and Facilities Operations Center operator confirmed that technicians had been dispatched to help students trapped in dorm elevators in Mather House and Thayer Hall.
Adams House Faculty Dean Sean Palfrey ’67 stood with a flashlight outside Adams amid the darkness that engulfed Plympton St. He said Harvard has experienced “multiple different kinds of outages” in past years, including one a few months ago.
“The main control centers just blow out an entire section of Harvard,” Palfrey said.
The outage caused inconveniences for many students, some of whom were doing homework.  Shannon S. Lytle ’17, an Adams resident, was in the middle of a p-set when the power went out.
“It was annoying more than anything because I was trying to get my work done, and my laptop was close to dying,” Lytle said.
Some students were also studying for midterm examinations scheduled for Friday, including in Molecular and Cellular Biology 60: “Cellular Biology and Molecular Medicine,” Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology 10: “Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology,” Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 10: “Foundations of Biological Diversity,” and Math 122: “Algebra I: Theory of Groups and Vector Spaces.”
When asked how she was studying for her Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology 10: “Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology” midterm in the blackout,   Kristen Fang ’19 said: “I’m not.”
A crowd of students gathered in the Starbucks near the Harvard Square T stop to continue studying, according to Nico Tuccillo ’19, who was studying there for his midterm in Molecular and Cellular Biology 60: “Cellular Biology and Molecular Medicine.”
Nina Vendhan ’19 had other concerns.
“I’m worried about my food in my mini-fridge,” she said.
Some Houses, or entryways within Houses, still had power. Lethu A. Ntshinga ’18 said Leverett’s McKinlock Hall, where she lives, had electricity even though the House’s towers were dark.
“It’s lit, as usual,” Ntshinga said.
Houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle were not affected by the blackout.
After the Houses went dark, Pforzheimer House committee co-chair Muhammed Ors ’17 published a Facebook post poking fun at undergraduates housed along the Charles River.
“Bet all you river kids, and especially those who transferred to the river, wish you got quadded now,” Ors wrote.
Despite his p-set challenges, Lytle said the blackout was exciting.
“I mean it’s kind of fun, too,” he said. “It puts everybody in a different kind of emergency state of panic.”

Tonight at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson football team faces a pair of opponents: Georgetown and the probability of rain.
Both are slippery foes. The Hoyas, because they’ve started the year 3-0 after four straight losing seasons. The rain, because it is wet.
“I can’t remember going into a third game and never having some rain to acclimate,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It’s all about adapting to the environment, whether that’s a hostile environment on the road, rain, or wind.”
In recent years, however, the Crimson (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) has weathered all these difficulties. In 2015, Harvard wrapped up its third straight Ivy League title, capping a stretch in which the team played to a 28-2 record over its three championship seasons.
Those victories came in bright sunlight and blistering cold; they came in the hinterlands known as Ithaca, N.Y. and Hanover, N.H.; and they came in the homeland known as Harvard Stadium.
Dating back to 2013, the Crimson has won 16 road games in a row—second only to Ohio State, who has won 19 straight. More than any other statistic, this one demonstrates the program’s ability to adapt to different environments.
It is little surprise, then, that Murphy has already prepared his players for precipitation. This week in practice, Harvard went through a series of wet-ball drills; since no actual rain fell, coaches dunked footballs in water to simulate inclement conditions.
“We have to think about [ball security] every single game,” running back Semar Smith said. “You can’t lose sight of that even when it’s raining.”
The preparation began as long ago as last Saturday, when Smith ate up 89 yards on the ground against Brown. That performance cemented the junior’s status as top back and demonstrated the power of the Crimson’s run game—a crucial asset in wet weather.
Sure, Harvard can deal with harsh conditions—over the last few years, only the Postal Service has delivered more consistently.
But heading into tonight’s Georgetown matchup (7 p.m.)—and, beyond that, heading into the furor of Ancient Eight play—the Crimson faces as much of a challenge from internal opponents as external ones.
Take injuries. Fractures, strains, breaks, pulls, and separations are facts of football. As a coach, you just hope that the roulette ball doesn’t land on certain numbers.
Harvard number 79 is one such number. That jersey belongs to senior Max Rich, the left tackle and veteran heart of the offensive line. Against Brown he hobbled off the field after a goal-line rushing play and did not return; his status tonight is uncertain. Also questionable are sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley and junior left guard D.J. Mott, both starters.
“They’re all three good football players,” Murphy said. “If they can play, then we’d like to play them.”
High expectations represent another internal foe. To be sure, tough standards inspire excellence by demanding accountability. But those standards also exert a psychological burden.
Through two games, the Crimson has shouldered this weight through a full-proof tactic: keep winning. But expectations only dig deeper as the season progress.
“Once the game comes, that’s the easy part,” captain Sean Ahern said. “Practice is always the hardest thing....We have to get better and better any week to the point where we don’t give up any points.”
It’s dishonest, however, to present these challenges and provide no answers. In reality, Harvard remains a stalwart program, full of athleticism, talent, and hunger.
Besides a shaky stretch or two last Saturday, senior quarterback Joe Viviano has met all expectations. He’s completed 65 percent of his passes for 495 yards and no interceptions. Sophomore D.J. Bailey has emerged as a real threat on the defensive line, elevating a unit that already ranked as the strength of the team. And the secondary has recovered with panache after losing three starters from 2015.
“That group is talented,” Murphy said. “They’re really passionate. They give great energy to our team. They’re a lot of fun to be around.”
Certainly the Hoyas present a legitimate test. Georgetown’s rushing attack is averaging 125 yards per game. The team has converted 10 of 11 red-zone opportunities, including seven for touchdowns. Last year’s 45-0 blowout at Harvard Stadium belongs to last year, and this year’s Hoyas enter tonight with the deserved confidence of an undefeated team.
Moreover, Georgetown has proven an ability to beat Ivy League teams. At the Hoyas’ homecoming last Saturday, the hosts dispatched Columbia, 17-14, after jumping to a 17-0 lead.
Even so—even despite trying circumstances and a solid opponent—the Crimson reigns as a perpetual favorite. In 2016, this is what it means to be Harvard football. For how much longer, however, no one can say.
“[Georgetown] is now a veteran team that’s 3-0, coming in here with a lot of momentum,” Murphy said. “We’re still a work in progress.”

UPDATED: September 30, 2016, at 9:14 p.m.
Back at .500 after an impressive weekend sweep at home against Yale and No. 19 Maine, the Harvard field hockey team traveled a little further down the river Thursday night looking for another victory over a ranked opponent. 
And for the second contest in a row, the Crimson (5-4, 1-0 Ivy) hit its target, squeezing out a 1-0 victory over No. 14 Boston University (7-3, 1-1 Patriot League) at New Balance Field.
Freshman midfielder Bente van Vlijmen continued her torrid breakout of a rookie season, scoring the game’s only goal in the 52nd minute. The goal marks the fourth in three games for last week’s Ivy League Rookie of the Week, who is quickly becoming an integral part of a high flying Harvard offense that includes the likes of Marissa Balleza and freshman forward Maddie Earle.
“Bente has an unbelievable shot, and she was able to capitalize on one of the opportunities we had,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “It’s something we spend a lot of time on, and I’m glad it turned out to be effective today.”
The goal came off a penalty corner served in by senior defender Kyla Cordrey. The ball was then laid on a tee by sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte for van Vlijmen. The hard blast gave no chance for a save.
“[Penalty corners] are kind of my specialty,” van Vlijmen said. “I have a pretty hard hit so that always goes pretty well.”
Originally from the Netherlands, van Vlijmen has an aggressive nature that shows on the field and one that has helped lead her to success.
“The transition was really big because European hockey is really different from U.S. hockey,” van Vlijmen said. “But I love the energy—people are really physical. Our energy is so great. You represent your own college, which I’m really proud of. I’m having so much fun.”
Just a few minutes before, junior midfielder Hannah Wellington narrowly missed scoring when her shot went wide. Chances, however, were few and far between. More than anything, the game was a war of attrition with two strong defenses clashing.
“We knew ahead of time that we would have to work really, really hard to compete with a team like Boston University,” van Herwaarden said. “We had some opportunities and during the entire 70 minutes our defense stepped up, our press worked really well, and the work everybody put in paid off.”
The first half was a wash, with strong defenses on both sides canceling attacks to set the stage for a dramatic second half.
Likewise, sophomore goalie Libby Manela continued her shutdown keeping with her second clean sheet in three games—her first three collegiate starts. The defense in front of her allowed just three shots to go on goal, and the reigning Ivy League Player of the Week saved them all. Manela has allowed just one goal in her three starts.
“Libby has earned her props the last three games now, and she has been doing very well in goal,” van Herwaarden said.
Boston University has now dropped third consecutive games after jumping out to a 7-0 start and climbing as high as No. 9 in the national rankings. Harvard, on the other hand, has been moving in the other direction, now winners of three straight before returning to Ivy League play this Sunday against Penn.
“We just beat two ranked, which is very new for us,” van Herwaarden said. “Of course, this is a boost in confidence and energy so we are going to use that our next two days while we prepare for Penn. Penn has been a very tough opponent in the Ivy League over the last couple of years.”
Part of the Crimson’s progression can be attributed to playing against harder opponents, van Herwaarden says, including ones that are nationally ranked. The Crimson’s slow start has been long forgotten, and the future appears bright.
“I think that it has been paying off really well,” van Herwaarden said. “We want to compete for a championship in the Ivy League, and we need to measure ourselves against the top 15 teams in the nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While much is uncertain about the 2016 Harvard football team, one thing is for sure: Anthony Firkser can play football.
With a little over 13 minutes left in the first half, the senior halfback reeled in a deep pass from senior quarterback Joe Viviano, splitting the safeties along the way. He beat the defense to the pylon, scoring a 75-yard touchdown, his second of the game.
But that was only the beginning of the story. At halftime he’d racked up two touchdowns and 134 yards receiving. On four catches.
That production led the way for the Crimson (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) on an evening when the hosts shot to an early lead and held on for a 31-17 victory over Georgetown (3-1, 1-0 Patriot) The result moved Harvard to 3-0 on the year and extended a 16-game nonconference winning streak.
“[Firkser] is tough,” the Hoyas coach Rob Sgarlata said. “He should be playing with his hand on the ground next to the tackle, but they spread him out there, where our corners and safeties have to deal with him.”
With sophomore standout receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley out of action, Firkser had a much larger load to carry this week. The duo had combined for 366 yards through the air before this game.
Yet Firkser and the rest of the receiving corps stepped up in Shelton-Mosley’s absence. Though the 230-pound halfback was the star of the game, the rest of the receivers contributed. Nine different players caught a pass, with five earning 20 yards or more.
“I think our receivers actually stepped up a lot and helped by kind of taking what they gave us with short routes and stuff,” Firkser said. “Once we saw them start biting on some plays I was able to get more movement down the field.”
Along with Shelton-Mosley, starting offensive linemen Max Rich and DJ Mott sat out the game. Because of the lack of experience, the Crimson came out playing very much in-system. Short throws and runs up the middle characterized Harvard’s offensive drives.
The young receivers made big plays for the Crimson, though. On the first drive of the evening, sophomore Brian Dunlap caught a touchdown off a fade from Viviano in the back corner of the endzone. Twisting in midair to reel in the ball, Dunlap had to keep balance while toeing the line a la Larry Fitzgerald in Super Bowl XLIII for the score.
“That’s been sort of the character of the team for a million years,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Not that it was perfect, not that it was always pretty - but the way that Jonesie at left guard and Danny Laden at left tackle played and having Joey Foster back, all those kids did a great job.”
The game featured three different quarterbacks for the Crimson. Viviano started, played most of the first half, and continued an efficient start to the season. Passing 21 times for 15 completions, he totaled 210 yards and three touchdowns. One went Dunlap, one went for 75 yards to Firkser, and a third came on an 11-yard strike midway through the first period.
After Viviano came out in the second quarter, sophomores Tom Stewart and Cam Tripp completed the battery for Harvard. Stewart ended with 111 passing yards, and Tripp threw a touchdown to freshman receiver Cody Chrest early in the fourth. However, the three-passer system produced four turnovers, including two interceptions from Stewart and one from Tripp.
All the credit shouldn’t go to the Crimson offense exclusively. Coming off a game in which Harvard allowed 22 points to Brown, the defensive unit proved stingier this week, holding Georgetown to 17 points. Ignoring two long scores, the Crimson conceded 116 yards and held the Hoyas to one-of-13 efficiency on third downs.
“I thought it was a great team effort,” Murphy said. “Not a particularly pretty game...but the effort was really outstanding. We had a lot of room for improvement, but we played really hard…. We have to eliminate mistakes, and if we can do that we’ll be a good football team.”
In the absence of role players on offense, the defense stepped up to provide consistency for Harvard. However, the unit was playing with a depleted linebacking corps as well. As with last week, the Crimson was forced to roll down safeties to fill in the linebacking spots, consistently playing with five defensive backs.
“[Defensive Coordinator Scott Larkee] always puts us in the right position to make plays, and going into this game we knew the game plan was pretty simple,” senior defensive tackle James Duberg said. “Once we established and showed them that they couldn’t run the ball on us, they had to go away from that and it ended up being a passing game.”
But the secondary stepped up. Specifically, senior cornerback Raishaun McGhee appeared to be playing with a chip on his shoulder after being ejected for a targeting call last week. The senior had two pass breakups and was second on the team with seven tackles.
Although many cornerbacks aren’t known for jarring hits, McGhee’s biggest plays came on his tackles. He had a huge one on a swing pass for a loss of one in the second quarter and had an important pass breakup on fourth down near the end zone after Georgetown blocked a punt.
Early in the game, Harvard seemed to be in a much tighter contest with the Hoyas than last year’s 45-0 rout. After the Crimson stormed out to a 14-0 lead, the momentum definitively shifted Georgetown’s way.
On its third drive of the game, Harvard was forced to punt, and on the very next play, senior quarterback Tim Barnes hit sophomore receiver Brandon Williams to his right on a screen pass. Williams turned upfield and took the ball 76 yards for the touchdown. Aided by a cut block that sprung him, Williams won the footrace with the Crimson defense, pulling the visitors within a touchdown.
Later in the game, junior running back Isaac Ellsworth of the Hoyas took the ball 74 yards for Georgetown’s second touchdown. It came too late, though, as Harvard was up 31-10 before the score.
“Big plays are going to happen in any football game versus any team,” Duberg said. “Sometimes it could be a mental lapse, sometimes it’s just something as simple as one guy being just an inch off.”
Besides those two lengthy touchdowns, the Hoyas hardly threatened. In the first half, for example, the Crimson had 25 first downs. Georgetown? Just three.
“Harvard’s pretty good upfront,” Sgarlata said. “They did a really good job getting pressure with four guys. There was definitely a difference between their defensive line and our offensive line, so we struggled a little bit on third down.”

Perhaps you just dropped a pset-heavy nightmare of a class and added classical Chinese political theory or the intro level of the language you already took in high school, and you need to catch up. Or you should be spending less time hosting dorm room happy hours and more time attending office hours. With midterms nearing all too quickly on our calendars (October’s just a mere few days away?!) it may be time to *gasp* do a little work. However doomed you may be, have no fear, here are Flyby’s tips on how to get it together.
Mom yourself.Keep track of your assignments, and then nag yourself until you do them. This means phone reminders, quadruple underlining deadlines in your planner, tabs color-coded by assignment urgency—the works. What mom would want you to do, or what you’ve been telling mom all this time.
Torment yourself (a little).There’s not much use going to misery-ridden Lamont if you’re just going to sit in the café on your phone and exhaust your Boardplus dollars with another coffee and danish. You are there to be miserable, go on. You probably would rather disintegrate than read alone in the stacks for a few hours, but such a near-masochist approach can be conducive to getting ish done. To make the circumstances a little less grim, bring a friend and settle in your own nook (if you can snag such a hot commodity on a weeknight at Harvard). Then, confer some moral support: give each other your phones and make a pact to check Snapchat only once you’ve finished something. Whether that something is a chapter, a night’s reading, or a week’s worth of work we’ll leave up to you and your Type A/B tendencies.
Help yourself.We’re not saying you always have to go about studying the austere way. If you’re having trouble: GET HELP. Form study groups, a pset squad (hint: your most competent peers might not be your closest friends), or get a roommate to quiz you. If you’re confused, go straight to the expert source’s office hours, or check out resources like the Writing and Math Question Centers. A plus to this strategy: extra one-on-one time with that cute TF.
Finally, treat yourself.Adopting these productive habits could be the start of a beautiful new you—you who wakes up early for Balletone at Hemenway or forgoes curly fries for quinoa. Or, because you’ve been so good academically, cut corners elsewhere, say, regarding your diet or liver functioning. In other words, go you! A night at Border is in order. After all, queso and margs can drown any amount of internal suffering.

Imagine the very heart-wrenching sensation of having the show that you just sat down to binge watch fade very melodramatically from your TV set. You blink, hoping that it was just a flicker—and then, suddenly, you hear the screams across campus.
Great job, Harvard, the damn power is out.
Nearly all of Mt. Auburn street past the Lampoon is dark. The very bright streetlight recently installed in front of Adams House has been reduced to a dim flicker. Students are, remarkably, out in the streets instead of posted in front of their macroeconomics textbook, desperately p-setting away.
And yes, the final clubs are still thumping with their sub-par music. The Fly seems oblivious to the fact that Lowell towers have gone dark. Honestly, this is why you should get punched for a final club—not the networking, not the parties, but the fact that when most of Cambridge goes dark, you can trust the PSK, the Owl and the Fly to still be lit.
Part of us knew that the end of days was coming when we found out that Harvard had lost nearly $2 billion in investments this past fiscal year, but we didn’t expect it to happen so soon.

In case you’ve been living under a rock (or have been holed up in Starbucks for the evening), you’ll know that most of Harvard Yard and the River went dark sometime around midnight tonight. Students poured out into the pitch-black night, wandering listlessly now that their Thursday study plans were cut short, unsure of what to do.
Should we start drinking as if the world is ending? Wifi is down, so we can’t even Netflix and chill. Should we break out our clandestine scented candles to light our dorms?
We at Flyby, wondering what Harvard life was like pre-electricity, decided to venture out into the blackness. Here’s what we overheard during the Blackout of 2016:
“Is this how the purge starts out?”Better toss your heaviest textbooks into your bag and grab a beer bottle or two…they’re the only weapons you’ll have to defend yourself with if this is the start of the purge.
“Don’t go to bed! We’re having too much fun!”Oh, freshmen…
“Alright, I guess they’re going back in…”Spoken by a resigned HUPD officer, about Matthews residents streaming back into a still-dark building. Kids these days.
**Soulja Boy playing**Leave it to optimistic freshmen to try and turn a blackout into a rager. Unfortunately, fire trucks’ lights are not strobe lights, and some of us just want to find a place to write up our Stat 110 psets and to go to bed.
 “Fuck this, should we go to this quad?”Apparently the Quad is #lit tonight, in multiple senses of the word. Still doesn’t make it worth the trek.
“We’re going to the Kong.”Fantastic call. We’ll meet you there.
