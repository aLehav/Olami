After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, I wandered into the Center for Government and International Studies’ Knafel building to sit in on “Capitalism and its Critics,” a new graduate Government seminar offered by Professor Katrina Forrester. Drawn in by both the topic and the professor, I ignored the fact that I had done two of the assigned readings for that week — which totaled some 200 pages — and instead relied on the little Marx and Foucault I remembered from Social Studies 10 to follow along with the conversation.
The ensuing discussion was incredibly enjoyable and thought provoking. Yet by the end, I couldn’t really tell if we were still discussing capitalism — a real world economic system made up by billions of human beings who work, laugh, and cry — or an ambiguous concept whose only essential feature was some vague connection to power relations.
I tend to think that I’m not the only student who feels like this. In “A Mathematician’s Apology,” the English mathematician G.H. Hardy worried that academia might be an ivory tower, disconnected from the outside world: “I have never done anything ‘useful’. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world. […] Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is nil; and outside mathematics is it trivial anyhow.”
I don’t fully agree with this view. G.H. Hardy’s work in number theory was largely useless, that is, if you ignore the fact that number theory has allowed vendors to encrypt credit card information when selling online, leading to trillions of dollars generated through e-commerce. I’ll also still encourage you to take a philosophy class at Harvard, and not because it might help you get a better LSAT score.
Yet this critique still has value and is part of the reason I lay awake at night and stress about what I’m going to write my Social Studies thesis on. Like Hardy, I worry about how useful what I do may really be. When I do so, I’m reminded of John F. Kennedy’s ’40 famous dictum, “Ask what you can do.” That’s why, during one of my weekly trips to spend my BoardPlus on a ramen bowl at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, seeing this quote adorn the walls made me think that maybe the answer to my worries lay within this school for public policy.
The Kennedy School’s emphasis on praxis is clear as soon as you walk in. When entering one of the buildings, I looked down to see a gold disc set into the floor, with a quote from the address by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s, class of 1904, at the Harvard Tercentenary Celebration: “Harvard should train its citizens in that high Athenian sense which compels them to live life unceasingly aware that its civic significance is its most abiding.”
HKS aims to offer a reprieve from the worry that one has never done anything useful, and, in this way, its very mission sets it apart from the College.
The school’s descriptions of its four degree programs further exemplifies its practical orientation. According to the website, the Master in Public Policy is for those who have an “urge to extract answers from the clutter of real-world public problems.” The Master in Public Administration is for those with some previous professional experience who now need “the specialized skills, informed perspectives, and nuanced understanding to be an even more effective leader in solving public problems.” The Mid-Career Master in Public Administration is for those with already advanced careers who “know [they] can make a greater impact.” Finally, the Master in Public Administration and International Development provides economics-centered training to those who want to “acquire the analytical tools and global perspectives to design and implement effective solutions.”
My conversations with students at the Kennedy School showed me that students themselves notice this palpable culture of public service. Mauro Morabito, a recent MC/MPA graduate, told me that at HKS, “There is definitely a very keen interest in the public or in ways that the public good can improve.” To me, it looks like HKS offers a unique space for students to learn while always thinking about the potential impact of their education on the public sphere.
What does a school that is almost entirely focused on practicalities look like? This may be from a lack of experience, but I tend to think that taking a class on linear algebra for one semester gives you much more information than a semester course on negotiation might.
I’m not alone in feeling this way. In the past, HKS has been critiqued for a lack of academic rigor and a failure to provide anything except the Harvard name — in other words, for serving as “a country club shrouded in academia.”
Indeed, Trevor J. Levin ’19, a former Crimson editor and current MPP candidate at HKS, told me that “grades below a B minus are quite rare.”
“Most classes are curved to give everyone at least a B minus unless you don't do a major assignment or something,” he added.
Because of this lack of emphasis on GPA, Levin continued, “most of the jobs that you wind up getting, you’re gonna get through either networking” or writing one really good policy report.
But those who criticize HKS for lacking academic rigor miss the point. HKS classes aren’t trying to be academic, in a conventional sense of the word. Instead, they’re focused on teaching skills.
“This is quite special, and probably what HKS is most known for,” Morabito told me. “The so-called soft skills — so, advocacy and negotiation, public speaking, leadership, persuasion.”
Courses based on these skills, Morabito added, are “experiential courses, and you have a lot of learning by doing and simulations.”
Some students see these types of courses as the most valuable at HKS. Shulin Jiang, an MPA candidate, told me, “If I could, I would choose classes with more simulations, like the negotiation classes.” To me, it seems that by interacting amidst these simulations, students learn from the professional experiences they each bring to the table.
Some may see the College as presenting the opposite model of education as HKS. Instead of skills based learning, we learn information. Our thousands of pages of readings push us to internalize loads of knowledge, which we are free — but not necessarily taught to — apply in our real lives.
This view of the College’s educational model presents a problem, though. Not only does it risk detaching students from the real world, it leaves unanswered the question: What value is there in a Harvard education?
In “Good Will Hunting,” Matt Damon’s character confronts a Harvard student and tells him that one of the few certainties in life that he’ll one day discover is the fact that the student “dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education [he] could’ve picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library.”
Damon misses the point, though. He’s right that at many institutions of higher learning, the actual knowledge gained could have easily been accessed somewhere else. However, the value of these institutions is that they serve as a space in which very motivated students can gather and learn from one another.
At the College, we hesitate to admit this. The idea that our courses aren’t actually the most important part of our education may leave a bitter taste in our mouths.
HKS, however, does not shy away from this reality. The Kennedy School realizes that its value lies in its ability to cultivate practical skills, a mission it carries out by gathering an incredibly diverse group of people with substantive professional experience into one classroom.
Each of the school’s four degree programs attract students at different stages in their career. The result of this, Morabito told me, is that “everybody can get something out of this, but specifically for the younger cohorts that might not have encountered this before in their professional lives.” To me, it seems that this diversity in age leads to an environment in which the young, more idealistic students with an appetite for change exchange knowledge with the older, more pragmatic students with professional experience and who may have actually changed the world.
HKS recognizes that any education they can offer pales in comparison to the education students will receive simply from interacting with each other. I imagine that’s why many professors seem to emphasize the interactions, constructing classes around simulations that bring out the most from those interactions.
Likewise, the professors are there because of the benefits students get from interacting with them, not because of any special ability they have in imparting information to students. As the MPA website states, faculty are meant to “share significant, real-world experience with you.”
We should take note of this at the College. We have the theoretical education, but to some extent, we also have the practical education that HKS offers. We may not have structured simulations forcing us to critically engage with each other, but we do have an incredibly diverse student body and an open “play” environment in which we can interact. This has led to the creation of a college newspaper that has produced more than 40 Pulitzer Prize winners, a multimillion dollar business, and the oldest theatrical organization in the nation.
The practical education that HKS offers and that some undergraduates so desperately crave when we’re learning theory in a lecture hall is there —we just have to take advantage of it. Like the poet Walt Whitman’s learn’d astronomer, when we become tired and sick of the charts and diagrams, we must look up in perfect silence at the stars.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors,” Albert Einstein professed to students at the California Institute of Technology in a 1931 speech. “Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.”
Almost a century later, most scientists carry out research according to this standard — but some do, in fact, forget his warning.
Scientists have a unique power to unveil the deepest truths about our physical and natural world. They hold up mirrors to our societies and challenge the status quo of accepted thought. The profession holds immense beauty and influence, but also immense responsibility. In the world of academic research, the only goal should be to obtain truth — we should never let honesty fall second to the pursuit of personal gain.
A recent high-profile integrity case in scientific misconduct has struck a tension with this standard. Just over three weeks ago, The Crimson reported that neuroscientist and Stanford President Marc T. Tessier-Lavigne will be investigated by a team of top researchers in his field, including former Harvard provost Steven E. Hyman.
Tessier-Lavigne is accused of co-authoring papers with doctored images and figures spanning multiple years, including one in the journal Cell and two in Science. According to the Stanford Daily’s Nov. 2022 reporting, Stanford claimed that Tessier-Lavigne had attempted to correct any research misconduct after he was first informed of the accusations in 2015 and that the images did not affect the papers’ findings. However, some experts argue that the image manipulation of which Tessier-Lavigne is accused suggests intent to mislead readers — which, if true, would constitute a severe act of academic wrongdoing.
Researchers gain a lot with each successful publication, including increased funding and citations that boost their reputation and status. For honest research findings, such accolades are well-deserved; scientific research is a laborious and intensely challenging process. Rewarding notable scientific progress through publication and career advancement is crucial to advance knowledge. However, this system also creates significant institutional pressure on academics to produce consistent, impactful results.
As such, there exists a rare but exceedingly damaging type of academic who will falsify findings for personal gain during their career, putting self-interest over truth — at a high cost to the greater scientific community. If Tessier-Lavigne is found guilty of scientific misconduct, his current status as the president of a prestigious university and a renowned scholar could be partially attributed to obstructions of truth. Any mishandling of misconduct cases such as this could have immeasurable consequences, the most concerning being a jeopardization of public trust in science.
In a time where public skepticism of scientists is growing, it could not be more vital for every scientist to uphold integrity. This is especially true for high-profile scientists and researchers in positions of authority. In December 2021, only 29 percent of surveyed adults in the United States had a “great deal of confidence in medical scientists to act in the best interests of the public,” declining approximately 10 percentage points compared to the prior year — a trend seen across all scientists, not just those in medical research. Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, climate change denialism, and pandemic skepticism are all examples of this trend, with serious consequences for public health and policy. Every researcher must prioritize public trust in science as a core foundation to their work; failures of integrity only further threaten public confidence.
Training in scientific integrity must be strengthened, both by teaching young scientists to maintain credible research practices and by training all researchers to identify and report scientific misconduct.
For the concerned reader, you should know that it is not easy for falsified data to make it to a published journal in the first place. Every published paper, including each paper co-authored by Tessier-Lavigne that is currently under fire, is peer-reviewed by experts, who may provide extensive feedback, requests for revision, or even full rejection.
However, it is still possible for some integrity cases to fall through the cracks, especially if the submitting authors are well-respected in their field. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have already been shown as having potential to assist peer review; these technologies could be further employed in practice to review data and flag potential figure manipulation during the review process.
Yet no matter what changes are made to the review process, it will always be the responsibility of publishing scientists to uphold truth and honesty in their work. To those of my peers who dream of chasing scientific discovery, remember that integrity should be valued above all else.
Even to those who do not envision a career in traditional scientific research, you too bear equal responsibility to work honestly. These principles are needed in everyday life, in every job you will ever hold, and in every sector of our society. Anyone who has the power to inform has the equal power to deceive. I ask that you wield your influence with the sole intention of illuminating the truths about our beautifully complex world, for a purpose greater than yourself alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
That a mental crisis escalated to a chase by at least four police officers and ended up in the death of an individual is heartbreaking, to say the least. Even as the details surrounding Sayed Faisal’s fatal encounter with Cambridge Police Department officers on Jan. 4 are yet to be uncovered, one thing remains clear: The system failed Faisal.
Sayed Faisal, an only child of Bangladeshi immigrants, was a computer engineering student at the University of Massachusetts Boston who hoped to pursue a career creating video games. Faisal was a beloved member of his community and will be dearly missed. We cannot imagine the loss and pain his family and friends must feel at this time. We offer our deepest condolences to his loved ones as they grieve.
This was the first fatal shooting by Cambridge police in over 20 years, but that figure does not offer comfort, nor does it warrant a pat on the back. Rather, it forces us to contend with some uncomfortable truths regarding failures of proactivity and accountability in the law enforcement system.
The death of Sayed Faisal serves as a reminder of a hardly revelatory fact: that police officers are not equipped to handle mental health emergencies. According to a report from the Treatment Advocacy Center, at least one in four fatal police encounters leads to the death of individuals with severe mental illness, making them 16 times more likely to die from a police encounter compared to other civilians when approached by the police. It is deeply concerning that encounters between police officers and individuals experiencing mental health crises recurrently end up in the death of a civilian.
It bears repeating: Sayed Faisal should have received help, not a bullet.
This incident underscores the need for urgent and comprehensive reform in how law enforcement handles mental health crises. The City of Cambridge ought to expedite its rollout of resources for non-violent 911 calls. As we’ve opined in the past, funding for programs such as the Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team and the Cambridge Department of Community Safety, which are each viable alternatives for emergency response, should be a priority for the Cambridge City Council.
By partnering with Harvard researchers and other experts in the field, the City of Cambridge can adopt best practices to initiate new systems, encourage their use, and generously scale funding as necessary. Given that HEART’s call volume has reportedly almost tripled since Faisal’s shooting, the cost of delaying the implementation and support of such alternative emergency response programs may well be denominated in lives.
Beyond restructuring the law enforcement system to take a more proactive approach to crisis management, securing accountability for police actions is of the utmost importance. Transparency in policing is of even greater concern given that this editorial comes in the wake of not only Faisal’s shooting, but also Tyre Nichols’s tragic death at the hands of Memphis police officers. The fact that there is limited public information on the specific circumstances surrounding Faisal’s death multiple weeks into the investigation is appalling — something only aided by a lack of body camera footage from the incident.
That a city as progressive as Cambridge lacks a basic mechanism of accountability as body cameras is difficult to comprehend. We call on the City of Cambridge to implement body cameras immediately for Cambridge Police Department officers — addressing in particular City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, who was the only member in a recent Council session to oppose this measure.
Our call comes not because we believe that body cameras will serve as the end-all, be-all solution to police violence — if anything, the current research has shown mixed reviews on the impact of body cameras on police violence — but out of an understanding that in some cases of police brutality, body camera footage may sometimes be the only source of justice for victims’ families. Such footage allows the public to see what otherwise could have been concealed, and is thus potentially critical to holding officers accountable.
The implementation of body cameras, however, should not be a carte blanche for the invasion of privacy through technological means. Common sense privacy restrictions, such as not allowing mass facial recognition and surveillance, should be put in place to ensure the protection of individuals.
Sayed Faisal’s death should not have occurred for lack of an empathetic emergency response infrastructure; nor should justice for his killing be delayed by a lack of police accountability mechanisms. Ultimately, when we get to the reactive, we have already failed at the level of the proactive. We must work to ensure that individuals do not continue to pay for mental health crises with their lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the Feb. 6 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, members of the Harvard College Turkish Student Association and Harvard Society of Arab Students organized fundraisers to raise money for victims, collectively amassing more than $30,000 in donations.
As of Thursday, more than 20,000 people in Turkey and Syria have died, tens of thousands are injured, and hundreds of thousands are homeless due to the magnitude 7.8 earthquake — one of the deadliest in the past two decades. Freezing temperatures, power outages, and blocked roads have stalled aid and rescue efforts, spurring fundraisers from campus organizations.
Former TSA Co-President Ratip “Emin” Berker ’22-’23 described fundraising efforts — which were intended to “remove the ambiguity” around where or how to donate — as “overwhelmingly good.”
Berker said members of the TSA publicized the fundraiser on social media and tabled outside the Science Center, expecting to raise at most $2,000. Instead, the group raised more than $29,000 in less than 24 hours from more than 1,100 donors.
“We wanted to make it easier for people to contribute and not have to think about what organization to go to because chances are, your average Harvard student is not very well-informed about which NGOs operate in Turkey, which one of them are more reliable, which one of them are helpful,” Berker said.
“Raising money is something, but it’s not like these people will need it just for this weekend,” Berker added. “It’s also important to raise awareness on a longer-term scale, so that help continues going there.”
SAS President Sam M. Saba ’23 said the organization decided to organize a fundraiser due to the “devastation” the earthquake caused.
Assma Alrefai ’25, SAS social co-chair, said she believes SAS is the only campus organization fundraising to help Syria and other affected neighboring countries. Alrefair said she appreciated other student groups helping their cause by “posting on their Instagram page and pubbing through their mailing lists.”
“That’s what we’re trying to count on — just the support from students,” she said.
SAS has raised $5,000 of the group’s $15,000 goal. Organizers said a Harvard alum plans to match donations one-to-one.
Some members of TSA and SAS said they initially did not realize the extent of the destruction caused by the earthquake.
Berker, who was in Turkey until the night of Feb. 5, said that the earthquakes occurred an hour after his flight landed in Boston. He said that he heard the news from a blockmate and “didn’t know how to react.”
“It took me a while to grasp the magnitude of it because earthquakes do happen, all in smaller magnitudes,” Berker said. “Initially, I thought, ‘Oh, I hope everyone’s safe.’ But I think as more and more info came in, I realized, ‘Okay, it’s not just something small. It’s quite big.’”
TSA co-president Naz Yanik ’25 said she found out about the earthquake on Twitter and initially “underestimated its effect.”
“I went to sleep around 11 p.m. — I didn’t really know,” Yanik said. “Then I woke up today, I realized its magnitude and its effects very much since many of my friends lost their families and parents.”
However, Yanik also said that many people on campus — including some of her friends — did not know about the earthquake.
“Maybe an earthquake sounds like ‘Oh, it happened and people were shocked or people were sad,’” Yanik said. “But the thing is, a lot of people are still under the rubble and they are waiting to be found.”
While Saba recognized that students might feel “skeptical” about sending money to organizations outside of the United States, Saba said SAS is working with an organization established by a Harvard graduate student, allowing SAS to keep in direct contact with the organization.
“The United States dollar goes much further in the region than it does here,” Saba said. “So even a couple of U.S. dollars can feed families for days.”
“We really want everyone — even as small of a donation as you can make — to donate because it really can make a difference,” Saba added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in the 2000s, Utkarsh Saxena wondered if he would ever “belong and be accepted” as a queer man in India.
Saxena, who earned a Master of Laws from Harvard Law School in 2014 and a Master in Public Administration in International Developmentfrom Harvard Kennedy School in 2020, said he faced “a lot of phobia” around his identity.
Now, Saxena is petitioning the Supreme Court of India to legalize same-sex marriage.
“I didn’t think that so quickly, I could even dream of petitioning the court and seeking the right to get married and having kids,” Saxena said. “If this goes well, that could actually be possible, which would have been unfathomable.”
Saxena met his partner, Ananya Kotia, when they were undergraduates at Hansraj College of the University of Delhi. Fifteen years later, the couple decided they were ready to get married, petitioning directly to the Supreme Court of India in December 2022 for the legalization of same-sex marriage.
The case was admitted for a hearing on Jan. 6, and it will be considered together with three similar petitions for additional hearings in March.
Saxena will appear in court alongside several other lawyers to present the case. He has clerked on the Supreme Court of India and has litigated other cases before the highest court, including those on constitutional law.
“I’ve been legally also observing the change in the court, besides experiencing it emotionally and socially,” Saxena said. “For all those reasons, I thought it was important now to further advance the cause of LGBTQ rights.”
In India, marriage and divorce have traditionally been categorized as family laws and regulated by religious institutions specific to Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and other faiths. Saxena and Kotia’s petition will instead challenge the Special Marriage Act, a secular law that does not recognize same-sex marriage.
Jeffrey A. Redding, a professor at Melbourne Law School whose research focuses on comparative law and religion, said he thinks the petitions are “a calculated gamble” because they focus on secular law.
“Same-sex marriage advocates have given the Supreme Court a way to implement same-sex marriage in India without fully inflaming the Hindu nationalist government with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the center — and also political, social, and cultural actors from all the other religious communities in India,” Redding said.
In recent years, the country has expanded rights for those who identify as LGBTQ+.
In 2014, India recognized non-binary or transgender identities as a “third gender.” Four years later, the country decriminalized same-sex marriage, which was seen as a landmark victory for LGBTQ+ rights activists.
Akshat Agarwal, who holds law degrees from Yale Law School and the National Law School of India University, said he believes the petitioners have “a really strong case” from a constitutional perspective.
“The court has already said multiple times that we believe in equality, we believe that sexual orientation discrimination should not happen,” said Agarwal, who is currently pursuing a JSD at Yale Law School. “But it really also depends on what the government argues now because we don’t know what position the government of India is going to take before the Supreme Court.”
Agarwal said an additional challenge for India is the limited recognition of LGTBQ+ rights at the local level. Currently, India’s inheritance and common property laws do not consider LGBTQ+ couples. Same-sex couples are also prohibited from having children with the help of an Indian surrogate mother.
“There are reasons that the Supreme Court of India would want to cement or buttress its image as a human-rights-defending institution and grant the right to same-sex marriage,” Redding said. “The Supreme Court would be doing so in a social, cultural, and political context, which is largely hostile to open expressions of gay and lesbian identity and same-sex marriage.”
Saxena and Kotia said they considered moving to another country where they would be able to start a family. Still, they eventually decided against it because of their interest in public service and a decision to “dedicate their professional careers” to their home country.
“I’m glad we decided the way we did because this is how constitutional battles and battles for civil rights are. There are ups and downs,” Saxena said. “As long as you believe that the long arc of change is bending in favor of progress, you keep at it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The value of fossil fuel investments in Harvard’s endowment ticked up during fiscal year 2022 as energy prices soared, according to a Harvard Management Company report released Thursday.
Harvard, which announced in fall 2021 that it would allow its remaining positions in the fossil fuel sector to expire, has an array of investments in external private equity funds with holdings in the industry. The school has pledged to discontinue such investments once its legal obligations are fulfilled. In the Thursday report, HMC — which manages Harvard’s endowment — attributed its investment gains in fossil fuel companies to global market conditions.
“The net year-over-year increase in fossil fuel exposure was due entirely to the appreciation of HMC’s existing assets,” the report states. “The energy sector was the highest performing sector in the S&P 500 during the fiscal year driven by higher commodity prices. This led to a significant markup of private assets in the sector.”
Fossil fuel investments now account for more than 2 percent of Harvard’s $50.9 billion endowment, up slightly from less than 2 percent at the end of fiscal year 2021. Harvard’s overall endowment value decreased by $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2022, marking the first year of negative returns since 2016.
Though the value of its fossil fuel holdings increased during the past fiscal year, HMC is on track to expand its investments in climate transition solutions in the coming years, according to the report. At the end of fiscal year 2022, HMC’s investments in climate solutions amounted to less than 1 percent of the endowment’s value — a figure the company expects to rise in the coming years.
“Should the current investment trends continue as expected, the endowment’s exposure to climate transition solutions will exceed those in fossil fuel related investments in the next few years,” the report states. “Having these curves cross will cause the portfolio’s net exposure to climate transition solutions to become positive and remain so into the future. This result will be highly dependent on the ongoing valuation of commodities, as demonstrated by fiscal year 2022 results.”
The report is part of the Harvard Management Company’s work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with its investment portfolio to net-zero by 2050, a goal the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — set for the endowment in 2020. As part of its commitment, HMC releases a report each February detailing its progress towards the net-zero goal.
Unlike other organizations that have made net-zero commitments, much of Harvard’s endowment is invested in private equity and hedge funds, an investment approach that makes it challenging to obtain an accurate measurement of greenhouse gas emissions in its portfolio, according to HMC.
“HMC has partnered with third-party data providers to develop a framework for calculating portfolio carbon metrics and estimating emissions,” the report states. “Additionally, HMC is engaging with its external managers to increase the reporting of direct emissions for portfolio assets and other climate-related information.”
HMC expects to report a “baseline emissions measurement for the endowment” as soon as next year, according to the report.
The initial estimate will include Scope 1 and 2 emissions of companies in HMC’s investment portfolio, defined as an organization’s direct greenhouse gas emissions and emissions coming from energy purchases. Notably, the estimate will not include Scope 3 emissions, which encompass all other indirect emissions in a company’s chain of production.
Last July, HMC Chief Compliance Officer Kathryn I. Murtagh wrote a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission in support of a proposed requirement that public companies disclose Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but advocated against mandating Scope 3 emissions disclosures — citing difficulties corporations face in obtaining the requisite data.
The report also confirmed that HMC achieved carbon neutrality for its facilities and operations in fiscal year 2022 for the first time, a milestone the company announced it expected to achieve in its climate report last year.
HMC’s strategy to lower the endowment’s greenhouse gas emissions also includes engaging with companies via shareholder proxy voting. The report stated that at least 215 shareholder proposals addressing climate change were submitted, a sharp increase from the 84 in proxy voting season 2021. Of these 215 proposals, at least 103 were approved by April 2022.
Looking towards the future, the report states that HMC does not expect “linear” progress towards its net-zero goal, citing the interplay between the short term and long term results of investments to play into their strategy going forward.
“As a long-term investor, HMC will weigh investments’ short-term emissions against their potential to reduce emissions over the medium to long term,” the report states. “HMC is committed to meeting its net zero pledge and will continually seek opportunities to enhance knowledge of portfolio transition planning, carbon accounting standards for financed emissions, and best practices in disclosure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Workers at Harvard and around the Square say they continue to face difficulties in their daily commutes to Cambridge due to ongoing slow zones, increased wait times, and diversions on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Red Line.
In May 2022, the Federal Transit Administration opened a safety investigation into the state of the MBTA — an action taken only once before. The investigation concluded in August, with an order for the agency to address dozens of problems touching almost every aspect of its operations.
Last year, safety issues on the MBTA made headlines, including a death on the Red Line and a fire on the Orange Line as it crossed the Mystic River, which caused a passenger to jump to safety into the water below.
In mid-June, though the investigation had not concluded, the FTA ordered the MBTA to address safety problems. Service has since been slashed on some lines for repairs, including a monthlong shutdown of the Orange Line and other diversions and station closures.
After seven months of repairs, services throughout the MBTA — including on the Red Line — have not yet returned to normal. Slow zones — stretches of train track where cars must slow down because of structural deficiencies — have increased, resulting in an uptick in travel times between stations.
Workers commuting from the Greater Boston area to the Harvard station expressed frustration over the renewed trials of taking the T, saying delays and unpredictibility have resulted in late arrivals to work, decreased time with family, and changes to morning routines.
Cassie Hernandez, a staff member at the Harvard Mail Center, said that despite the months of work, “it seems like nothing’s really getting fixed.”
“No matter what time I get to the train in the morning, I always get here at the same time: around 8:10,” Hernandez said.
“Even if I leave my house earlier, I feel like I can never get a good time where I’ll get there at 8 o’clock, when I’m supposed to be there,” she added.
Julia A. Trogani, visitor services and shop supervisor for the Harvard Art Museums, described her commute as a balancing act. After work, she rides the Red Line for one stop from Harvard to Porter Square in order to transfer to the commuter rail, which comes once an hour.
“Sometimes I’m walking up or running up the stairs, and it’s just pulling away, and it’s just that close,” she said. “It does significantly change my day, the difference of 30 seconds.”
According to Transit Matters, a Boston-based public transit advocacy group that tracks the MBTA’s performance, the average wait for a northbound train from Harvard station has increased by almost 50 percent from February of last year. In February, the Red Line’s total slow zone delay time from one end of the line to the other was 24 minutes.
Hernandez, the Harvard Mail Center staff member, said that the impact on workers can be trying.
“It’s tough,” said Hernandez, who takes the Red Line 12 stops from Quincy Center to Harvard. “I would like to get home earlier. I have kids.”
Chase Culler, a bookseller at the Coop and lecturer at Boston University, said the Red Line has played a role in making him late for work “maybe once or twice a week now.”
“I used to plan it out pretty perfectly,” he said. “Time has not adjusted — I haven’t adjusted for the Red Line. Something has changed.”
In an emailed statement, MBTA spokesperson Lisa Battiston did not provide a timeframe for the return to normal service.
“To improve track conditions, MBTA crews continue to work nights and weekends on the Red Line. Rail replacement and other track maintenance work will continue this month during overnight hours while the MBTA works to schedule more weekend diversions to give crews more access to the right of way,” she wrote.
“The MBTA appreciates its customers’ patience while crews work to make the improvements necessary to allow trains to travel at faster speeds,” she added.
Adding to existing Red Line troubles, a car crashed into the Alewife station garage on Saturday, resulting in a weeklong closure and forcing shuttle bus service between the Alewife and Davis stations.
Still, Culler said he is sympathetic to the T’s plight.
“I don’t envy any person who is assigned to fix the Red Line the same way they fixed the Orange Line.”

In 2011, Cambridge Public Schools adopted the Innovation Agenda — a controversial policy which promised to overhaul Cambridge’s elementary school system and “eliminate achievement gaps.”
Before the implementation of the Innovation Agenda, the district employed the JK-8 model of education. But as specific elementary schools began to develop advanced academic tracks or specialized curriculums, however, teachers grew concerned about unequal achievement across the district.
Cambridge Public Schools officials unveiled the Innovation Agenda as a “design for excellence” to address inequities in the middle school experience, efficiently utilize CPS resources, and better prepare students to enter Cambridge Rindge and Latin School — the city’s only full public high school.
“The Innovation Agenda is an ambitious plan that will propel Cambridge Public Schools into the 21st century, and prepare all our students for life in a world we cannot fully imagine today,” the 2011 Innovation Agenda implementation plan reads. “The Innovation Agenda is a design for excellent education rather than adequate education—merging Cambridge Public Schools’ twin goals of academic excellence and social justice.”
The Innovation Agenda reorganized Cambridge public schools, creating new middle schools within existing buildings and moving away from the K-8 model.
A decade later, some Cambridge parents are left wondering what happened to the Innovation Agenda. The once-controversial, now-forgotten policy, they say, must be reviewed.
Jean Cummings, a reporter for Cambridge Day who covered the adoption of the Innovation Agenda, said many teachers “diametrically opposed” advanced academic tracks because of disparate results across schools.
“They used to say you could tell by the color of the classroom whether it is advanced learning or not,” she said. “By separating people and telling them ‘you’re advanced, and you’re not,’ you’re condemning the other kids to thinking they’re second class.”
Cummings said inequities across the district were primarily in the type of curriculum and quality of teachers in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grade. As a result, students who weren’t enrolled in the advanced curriculum left for private or charter schools, depressing district enrollment.
“It was an ongoing problem — from this administration’s point of view — that some schools seemed healthy and were humming along, and there was high satisfaction from families and students and teachers, and in other schools, the middle school just started caving in on itself,” she said.
As concerns began to multiply, the district hired renowned Newton superintendent Jeffrey M. Young in April 2009.
Two years into his new position, Young proposed the Innovation Agenda, aiming to close achievement gaps by “eliminating the opportunity gaps that have existed in Cambridge for decades.” The plan specifically promised high average growth in English and Math proficiency and a 92 percent increase in reenrollment for students in sixth and seventh grade.
While school committee members thought the policy was “best for the community,” it ultimately divided Cambridge, according to Cummings.
“People had arguments in the street, people were screaming at each other,” she said.
City Council member Patricia M. Nolan ’80, who voted for the Innovation Agenda as a member of the school committee, said she believes that it is “incumbent” for officials to review the policy and its impact.
“My main concern is that we continue to see disparate achievement,” she added. “We didn’t meet those outcomes, but then nothing ever happened.”
According to publicly available data, enrollment numbers among middle schoolers have remained below those of K-5 and high school students each year since the Innovation Agenda’s adoption.
Though the Innovation Agenda promised growth in academic improvement for sixth through eighth grade students, math exam scores have consistently been below the target percentile in recent years.
“Ten years later, every single kid in the district started kindergarten two years after the Innovation Agenda passed, and yet we still have very uneven achievement across the four middle schools,” Nolan said.
Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Martin R. West, who has studied the effects of K-8 versus middle school education models on students’ academic performance, said there’s “probably not one optimal grade configuration for every school system.”
West’s 2012 study of Florida public schools found that in the middle school system, students’ academic performance was lower. Still, this education model can reduce enrollment disparities and enhance diversity by bridging students from different neighborhoods, according to West.
West added there are many factors that can go into the decision to change a school system’s grade configuration.
“Districts like Cambridge that are making decisions about grade configuration do need to be aware of the fact that the transition to a stand-alone middle school appears to be very difficult for many students and that the middle school environment is one that seems challenging for educators to get right,” he said.
CPS seniors and school committee student representatives Grace Clemente and Adelina R. Escamilla-Salomon were among the few students who did not experience the K-5 model, instead spending kindergarten through eighth grade at Amigos School because of its dual-language immersion program.
The K-8 school system allowed for “really strong connections,” according to Clemente. Small classroom sizes also facilitated “a lot more opportunity for individualized learning,” she said.
“There were enough teachers to accommodate all those students,” Clemente added.
Escamilla-Salomon said students in the K-5 system benefit from an earlier transition to middle school, which prepares them for the eventual transition to high school.
Spending time in a smaller environment until eighth grade made it “a little bit of a bigger transition to high school,” Escamilla-Salomon added.
Victoria L. Greer, CPS superintendent and former middle school teacher, said though “each and every community is different,” the middle school system is important for student development.
Students in middle schools are “in different places in their social development as well as their academic development” than their elementary and high school counterparts, she said.
“The middle is a really unique place for young people,” Greer added.
According to Greer, the district is currently developing audit plans for CPS programs, which will be available by the end of the 2022-2023 school year.
“For our district it is a best practice for us to ensure that we’re doing ongoing audits and reviews of our programs, our services, and our service deliveries,” she said. “Depending on our research questions, it will determine whether we can look into the Innovation Agenda in the 2023-2024 school year, or will it be the 2024-2025 school year?”
Eric A. Weinberger — a parent of a public school student and a vocal supporter of an Innovation Agenda audit — wrote in an emailed statement that CPS is experiencing a “kind of amnesia” for not considering an audit of the policy until now.
“Here is the chance for Cambridge to do for the country, or U.S. public education, what Superintendent Young didn’t draw on for his own proposal — what data and outcomes emerge in a middle-school system that produce true equity and social justice?” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even after Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 announced plans to reform the Boston Planning and Development Agency on Jan. 25, Allston advocates continue to express skepticism over the proposed changes.
The BPDA has been criticized for a perceived partiality to developers over neighborhood residents. Critics, including Wu, have said the BPDA’s broad urban renewal powers bypass public accountability. Shortly after its inception in 1957, the BPDA demolished two neighborhoods in a controversial campaign of urban renewal.
During her mayoral campaign, Wu promised to abolish the BPDA, claiming it was “one of the drivers of almost every inequity that we see across the city.”
Wu revealed plans during her January State of the City Address to transfer the BPDA’s planning powers into a new City Planning and Design Department directly under the oversight of the city government.
Later that week, Wu filed a home rule petition to end the BPDA’s ability to seize properties deemed “blighted” under the mandate of urban renewal. If passed by the City Council, the petition will be submitted to the State Legislature for approval.
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston neighborhood advocate, said although Wu’s plan accounts for the “structural problems” with the BPDA, a change in culture is also needed.
“Will a new organization make different decisions?” Mattison said. “Depends on the people in those positions and in the leadership.”
In an effort to rebrand the agency, former mayor Marty J. Walsh renamed it from the Boston Redevelopment Agency, which many residents associated with controversial urban renewal projects, among other reforms.
Still, housing advocates — including Wu — say the changes did not substantively alter the institution itself.
Some residents said Wu must convince them that her new reforms will bring greater voice and influence to locals.
“Just having a planning department that makes nice plans is not sufficient,” Mattison said. “It takes follow through, and consensus building, and a whole bunch of other things.”
Harvard-Allston Task Force member and Allston resident Bruce E. Houghton also said he is uncertain about the reforms’ potential.
“I don’t want to speculate on whether it will be successful, or what the outcome will be, because I don’t think anybody knows, including Mayor Wu,” he said.
“The community is being asked to put on blinders and be myopic about what a regional development will look like,” Houghton added.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association, expressed the need for alternative approaches to development.
“There’s a big need for a greater planning effort — a wider holistic planning effort,” D’Isidoro said.
In late January, D’Isidoro was appointed as a member of the city’s Article 80 steering committee, which will review Boston’s zoning code and development process for large building projects.
According to D’Isidoro, residents’ worries over development are rooted in a lack of control over the city’s landscape and a fear of large changes in their neighborhoods. To combat these concerns, he said he believes the city should ensure residents are involved in the planning and development process.
“At least giving people an opportunity to take part and get involved, and what have you, is extremely important,” D’Isidoro said.
“The more you engage the community and the more community residents feel they're a part of the process, that helps to diminish resistance to what's going on,” he added.
Despite apprehension, Houghton said he is hopeful about future planning and development initiatives in Boston.
“There's an acknowledgement that what's ‘working’ isn't working and I think that's the first step,” Houghton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Allston-Brighton’s Sound Museum prepares to close in late February, neighborhood musicians are seeking alternative rehearsal spaces.
The Sound Museum was first established in the South End by William Desmond to provide affordable spaces for area musicians, according to the business’s website. The museum has operated out of its Allston-Brighton location for 32 years, providing musicians a place where “they can rock as hard as they want to.”
Biotech real estate investor IQHQ purchased the Sound Museum’s building at 155 North Beacon St. in 2021 for $50 million. After announcing plans to demolish the building to develop a new research complex, IQHQ offered to assist the museum’s relocation — though in the time since, plans have remained in limbo.
On Dec. 17, 2022, tenants of the Sound Museum were notified of its closure. Now, organizations have stepped in to help area musicians find alternative rehearsal spaces, and have advocated on behalf of artists facing displacement across Boston.
Artists at Humphreys Street Studios created the #ARTSTAYSHERE Coalition to support local artists and protect neighborhood arts spaces. Since then, they have expanded to helping artists across the Boston area, including Allston-Brighton musicians currently facing the closure of the Sound Museum.
Though initial plans for a relocation of the Sound Museum to West Roxbury fell through, IQHQ committed in January to donating a building at 290 North Beacon St. to Boston as a permanent rehearsal space for artists. In the interim, artists will be able to use a “swing space” in Dorchester, according to a press release from the office of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07.
Ami Bennitt, a volunteer for the #ARTSTAYSHERE Coalition and an advocate for the arts, said artists across the Boston area face anxiety and difficulty amid the closure of creative spaces.
“All of the artists that we work with — whether musicians, creative small businesses, or visual artists — everyone is devastated and really upset and really anxious, ” she said.
Bennitt added that the loss of affordable art spaces has created a greater financial barrier to creation.
“What you would find if you talked with other cities is that there’s also not enough affordable artists’ workspaces,” she said.
In a Wednesday public forum hosted by the coalition, advocates gathered to discuss artist displacement, while artists from across the Boston area spoke about their local situations.
Jim Healey, a current tenant of the Sound Museum, said he is pleased the city is working to secure spaces for artists, calling Allston-Brighton the “epicenter” of the city’s music scene.
Ethan Dussault, head engineer and co-operator of New Alliance Audio, said it was “heartening” seeing people at the forum working together on the issue.
Dussault, a member of #ARTSTAYSHERE, said he is excited to be helping artists. “I’m thrilled to be a part of the coalition and assisting in any way I can to preserve and prevent arts and cultural displacement from the area.”
Local officials have indicated they will continue to work to support Boston area artists. Somerville, Boston, and Cambridge announced on Tuesday their plans to join with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council on a project to protect the area’s existing art spaces and promote the creation of new ones.
Despite the difficulties that artists expressed in the forum, Bennett highlighted the number of people working together to help the city’s artists.
“The good news is that we have a bunch of people here tonight trying to help and who are working behind the scenes,” Bennitt said.

Harvard Undergraduate Workers Union publicly launched late last month in an effort to unionize undergraduate student employees on campus.
The University’s graduate student union represents graduate student employees and undergraduates who work as teaching fellows, teaching assistants, and course assistants, but other undergraduate employees are currently without union representation.
In late January, the group began postering outside classrooms to advertise weekly Sunday meetings from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. in Sever Hall. On Feb. 2, HUWU launched its official Twitter account.
“No matter what you do outside of work, if you work, you deserve protections, and that includes undergrads,” said Benjamin B. Roberts ’23, an HUWU organizer.
The movement hopes to gain official union recognition in order to bargain with Harvard for a contract that would guarantee higher wages, more consistent hours, and increased communication from employers.
Undergraduate workers are limited to working for up to 20 hours during school terms, but they can log up to 40 hours a week during breaks. The base pay for undergraduate student workers is $15 per hour, which is the minimum wage in Massachusetts.
The idea for the initiative originated in the Student Labor Action Movement, according to HUWU organizers Syd D. Sanders ’24 and Olivia G. Pasquerella ’26, but HUWU became an independent movement as organizers began preparing in fall 2022.
HUWU’s start also coincides with the launch of Harvard Academic Workers-United Automobile Workers, which started a card drive to form a non-tenure-track faculty union Monday.
Workers who want to form a union can sign authorization cards to prompt either a union election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board or voluntary union recognition by Harvard.
Unlike the non-tenure-track faculty union drive, HUWU has not begun their card campaign for official union recognition. Instead, Sanders said, the group is currently focused on publicizing the unionization effort before starting an official card drive in order to better reach undergraduates who are dispersed and often work in isolated jobs.
“The only way that you can build a union is if you have the support and the consent of the workers that are in those workplaces,” Pasquerella said. “It’s just very important that we get the word out as much as possible.”
The group is currently reaching out to students to assess their priorities, according to Roberts.
“We’ve been working on talking to different students and figuring out what they need, what’s hard in the workplace, basically what kind of protections we would be fighting for,” Roberts said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the formation of HUWU.
HUWU leaders have also been meeting with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and HAW-UAW.
“They have a lot of expertise that they can give,” Pasquerella said. “That’s been one of the most helpful parts of trying to get this started is asking people who have done it already.”
In addition, HUWU organizers met with undergraduate organizers at Grinnell College and Kenyon College. Grinnell was the first college in the U.S. to fully unionize its undergraduate workers in April 2022. Kenyon College undergraduates are currently attempting to unionize.
Keir M. Hichens, a graduate of Grinnell College and former president of the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers, said there is currently a “new wave” of undergraduate union activity.
HUWU plans to begin their card drive soon, according to Sanders.
“Something is in the air,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a crowd of just 105 people on a Wednesday night, Harvard men’s volleyball played through one of their smallest home game attendances so far this season – but certainly not the least exciting. The team came into their match against Merrimack under the weight of a two-game losing streak and emerged victorious – in more ways than one.
Following last season’s loss in the 2022 Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA) tournament semifinals, Harvard (4-4) entered the season with optimistic prospects, as the team bore a unique combination of new talent and tournament-seasoned core. Yet, early-season games have posted mixed results for the Crimson, as it settled into a game pattern of ‘sweep or be swept.’
Luckily for Harvard, Wednesday’s match against Merrimack (5-4) looked to be the former, though not without its moments. While Harvard entered the game having lost its two most recent matches against Daemen (5-1) and McKendree (5-2), Merrimack was rolling off a five-game win streak –  and hungry for a sixth.
Harvard started hot into the first set, grabbing the first few early points to bring the team into an early lead. Merrimack’s attempts to answer back left both teams evenly matched for a tense back-and-forth until a serving streak from first-year outside hitter Zach Berty allowed Crimson to break away with the momentum.
Head coach Brian Baise credited the powerful plays in this match to the team’s strategy – specifically, countering that of Merrimack’s #9 Xander Thesz and #13 Matthew Motes.
“Defensively, we’ve focused a little more on their middle blockers,” Baise explained. “We could tell they were getting the ball to them any chance they could. Two really good players, so I knew we had to stop them, slow them down, so that was part of it.”
Harvard continued to ride the hot hand until the Warriors managed to side out on Berty’s serve, making it 16-10. A flurry of service errors from both sides left the score briefly stagnant before Harvard came back on a tear to make it 24-16 – match point for Harvard.
Yet, the game was not quite over. A serve from sophomore setter James Bardin resulted in a point for the Warriors, and they only kept coming. As the Crimson desperately tried to close out the set with a final, last point, Merrimack’s #4, freshman setter Carson Bashford, went on a run of 4 serves to keep the Warriors in the set, and Harvard on the edge.
At 24-20, with momentum primed on the side of Merrimack, Harvard called a brief timeout.
“I think our serve-receive broke down a little bit,” reflected Bardin, when asked about the situation at play. “We just took a timeout and reset, and came back.”
Come back they did. The Warriors’ next serve set up a beautiful kill for sophomore opposite hitter Kade McGovern, letting Crimson take back the rally, and the set.
Harvard stayed strong throughout their next two sets, taking the first point in both to start out, but dropping quickly to a tie afterward. Unlike the first set, Merrimack was able to pull ahead with the lead early on, though a combination of Warriors’ fumbles and Crimson kills allowed Harvard to keep pace. A tense segment in the second set, flavored by a dash of service errors from both sides and back-and-forth rallies brought the game to 16-17, as Harvard pushed to overcome a late Merrimack lead.
Though service errors have served to plague the team during the early beginnings of the season – and are a constant in collegiate volleyball – coach Baise notes a marked improvement for the team and a bright spot in the game.
“We have some guys who can really serve well – good arms, good pace on the ball,” Baise remarked. “We’ve been encouraging them to be aggressive when the toss is good, and the situation is right. We’ve been serving maybe two or three good service matches in a row, so I’d like to think that some of that early work and patience has been paying off.”
This refinement has been fruitful for the team, its players, and especially these sets in question. From its light deficit, the Crimson emerged on a 7-1 run, with a service ace from Berty to pull ahead 23-18.
Following a back-and-forth, it’s ironically a service error from Merrimack that clinches Harvard’s final point, leaving the second set 25-20 in the Crimson’s favor.
This would prove to be deadly for the opposing Warriors: so far in the season, Harvard has never given up a set after being up two to none. As of now, they still haven’t. Both teams fought hard for the lead as shifting hot streaks created a see-sawing scoreboard, but a service ace from McGovern secured a Crimson victory at 25-21.
This sweep was big for Harvard, closing out the team’s homestand with a victory, and for coach Baise, feels especially good. The 3-0 victory was a great testament and reflection of the team’s improvements into the season.
“We’ve played some really good volleyball so far this year, but we haven’t played really good volleyball for stretches at a time,” Baise explained. “So we’ve been good one set, and then not good the next set, and vice versa. [There were a] few small lapses [this game], but we didn’t let them go too long, and that’s why we’re able to get that sweep against a good team.”
Merrimack is a new addition to Harvard’s non-league opponent lineup, and to the men’s collegiate volleyball circuit in general. The 2023 season is the program’s first, as the Warriors join the Northeast Conference (NEC) alongside tough opponents such as Daemen. The Crimson played the new team for the first ever time back in January, where it had also won 3-0.
Bardin credits that prior clash with many of the successes found tonight, and the subsequent regular-season sweep over Merrimack.
“We knew their hitters pretty well,” Bardin explained. “A lot of [their hitters] are fairly one-dimensional, so we had a pretty clear gameplan on how to defend them. We had one our best blocking nights yet, so that scouting paid off.”
Among those blockers, junior middle blocker Trevor Schultz played a key role, with a game-high of 6 blocks. These add to an already accoladed stats sheet, with 1 ace and 5 kills.
“I think Trevor Schultz did a good job closing the blocks today, that’s the best I’ve seen him do,” Bardin said. “I think he, by far, had the most blocks on the team, which is great to see, ‘cause he’s been working that hard these past couple of weeks.”
Another player to watch this game was McGovern, who notched the game-winning ace, while also grabbing 10 kills – leading all players in this match.
“He keeps getting better and better,” Baise said of McGovern. “Better decision making, and so many strengths to his game. We’ve just been focused on him playing to those strengths, and not giving away some of those easy points, and it’s made all the difference for him. The number of matches now he’s put together now has been really impressive.”
Also important have been contributions from Berty and sophomore outside hitter Logan Shepherd, who each brought in 7 kills – which, for the latter, is a season-high.
As for the team, Harvard continues to look forward to its first away games since prior to the Harvard Invitational. The Crimson will face their first EIVA rival, Charleston (10-0), in West Virginia. Charleston is currently ranked No. 2 in the EIVA, while Harvard stands at No. 4.
“The league will be tough,” Baise admitted, “We’ve seen some good teams [in the early season], and so I’m hoping that a lot of our preparation and what we’ve been doing these last 6 weeks will prepare us well.”
Charleston is riding a 10-game win streak, and is currently undefeated in its matches against non-league opponents – their matches against Harvard will be their first taste of league play as well. Last season, Crimson was swept by Charleston in the regular season, losing 1-3 and 2-3 in close matches. Luckily, the team doesn’t seem deterred.
“We lost to them last season, so it’ll be a rough match,” Bardin said. “But they graduated a lot of guys and we’ve got a lot of new guys, like Zach Berty. I think it’ll be a good game.”
Harvard will take on Charleston in back-to-back matches at the Wehrle Innovation Center on the weekend of February 17th.

The whole thing about being gay is, you can’t really do it alone. I can say I’m a lesbian until the day I die, but as long as I’m single, I’m just a girl with a questionable haircut and a carabiner on my (left) belt loop. And no day adds insult to this injury quite like Valentine’s Day.
First of all, who decided that Valentine’s Day merch would share half of its colors with the lesbian flag? Yes, we do own the color pink, thank you very much. Plus, teddy bears holding hearts are inherently sapphic. The masculine bear in a softer, plusher form, holding a classic feminine symbol of love? That’s a masc lesbian.
Additionally, Valentine’s Day removes an advantage lesbians usually have over straight men. Normally, lesbians are much better at being romantic, because we have a better idea of what women enjoy and less toxic masculinity. But on Valentine’s Day, men remember that they’re supposed to bring chocolates to their Valentine, whereas if I do it, it just seems to her like any other Tuesday!
Worst of all, on Valentine’s Day I have to look at straight people more than usual, because they’re all out and about. Ew. Remind me to stay in my dorm on the fateful day.
I’ll stop now, because my dad reads these, and also because if the people on the other side of my internship applications find this by googling my name, I don’t want them to think I’m weird. People are obviously not obligated to date me. But that does not mean that I am not bitter. I am bitter. I’m just saying, I have a lot to offer. Yes, I may have some commitment issues. But clearly I don’t have commitment issues when it comes to THE BIT.
And now, to connect this all to Harvard so that Hana and Tina will put my rant in the feature, which I acknowledge that they have no real reason to do, I will say that I will be doing Datamatch. If you can relate to this article, my DM’s are open, ladies.
(To avoid the predatory lesbian stereotype, I will also say that this is all a joke. Don’t come for me!)

If you’re single this Valentine’s Day, a) you’re not alone, and b) you don’t have to feel alone, because Flyby is here with some handy tips for single people to survive Valentine’s Day, also known as Singles Awareness Day (S.A.D.). There is no need to turn into the Grinch (Valentine’s Day Version) because love is all around, so here’s how to embrace self-love, friend love, family love, food love, pset love and so on.
Treat Yourself!
Valentine’s Day is supposed to be about treating that special someone in your life, and the person who you should love the most, the real BAE, is yourself. Self-love is the best love, so take this as your sign to spoil yourself. Retail therapy always works, so you might as well buy yourself that Keurig or those headphones that you have had your eye on. You know what else is perfect for filling your Valentine’s Day void? A decadent dessert. The Square has plenty of options, like Amorino Gelato, Mike’s Pastries, Milk Bar, and Zinneken’s (but beware of the couples). Look on the bright side: instead of spending money on someone else, you can splurge on yourself.
Remember the good things about being single.
Being single has its perks. You may be single on Valentine’s this year, but at least you’re not chasing a red flag. You have more time for your friends, family, and hobbies. You don’t have to share your food, ever. Your phone battery isn’t getting drained from calls and texts. You can watch whatever movie you want. You can literally do whatever you want with whoever you want. There’s no drama, no judgment, and no worries. You have so much freedom, so make the most out of being single now.
On the other hand, you can also wallow.
If trying to ignore the fact that you’re single, lonely, and sad doesn’t work, then embrace the misery. Hide away from heart decorations and lovey-dovey couples by staying in, ordering some unhealthy food, and watching something. All Netflix, no chill. Surprisingly, there are a lot of Valentine’s horror movies out there, like “My Bloody Valentine,” and romcoms like “How to Be Single” can be a great escape. Give yourself some time to feel your feelings because as soon as Feb. 15 comes around, the pity party is over, and you’re back to the reality of being a busy academic weapon.
Do what YOU love!
What’s a better day to practice the self-love first philosophy than the most loving day of the year? You get to be selfish on this day. You can dress to impress yourself. You can revisit some of the hobbies you love but never seem to have time for these days. You can hang out with your friends and throw a Galentine’s/Palentine’s party. Make it a happy day by ending it with some well-deserved me time. Put on your favorite pajamas and have a scrumptious meal in the comfort of your own dorm. Food will always be your Valentine. Food will never leave you.
It’s normal to struggle with Valentine’s Day if you’re single. If you have been dreading Feb. 14 approaching, hopefully these tips can help you out. If all else fails, you can always use Taylor Swift’s “How You Get The Girl” as a last resort to win the affection of your class crush.
