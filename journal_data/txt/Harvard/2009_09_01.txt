After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paging Peter Sellers. Suddenly, it seems, a whole lot of people have learned to stop worrying and love the drone. With the same deadly precision they claim for their weapons of choice, defenders of drones—also known as unmanned aerial vehicles—have been gleefully shooting down the arguments of any who dare criticize their tactics. “The future of how you use these unmanned systems or remotely piloted systems is really unlimited,” contends one lieutenant general, speaking for them all.
The recent U.S. takeout of Taliban big cheese Baitullah Mehsud has predictably fired up these drone proponents, who see it as a clear-cut success story and a case for upping the number of UAVs. What’s more surprising, perhaps, is that the counterarguments have been so few and so thin. It’s the specifics, rather than the supremacy of the drone approach itself, that have come under attack. Pakistanis decry U.S. counterterrorist strikes in their country as a “violation of sovereignty” (apparently, contracting out assassination missions to third parties isn’t their preferred method), but these protests really boil down to wanting the missiles in their own hands. Soft-hearted lefties contend that drones take out innocent civilians along with targets. But justifiable as these concerns are, as tracking software grows more advanced and imaging resolution more clear, the purely mechanical aspect of unmanned warfare will take care of itself.
So how to reckon with that nagging feeling in the gut when confronted with the statistics—that last year the U.S. military employed twice as many drones as it did manned fighter planes, that the total number of military drones has increased drastically from 167 in 2001 to 5,500 today, that under Obama’s presidency alone we’ve already ordered dozens to eliminate al Qaeda and Taliban operatives? CNN.com blithely reports on one Major Morgan Adams, who pilots a Predator sending Hellfire missiles into Iraq and Afghanistan: “He kisses his wife goodbye, drives to Creech, a tiny desert air force base in Nevada, and within minutes could be killing insurgents on the other side of the world.” Now soldiers can go about the dirty business of war and be home in time for dinner.  
It’s precisely this lack of personal investment that makes the new emphasis on drones such a radical shift in the way war is waged. Despite the rhetoric employed when we send our soldiers packing, we’ve come a long way from the ideal of war as a forging ground for masculine ideals: the moral enrichment found on Cato’s battlefields, the two Novgorod commanders vying to outdo one another in valor in “Alexander Nevsky.” Even in Vietnam, when these models of individual heroism largely broke down—no longer could one line up manfully, toe to toe with the enemy—American forces were still provided with opportunities for bravery as they navigated the jungle under constant threat of sniper fire.
But when a physical presence becomes superfluous, such subtle considerations—considerations that made war as much about cultivating our own behavior as about taking out “targets”—don’t play a role at all. And therein lies the danger. Policymakers in their swivel chairs at the Capitol have much in common with children afraid of the dark; the richness of their imagination often outstrips the banality of the reality. The capability of dispatching a robot with no harm to U.S. persons isn’t necessarily a condition for joystick diplomacy, but it makes overreacting to threats a very distinct possibility. So it is that even P.W. Singer, a defense analyst at the conservative Brookings Institution, warns the shift to unmanned vehicles could make us “more cavalier” to the use of force.
Indeed, all the recent uproar over Guantanamo prisons and black sites has obscured the fact that drone targets also don’t get court trials, judges, or hearings. (Until recently, the Obama administration used Blackwater—also responsible for Gitmo planning—to help organize its drone operations.) It’s hard to think of a more bizarre and troubling contradiction than shutting down the number of torture programs while stepping up the number of remote-control executions. Keeping our own boys safe is a laudable goal, but not if it comes at the cost of due process or credibility abroad.
Comeuppance will arrive sooner or later, though. If our targets don’t turn the drones back on us—more than 40 countries are working right now to develop drone technology—the robots themselves may have their way. The Air Force just released its Unmanned Aircraft System Flight Plan, which estimates that autonomous aerial bots will replace all manned aircraft in the country by 2047. And in June, leading figures in the artificial intelligence community convened at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Monterey Bay to discuss the dangers of technologies like drones for humans. Sitting on the oceanfront, surrounded by pristine forests and sandy white beaches, they mulled over such “I, Robot” scenarios as super-intelligent machines destroying the world in self-defense. Forget Dr. Strangelove—we need Will Smith.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Changes have occurred since I entered Harvard 61 years ago. Most obviously, in 1948 the class consisted only of men. Women, in smaller numbers, were shunted off to Radcliffe. The amalgamation of genders and increased diversity of the student body in general are likely to have effects on the university that will not be fully appreciated for at least 50 years.  
The treatment of and expectations from athletes may also have changed. Last year’s Louisiana State University starting quarterback, Andrew Hatch, will be returning to Harvard. I remember sitting in the newly opened Lamont Library and noticing with surprise someone from my hometown whom I had not previously considered likely to be admitted. He was approached by an assistant football coach and asked why he was not coming to practice. He stated simply that he was too busy doing schoolwork.
What about the perception that Harvard is the premier academic institution? When the dean of admissions interviewed me, he said, “We mustn’t think of ourselves as the best,” adding with a chuckle sote voce, “but of course we are.” My preference is to think of the school as a metaphor for excellence. Some things at Harvard are not the best. I remember developing a seemingly brilliant chemistry equation and discussing it with a graduate teaching fellow. He liked it. Later, I found that there were two things wrong: The equation was incomplete, and the correct formula had been discovered a century previously.
Time disparity is also reflected in an observation made by a classmate at our 50th reunion. At the time we started, the Spanish-American War was as remote as World War II is to the current class. The Spanish-American War seems impossibly distant. One has to conclude that WWII seems that way to your class. Consider life as a one-way street. Although one’s choices of concentration, vocation, and life partner are not necessarily irrevocable, they are not limitless. Give these choices some rational thought. A degree from Harvard won’t protect you from life. Some doors may open, but others will be at least partially shut. 
Here is a brief history of the Class of 2013: At your 25th but not at your 35th reunion, activities will include provision for small children. By your 50th you will still vividly remember your college days. The intervening years will be a blur. You will also be surprised that members attending their 60th will on the whole be in better shape than your class (survivor selection). After 75 years the books on the class will be archived. But look on the bright side. The time from the year I was born until the year your class records are finished will encompass 36 percent of Harvard’s history. Viewed in that perspective, the school is still young.
Answer exam questions as broadly as possible. One student took a social relations exam without enrolling in or auditing the course. His expansive answers drew the comment, “You almost hit the jackpot!” The course professor, who happened to be one of my favorite teachers, tried to get the student expelled. President Conant was more forgiving. Drew G. Faust would likely do likewise, but don’t tempt her.
Presumably, you will consider taking one semester abroad and, given your multiplicity of interests, will get involved in something—sports, acting, politics, writing for The Crimson. I liked sculling on the Charles. Avoid extensive bridge playing. Most of the devoted players in my class dropped out. However, one that didn’t sent five of his children to Harvard, so go figure.
Expect that the best teachers won’t get tenure. In my class, a large number of the students taking math courses appreciated the apparently effortless way one teacher was able to teach a course and a half in one semester. The tenured faculty was not impressed. As explained at our 35th reunion, tenure is a commitment that could last 30 to 40 years. The gifted teacher may burn out. Scholarly productivity is more likely to endure. My experience as a faculty member at a non-Harvard medical school gives credence to the concept. However, I still think that “Dr. R.” could have done both.
One of my classmates is an Olympic gold medalist. Another won a Nobel Prize. One donated enough money to the university that a building was named after him. One caused a change in the course of U.S. history. Only the first of these events was predictable during college. On the other hand, my guess is that 10 percent of my classmates are in poor financial straits. When one such tried to speak up at a reunion, he was ignored.
Be careful how you are quoted in The Crimson. I Googled myself and found that remarks made 60 years ago were still retrievable.
You have four years. To paraphrase Dylan Thomas, after the first four college years, there are no others. Carpe diem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many energetic students volunteer in developing countries to make an impact on less privileged communities. Some bring back glorious stories of success, while others come back in frustration. After a recent humanitarian research project, I have come to appreciate the value of the frustrating experiences. These experiences provide subtle, et important clues as to why many developing communities stagnate in poverty. I believe it is the failure to understand these less obvious driving forces of poverty that cause even giant organizations like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to fail in major development projects. But most importantly, these experiences teach us the value of perseverance in development work while ignoring bureaucratic fluff. 
This story begins at Harvard University, where a small research team developed a low-cost prototype robot based on feedback given by humanitarian deminers. The robot was to be used to perform area reduction in uncharted territory. Area reduction is the first phase of any demining project where a large area is reduced to smaller plots of suspected regions. Since area reduction is done in lands abandoned for decades, current techniques require deminers to cut and burn the vegetation. Our effort was to develop a low-cost robotic platform that could assist in area reduction while eliminating the need to damage vegetation. Since moving through tropical vegetation is extremely challenging for a robotic platform, the prototype robot had to be tested in an affected region in Sri Lanka. 
I decided to sacrifice a piece of my luggage to take the prototype robot on my way to Sri Lanka on July 9. One of my Radcliffe research partners, Lahiru Jayathilaka, who worked on the robot’s perception and reaction, planned to meet me in Sri Lanka on July 10 to carry out field trials. I had informed the defense attaché of the Sri Lankan embassy in Washington, D.C., about this transfer and had requested him to inform the customs at the airport in Colombo and the Ministry of Defense to avoid delays. Both the defense attaché and the Sri Lankan ambassador promised to extend their full support. 
As planned, I landed in Colombo with my wife, two kids, and our luggage. To my astonishment, the customs had no clue about my transporting the robot to Sri Lanka. They decided to detain it in the airport and ordered me to bring a special letter from the Ministry of Defense to reclaim the box. They also told me to bring along enough Sri Lankan money to pay a fine and tax. I agreed to the fine but questioned why I should pay tax on a university prototype with no commercial value. Based on arbitrary criteria, one officer estimated a value of 5,000 rupees for the parts, and another estimated a value of 10,000 rupees. Finally, after some negotiation, they settled on the value of 5,000 rupees  as both fine and tax. My tired and embarrassed family had to wait for more than an hour at the airport until the drama was over. 
After one week, I went to the airport with the letter given by the Ministry of Defence. I paid a fine and the arbitrarily calculated tax. Interestingly, the cashier did not return my balance. An accompanying air force officer volunteered to get me the balance. Later, I found out that it was standard practice for the cashier to keep the balance for detained items.
We forgot this episode and were determined to test the robot on real rough terrain. After many weeks of jumping through hoops and pulling strings, we were given a rush appointment to test the robot on August 21, a week prior to both Lahiru’s and my departure from Sri Lanka. It was a memorable day for us because what we saw in the faces of the demining units and the commanders of the engineers’ brigade of the Sri Lankan army simply made all of those frustrations worth it. When the soldiers saw that Lahiru and I were finding it difficult to unload the robot from our vehicle, more than 10 of them rushed over to volunteer. It was raining at Ambilipitiya training camp that day, and soldiers were holding umbrellas above our equipment. We tested the robot in different terrains with varying degrees of thickness of vegetation. Everyone on the field that day was thrilled! The robot walked on mud and survived the rain, but it did get stuck in some vegetation. Expert officers gave us feedback and promised continuous field support for our work.  We had just witnessed two very different sides of the people we were trying to help.
There are a few lessons we learned out of this experience. Often, it is highly likely that you will ask yourself: “Why did I volunteer when these people don’t want to find solutions to their own problems?” You will wonder why you exhaust yourself with seemingly ridiculous bureaucratic collisions. Be determined and have patience—you will reach the layers that appreciate your generosity.  Then—and only then—will you see the beauty of the country you are volunteering in. Moreover, you will see massive opportunities for reforms in the system on the flip side of the frustrating experience. It is worth the wait! But remember to record the frustrating experiences so that we can collectively work to improve the systems that keep victimizing nearly five billion of the world’s population.

With an endowment that suffered an $8 billion drop last October and a list of expenses that keeps on growing, it is no surprise that Harvard has been hunting for revenue sources to continue funding its essential programs. But one of these new ventures—Harvard’s agreement to license the phrase “Harvard Yard” to the Wearwolf Group for use in a line of upscale clothing—has elicited unwarranted student criticism and media attention. Given that the profits from the clothing line—which will sell men’s shirts for $160 and sportcoats for as much as $495—will directly benefit Harvard’s financial-aid program, it is misguided to blame the university for doing what it can to pay its bills, even if that means allowing Harvard’s name to adorn crimson-lined blazers and madras shorts reminiscent of the 1950s “good-old-boy” era. Some students have complained that attaching the phrase “Harvard Yard” to expensive clothing will entrench Harvard’s elitist image and discourage potential students who aren’t from affluent backgrounds from applying. Because the clothing is expensive, the argument goes, these prospective applicants will be convinced that Harvard really is a place for the privileged alone. But all things considered, it seems highly unlikely that the Harvard Yard clothing line will do anything to discourage applications. Harvard licenses its name to a wide variety of products across many different price ranges—and unlike the readily affordable fleeces and T-shirts that are peddled at the Coop, the new Harvard Yard line won’t even bear Harvard’s insignia. Nor is this the first time Harvard has sold its naming rights to clothing companies on the higher end of the price spectrum: Just check out the Coop’s Ralph Lauren section for confirmation. By licensing Harvard Yard, the university is doing what it can to support financial aid—which runs directly counter to the “elitism” the clothing line’s critics denounce. This is a case in which the benefits outweigh the incredibly small costs, particularly in a bleak economic climate that has already diminished or destroyed several other universities’ commitments to financial aid. Unfortunately, the media coverage of the clothing line has blown Harvard’s decision out of proportion. The reality is that Harvard is rightly doing everything in its power to ensure the well-being of its own financial-aid program. Claims that a couple of pricey jackets and khakis here and there will lead to “exclusion” miss the point.

A group of Harvard professors have petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to alter its current proposal to give shareholders the power to nominate members of company boards, a change they say would increase companies’ exposure to volatile investor sentiment.
The professors—a group of Law School and Business School experts on corporate governance—argue in a letter sent to the SEC in mid-August that any proposal to increase shareholders’ influence on board member selection needs to be more restrictive. They wrote that speculators and raiders—the kind epitomized by “Wall Street’s” Gordon Gekko—have little long-term interest in a given company and may sacrifice long-term viability for short-term profits.
The reform’s proponents place some of the blame for the financial crisis on insufficient shareholder oversight. They argue that opening boards to stockholder influence is necessary to increase accountability to those who own shares in the company. 
In their letter, the Harvard professors endorse the intent of the proposed reform but push for revisions to the specifics of the proposal. Instead of the current reform’s rule that shareholders be able to nominate directors with as little as a one percent stake in the company, they proposed the bar to be eligible be raised to five to 10 percent ownership in the company for at least one year. Currently, the proposal requires only a one percent stake to nominate.
Companies have long resisted stockholder influence over corporate board membership, arguing that most investors seek short-term gain and have little interest in preserving the company’s long-term profitability, said signatory Joseph L. Bower ’59, a professor at the Business School.
The reform’s backers say empowering shareholders could help prevent another financial crisis, but according to Jay W. Lorsch, a Business School professor and signatory to the letter, the new reforms represent a continued effort by institutional investors to gain power and influence over the companies they invest in—a movement that predates the market crash.
“Shareholder democracy doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Bower. “The notion that the shareholder is a citizen with a stake and an understanding of the issues in a company is a bit theoretical or empty in my view.”
The SEC’s proposal, a cornerstone of Chairwoman Mary L. Schapiro’s financial reform agenda, has aligned in opposition a powerful constellation of some this nation’s largest and most prestigious law firms and Fortune 500 companies, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where Law School professor and principal author of the letter John C. Coates once worked.
According to a Washington D.C. lawyer with expertise in corporate governance who declined to be named to protect his client relationships, any potential reforms are sure to face a concerted challenge in court over whether the SEC has power to regulate in this field.
And among these academics who ostensibly support the idea behind the proposal, skepticism remains.
“I don’t have much confidence given the way American capital markets function that they can effectively govern companies,” said Lorsch.

Although more than a month has passed since the Cambridge Police Department announced that the City would be commissioning an independent police review panel in the aftermath of the controversial arrest of black Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., committee members have yet to be finalized and announced. The panel will likely include 10 to 14 non-paid professional experts in academia, law enforcement, and conflict resolution, whose names are expected to be announced within the next couple weeks, according to Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Washington D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum and chair of the panel. He said that finalizing appointments has been a “challenge” because people are often traveling and vacationing during the summer months. Once the panel is convened, the full group will likely meet three or four times over a period of three to five months, Wexler said. Other small group meetings may be held as well, and additional phases may be added if needed, he said.The CPD hired Jennifer Flagg, former chief administrative officer of the Mass. Turnpike Authority, in early August to serve as a liaison to the panel and to facilitate police discussions, according to CPD spokesman Frank Pasquarello. Gates’ arrest, which some believe was prompted by police racial profiling, triggered a national media frenzy in July that enveloped even President Barack Obama.Wexler said that the panel will seek lessons from the Gates arrest that can help local and national police with conflict resolution in the future, rather than compile an “action report” that only analyzes the incident. He said that the Gates brouhaha has been interpreted from many different perspectives, but that the review panel would help bring the discussion to a higher, more constructive level. City Councilor Craig A. Kelley said that the panel would have to delicately examine the racial and class undertones of the arrest.“When it’s all done...I don’t want people to look at it and say it was a waste of money, a whitewashing,” Kelley said. “We want people to say we had a thorough discussion, an honest review. If that takes a couple extra months to get there, I’m OK with it.” —Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

Edward C. Forst ’82, Harvard’s first executive vice president who stepped down Aug. 1 after a year on the job, will return to Goldman Sachs on Sept. 8 as the firm’s senior strategy officer while continuing to advise Harvard on finances and capital planning.
Forst, who had spent 14 years at Goldman immediately prior to his brief tenure at Harvard, will rejoin the company’s management committee and “review, define, and focus the firm’s global strategy,” according to an internal memo sent by Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75 and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s CEO and president, respectively.
The 26-year veteran of Wall Street abruptly announced his intentions to return to the financial services industry in May, stating his desire to seek out opportunities in an environment much changed by the crisis.
“This has been an outstanding year for me,” Forst told The Crimson after announcing that he would leave the University. “But it’s time to return to where I began.”
In his role as one of University President Drew G. Faust’s top advisers, Forst sought to improve the cost-effectiveness of the University’s operations by consolidating resources, such as office supplies, that have traditionally been procured separately at each of Harvard’s schools.
After Harvard’s nearly $37 billion endowment took a precipitous plunge, Forst’s job description expanded to include working with administrators across the University to close budgetary gaps at the schools. Many school leaders described his involvement in the budget-cutting process as “critical,” and Forst met with Faust on an almost daily basis.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake confirmed yesterday that Forst will remain on the University’s Debt Asset Management Committee and will join the Committee on University Resources, a little known body of prominent donors.
Forst, who holds an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania, arrived from Goldman Sachs at the end of a protracted year-long search. Though new to higher education administration, he had kept a hand in Harvard’s affairs, co-chairing several class gift committees and the University Committee on Student Excellence and Opportunity.
He will be replaced by Katherine N. Lapp—currently the executive vice president for business operations at the University of California—who will take the post in early October.

Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons, the country’s first openly lesbian mayor, married her longtime partner Mattie B. Hayes Sunday.
Colleagues, city councillors, friends and family attended the gathering, which took place at Central Square’s Saint Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church at 2 p.m.
“It was a joyous affair,” said Neal Alpert, the city’s director of constituent services. “It was smiles all around.”
The two have been together for seven years and have known each other since they met in graduate school 20 years ago, Simmons said yesterday. 
The wedding was officiated by Reverend Irene Monroe, a black lesbian minister and close friend to both Simmons and Hayes.
Monroe said the wedding was historic, since it represented the first time a predominantly African-American church in Cambridge has allowed same-sex marriage. 
“I was honored to be a part of it,” she said.
Simmons is also raising her three grandchildren, who attend Cambridge public schools, making the wedding an occasion that “completed the family,” said Rosaleah Brown, deputy assistant to the mayor.
Though Simmons and Hayes do not have any concrete plans for a honeymoon, they have “lots of ideas,” Simmons said.
She described the occasion as historic, celebratory, and familial.
“It’s a privilege to wed the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with,” Simmons said of her wife, who is an administrator with a program that aims to aid young women in the juvenile detention system in New York.
“We had love, and now we have that legal document as well,” she said.

We kid you not. On September 10, religion guru Harvey Cox will be the first Hollis Professor of Divinity in recent memory to exercise his bovine grazing rights. Research shows that his position—the oldest endowed chair in the history of higher education in the U.S.—apparently came with grazing rights in Harvard Yard. For the cows, of course.
So it's only natural that Cox kicks off his retirement ceremony and the release of his new book by bringing a Jersey cow named "Pride," courtesy of The Farm School in Athol, Mass., into the Yard. Except the four-legged herbivore will be renamed "Faith" for the day. (God forbid the presence of an amicable, cud-chewing embodiment of one of the seven deadly sins on such an occasion.)
Reverend Peter Gomes, longtime friend and supporter of Cox's grazing rights crusade, will preside over the ceremony along the steps of Memorial Church. There will be musical offerings. And a stately procession—with cow in tow—to the green area right behind the Divinity School, where the ceremony will be topped with a much anticipated milking.
Cox first caught wind of this perk when he became Hollis Professor of Divinity in 2002. The only Hollis professors known to graze their cows in the Yard were Edward Wigglesworth, the first to hold this position in 1722, and his son who succeeded him.
"I thought it was kind of a nice and quaint tradition, so I started thinking why don't we do it?" Cox explained. Clearing his proposal with a formidable list of University officials, security, and groups he never knew existed, such as the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, was no simple task. But all seemed receptive, if not excited, about a bovine appearance on campus.
Though FlyBy predicts most will simply be surprised or amused to see Faith ambling across the Yard, Cox, who will remain on faculty post-retirement as a part-time research professor, hopes that his send-off exercise will help "reacquaint people with crops and animals and where food actually comes from."
In any case, if you thought the Memorial Church bells were a pain, thank your lucky stars that the Yard is no longer teeming with squealing pigs and other farmyard creatures.

It turns out that Tom Jehn, the Expos program director, tweets under @trjehn. For someone whose job centers on clear and cogent writing, his tweets are a tad ironic:
   
poking a finger into my eye 6:50 AM Jun 11th from web
poking a finger into my other eye 7:03 AM Jun 11th from web
More tweets after the jump.  
He also uses Twitter to set good examples for us youngsters:

..uh, such as your Twitter account?
There’s also Stephanie Kenen, the administrative director of Gen Ed, or as she writes in her bio, an “ overeducated bureaucrat.”

I have apparently become the resident evil bitch-dean from hell. Everyone’s afraid of me. I’m not that mean, am I? 8:30 PM Jul 22nd from web

No worries, Steph. If your Fan Page ends up anything like your Twitter account, with a grand total of 11 followers, we think you’re safe.
Following in the footsteps of HUDS, Gen Ed also set up its own Twitter account! We might add that it has nine followers, which is probably the sum total of everyone at Harvard who knows what the hell is going on with the program.
True to the Gen Ed mission, its tweets are informative, engaging, and substantive:
Welcome to the official Twitter feed for the Program in Gen Ed! Stay updated on what’s happening, ask us questions, get answers & much more! 5:22 PM Jul 29th from web

EDIT 9/2/2009: So, it looks like Tom Jehn and Stephanie Kenen deleted their Twitters. Guess they learned the hard way to be careful what they say...

Three months after Cambridge resident Justin Cosby was shot to death in the basement of Kirkland House in what prosecutors say was a failed “drug rip” (he was found with $1,000 and one pound of marijuana near his body, and The Crimson later reported that he may have been involved in drug sales to Harvard students), police have apprehended all three suspects they believe were involved in the shooting.
The three men, all from New York, are currently jailed without bail.
Jabrai J. Copney, 20, was the first to be arrested and arraigned after he turned himself in to police in late May. He’s since been indicted on five charges including first-degree murder, and he pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Police say that Copney, an aspiring songwriter, pulled the trigger on Cosby.
Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts, 19, was arrested in Harlem in early June and is the second man to be apprehended by police. He was arraigned in Manhattan over the summer but refused to return to Massachusetts voluntarily to face charges, which also include first-degree murder. Prosecutors have thus far failed to obtain the warrant needed to extradite Jiggetts to Massachusetts.
Jason Aquino, 23, was the final suspect to be arrested by police in connection to the shooting and faces the same charges as Jiggetts. In late July, he was arraigned in Manhattan and extradited to Cambridge, where he pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds e-mailed students earlier today to announce the unveiling of the much delayed application for J-Term housing. You can find it here. The app is pretty short, so you might as well fill it out soon and not play chicken with the Oct. 15 deadline. A couple of things to note after the jump:
1) The application wastes no time making clear that your swipe cards will not work in Houses if you are not approved for J-Term. So if you're hoping to crash with your more J-Term eligible roommate, you'll have to live with the inconvenience of calling them every time you need to get in.
2) The language about allowing thesis writers to stay sounds very cautious, and leaves a lot of wiggle-room for rejection:
If this is to be believed, the designation "absolutely must stay on campus" is only enough to get your application considered.
