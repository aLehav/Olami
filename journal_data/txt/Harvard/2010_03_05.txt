After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Microeconomic  theory has traditionally had an individual focus; everyone makes personal  decisions to maximize their utility based on economic and psychological  incentives. However, until now, most theory has failed to incorporate  the effect of identity on an individual’s economic choices.. A new  integration of economics and sociology,  “identity economics,” that takes into account the influence of social  contexts on humans’ choices, has major ramifications for many areas  of both corporate and policy interest, including problems that have  plagued the American education system. Understanding students’  incentives through both economic and social incentives give useful ideas  for improving our schools.
This  theory has been brought to the fore by the  groundbreaking new book, Identity Economics, by  economists George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton.  The two begin their investigation of students’ incentives with the  traditional economic model in which students weigh the monetary costs  and benefits of education. Then, however, they look at the social categories  common in a school. There are “insiders” are often the jocks or  high achievers who are very involved in school life. There are also  “outsiders,” the “burnouts” who resent the culture of the insiders  and the school as a whole. They are not invested in their life at school  and do not feel a meaningful relationship to the institution.
Finally,  they examine the effect that these identities have on the utility functions  of the students. The students who identify as insiders will benefit  from being involved in the school and exerting at least a moderate level  of academic effort. The outsiders, however, would be unhappy with these  activities. Rather, their sense of self is positively reinforced by  rebellion against the educational environment.
Common  remedies for bad schools include more resources and teacher training  programs, and both of those can be beneficial solutions. Yet identity  economics shows us that a school’s culture can be just as important,  if not more so, in contributing to the success of its students. Akerlof  and Kranton explain how many schools that have bucked the trend and  succeeded where others have not have done so because of a cohesive culture  where teachers and students feel united for a common mission or purpose.  There are few, if any, “outsiders,” because everyone buys into the  school’s ideas and missions.
Notable  examples of this are the Knowledge is Power Program charter schools  in various low-income neighborhoods throughout the country. The KIPP  schools give disadvantaged middle school students a unique education  by creating an immersive educational environment. Teachers create an  intense and fun educational experience from the early years, ensuring  that students grow up with a value of academic success and the culture  of the school. As detailed in the wonderful book Work Hard, Be Nice,  the schools create an environment where scholarly achievement and good  character is valued by peers and the community. Communication with parents  is frequent, so that everyone, from administrators to teachers, students,  and parents, feels like an “insider” in the culture of the school.
By  changing the way that students perceive themselves, these schools are  transforming communities. A study  by Johns Hopkins in 2007 found that “Even when pre-existing differences between KIPP and comparison  students are controlled in statistical analyses, KIPP students generally  outperformed comparison school students on achievement measures.”  KIPP schools and other similar institutions are largely successful because  they invest in developing the identity of their students.
Identity  economics shows us that social incentives and norms crucially influence  economic choices and decision-making. Through incorporating this new  idea into standard microeconomic theory, we can change the way we view  various challenging policy issues. Ironically, this new path of economic  study might show us that sometimes the solution to a pressing problem  might not be one of money or programs but rather, one of culture.

Tomorrow, Harvard  Law School’s Latino Law and Policy Conference will hold a panel on “The Future of Immigration Reform” that will address the role of guest worker programs.  Listed as one of the speakers is Mark Krikorian, head of Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigrant group with strong ties to hate groups.
Krikorian is an odd choice for as respected an institution as HLS. The group he heads was established by the racist founder of the modern nativist movement, John Tanton, who has worried about the “educability” of Latinos. “I’ve come to the point of view that for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that,” Tanton wrote in 1993.
Tanton played a critical role in CIS’s creation. Not only did he dream it up, but he installed his best friend, Otis Graham, as head of the group in the 1990s. Graham, who is still a member of CIS’s board, has some unconventional views about history. In his book “Unguarded Gates,” Graham claims that a “mythistory” was created during the civil rights movement that falsely depicted America as a “nation of immigrants.” He depicts racist past policies, such as the 1924 Immigrant Act that restricted immigration mostly to Northern Europeans, as honest attempts to preserve a “working American nationality.” He praises the American Coalition of Patriotic Societies, which backed the act, but failed to mention that it was indicted for sedition in 1942 because of its pro-Nazi activities. And Graham dismisses the nearly four million-strong, angrily anti-Catholic Klan of the 1920s as “on the margins of immigration reform.”
Krikorian often falsely claims to have no “personal relationship” with Tanton. But the facts belie him. Krikorian worked at Tanton’s Federation for American Immigration Reform, which the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as a hate group, before landing his post at CIS. When Krikorian was given the CIS job in the mid-1990s, Tanton wrote to congratulate him. Not long after, Krikorian began participating in annual writers workshops put on by Tanton. Through the years, Tanton wrote to Krikorian about various aspects of policy.
There are other connections, too. Krikorian has written for Tanton’s hate journal, "The Social Contract." Wayne Lutton, a board member of the white nationalist Charles Martel Society who has been published by a Holocaust-denying publication, edits the journal. Its most notorious venture was a special issue devoted to the theme of “Europhobia: The Hostility Toward European-Descended Americans” that featured a lead article from John Vinson, a member of the white supremacist League of the South, arguing that multiculturalism was replacing “successful Euro-American culture” with “dysfunctional Third World cultures.”
But it’s not just Krikorian’s affiliations or his organization’s genesis and leaders that are problematic. Krikorian is on record making bigoted and callous statements about minorities. For example, in response to the recent earthquake tragedy in Haiti, Krikorian wrote on the conservative National Review Online, “…Haiti’s so screwed up because it wasn’t colonized long enough.” Krikorian also suggested that the solution for Haiti “would be to resume colonialism.”
In 2008, shortly after the failure of Washington Mutual Bank, Mark Krikorian found a press release issued months earlier by the bank that celebrated its inclusion on a list of “Business Diversity Elites” compiled by Hispanic Business magazine. On NRO, Krikorian posted the release with the sneering headline, “Cause and Effect?”, implying that the bank failed because of its minority employees.
It’s not just Krikorian’s words that are a problem—his actions are too. In 2007, he accepted an invitation to speak at the Michigan State University chapter of Young Americans for Freedom. It apparently didn’t bother him that MSU-YAF had been widely covered in the media for a series of nasty stunts—attempting to stage a “Catch an Illegal Immigrant Day,” holding a “Koran Desecration” competition, and posting “Gays Spread AIDS” fliers across campus. He also didn’t seem to mind being part of the same speakers series that included Nick Griffin, a Holocaust denier who heads the racist British National Party, and Jared Taylor, who says blacks are incapable of civilization.
But the list of CIS’s  execrable connections goes on even further. The group regularly circulates articles to its membership produced by the white nationalist website VDARE. VDARE is named after Virginia Dare, allegedly the first white child born in North America. Some of its board members also serve in leadership posts at the anti-immigrant Federation for American Immigration Reform.
The Latino Law and Policy Conference lists as part of its mission that it seeks to “encourage a forward-thinking dialogue” and “inspire the next generation of Latino leaders.” Does giving a platform to Krikorian, with his nasty views and even nastier connections, further that mission? Perhaps next time the conference should choose a different “expert” to address this complex and important topic.

As the journalism industry faces the challenges of a digital world, newspapers have no choice but to change their reporting methods and employment structure. However, this should not come at the cost of journalistic breadth and depth. As such, we regret that many newsrooms across the country have decreased their higher education coverage and eliminated higher education beats writers. While it is always difficult to determine the best way to tighten one’s belt, sacrificing college and university reporting is an unwise cut on the part of many publications.
The Chronicle of Higher Education recently noted, “At a time when newspapers are slashing their staffs and squeezing out education coverage, it is more difficult for colleges to communicate their relevance and messages to the public.” This trend is worrisome, partly because journalists serve the community when they publicize breakthroughs happening at universities. Without such media coverage, it would be difficult to draw attention to new research developments, musical compositions, films, and philosophies that appear in abundance at higher education institutions. While colleges and universities can publicize their own findings, their press releases may suffer from bias. Newspapers provide a more objective viewpoint while also synthesizing and analyzing research to make it digestible for the average person.
If this trend in local and national journalistic priorities continues, college newspapers must pick up the slack in order to hold their institutions accountable. While professional papers are still better suited to cover higher education, since they do not suffer from conflict of interest, student publications are the next best option. If they do not pick up where the professionals leave off, controversial university policies could take effect without proper, outside scrutiny. In order to prevent this and ensure that their coverage remains largley free from bias, college papers should strive to become independent from their universities whenever possible.
The journalism industry is not going away—it’s merely changing. Thus, it is imperative for newspapers to consider their content, both old and new, carefully. Although we understand that publications are stretched thin these days, we strongly encourage professional papers to consider making other cuts before eliminating higher education beat writers. Universities have historically been the birthplace of many game-changing ideas and innovations. If newspapers won’t give us a reliable and unbiased account of these stories, who will?

In Harvard Square, a good burger is hard to find. You can order “The Viagra” at Mr. Bartley’s, but he charges $9.79 for his help. You can savor “hand-packed” beef at b.good, but be warned: Real food is real slow. You can chow down at Flat Patties, but you better enjoy a detour. The Square lacks a cheap, quick, close alternative. In other words, it lacks a McDonald’s.
Or a KFC for that matter. Cambridge’s zoning laws spook fast-food chains from the Square. Section 11.31 of the Zoning Ordinance, for instance, demands that a joint look “compatible with…other buildings…in the particular location”; fulfill “a need for such a service in the neighborhood”; and attract “patrons primarily from walk in trade as opposed to drive in [trade].” So you can sue it for almost anything.
And this fact I lament. It is a pity the city reviles fast food.
True, some chains have snuck in. If you’re eating a burrito right now, you’re probably at Qdoba. But you could’ve been eating a Frosty. Over the years, Cambridge has blocked chains like Wendy’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Boston Chicken from the Square. Others—like Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, Legal Seafood, and IHOP—have provoked uproars.
Yet this hamburglar is remorseless. “I’m thrilled there are no fast food restaurants in Harvard   Square,” Craig Kelley, a member of the city council, wrote in an e-mail. “They tend to lead to much more trash on the streets.” Gladys Gifford, former president of the Harvard Square Defense Fund, agreed: “I live a block from Harvard Square and there isn’t a day that goes by that somebody hasn’t picked up a coffee or donut at Dunkin’ Donuts and they’ve dropped it on my lawn.” Gifford also blamed Dunkin’ Donuts for more traffic. “If you stay there long enough, you’ll see a stream of illegal parking; these people run in and get their coffee,” she told me.
But Jeffrey Miron, senior lecturer on economics, disagreed. “It could be that if you allow for a Dunkin’ Donuts, there will be more traffic, but that’s an indication that more people want to shop there,” he told me. “You could assess Dunkin’ Donuts for the litter they create. That is a reasonable policy, but outright banning it doesn’t seem to be in the interest of consumers at all.”
Au contraire, preservationists retort: Consumers dislike chains. “You can go to Abu Dhabi or Copley Square and see the same stores, which takes away some of Harvard Square’s appeal. It has Algiers…We don’t believe you come to Harvard Square to go to Starbucks,” Gifford said.
But if people preferred mom-and-pop stores, they would patronize them. “The fact that a quick burger joint wants to locate here means they think they can earn more revenue...that’s an indication of what the people who frequent the square would like to buy,” said Miron. If they thought they would lose money, “Starbucks and McDonald’s wouldn’t come here.”
Still, preservationists are wary. “So we should let the free market and Adam Smith reign?” Gifford asked. “I don’t think that’s wise. Look at the mess Adam Smith and Alan Greenspan got us into.”
And look at the mess zoning got the Square into. In the middle of the twentieth century, preservationists decided that red brick was cute, so they pushed developers to use it in new buildings and renovations. But by the 1990s, they were sick of it, so they prodded builders to use other materials. As a reporter for this newspaper wrote, Cantabrigians realized, “There is such a thing as too much red brick.”
Zoning laws reveal an unpleasant truth: Government by the people is government by the vocal. The people who squawk impose their preferences on the people who cave. And often, those preferences are whims. In this case, the people who want to feel quaint while frequenting the Square impose their preferences on students, who are too transient to oppose them. Sure, students like funky restaurants. But sometimes they need to grab lunch before class, and Central Square is a little out of the way.
No, McDonald’s exclusion from the Square is not tragic. But neither is Dunkin’ Donuts’ inclusion. Cambridge should lower its barriers to chains. And preservationists should cheer up. All they need is a happy meal.

What do Wisconsin dairy cattle, rat poison, and former President Dwight Eisenhower have in common?
The answer is warfarin, the most prescribed anticoagulant in North America that unites these seemingly disparate phenomenon with two vastly different medical issues: anticoagulation and tuberculosis.
In the laboratory of Jonathan Beckwith, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School, a team of researchers have discovered that warfarin—a compound found in blood thinners—interferes with not only the process of blood coagulation, but also the growth of the bacteria molecule that causes tuberculosis.
The discovery has profound consequences for the future of new anticoagulants and tuberculosis antibiotics, the researchers said.
Warfarin was first discovered during the Great Depression when dairy cattle on a Wisconsin farm suffered excessive bleeding from consuming spoiled sweet red clover hay, which was later found to contain a warfarin-like compound that inhibits blood clotting.
Recognized for its anticoagulant abilities, warfarin was later used in 1955 to treat Eisenhower after a heart attack. Now, warfarin is used in rat and mice pesticides.
Warfarin works as a blood thinner by interfering with VKOR, a bacterial version of the human enzyme that recycles vitamin K in the liver. Through the recycling process, clotting factors are produced and secreted into the blood, piling up to act as coagulant agents.
Coagulation, which stops the loss of blood at vascular injury sites, is essential for the process of stopping bleeding, or hemostasis, but it can be dangerous in the case of blood clotting complications like deep vein thrombosis. Warfarin, an anticoagulant, inhibits the function of the VKOR enzyme.
In addition to its role as an anticoagulant, warfarin inhibits the VKOR homologue of mycobacterium tuberculosis—a productive agent of tuberculosis.
The VKOR homologue forms disulfide bonds in proteins secreted by the bacteria. The bonds lock the bacteria into peak fighting form by stabilizing the proteins, helping them to survive in harsh conditions outside the cell, according to HMS Professor of Cell Biology Tom Rapoport.
But the “caveat” of using warfarin to inhibit tuberculosis growth is the need to apply very high concentration of the drug to produce desired results—and high dosages of the drug may cause a patient to bleed to death, according to graduate student and lead researcher Rachel Dutton.
Rapoport said that his hope is to find reagents that “can kill TB cells but not cause the person to bleed too much.”
Beckwith’s team worked off of discoveries made in Rapoport’s lab, including the structure and function of the VKOR protein, its formation of disulfide bridges, and its method of inhibiting the VKOR enzyme.
The next step of the HMS researchers’ work will require collaboration between the discoveries made in Beckwith’s and Rapoport’s labs. The identification and understanding of the VKOR structure will help the researchers in their search for new tuberculosis antibiotics, Rapoport said.
Beckwith’s team is currently developing screening assays for various anticoagulants and antibiotics to test whether they inhibit VKOR’s enzymatic activity. Dutton said they hope to “find other small molecules that would be stronger inhibitors that could potentially serve as starting points for new TB antibiotics.”

Hamsa Sridhar ’12 works with levitating gold on a regular basis—but the work is neither magical nor costly.
Sridhar, a joint physics and mathematics concentrator, is the only undergraduate researcher involved in a project at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences that seeks to levitate certain micro-particles coated with a thin layer of gold.
Under the direction of Applied Physics Professor Federico Capasso, Sridhar has to devise feasible ways to coat the micro-particle with gold and magnetic materials.
Before entering the nanofabrication facility at SEAS to coat the micro-particles in gold in her routine procedure, Sridhar must undergo a number of security measures: she has her iris scanned, and she swathes herself in a complete outfit that includes booties—which go on first, she said—and a white suit.
Sridhar—who placed first in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair as a high schooler—said that her interest in nanotechnology blossomed last summer, when she participated in the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network Research Experience for Undergraduates Program, which offers hands-on nanoscience and technology research experience.
Describing nanotechnology as “the hub of science” and a field with “a lot of potential and promise,” Sridhar said that she is passionate about the field because “all the new technologies are moving towards” nanotechnology.
“Hamsa has been great,” said SEAS student David N. Woolf, who is also a research assistant for the project. “She is hardworking and self-sufficient.”
The SEAS project made a breakthrough last year, when researchers proved the existence of repulsive inter-molecular forces, which had previously only existed in theory without empirical basis.
The application of certain materials to the micro-particles causes a shift from attractive to repulsive inter-molecular forces, thus permitting the particles to levitate in a fluid, Sridhar explained.
With further exploration, the researchers hope that their work will help significantly reduce quantum-scale friction in nano devices—but more research and experimentation remain before the project’s findings can be applied to an actual nano device, Sridhar said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 5, 2010
The Mar. 5 news article "A Golden Levitating Act" incorrectly stated that Hamsa Sridhar '12 placed first in the 2007 Intel Science Talent Search. In fact, she placed first in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School have made a landmark discovery in cancer genomics that may permanently shift the way cancer is currently diagnosed.
The study, published in the Feb. issue of Nature, identified 158 regions of the cancer genome that were most frequently altered in cancer.
“What was unique in our approach was that we were interested in alterations across different cancer types,” said HMS student Craig H. Mermel. “We want to stop looking at brain cancer or lung cancer but instead diagnose cancer by mutations common to the disease.”
In a sample of 3,131 cancer specimens of 26 cancer types, the group identified 158 regions of focal somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) that were frequently altered across several cancer types. Somatic copy number alterations occur when there are abnormal numbers of chromosomes within a tumor’s genome, Mermel said.
These SCNAs include amplifications, in which more than one copy of a gene is present, and deletions, in which the copy is not present at all.
Although the exact role of SCNAs is still unclear, the researchers found that a large number of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present over several cancers of different origin. The common SCNAs may act as important markers in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, according to Rameen Beroukhim, a clinical fellow in oncology at Harvard-affiliate Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
“Each cancer type obviously has a very complicated copy number profile,” Beroukhim said. “Two cancer types individually don’t look that similar, but we found that over such a large number of samples, copy number profiles looked more similar than different.”
Matthew L. Meyerson ’85, professor of pathology at HMS, emphasized the shift to viewing the diagnosis of cancer on a genetic basis.
“I think that it is part of the change in cancer diagnosis as no longer looking at cancer as lung cancer or breast cancer, but as caused by a particular type of genetic alteration,” Meyerson said.
Although this study is unique in that it indicates a promising universal view of the cancer landscape, Beroukhim said it would not have been possible without the context of current cancer research.
“This study happened now because there are more tumor samples available and in higher resolutions,” Beroukhim said. “We can really determine what gives rise to different cancer types.”
The promise of their findings has already prompted funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Sarah Thomas Monopoli Lung Cancer Research Fund, the Lucas Foundation, and several drug companies—most notably Novartis—in the hope of developing drugs that may specifically target common genetic alterations across cancer types.
But the researchers said that more work needs to be done before patients can benefit from the findings.
“This is only one particular milestone on a hypothesis that we thought was particularly powerful,” Mermel said.

Every year, astronomy lecturer Philip M. Sadler asks his students if they have ever toured an inflatable planetarium dome as a middle or high school student.
In a given year, at least a fourth of his students raise their hands, he said.
Sadler invented the Starlab portable planetarium in 1977—and 20 years later, about a quarter of students in the U.S. public school system have seen his inventions, he estimated.
In recognition of his development of Starlab and his dedication to helping students and teachers understand the common misconceptions lodged within science education, Sadler has been named the recipient of the 2010 Education Prize by the American Astronomical Society.
John P. Huchra, president of the American Astronomical Society and professor of cosmology, praised Sadler for his international impact as a science educator in the astronomy community and beyond.
Most students have difficulty retaining scientific concepts within the traditional textbook-and-lecture format, and “Phil was one of the very first to realize this,” Huchra said, adding that Sadler “will continue as a major player in the field.”
Sadler—also the director of the Astronomy Education Project in the Harvard College Observatory—currently teaches Astronomy 2: “Celestial Navigation”, which was first offered in 1897 and is the oldest continually offered course at Harvard.
Despite its long history, Sadler has “modernized and taken the class to a whole new level,” Head Teaching Fellow Elizabeth N. Garfield said.
“Students tend to love the class because they can tease apart their misconceptions and explore ideas about the world they never had before,” Garfield added.
By exploring basic concepts that are vulnerable to misconceptions—such as the reason for seasons and changes in the moon’s appearance—the class allows students to “piece together the world in an entirely new way,” Garfield said.
Sadler’s education research is not constrained solely to astronomy. His new book, titled “AP: A Critical Examination of the Advanced Placement Program” will be released next month.

Harvard physics professor Gerald Holton and researcher Gerhard Sonnert discussed in a study group yesterday the assimilation of German refugee children and the factors that contributed to their socioeconomic success in America.
The two co-authored the 2006 book “What Happened to the Children Who Fled Nazi Persecution,” which examines the immigration experiences of a group of refugees born between 1918 and 1935.
To their surprise, Holton and Sonnert said that the group did not follow the usual model of assimilation, in which immigrants become familiar with the new country’s culture before achieving social and economic success.
“Linear assimilation was not true for this group because although they did really well socioeconomically, they did not assimilate into the mainstream,” said Sonnert, adding that the cultural values retained by the refugees proved “advantageous.”
Holton and Sonnert also found that children whose parents had been professional workers in Germany were three times more likely to become professionals in the United States.
Though the post-war climate in America was friendly to many job-seeking immigrants, the German refugees were especially successful in their assimilation efforts, Sonnert said. The group boasted greater rates of professional careers and degrees in higher education, compared to the general American population.
“We want to know why this particular group of people was so successful,” Sonnert said.
Among other explanations, Holton pointed to the amount of responsibility required of children who endured the oppression of Nazi Germany and negotiated their own immigration efforts.
For example, many refugee children were charged with obtaining immigration documents for their parents, who could not safely leave the house without a Swastika, according to Holton.
After the discussion, Alex Sagan—co-chair of the study group on Jews in modern Europe—said he was impressed by the professors’ systematic approach to understanding the immigrant experience, and the simultaneous evocation of the refugees’ psychological condition.
Holton and Sonnert are currently awaiting the publication of their new book, which applies their findings about the German refugee children to modern-day immigrant populations.

The anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen may act as a neuroprotective agent against the risk of Parkinson’s disease, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
In the observational study, participants who regularly used ibuprofen were 40 percent less likely to develop Parkinson’s disease over a six-year period, according to lead researcher Xiang Gao, an instructor in medicine at HSPH.
These findings confirmed the results of a 2005 study that found that users of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs—including ibuprofen—displayed a lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.
The current study focused on ibuprofen, which can be purchased over the counter in the form of popular brands such as Advil.
Over six years, 130,000 subjects self-reported their health statuses and specifically noted their use of ibuprofen and whether they had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.
The study found that 15 to 20 percent of participants regularly used ibuprofen, and 291 individuals were diagnosed with the disease within the six-year timeframe.
Despite the suggestions of a correlation between ibuprofen use and risk of Parkinson’s disease, the Harvard researchers said that the study’s findings cannot be used to reach any conclusions because the research was purely observational and did not examine causality.
The next step is to “take advantage” of the study’s findings by further exploring the relationship between ibuprofen use and risk of Parkinson’s disease, said Michael A. Schwarzschild, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and one of the study’s authors.
Schwarzschild said that it is not surprising that anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen may help reduce the risk of the disease, which involves inflammation of the brain. But scientists have yet to determine exactly why ibuprofen may be more effective as a neuroprotective agent than other anti-inflammatory drugs, Schwarzschild explained.
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurological disorder that progressively slows down movement. Dubbed “the shaking palsy” by its discoverer James Parkinson, the disease is characterized by a “rest tremor,” a steady shaking that typically begins in one hand while a patient is at rest, according to Schwarzschild.
The disease is also associated with dementia, depression, and other disorders.  According to the National Parkinson Foundation, 60,000 new cases of Parkinson’s disease are diagnosed each year.
The study—which will be presented in April at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in Toronto—also involved researchers Honglei Chen and Alberto Ascherio, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at HMS.

Childhood obesity prevention programs, often targeted at children ages 8 and older, should begin efforts to curb obesity at infancy or even earlier, according to researchers at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.
The study, published online Monday in the journal Pediatrics, tracked 1,826 women from pregnancy through their children’s first five years and finds that African American and Latino children in particular stand a much greater risk of being overweight.
Even adjusted for socioeconomic status, almost every known risk factor for childhood obesity occurs at higher rates among racial and ethnic minorities, lead author Medical School professor Elsie M. Taveras said.
Taveras, who directrs the One Step Ahead Program at Harvard-affiliate Children’s Hospital Boston, said that the study’s results will play a role in shaping childhood obesity prevention programs, as the research shows that earlier intervention is necessary especially among minority children.
Hispanic and African American mothers were more likely to be overweight when pregnant, and their children more likely to be born small, gain excess weight over time, get less sleep, and begin eating solid food sooner, the researchers found.
“We should be starting earlier especially if we want to prevent disparities in childhood obesity,” she said.
The researchers are currently examining the relationship between pregnancy risk factors, such as poor feeding practices or insufficient sleep, and infant health.
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mere months after the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species”, the finches that inspired Darwin’s theory of divergent evolution are once again at the forefront of scientific research.
A team of Harvard evolutionary biologists and applied mathematicians led by Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Arkhat Abzhanov published a study which reveals how variation in certain genes translates into observable phenotypic differences in the beaks of Darwin’s finches.
The team found that the link between genotype and phenotype—as it relates to beak shape—is much simpler than previously thought, with beak length, depth, and width each controlled by a single gene.
In addition, the order of the mathematical transformations necessary to create the different beak shapes and sizes corresponds to the taxonomical differences between the birds themselves.
Using a number of different analytical techniques, the team sorted 14 seemingly disparate beak shapes into three broader categories.
The team—which sought to apply quantitative methods to describe the beaks in a more mathematical way—conducted analysis that consisted of quantitative comparisons of the shapes of different species’ beaks, according to Otger Campàs-Rigau, a postdoctoral fellow in applied math specializing in morphogenesis, or the process by which an organism’s shape is determined.
“Scientists had wondered for a long time how different the beaks really are, and had analyzed their differences in a more qualitative way,” Campàs-Rigau said.
The team found that finches within the genus Geospiza all have beaks differentiated only by scaling transformations, with only a single gene controlling each of the three dimensions. But for Galápagos finches outside of Geospiza, higher order mathematical transformations were necessary to account for the physical differences in the beaks, Campàs-Rigau said.
According to team leader Abzhanov, the findings shed new light on the work of D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson, a Scottish biologist who used mathematics in the early 20th century to explore the morphological relationships between different species of crabs.
The Harvard team’s exposition of the scaling relationships present in the beaks of Darwin’s finches takes Thompson’s findings one step further.
Abzhanov said that the next challenge is for researchers to explain the genetic origins of the higher order transformations that account for the differences in beak shapes above the species level.
The team’s research was published in the Feb. 16 Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshmen who try to burn boats and call upon spirits in hopes of receiving blessings from the River gods this year will do so at the risk of getting arrested by the police, if plans discussed at yesterday’s Committee on Student Life meeting are carried out.
Committee members at yesterday’s monthly meeting approved plans to discourage the annual “River Run,” which they characterized as an unsafe, alcohol-laden pseudo-tradition.
“We’re trying to tell people they shouldn’t do it,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 about River Run after the meeting. “For those who blunder ahead, they will be met by law enforcement.”
The Harvard University Police Department as well as other police agencies will be stationed around the River Houses and at the Charles River Wednesday night to discourage and monitor unsafe freshmen activity, Dingman said. Freshmen receive Housing lottery results the following morning.
“The HUPD as well other local police jurisdictions are aware of the event and will work cooperatively to ensure that next Wednesday night/Thursday morning is safe for everyone involved,” HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano wrote in an e-mailed statement.
The administration has asked House Committees to refrain from promoting their Houses in Annenberg Hall until Housing Day, as Dingman and others believe that such displays of enthusiasm may spur freshmen to act out during River Run.
But Mather HoCo Chair David L. Billing ’11 said these regulations are overly strict as House Committees are not involved in River Run activities.
“Mather HoCo has never had anything to do with River Run. We’re not involved with that in any way,” Billing said last night. “River Run is a tradition that freshmen hear about from upperclassmen, and they do it regardless of what HoCos do.”
Houses have also been asked to bar freshmen from entering courtyards and engaging in underage drinking the night before Housing Day, which prompted Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 to quip that some wholesome freshmen activity may be welcomed.
“From the House’s point of view, the message I want to get to the freshmen is that quiet prayer in the Randolph Courtyard will be greatly welcomed by Adams House gods, whereas drunken howling is one of the best ways to guarantee that you’re not getting in,” he joked.
In an attempt to divert freshmen from River Run, the Freshman Dean’s Office has prepared alternative programming, including a t-shirt making event at Annenberg Hall followed by a dance.
“The message from us should be that we love celebration, but it’s got to be the right kind of celebration,” Palfrey said.
The committee also reviewed the Undergraduate Council’s recommendations for January term programming yesterday.
Committee members voiced general support for the idea of expanding on-campus programming initiated by student groups such as the Institute of Politics and Harvard Undergraduate Television.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Thursday morning, Calvin Miller waits for a 39-foot blue and white van to pull up on 577 Washington Street in Codman Square, Dorchester for his weekly primary care check-up.
The 30-year Dorchester resident, who is currently unemployed, first stopped by the Harvard Medical School-affiliated mobile health clinic four years ago out of curiosity.
“It was really good that I stopped, because I learned that my blood pressure was high,” Miller recalls. “But since I now come to the van, it’s started to drop.”
Founded in 1992 by current Medical School Dean for Students Nancy E. Oriol, The Family Van has been providing free health screenings at six sites in the Boston neighborhoods with the highest rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. A small staff of health professionals regularly sees residents like Miller for preventative screenings ranging from blood pressure checks to confidential HIV testing and counseling.
But like many other mobile health clinics in Boston, The Family Van was forced to slash its budget by roughly 20 percent—or a little over $100,000—in 2008 and to cut back on staff and services including community health awareness events.
Faced with a shrinking donor base, The Family Van—which relies on funding from the Medical School and state and federal foundations—hopes to increase its visibility to prime for a larger fundraising push, Executive Director Jennifer L. Bennet says.
“In this kind of economy, the need [for mobile health clinics] only increases,” Bennet says. “But it is tough to be able to sustain these programs—they’re not cheap.”
‘A VERY SICK COMMUNITY’
Twenty years ago, when Oriol was treating patients at Harvard-affiliate Beth Israel Deaconess Mecical Center, she was struck by the high rates of infant mortality in Boston, which she says are symptomatic of a “very sick community” suffering from great disparaities in access to care.
Oriol recalls spending the next two years networking with “everybody and anybody who was related to healthcare in Boston.”
“Eventually, after talking to many men on the street, the barber shop, we crystallized the idea of a family van,” Oriol says.
Serving approximately 5,000 patients a year, The Family Van focuses on cost-effective prevention with free tests and counseling services in Boston’s low-income neighborhoods.
The Family Van is estimated to save the healthcare system roughly $20 million a year by treating patients who otherwise would not have regular access to primary care and saving them the cost of potentially expensive emergency room visits, Oriol explains.
Harvard researchers estimate that The Family Van returns $36 for every $1 spent on preventative care, based on a formula developed and published last year in BMC Medicine, an online peer-reviewed journal.
“Our model is focused on prevention, and in this country, we don’t fund prevention, we fund illness,” Bennet says. “That can sometimes make it difficult to have people understand the impact and the value of prevention.”
VALUE OF PREVENTION
Four days a week, The Family Van makes its rounds through Boston neighborhoods, stopping at each designated site for three hours as patients enter the blue-cushioned compartment that serves as a mobile waiting room.
Behind sliding wooden doors, the staff begin patient check-ups by taking blood pressures and patient histories. Patients who wish to discuss more sensitive health concerns such as pregnancy or HIV test results are taken to a private room in the back of the van.
“The van creates a culture of wellness,” Bennet says. “People can come in without being judged for their illness.”
Manager of Direct Service Rainelle Walker-White stresses that the staff of The Family Van strive to listen to their patients as well as treat them.
“People come in, and we share and spend as much time as we can with them,” Walker-
White says. “This isn’t a doctor’s office. We are just what this neighborhood needs.”
Despite The Family Van’s emphasis on preventative measures and healthy lifestyle choices, Bennet says that the patient population consists primarily of minorities and low-income groups who do not have easy access to healthy foods.
McDonald’s golden arches are a common sight in these neighborhoods, and Bennet says thatthe availability of cheap, fried foods likely hinders efforts to lead healthier lives.
“One of the big efforts is to access fresh fruits and vegetables,” Bennet says. “But when they don’t have a car and the neighborhood is full of fast-food restaurants, you are really fighting an uphill battle.”
THE REGULARS
Miller was so pleased with The Family Van’s efforts to help him manage his hypertension that he encouraged a good friend living in the area to come with him on his weekly visits.
“We always call one another, and we always come,” Miller says. “Sometimes he picks me up by the hospital where I’m staying. Sometimes he calls me and both of us come.”
In Dorchester’s Codman Square, the van’s visitors tend to be elderly patients diagnosed with chronic conditions, who, without The Family Van’s services, would not be able to effectively manage their multiple illnesses, Bennet says.
After over a year since Family Van had to scale back on services and staff due to funding shortages, Bennet says that The Family Van was able to hire back some of its staff to full-time positions this January.
With a reduced operating budget of roughly $480,000, The Family Van is hoping to regain solid financial footing to offer its original range of services and possibly more, Bennet says.
“We had been slowly been building up donor base, but we saw a drop in donors on a group and individual basis,” Bennet says.
While funding from the Medical School has remained constant, Bennet explains that several foundations had to temporarily limit grant awards or eliminated funding completely due to the economic downturn.
“It’s always tough to get general operating support,” Bennet says. “You have to get people to appreciate that we need those costs to get care to people.”
Ruby Hubbert, a Roxbury resident and a regular, stresses that she would be upset to see Family Van cut back on curbside visits.
“I love it. They give you birthday cards,” Hubbert says. “Don’t stop it—it’s nice to have.”

Roughly three months since University President Drew G. Faust charged a newly created Work Team with recommending strategies for Harvard’s expansion into Allston, team members have started to make progress on exploring ways to use the University’s vacant property holdings in Allston.
In the past month, the Work Team—created shortly after the University announced that it would halt construction indefinitely on the Allston Science Complex due to financial constraints—has met with local community leaders and government officials to discuss Harvard’s immediate and future role in developing the Allston campus despite a drastically altered financial landscape.
At the Work Team’s suggestion, Harvard opened a free indoor ice skating rink on the site of Allston’s old Volkswagon dealership in January, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who oversees the University’s capital planning functions, said the University continues to look for novel ways of using vacant properites.
Going forward, Lapp said Harvard may continue development on the Science Complex with other academic institutions and other organizations.
“We’re doing a lot of work on that front, working with the provost and others to identify the academic priorities of Harvard and what might make sense in terms of building Allston and where partnering with some institutions might make financial sense as well,” Lapp said yesterday.
The 14-member Work Team is led by Harvard Business School’s Senior Associate Dean for Planning and University Affairs Peter Tufano ’79, Director of the Institute of Politics Bill Purcell, and Graduate School of Design Professor Alex Krieger.
Purcell empahsized that unlike committees or blue ribbon commissions, the Work Team’s progress is not defined by a specific time frame.
Instead, Purcell said, the team aims to focus on effecting change in the short and long term.
“If there’s something that can be done without knowing all of the answers for even the midterm then we should go ahead now if we can and make that recommendations as quickly as we know the answer,” Purcell said.
Since its creation, the team has met with members of the Harvard Allston Task force, a group appointed by Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, as well as local government officials, and Purcell described these discussions as fruitful and informative.
“These are the people who live with the neighborhood and community issues every day and every night and to know where they were and have a sense of their feelings about Harvard at this time was critically important to me,” Purcell said.
But Purcell acknowledged that at this point, there remain many unanswered questions.
“We all have questions,” Purcell said. “The good news is that there’s a real sense of optimism about our ability to answer those questions.”
Harvard Allston Task Force chair Ray Mellone agreed that last week’s meeting had been “a pretty good conversation.”
“Everybody that was anybody was at that meeting, you can’t do any better than that,” Mellone said.
He added that he hoped the University would continue further involvement with the community.
“We’re hoping for productive and meaningful collaboration in the future,” Mellone said.
But Task Force member Bruce Houghton said that while he thought the meeting was “very nice,” it was too early to tell what the Work Team’s efforts will result in.
“The proof is in the pudding, maybe they’ll do nothing,” he said.

Former U.S. solicitor general Seth P. Waxman ’73 is set to lead Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing board, for the 2010-2011 academic year, the University announced Wednesday.
Waxman will step into his new role as president following this year’s Commencement, and Mitchell L. Adams ’66, who is the executive director of the independent public agency Mass. Technology Collaborative, was elected vice chair of the Board’s executive committee by their fellow overseers at their February meeting.
“The past few years have been challenging ones for Harvard, no less than other institutions of higher education, but these challenges present real opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and leadership,” Waxman told the Harvard Gazette. In an interview with The Crimson, he added that he plans on taking his new position “very seriously.”
Both Waxman and Adams have held leadership positions on the Board of Overseers—Waxman currently chairs the board’s social sciences committee and previously led the committee on institutional policy. Adams is presently vice chair of the committee on schools, the College, and continuing education. Both have also been directors of the Harvard Alumni Association.
Waxman, who graduated summa cum laude from Havard before attending Yale Law School, is now a partner with the law firm WilmerHale in Washington, D.C., and a faculty member at Georgetown. He has argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court, according to an online biography, and was mentioned as a candidate to replace Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter before Sonia M. Sotomayor was appointed.
Vice chair-elect Adams, who received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1969, will bring financial experience to the post just a year after Harvard’s endowment lost $11 billion. Adams has served as a financial administrator for Harvard Medical School and the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
University President Drew G. Faust praised the dedication Waxman and Adams have shown on the board in a statement.
“I look forward to their leadership and to working even more closely with them next year,” she said.

Erez Lieberman-Aiden has already invented the iShoe (footwear that can diagnose poor balance in the elderly) and the Hi-C (a method to decipher DNA’s three dimensional structure).
After winning the 2010 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize on Wednesday, he will now have an additional $30,000 to pour into his creative efforts.
“It’s a huge honor,” said Lieberman-Aiden, a graduate student in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology who also studies applied math at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The award, given annually to MIT seniors or graduate students, recognizes rising inventors who demonstrate remarkable creativity, a “portfolio of inventiveness,” and potential to mentor future inventors, according to the Lemelson-MIT Program’s executive director Joshua Schuler.
“The way [Liberman-Aiden] engages problems is very impressive, and his work in linguistics, with the iShoe, and Hi-C blew us out of the water,” said Schuler.
In addition to studying applied math, Lieberman-Aiden has also worked in the fields of evolutionary linguistics, biotechnology, and sensor technology.
His most recent invention is a genome imaging technology that can track billions of interactions between fragments of DNA.
Calling Hi-C a radical extension of existing technology, Lieberman-Aiden said that the whole project had started with a simple question: Wouldn’t it be great if researchers could probe the entire genome’s architecture at once?
“I think it surprised a lot of people that the answer turned out to be yes,” he said. “Maybe that’s the core of what inventors do. They ask, wouldn’t it be great if we could do something? And if the answer turns out to be yes, they try to figure out how to make it a reality.”
According to Schuler, the selection committee was also impressed with Lieberman-Aiden’s ability to engage people and to inspire youth.
In 2004, he started a program with mathematics and biology professor Martin A. Nowak to mentor undergraduates and graduate students at the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.
Since then, Lieberman-Aiden estimates that he has mentored and collaborated with over 30 students.
Lieberman-Aiden also mentors undergraduates in the Idea Translation Lab.
Daniel D.B. Koll ’10, who started working with Lieberman-Aiden last semester in the Lab to develop a navigation device using 3-D sound, described Lieberman-Aiden as “a really cool and creative guy to work with.”
The Lemelson Foundation awards the U.S.’s largest cash award for inventions, the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize.
The Foundation also recognizes student inventors at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and California Institute of Technology.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly every day this February, Dana Roberts has made the trek across the river for softball practice, just as the senior has for the last three years. But when she comes out on the field now, she doesn’t lace up her cleats and start throwing warmup pitches. Instead, she takes a seat on the bench and takes a glance at the practice plan.
Roberts won’t be seeing any time on the field in her senior season. Instead, she’s embraced her new role as an assistant pitching coach.
“I still feel like I’m part of the team,” the senior says. “I’m just as invested in the team’s success—and especially the pitchers’ success—as I ever was before.”
For a player who spent the last five years of her career battling a nerve injury in her elbow that resulted in two surgeries and countless missed innings, the prospect of pitching through another season of pain seemed too much to bear.
So last summer, Roberts made the decision to hang up the glove for good.
“By the end of last season, it was just so painful, so frustrating, that I decided last June to just kind of throw in the towel,” she explains. “I’d given it my all—that was that. But I wasn’t ready to step away from the team.”
In September, Roberts and Crimson coach Jenny Allard worked out a plan—Roberts would stay with the team and use her experience to help guide a young pitching staff.
“She brings knowledge of each and every person on the staff,” Allard says. “She’s really invaluable in that role. She knows the game, she knows what it’s like to be out there. She knows how the pitchers really need to think and what their focus needs to be.”
After a standout career at Ramona High School, outside of San Diego, Calif., Roberts arrived at Harvard in 2006 ready to make an impact. And the rookie did just that, showing no lingering effects of her first elbow surgery, as she tied the Crimson single-season record with four saves.
Roberts saved her best pitching for the stretch, hurling 28-straight scoreless innings in April and recording both the division- and Ivy League Championship-clinching wins.
But the injury returned. Roberts went through another surgery during her sophomore year and would never pitch a full season again.
“Sophomore year, I didn’t pitch at all until spring break, and then I came in and pitched basically just the Ivy season and ended up having a good season,” she says. “[I] didn’t pitch at all last year until about spring break, and came in, and it had just gotten to the point where I knew that physically, even if I [was healthy] enough that I would be able to pitch, I wasn’t going to be effective out there on the mound.”
But the experience Roberts gained mentally—both as a reliever and battling through pain—makes her particularly suited to her new role as a coach.
“I had to rely on my mental game a lot,” she admits. “So I feel like…I’ve been able to help—especially [freshman] Jess Ferri and [sophomores Rachel Brown and Julia Moore], the younger pitchers—develop their mental game a little bit, kind of have a much more intelligent approach than in the past where there wasn’t as much communication between the coaches and the pitchers.”
That added mental dimension will be crucial to the team’s success this year, as Allard is asking a trio of young pitchers in Brown, Ferri, and Moore to step up and shoulder a large portion of the load on the mound.
The pitchers have already begun to see the benefits of Roberts’ work in practice.
“She’s been so much help, because she provides a really critical and analytic eye for us,” Brown says. “I’ll be working on a pitch, and she’ll see things that I don’t think of.”
But Roberts’ influence is not limited to the team’s young hurlers.
“I’m just so glad that she stayed with us, because she may not realize this, but we need her so much,” says co-captain Margaux Black, also a pitcher. “She has the best eye out there, because she’s not pitching, she’s not focused on herself, but she can focus on everyone else.”
“It’s definitely helped me personally, and just having her there next to me—it’s comforting,” Black continues. “She’s my teammate, she’s also my roommate, we’ve gone through this whole thing together.”
During practices, Roberts focuses solely on the four pitchers—running workouts, working on situational awareness, taking notes, and debriefing after scrimmages.
And Roberts makes her hybrid role as a coach and teammate an advantage.
“Dana has turned an injury into the best thing for the team,” sophomore shortstop Jane Alexander says. “They have so much trust in her because she’s a teammate, and so it really helps our staff to have someone they trust and respect helping them to get better.”
Having had a taste of the coaching experience as an undergrad, Roberts sees it as a path she may someday follow—a proposition Black heartily agrees with.
“I’ve always enjoyed giving pitching lessons and instructing—I get a lot of pleasure out of that,” Roberts says. “And this has been really rewarding for me, using my knowledge to help the rest of the team. It will probably be a while until I have any freedom to do that, but somewhere down the road I’ll probably end up coaching.”
But for Roberts, that decision lies far in the future. In the present, there’s just under a month before Ivy play opens—and with it, the last shot at a second Ancient Eight crown for Harvard’s six seniors.
Because when it comes down to it, whether she’s hurling strikes on the mound or making notes on the bench, Roberts just wants to do what she can for her team.
“Surprisingly, once I made the decision to stop pitching, everything got a lot easier,” she says. “[Once I] was able to throw myself into it knowing that my goals for the season have changed and the game path that I’m trying to make has changed—it’s actually been really rewarding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Game 6 of the 2003 World Series.
All eyes are on 23-year-old Florida Marlins pitcher Josh Beckett, starting on three days’ rest with his team one win away from beating the New York Yankees and clinching the title. But while most spectators are watching the ball fly out of Beckett’s hand as he dismantles the Yankees’ lineup en route to a complete-game shutout, Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh has his gaze set just above the open top button of Beckett’s jersey.
“He’s wearing the Harvard shirt,” Walsh remembers thinking. “You could see the ‘R’.”
Walsh and the Crimson had given Beckett a Harvard t-shirt when he joined the team for dinner on one of its spring break trips to Florida, and now it claimed a share—just a sliver, but a share nonetheless—of the spotlight on baseball’s biggest stage.
This is the reality of Joe Walsh. He is not, and probably never will be, a household name for fans of America’s pastime. Such is life in the Ivy League. But Walsh has lived the elusive dream of “getting a paycheck from doing something you love.” He’s an innovator, the first Northeast coach to hold a Scouting Day; he’s sent players to minor league fields and major league front offices; and, in the prestigious Cape Cod Baseball League, he’s coached some of the greatest athletes in the history of the game.
In his own way, through the countless relationships he’s forged over a career spanning three decades and a coaching philosophy rooted in a lifelong love affair with baseball, Walsh’s imprint on the sport can be felt at every level.
***
If Walsh never imagined he’d be a Harvard coach the first time he stepped onto the school’s baseball field, it’s probably because he had just jumped over the fence.
Suffolk University—where Walsh played college ball and began his coaching career—had no home field, so Walsh and his teammates would come across the river to Cambridge and use Harvard’s.
More than 30 years later, Walsh is the same blue-collar kid from Dorchester, still feeling most comfortable on the baseball diamond—regardless of its owner.
“You can’t be around Coach Walsh and not know how much he loves baseball,” says former Harvard pitcher Shawn Haviland ’07, now a farmhand with the Oakland A’s. “It goes beyond love—he lives baseball.”
Walsh also still carries an underdog mentality that got him through years of coaching a Division-III Suffolk team that managed to win despite negligible resources and prepared him as he made the transition to Harvard.
Before former athletic director Bill Cleary ’56 hired him in 1995, Walsh says there were doubts about his ability to make the switch to coaching Division-I talent. This was news to a guy who in 1988, his first year managing in the Cape League, had a first baseman named Dave Staton, “the greatest hitter who ever lived,” according to Walsh.
If even a serious baseball fan hasn’t heard of Staton, it’s because he only played 46 games in the majors. But the names of his backups might sound more familiar: Frank Thomas and Mo Vaughn.
After watching Walsh coach in the Cape (as well as pulling into work at seven in the morning to find Walsh waiting with a message: “No one wants this job more than I do.”) Cleary knew he had his man.
***
At Harvard—a place not normally associated with the plucky underdog—Walsh inherited a baseball team that lacked discipline and was unfamiliar with success. So while he had an endowed position and more financial security than he had ever experienced in his life, it was no time to remove the chip from his shoulder.
The first call Walsh received in his new office—which sported a “desk” made from a door resting on two file cabinets—came from a lawyer in Texas whose son had previously expressed interest in playing at Harvard.
“Coach, my son is thinking about going to Yale,” the lawyer said, “and I just noticed that the Yale coach has a professional background and you don’t. What is your background?”
“Well, I’ll give you my immediate background,” Walsh responded. “For the last 24 hours I’ve been in this office with a bottle of 409 cleaning fluid. Your son can go to Yale, and when we see him in the spring we’re gonna rip him.”
That season, Walsh instilled the same fiery spirit in a previously-lackluster Crimson team.
“He came in and changed the culture and the attitude of the program,” says David Forst ’98, now Oakland’s assistant general manager.
Harvard won the Ivy League title in 1997 and 1998, and the lawyer’s son never beat the Crimson, according to Walsh.

Walsh has had good seasons and bad seasons as Harvard’s coach, but his competitiveness, intensity, and love for the game have never wavered.
“He coaches not to lose,” says Peter Woodfork ’99, assistant GM of the Arizona Diamondbacks. “He pushes the envelope. He wants to win games.”
These qualities have transferred to many of his former players, who have passed on lucrative post-college careers in finance and consulting to keep playing baseball until “they rip the jersey off,” as Steffan Wilson ’08, a minor leaguer in the Brewers system who has been called to the major league camp in Spring Training, puts it.
With many of his former players working their way through the minors or taking positions in major league front offices, Walsh continues to be a valuable resource for those in the know.
“In addition to being an outstanding baseball person, his knowledge and experience is something that you don’t take lightly,” says Mike Hill ’93, general manager of the Florida Marlins. “[If] he calls you and he says there’s a player he likes, you take notice.”
But despite his extensive network throughout the broader baseball community, the Harvard coach is most concerned with what’s happening on the field—his field. Because while Walsh values what he’s done in the past, the real thrill comes from what’s next—the next pitch, the next inning, the next game. Baseball.
“I don’t think there’s a moment that passes where he’s not thinking about it,” Wilson says of Walsh and baseball. Then, echoing his former teammate Haviland, Wilson spells out the reality of Joe Walsh.
“He lives the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s nighttime, and the lights are on at a sports complex in Huntington Beach, Calif. Players jog onto the field and split off to their respective positions, with one heading towards the center of the diamond. It’s Jessica Ferri’s turn to pitch against the Corona Angels, a team she’s played against many nights during her time with the Valley Breeze 18U Gold travel team.
But tonight is different. Ferri knows that there is a set of eyes in the crowd intent on seeing her best throw. After all, it is recruiting season, and she has something that Harvard needs: a strong arm.
“I remember my junior games were very important,” Ferri reminisces. “One of my big games that contributed to me getting here was at an exposure tournament. I remember I pitched really well, and [a scout] was there. She was looking for performance, attitude, and skill level, and I guess I stood out.”
A junior at the time, Ferri was being recruited by a plethora of schools, but one stood above the rest. With her strong academics and desire to go to school in the Northeast, Harvard seemed to be the perfect choice.
But for the Crimson, Ferri was just one piece of the puzzle. Harvard was already in the process of enhancing its pitching rotation, having recruited another Californian pitcher the year before. A lot was resting on this recruit’s shoulders, and now-sophomore Rachel Brown delivered.
“Last year, I considered everything almost a pleasant surprise, because I had no expectations going into my first season,” Brown remarks. “This year, however, I have high expectations not only for myself, but also for the team. We’ve been training really hard, and I think especially after a disappointing loss to Dartmouth last year, we don’t want to lose a single game in Ivies this year.”
If this goal is to come to fruition, Ferri will have to live up to the standard of Brown’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year campaign. Brown posted 211 strikeouts on the season—a Harvard single-season record—and ranked ninth in the nation with 9.8 strikeouts per game. She was also named to the All-Ivy First Team after finishing the season with a 16-7 record, and, due to injuries in the pitching rotation, Brown was forced several times in the season to follow up complete-game starts with multi-inning saves—a burden that she didn’t mind.
“Pitching is a natural motion, and I got a little bit sore, but it was nothing,” Brown remembers. “There were no serious injuries, so I got lucky. I think it’s easy to get tired, but with softball pitching, you can pitch one game and then the next day go another whole game again, because it’s tired, but not sore.”
The prospect of hurling complete games doesn’t intimidate Ferri, either. She is used to the grind of a travel softball season—including days when the team would play six games.
“I wouldn’t be pitching all of them, but either way I had that experience,” she explains. “In travel ball, [the games] would be all against different teams, but now in the Ivy League we will play four games in a weekend. But it’s all the same team, so we will have to find ways to reinvent ourselves. Batters find ways to know what you throw and we have to find a way to throw them off.”
“I never had this intense of a workload, this intense of a competition,” she continues. “So I think that’s going to be an adjustment.”
Without having played a single game in college, the freshman still seems to know the way the system works and what to expect. All this could be attributed to Brown’s mentoring. From the start of the academic year, Crimson coach Jenny Allard paired the two pitchers to be buddies, a system to make the rookie feel included on the team and to ease her into life at Harvard. The two clicked right away.
“We went to ABP and had early breakfast and just talked about classes and other things other than softball,” Ferri says. “We get along very well. When I came in I was very intimidated, because she was incredible last year, and it’s warming and reassuring to see that she’s such a kind person.”
It’s not only these early morning Au Bon Pain meetings that helped the two get to know each other. Ferri also joined the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma, where she was again paired with Brown to foster their budding friendship.
“There’s a big Kappa contingency on the softball team, so Jess is actually my little sister,” Brown laughs. “[Senior Dana Roberts] is my big sister, so it’s kind of a pitching dynasty. So it’s fun. We like hanging out together outside of the sport.”
Ferri values the friendship that has sparked between the pair of pitchers, and she realizes that this friendship will translate into a dependence that will last until Brown graduates. The two will have to learn from each other in order to have a successful season on the mound this year.
“I’ve definitely gone to her for advice, and we have very different pitching styles,” Ferri acknowledges. “There’s a lot that I see in her that are things that I need to personally work on [in] my pitching, as well as presence on the mound. She’s so poised and confident. I feel like I learned a lot just from pitching alongside her.”
Allard sees Ferri’s motivation to excel and has no doubt that the rookie will have a positive impact on the season—and especially on Brown.
“In terms of how she’ll complement Rachel, I think she’ll make Rachel a better pitcher,” Allard says. “Not just because they’re going to be competitive, but simply because if Jess Ferri can have a great season and really establish herself as a strong starter, that’s going to make Rachel better because Rachel’s going to be fresh…and Rachel, given her year of experience, has the benefit of kind of mentoring Jess Ferri as a freshman pitcher. I think that they can feed off each other very well.”
Brown has full confidence that Ferri will excel in the Ivy League, especially with the assets that the young pitcher brings to the team.
“[Ferri] throws really hard,” Brown explains. “She’s very strong, so that definitely helps add to her speed. She’ll throw inside to batters, and batters just can’t keep up with her. She spins the ball so that batters miss. So she’s got a lot going for her: speed, location, and movement, which are awesome.”
With these weapons and Brown’s trademark rise ball, the Crimson has a legitimate shot at improving its record and ultimately beating out Dartmouth for the Ivy North Division title.
And at season’s end, Ferri could have a chance to pick up a Rookie of the Year prize to match her mentor’s.
“I have to remember that there are expectations, but I can’t worry about that,” Ferri says. “I have to worry about what is in my control. Rookie of the Year is voted by other people, so all I can do is worry about how I play. My focus is still [to] play my best and contribute to the team as much as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard softball team only graduated two seniors from last year’s squad, sophomore Jane Alexander feels like she’s stepping into a much larger void.
Bailey Vertovez ’09, a co-captain last season, was one of the Crimson’s most versatile players, seeing time at shortstop, pitcher, and in the outfield.  While Alexander will be expected to primarily play shortstop, she still feels the responsibility that comes with entering into a role previously held by such a seasoned veteran as Vertovez.
“You can’t fill Bailey’s role. She was such a great player and such a great team leader,” Alexander says. “Having a huge senior class helps with some of the pressure, though.  Having them means that I don’t have a huge role to fill on the leadership side, but I think that the team has decided as one to all step up and take a leadership role.”
Even though Alexander will begin her first full season as a starter, she has been around this block before.  She arrived at Harvard as a highly-touted freshman and was expected to get significant playing time alongside Vertovez.  But Alexander suffered tendonitis in her wrist last October and battled with it throughout the fall before facing a decision in the winter to either get surgery immediately or delay it until the summer.
She decided to forego the operation until the summer, but was plagued by injuries throughout the season and wasn’t able to contribute at the level she and the team were expecting.  She had cortisone shots in January 2009 to see if that would help anything, but Alexander acknowledges she may have played through the injury more than she should have, and as a result her injuries persisted throughout the season.
“Jane had some inconsistency last year because of the injury she suffered that was very distracting to her wrist and hands, but I think that she has really gotten herself to a good place both physically and mentally,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “She’s made huge strides this fall, and we’re really expecting her to just settle in and get a lot of experience and confidence. “
Entering an infield that is expected to be one of the best in the Ivy League will help Alexander gain experience early and get comfortable with her new role.
“We’re a veteran infield, and the best thing I can do is just to make sure that that infield stays solid,” Alexander says. “The best thing that I can contribute is just to make sure that nothing gets through our infield, and that we’re going to be the best infield in the Ivy League.”
While missing a full year of softball was frustrating for the sophomore, she succeeded in turning her injury into an opportunity to find new ways to help her team.
“I had never been out for that long in my life, and being out for that long makes you realize how much you really love the game,” Alexander explains. “We’re not in it for money, we’re not going to play professionally, we’re just in it because we love what we do.”
Alexander’s love for the team truly blossomed when she was faced with the task of not showing disappointment at her injury and instead doing everything she could to help from the bench—putting an emphasis on making sure the bench was impacting the game.  Whether it was letting the fielders know a runner was stealing, or making sure that everyone was excited, or helping players get hits, Alexander was able to realize the ways she could contribute to the team even without her bat and glove.
“She really ties everybody together,” senior Dana Roberts says. “She’s constantly checking in with everybody and making sure everybody is on the same page. You really feel her presence out there and know that she’s a strong leader.”
Although Alexander is eagerly awaiting the chance to take her leadership skills to the field after losing a year, she’s more interested in helping the team than proving to herself that she can do what was expected of her.
“Missing one year of your only four left to play is a big chunk. I definitely want to come out and play as well as I possibly can,” Alexander says. “Last year I put a lot of pressure on myself, and that’s why I played through the injury. This year I want to be there for my team, not for myself. I want to play for the Harvard Crimson and not for anything I think I should be doing.”
Despite being limited in her experience on the field, Alexander used the time during her injury to develop what initially brought her to Harvard: her love for the team atmosphere that surrounds Crimson softball.
During her recruitment, Alexander was set on Stanford until she visited Cambridge.  After seeing how tightly knit the softball team was, she immediately knew that Harvard was the place she wanted to play.  Now, she has the perfect opportunity to bring together her leadership, vocal presence, and on-the-field skills to contribute to the softball team in a unique way.
“Jane is a natural at shortstop—she knows the ball, knows the game, and moves well,” Allard said. “She really has some strong gifts, and we feel that she’s really ready to step up this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Harvard stepped off the Ivy diamond, it was after a heartbreaking 5-2 loss at home to Dartmouth, which clinched the Ivy North Division title for the Big Green and ended Ancient Eight championship hopes for the Crimson.
This season, a strong Harvard team looks to pick up where it left off last year, in search of retribution against Dartmouth and an elusive yet possible Ivy League title.
“If [losing to the Big Green] hurts this bad, there’s a reason for it,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard says. “And maybe this is what’s going to really motivate us [this] year.”
Of course, it’s not just Dartmouth that Harvard is setting its sights on this season.
“Basically, we want to beat everybody,” co-captain Margaux Black says. “Literally, everybody.”
The Crimson, which boasts an experienced lineup that includes six seniors, will rely on upperclassman leadership to carry the team.
“The coaches have to have the vision,” Allard says. “But the seniors sit at the front of the bus and they say, ‘This is where I’m going,’ and they get everybody on board. When you have more people in the front of the bus than the back of the bus, the bus really goes fast, and you don’t want to steer off course.”
The Harvard seniors are the only members of this year’s team with an Ivy League title under their belts, having won the 2006 championship. But the Crimson has experience up and down the lineup, returning seven position starters from last year’s squad—led by All-Ivy selections senior Jennifer Francis, co-captain Melissa Schellberg, and juniors Emily Henderson and Ellen Macadam.
But a strong class of seven freshmen expect to make an impact as well. Rookie outfielder Ashley Heritage adds her speed to Harvard’s repertoire, joining Henderson, last year’s Ivy leader in stolen bases, and Macadam as prime weapons on the base paths.
“The basic theme of the year is speed kills weak skills,” Allard says.
The Crimson has a very deep roster this season, especially  at catcher, as senior Jess Pledger, along with three freshmen—Megan Fazzio, Olivia Piccione, and Mariel Sena—could contribute from behind home plate.
“Player for player, this is the strongest team that we’ve had,” senior pitcher Dana Roberts comments. “And I feel like we’ve had a lot more focus, really good training through the entire month of February.”
Sophomore Jane Alexander, whose play was limited by injury last season, steps into the starting role at shortstop, while Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, is back for her fourth year as the starting third baseman. Returning starters sophomore Whitney Shaw at first base and Macadam at second base round out the infield.
Sophomore Mari Zumbro is no longer in the pitching rotation but will likely contribute defensively at the corners and offensively at the plate. Francis, who was one of Harvard’s two representatives on the 2009 All-Ivy First Team, returns to anchor right field, while senior Stephanie Krysiak and Henderson complete the outfield.
“We’re just trying to take all parts of our game and make them better,” Allard says. “We want our power hitters to really hit more home runs, deep balls, drive the ball deep. We want our contact hitters to be the toughest outs in the lineup, and we want our speed people to get on base. I think we’re looking to be more dynamic offensively.”
Last year, the young Crimson squad struggled with offensive inconsistencies. Harvard ranked first in fielding percentage and third in ERA in the Ivy League, but was sixth in the conference with a .267 batting average.
“It’s a matter of really pushing ourselves offensively,” Allard says, “and scoring the runs we need to score and having very timely hitting.”
This season, the Crimson defense—especially the pitching staff—appears to be the key to unlocking the team’s potential. Harvard returns sophomore Rachel Brown, last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year, to the rotation. Brown is coming off a season in which she set a new program record with 211 strikeouts, pitched 15 complete games, and earned first-team All-Ivy honors.
Joining Brown on the mound this season will be freshman Jessica Ferri, Black, and sophomore Julia Moore. All four of these pitchers will most likely be starters, giving the Crimson a more balanced rotation than it has boasted in the past.
“Our defense has been right on the mark,” Allard says. “That’s something that we’re confident in, we’re strong in. That’s something that we really need to feel, that our defense combined with our pitching can really limit and stop the opposition.”
Conference losses to division bottom-dwellers Columbia and Brown came back to haunt the Crimson last year as the season drew to a close, so it is a major goal of the team to limit early defeats in the hopes of securing its third trip to the Ivy League Championship Series in four years.
“Anything can happen,” Black says. “It’s a game of inches, so you’ve got to go out there with everything you’ve got, 110 percent, always. Any team can win. We play a lot of teams four times, so you just have to be on your game always and never take anyone for granted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cole Arledge takes a miserable cut and strikes out during a Harvard baseball practice. It’s been a long day, and the junior catcher throws his helmet down in disgust before walking off the field. A little up the third-base line, he sees a teammate taking his usual unorthodox swings at a ball in the grass. It’s far from perfect form, and despite his bad day, Arledge smiles. He can’t help it when Alex is around.
Three-year-old Alex Wawrzyniak doesn’t resemble the typical Crimson athlete, but he has certainly proven himself enough to earn a roster spot. While other ballplayers might struggle through evening practice after an exhausting day of class, no one thinks to complain when Alex arrives after his weekly chemotherapy.
Harvard’s honorary teammate suffers from Pilocytic Astrocytoma Low Grade Glioma, a form of cerebral tumor. Alex has gone through nine months of intensive treatment at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute following his diagnosis in April 2009.
“The MRI showed four tumors in his spine, like a cluster of grapes, and cancerous cells within his brain, like frosting on a raisin,” says Alanna Lopez, Alex’s mother.
The cancer is very treatable, and the early intervention has spared Alex unknown hardship. But the tumors did not spare his vision. As the low-grade gliomas crushed his optic nerve, Alex succumbed to a life of blindness before ever stepping on a baseball diamond.
“[Baseball] is one sport that I really wanted him to get into if he was going to do sports,” Lopez says. “So this is it. Because he’s blind, I don’t know if he can [ever play]. If anything, this is the closest to a team he’ll ever be.”
But as it turns out, Alex is much closer to the Harvard team than he or his mom could have ever imagined.
The Crimson met its new teammate through Friends of Jaclyn, a non-profit organization committed to pairing children with brain tumors with collegiate or high school teams. Much like the organization’s namesake, Jaclyn Murphy, drew inspiration from the Northwestern women’s lacrosse team during her battle with cancer, nearly 200 young patients have signed up to be matched with programs around the country.
“Our whole mission is to give kids some kind of normalcy in their life, after whatever hardships they’ve gone through,” explains Brandi Gordon, a Boston program coordinator for FOJ and a Crimson softball coach. “We try to provide them with love, support, and friendship through—in [Alex’s] case—30 guys who can be teammates and brothers. He is a part of their family now.”
The program has proven particularly effective in its outreach. Since Hippocratic laws prevent hospitals from disclosing patient illnesses, FOJ finds potential matches mostly through word of mouth. In Lopez’s case, a friend from chemotherapy facilitated the pairing, and as soon as the organization called, she knew it would be a perfect opportunity for Alex.
“It’s kind of like an escape from all his medical stuff,” Lopez says.
And so Lopez makes the 34-mile drive every week from their home in Marshfield, Mass. and plans to do so for each of Harvard’s home games. After all, she would never deprive the team of one of its integral members.
“It’s been awesome to have him around,” Arledge says. “I think that everyone brings something to the team. Some people bring numbers and home runs, some people bring defense, some people bring leadership in different kinds of ways, and then having Alex as part of the team—he really brings inspiration and perspective.”
While scouts might focus on production more than inspiration, anyone inside the program knows just how valuable Alex’s contribution is.
“Our game is a game of failure,” says Gordon. “A lot of times, you strike out or mess up and focus on that. Now that [the players] have something else to think about, a strikeout or an error [doesn’t] mean as much. It puts into perspective what things are dramatic when really this three-and-a-half year old has gone through more than most people ever will.”
It is not so surprising, then, that after Arledge’s whiff in practice, the sting of the punchout doesn’t last long. Watching Alex take wayward swings with unquenchable enthusiasm and a carefree smile, Arledge knows he is witnessing true perseverance and courage—even if Alex can’t pronounce those words.
“He battles with things every day, but he still has the outlook you would expect a three-year-old to have,” the junior marvels. “I gave so much credit to the [Northwestern] team for being great to the little girl, but what I realized is that the team that gets to help the kid out is the lucky one.”
Certainly the Crimson players know that they have the good end of the deal. When practice ends, the ballplayers return to a world of papers and exams, but so too does Alex return to a harsh reality filled with medical tests and debilitating chemotherapy. Life outside the stadium bubble is not always so carefree.
“It’s been a long [journey],” Lopez admits. “It’s very draining, mentally draining. It just takes a big toll out on you, but it’s brought us closer together.”
The Harvard team recognizes this burden and has wholeheartedly embraced the FOJ mission of providing comfort and showing love. In addition to sending messages to Alex’s CareBridge page—a portal for friends to leave words of support—a number of players have taken to calling their young teammate at home, making him feel like a true member of the Crimson family.
“He likes them all,” Lopez says of the baseball team. “But certain names stick out. He likes [junior pitcher] Zach [Hofeld]. And Cole calls almost every night to say goodnight.”
“I want to be able to brighten up his day, but I also want to talk to him on good days,” Arledge explains.
The junior, it seems, has responded most strongly to Alex’s experience. But Arledge takes no credit for going above and beyond to embrace his newest teammate.
“I think that anybody on the team would do it,” he says. “I don’t think it’s something unique that I’ve done. His mom says [calling] makes him happy, and what do I have to do? The walk from the yard to the quad, that’s 15 minutes right there.”
And in these little ways, the Crimson as a whole has rallied around Alex. Above all, Arledge stresses that the team sees its young friend as a full member of Harvard baseball.
“I’ve heard the word ‘honorary teammate’ thrown around,” Arledge says. “When I think ‘honorary teammate,’ I think Whoopi Goldberg and the Globetrotters—like honoring somebody. People really want to bring him in.”
“He has a locker in the locker room,” Arledge continues. “We taped over a name plate and wrote Alex on it. It’s right in the middle of everything.”
What Arledge doesn’t mention is that the locker is his, gladly sacrificed to give Alex a place among his heroes.
This locker symbolizes much of what Alex has come to mean to the Crimson. Right in the center of the Harvard family, the youngster provides a reminder of the world outside.
“I hope the [team] will get out of it as much as Alex gets out of it,” Lopez says. “[I hope it teaches them] to not sweat the small stuff.”
As the Crimson gains perspective from its new pairing, Alex also grows stronger with the team’s constant support. The chemotherapy will never return his sight, but it will give him a chance at a normal life—Lopez plans to enroll her son in preschool this year, where he will prepare for a full education in Braille.
But first, Alex has his work cut out for him. It’s baseball season, and Harvard needs each athlete to be at his best.
“[He’s] our secret weapon this year,” says Crimson coach Joe Walsh with a smile. “If you see someone walking up there to the plate looking for a walk, it could be Alex.”
Even if he takes three swings and strikes out, he’ll walk back to the dugout with his signature grin. After all, it’s only baseball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tyler Albright may be the first junior captain of Harvard baseball that coach Joe Walsh can remember, but the long-time catcher is no stranger to being in charge on the baseball field. That role comes naturally with being behind the plate.
“I think he was born in catcher’s gear,” Walsh says.
Actually, Albright started playing catcher when he was eight, taking the position for the first time in a little league practice.
And from that moment on, he knew it was where he belonged.
“You’re involved in every play,” Albright explains. “You control the game. I like being thrown in the action.”
Action hasn’t been in short supply for the junior captain since he arrived at Harvard, as Albright has been the starting catcher since his freshman year.
“I said, ‘Tyler, have you ever called your own game?’” Walsh recalls. “He said, ‘no,’ and I said, ‘Well you’re going to call one here,’ and he smiled.”
Albright has been in charge ever since, adding All-Ivy honorable mention honors his sophomore year. The junior was recently named the top Ivy League catcher by College Baseball Insider.
“He’s got a hose behind the plate,” Walsh says. “When he goes to a game that starts at 3:00, I think there’s going to be a lot of people coming at 2:30 to see the infield practice to see him throw.”
Albright’s arm, combined with his stellar field vision, can be quite intimidating.
“A lot of teams just won’t run on us because of Tyler,” Walsh observes. “A lot of that doesn’t show up in the stats. His presence really gives us a force behind the plate.”
Walsh is hoping Albright will emerge at the plate this season as well. Albright’s offensive numbers have improved over his two years with the Crimson, and Walsh thinks this might be the year for the catcher to make a name for himself with the bat.
“We need a force in the middle of the lineup,” the coach says. “We hope that force comes from Tyler. I think he welcomes the challenge.”
But while Albright will look to add to his offensive presence, defense has been his bread and butter from an early age.
“Growing up I always emulated [Ivan] ‘Pudge’ [Rodgriguez],” the California native notes. “He called the game well, [and] that’s my best asset.”
And just like Rodriguez, Albright seems to emerge as the preferred catcher wherever he goes.
“He played in the Cape Cod league this summer,” junior outfielder Sam Franklin says. “From what I have heard, it is the top league in the country. All the top pitchers [there] wanted him catching and calling the games.”
“When Shawn Haviland [’08] was in [the Oakland Athletics organization], he told me that he still hasn’t had anyone catch him as well as Tyler,” Walsh adds.
Albright’s popularity behind the plate should provide some assurance for the Crimson’s young crop of pitchers, who will be expected to perform early in their careers.
“Basically, I have to acclimate them into college,” Albright says. “It’s a different transition, especially having such a young staff. Last year we threw two freshmen against the No. 1 team in the country, and it’s going to be the same this year. I kind of have to keep them comfortable on the mound, keep them motivated, keep them focused.”
“For them, there’s no better person than Tyler,” Franklin says.
Walsh will also hope that Albright’s dedication to the game will rub off on the underclassmen. The standout from Long Beach, Calif. grew up with an ever-present mitt on his hand.
“Being from a warm weather state, I played baseball pretty much year round—summer ball, winter ball,” he recalls.
His practice paid off at Woodrow Wilson High School, when his team was named the National Champion by Baseball America Magazine his senior year. Albright also garnered a number of individual accolades, being named the Defensive Player of the Year by his team that season, as well as earning the squad’s MVP honor as a sophomore and Most Improved his freshman year.
From a team perspective, Albright hasn’t been able to replicate his high school success at Harvard. The Crimson has posted a losing record in each of the past two seasons, but disappointing finishes have prompted the ballplayers to change their mentality.
“This year as a team we have a group of leaders,” he says. “Players step up and look after each other…It’s good this year. It’s different than years past.”
At the helm of the turnaround is Albright, whose tireless work ethic has earned him the respect of his coaches and teammates.
“You take a day like today when we had a three-hour practice,” Walsh says. “After practice it was like, ‘let’s go to the track.’ He has the ability to catch both ends of a double header. He has a lot of enthusiasm. He never gets lazy…It gets a little contagious.”
“He’s just a great guy,” Franklin adds. “Everyone wants to follow him…It’s a great strength being around him…he’s the man.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, a string of untimely injuries forced the Harvard baseball team to put its trust in the hands of inexperienced freshman and sophomore pitchers. But this season, it’s looking like the Crimson’s pitching staff may just be the key to its success.
Harvard, which begins its season tomorrow against Notre Dame, will take the field with a strong and improved defensive lineup, hoping to build on last season’s 13-28 record.
“We think our strength this year is going to be on the mound,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh says. “We’ve got—to use a Harvard word—a ‘plethora’ of arms this year.”
The Crimson’s pitchers range from freshmen to seniors and include several players returning from injuries. Junior ace Max Perlman was dealt a serious blow last season when he injured his elbow in his first start of the year, but will be returning this spring after recovering from Tommy John surgery. Coach Walsh believes both Perlman and senior Jonathan Strangio have successfully recovered and are ready to start on the mound for Harvard.
“I think Perlman’s not only one of the best pitchers around,” Walsh says. “I think he’s capable of being one of the best pitchers East Coast, West Coast, or wherever.”
The Crimson will also be looking to pitchers who emerged both last year and in fall ball. Sophomores Brent Suter, Will Keuper, Jonah Klees, and Connor Hulse all made big contributions last season, with Suter leading the team in ERA, wins, and strikeouts.
“We think [Suter’s] going to battle out there, he’s just such a good athlete,” Walsh says. “Maybe one of the best athletes I’ve ever coached.”
Junior Zach Hofeld and freshmen Andrew Ferreira, Joey Novak, and Matt Doyle have also shown some impressive preseason play that bodes well for the next few months.
“I’ve got huge problems in the sense that we have guys that might not make a trip, and someday they might be starting for us,” Walsh says.
But Walsh realizes that his problems are good ones to have.
“I don’t know a coach who wouldn’t want it that way,” he adds.
The rest of Harvard’s lineup is characterized by a mix of returning players and rookies filling in some key positions left open by  last year’s seniors, such as sluggers Matt Rogers and Tom Stack-Babich. Junior Dillon O’Neill will play a crucial role in center field, while junior Sam Franklin and senior Chris Rouches, along with injured sophomore J.T. Tomes, are possibilities for the corner outfield spots.
Freshmen Rob Wineski and Dan Moskovits are in a battle for third base, and sophomore Jeff Reynolds is expected to get a look at second. Senior Dan Zailskas will likely return at first base, while junior Sean O’Hara will look to stay injury-free at shortstop. Finally, junior captain Tyler Albright will anchor the Crimson behind home plate.
Both Albright and O’Hara received preseason mentions in The College Baseball Insider for their impressive defensive play, but the 2009 squad’s strong graduating class left some serious holes at the plate with its departure.
“We’ve got some question marks,” Walsh says. “Is our lineup going to be one that’s going to hit a lot of balls out of the yard? No. But I think we’ve got some guys in there that every once in a while are capable of driving the ball.”
The Crimson will see how it fares in tomorrow’s season opener against the Fighting Irish in DeLand, Fla., at the Bright House Invitational.
The Invitational, along with the subsequent Metrodome Tournament, are part of a challenging early non-conference schedule that has become characteristic of Harvard baseball.
“Our first series, those teams have always been powerhouses,” Albright says. “Spring break is a transition—it’s a game a day. If we come off strong, we can get into the [NCAA] tournament.”
Coach Walsh agrees that the Crimson’s tough opening schedule sets it up for division success later on.
“We like to play those teams, we get better playing those teams,” he says. “And we expect to win.”
As for the other Ivies, results may be a bit unpredictable. Brown and Princeton both have strong left-handed pitching, and Columbia, Cornell, and Penn have all improved in recent years.
“I don’t see any team being dominant, but I don’t see any weak teams,” Walsh says.
The coach also points out that many Ancient Eight squads have lost more talent than they gained during the offseason. While one may be able to say the same about Harvard, Walsh sees his team’s youth in a positive light.
A senior-dominated program could be a great advantage in the future, but the coach is quick to emphasize that the current season is clearly top priority.
“I’m not here to go through the motions,” Walsh says. “We want to win, we want to be a good ball club.”
The Crimson players share the sentiment and are making their intentions just as clear.
“Everyone’s just hungry to win,” Albright says. “And we’re ready to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy gauntlet is almost over. One more weekend (and a Tuesday game featuring Penn and Princeton) and the book on this historic season will be closed. After all the spilled ink on the Ancient Eight, the results have panned out predictably: Cornell will clinch the Ivy bid, Harvard and Princeton will battle for a post-season tournament, and the rest of the Ivies will fight for respectability.
As this edition of Around the Ivies is the year’s last, it is time to hand out the hardware. Without further delay, here are the definitive, unambiguous winners of the 2009-2010 season.
The Game of the Year is usually reserved for a close contest with a dramatic finish, but this year it goes to a 15-point blowout.  Penn’s upset over the Big Red on Feb. 12 stunned the college basketball world—some called it the biggest upset of the year. Cornell had just landed at No. 22 in the polls and the Quakers were 3-15, looking for some way to salvage their season. A 15-0 run to start the second half propelled Penn to an improbable win, and, as the final horn sounded and fans rushed the floor, college basketball was reminded that any team can be king for a night.
The Ivy League has many candidates for Coach of the Year. The Big Red’s Steve Donahue led an Ancient Eight team into the Top 25 for the first time this millennium; the Tigers’ Sydney Johnson has taken a handful of relative unknowns and produced a winner; and the Crimson’s Tommy Amaker has brought a young squad to the top of the conference. Because Donahue has already won two Ivy titles with the same cast of characters, the race comes down to Johnson and Amaker. Perhaps this weekend will swing my vote in the other direction, but, at the moment, Harvard’s resume is simply better than Princeton’s. The fact that the Crimson has found this success with only four upperclassmen (only two of whom were healthy for much of the season) has at least something to do with Amaker’s coaching, and for that reason, he wins out.
Without a doubt, Rookie of the Year goes to Harvard forward Kyle Casey. His teammates Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster had good freshman campaigns; Brown’s Tucker Halpern and Tigers forward Ian Hummer have showed flashes of promise; but Casey is the obvious choice. The first-year has averaged 10.5 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, second and first on the team, respectively. He shouldered the burden of Harvard’s frontcourt for much of the Ivy schedule after injuries sidelined several big men. More was asked of Casey than of any other rookie, and time after time he delivered.
Lastly, the four finalists for Player of the Year: Quakers point guard Zack Rosen, Crimson guard Jeremy Lin, Cornell forward Ryan Wittman, and Big Red big man Jeff Foote. No player means more to his team than Rosen, but Penn’s poor record hurts his case. Lin is surely the most complete player in the Ivies, as he ranks among the top five in scoring, assists, steals, and blocks—and he is certainly a deserving candidate—but I want to reward the best team, Cornell. Of the Big Red’s two stars, Wittman, with his smooth shooting, is the more skilled player and better prospect, but I don’t think he is more valuable to Cornell than Foote. No Ivy team can match up with the seven-footer. On defense he forces opponents out of the paint, and on offense he demands a double-team and frees up the Big Red’s shooters. If Player of the Year should go to the most valuable player on the best team, then Cornell’s Jeff Foote is the deserving recipient.
HARVARD (20-6, 9-3 Ivy)                          at PENN (5-20, 4-7 Ivy)
For the first time in months, Harvard is back to full strength. Every player that started the season healthy should be able to finish healthy. This recovery is bad news for the Quakers. Penn is better than its record and capable of beating any team in the league, but it lost handily a few weeks ago to a short-handed Crimson squad. Winning at the Palestra is never easy, but Harvard, coming off three straight 20-point wins, is peaking. I see the Crimson winning by double digits.
Pick: Harvard 74, Penn 63.
COLUMBIA (10-16, 4-8 Ivy)                      at YALE (11-18, 5-7 Ivy)
This game will help sort out the middle of the conference. Columbia presently sits in seventh but would likely move into fourth with a weekend sweep. Yale is fourth as of now but hasn’t beaten a team not named Dartmouth in a month. The last respectable team it beat: the Lions, by 15.  The contest will likely be a shootout between Bulldog guard Alex Zampier and Columbia guard Noruwa Agho, two of the top five scorers in the league. I like Zampier and his supporting cast more, so I give Yale the edge at home.
Pick: Yale 71, Columbia 62.
CORNELL (25-4, 11-1 Ivy)                           at BROWN (11-18, 5-7 Ivy)
The Big Red can clinch the Ivy title outright on Friday night. The Bears played Cornell tough in their last matchup and even held a lead in the second half, but the Big Red showed its dominance by pulling away late. Brown forwards Matt Mullery and Peter Sullivan offer some resistance on the inside to Cornell’s Foote, but the rest of the floor is filled with mismatches. The Big Red will take care of business and be Dancing in the NCAA tournament with its third consecutive Ivy title.
Pick: Cornell 76, Brown 61.
DARTMOUTH (5-21, 1-11 Ivy)                    at PRINCETON (17-8, 8-3 Ivy)
The Big Green circus makes a stop in Princeton, N.J., as its show is finally coming to a close. The Tigers, whose three-point loss to Cornell bumped them from second to third place, need to win if they have their sights set on the postseason. Dartmouth should not prove to be much of an obstacle. Princeton will win handily.
Pick: Princeton 62, Dartmouth 47.
CORNELL at YALE
This contest is the final regular season game for the most dominant senior class in recent Ivy lore. Yale will bear the brunt of Cornell’s assault one final time before the rest of the Ancient Eight lets out a collective sigh and says good riddance to this Big Red dynasty.
Pick: Cornell 80, Yale 65.
COLUMBIA at BROWN
If the Lions pull out a win in New Haven on Friday, this game will be for fourth-place in the conference—high stakes, I know. Brown’s got a bright future with all of its players returning next year, so a fourth-place finish might be a nice springboard into a title run next year. I see them picking up the victory on a Senior Night without seniors.
Pick: Brown 67, Columbia 60.
DARTMOUTH at PENN
Combined, these two teams have 10 wins. The next-worst team in the league, Columbia, has 10 wins on its own. It’s been a long season for the Quakers and the Big Green. Penn is the better team, and they should win, but both teams will be glad to turn the page on a forgettable year.
Pick: Penn 65, Dartmouth 58.
HARVARD at PRINCETON
Far and away the best game on the weekend’s schedule, this contest could effectively be a play-in game for a postseason tourney. The Tigers pulled out a gut-wrenching win at Lavietes Pavilion a few weeks ago against an undermanned Harvard team. Now at full strength, the Crimson will look for retribution, but it will be no easy task—only seven times in league history has any team swept the Killer Ps on the road. Lin’s 26 points against Yale suggest there’s still some gas left in his tank, and I think he can carry Harvard to one final win.
Pick: Harvard 55, Princeton 53.
RECORD LAST WEEK: 7-1 (To date: 30-10)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a convincing sweep of the Princeton Tigers in the first round of the ECAC playoffs last weekend, the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team only has one thing on its mind as it moves on in the tournament: retribution.
The team heads to Potsdam, N.Y., tonight to face off against the No. 6 Clarkson Golden Knights, who beat the Crimson 2-1 in Cambridge in early November. The two teams then tied 3-3 at Cheel Arena on Feb. 20.
“I definitely think we have a good sense of what kind of team they are this year, what their strengths and weaknesses are,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said.
If Harvard wins, it will then either travel to No. 8 Cornell or come home to play Rensselaer in the ECAC Championship game Sunday night. Harvard did not win any of the games it played against the Big Red and the Engineers during the regular season.
“I think with all three teams that we could play, we’ll have a little bit of revenge hopefully for all of them, with what happened during the regular season,” Farni said.
Though the team is likely to earn a spot in the eight-team NCAA tournament even with a loss Friday, the Crimson is still planning to give the ECAC tournament everything it has got.
“We don’t just want to settle for getting to the NCAAs,” said freshman forward Jillian Dempsey, who was named to the ECAC All-Rookie team. “We want to be the best we can be, and with our team we can definitely win the ECACs, so we're going to put all of our effort and energy into winning every game here on out."
Harvard has to at play Clarkson, and potentially at Cornell, despite its higher national ranking because those two teams had more points than the Crimson in ECAC play. If Harvard can win the conference tournament, it would likely earn one of the NCAA’s top four seeds, guaranteeing Harvard home ice in the first round.
“That would be huge if we were able to get home ice advantage,” said junior forward Kate Buesser, who was named first-team ECAC after ranking second in the league in scoring with 32 points. “We usually play a lot better with the energy of the crowd, and we know our rink a little bit better.”
To even get to that point, the Crimson will still have to take care of business against the Golden Knights and either the Big Red or the Engineers. Neither game will be easy—two are top-10 teams in the country, the other is coming off a five-overtime win over Quinnipiac in the longest NCAA women’s hockey game in history.
Against Clarkson, Harvard will have to find a way to shut down Golden Knights’ captain Britney Selina, the team’s all-time leading scorer and finalist for the ECAC Best Defensive Defenseman Award. The Clarkson offense also features third-team all-ECAC forward Dominique Thibault, second in the ECAC in goals with 21 and points with 39. Forward Juana Baribeau and left wing Melissa Waldie both have 16 goals on the year as well.
But the Crimson feels it has a plan that can counter the Golden Knights’ high-powered offensive attack which led the ECAC with 96 goals during the regular season.
“They’re clearly a bigger, more physical team than we are,” Dempsey said. “So we know that one of the better ways to beat them is by using our speed, moving the puck quickly, and outworking them in the corners.”
“I think with our team speed they’re definitely a team we can take advantage of in that way,” added Farni. “They have some really strong players but I don’t think their speed is necessarily up to the same level as ours.”
Between the pipes for Harvard will be freshman Laura Bellamy, who will have to adjust to playing in her first one-game elimination matches from here on out. The Crimson defense, which was second in the ECAC with just 1.42 goals allowed per game during the regular season, is headlined by third-team all ECAC performer Leanna Coskren.
The Clarkson defense is also strong, led by senior Carlee Eusepi. Eusepi was second in the conference in plus/minus during the regular season, and fellow defenseman Tegan Schroeder was tied with Selina for fourth in that category.
In net will be junior goalie Lauren Dahm, whose .937 save percentage was fourth-best in the conference during the regular season. Both Eusepi and Dahm joined Selina on the all-ECAC second team.
Against this stalwart defense, the Crimson will have a hard time replicating the 4.5 goals per game that it averaged versus Princeton last weekend.
“The Clarkson defense is very good, so it’s going to be almost a logic game trying to figure out how to beat them,” Buesser said. “One of the things we have to do is continue to forecheck their defense. The more pressure we have down there, the more time we have in their zone, the better our chances are.”
Buesser leads a Harvard attack that also features Dempsey, junior forward Liza Ryabkina–who had three goals last weekend–and senior forward Randi Griffin.
Crimson coach Katey Stone, who broke the NCAA Division I wins coaching record last weekend, has let her offense know that aggressive play is the best way to achieve success.
“Coach refers to the battles right in front of the net as the ‘mud areas’,” Dempsey explained. “This past weekend we were really just sacrificing and getting in the mud to get the job done...We were hungry, so we were just going at them, and I think that will be the same this weekend.”
If Stone's advice is true, for Harvard to pull out a victory on Friday night and win the ECAC Tournament Sunday, Dempsey and her teammates should be ready to get down and dirty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s do-or-die for the Harvard women’s basketball team.
After dropping games to Dartmouth and Princeton earlier in the season, the Crimson (18-7, 9-2 Ivy) needs to win every remaining game in its schedule to maintain a shot at capturing its 12th Ivy League title.
Coming off two weeks on the road, Harvard makes its return to the Lavietes Pavilion tonight to face Penn (1-24, 0-11 Ivy). In the last match-up, junior guard and co-captain Christine Matera led the Crimson with 19 points to hand the Quakers a 66-40 loss.
But despite Penn’s lopsided record, Harvard is careful to avoid the trap of complacency.
“Penn has a new coach, [Mike McLaughlin], and they have a not-so-good record, but he has done a great job and his kids are playing as a team,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “Even though Princeton is the team to beat this weekend, we’re trying to treat Penn the same way.”
Junior forward and co-captain Claire Wheeler expanded on her coach’s ideas.
“Penn’s record shows that we’re a better team because they haven’t won as many games, “ she said. “But, the thing is, the Ivy League is really competitive. On any given night, any team could lose to the other team.”
The Quakers, in fact, have a rather unique weapon in their arsenal. Most teams tend to carry a handful of dangerous players to watch, but Penn has broken away from this tradition. “The danger of Penn is the opposite,” Delaney-Smith said. “They have a bunch of players and on any given night one can hurt you.”
Harvard’s seven game winning streak, then, should prove a valuable asset coming into tonight’s game.
“We’ve been away and we’ve had some real battles,” Delaney-Smith explained. “I’m proud of how our team came out with the winning streak.”
The Crimson’s recent victories also proved to be team-building experiences. Wheeler attributed newfound confidence in practice to the team’s strong play against Yale last Saturday.
“The Yale game this past weekend was a team effort,” Wheeler said. “Everyone from the starters to the bench contributed. We keep getting better, and we emphasize that in practice. We remind ourselves that we’re raising the bar for ourselves and that we have our own standards we’re trying to reach.”
Harvard has also been practicing hard on the fundamentals of the game.
“Our main focus is defense and rebounding and making sure we outrebound other teams,” Matera said.
“We really needed to work on [defense and rebounding],” Wheeler added. “From that, it makes it easier to have an offensive flow.”
This dedicated practice in both defense and offense has allowed many of the Crimson athletes to put up strong numbers.
In her rookie season, freshman guard Victoria Lippert has performed with admirable consistency. Posting her third double double against Yale last weekend, Lippert is second on the team in scoring with 13.0 points per game.
“It’s obvious what Victoria is doing on the court,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’re not surprised. She’s a downright competitor and she’s very talented.”
Junior forward Emma Markley has also been instrumental in Harvard’s strong play this season. She currently leads the team with 14.2 points, 2.7 blocks, and 7.2 rebounds per game.
“Markley has been very consistent all year,” Delaney-Smith noted. “She’s been dominant and consistent as a shot blocker and a rebounder.”
Delaney-Smith was careful to point out the importance of Matera’s play as well.
“She’s been one of the top shooters in the league,” Delaney-Smith said. “People think she’s just a shooter but she’s not. She brings so much more to the team. She’s a tough, hardnosed kid and she knows the game well. She’s been through injury, through good and bad, and she’s been a leader.”
As point guard, sophomore Brogan Berry has also been essential in the Crimson’s success. Entering the final weekend of the season, Berry has 143 assists. She needs only two more to reach eighth place on Harvard’s single-season assists list.
“You can never say enough about someone like Berry,” Delaney-Smith explained. “Point guards are the pivotal position on any team...What a point guard does and brings to a team is irreplaceable and invaluable. She’s one of the best if not the best that’s played at Harvard.”
The Crimson will seek to maintain this high level of play and hopes to emerge from tonight’s game victorious. In doing so, Harvard will hold onto its undefeated home-court record and keep the race for the Ancient Eight title alive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s tourney time for women’s hockey, and with the end of the regular season also comes a slew of regular-season prizes.
Junior Kate Buesser and freshman Jillian Dempsey are both up for two of ECAC Hockey’s biggest individual accolades.
Buesser, a forward, is a top-three finalist for ECAC Player of the Year after earning a spot on the conference first team last week. The junior has stepped into the void left by the graduation of Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Jenny Brine ’09, and Sarah Wilson ’09 to lead the team with 38 points on 15 goals and 23 assists.
Buesser is tops in the ECAC with a +26 ranking, and was the conference’s second-leading scorer in league games. She is competing with Dartmouth senior Sarah Parsons and Cornell sophomore Catherine White, both forwards, for the prize.
Dempsey, a center, is one of three candidates for the conference Rookie of the Year prize. She is second on the Crimson with 26 points and is 10th among rookies nationally with 0.86 points per game. Big Red defenseman Laura Fortino and Quinnipiac goaltender Victoria Vigilanti are the other two finalists.
Buesser, Dempsey, and No. 4 Harvard take on No. 6 Clarkson in the ECAC semifinals tomorrow night in Potsdam, N.Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wednesday afternoon the Harvard men’s lacrosse team faced a non-conference opponent, the Georgetown Hoyas, in a televised contest played at Georgetown. The Crimson is poised to be a top team this year, returning its leading scorers from last season and welcoming one of the most talented freshmen classes of any team in the nation. Harvard fell to the Hoyas on Wednesday, but the Crimson’s offense was relentless, especially in the closing minutes when it tallied four goals in two minutes en route to falling by one, 13-12.
That Harvard will have a strong offense again this year is certainly expected, but I, for one, have been wondering what the condition of their defensive line will be after graduating several starters including goalie, Joe Pike '08. If senior Ben Smith’s early season contributions are any indication of how the defense will play, then I’d say the defensive line is going to be very solid this year.
In the first two games of the season, Smith has already tallied two goals for the Crimson. Smith scored against Canisius in the season opener at Harvard last Saturday. His score came after the defense pushed the ball up field and carried the action into the offensive zone, creating an opportunity for Smith to have a shot on net. After three years on the roster and plenty of game action in the past few seasons, this was Smith’s first collegiate goal. The goal was not a fluke or a stroke of luck by any means though. On Wednesday, in the tough battle with the Hoyas, Smith again netted a goal.
Smith's versatility on the field perhaps indicates some untapped potential to his game. Whatever the cause of his newfound ability to drive to the goal, it is certainly a harbinger of great things to come for both Smith and the rest of Coach Tillman’s defense.

Bored with Busch? Think Natural  Ice is nasty? Reeling over Rubinoff?
Every day, we try to bring  you news worth reading, but now we're going to try to give you news  that you can drink. Every week, a local mixologist from a local bar  or pub will put together a drink that they think represents a recent  campus news item.
So sit back, grab a drink (that’s  a virgin drink if you’re under 21) and enjoy this week’s Crimson  Cocktail.
The  Story:
Wyclef Jean took Harvard by  storm during these past few weeks, speaking at a luncheon and receiving an award for his efforts in disaster-relief  for Haiti. The Artist of Year left us with both laughs and a stern message:  “As the news cameras go down, let’s keep fundraising, sending doctors  and helping rebuild the infrastructure of Haiti.”
The Drink:
Wyclef’s Haitian roots and  sunny demeanor both came to the fore at Cultural Rhythms. In honor of his  tropical birthplace and his continued efforts to exert a positive influence on an area that needs it like no other, we bring you the Upside-Down  Pineapple Cake, a concoction recommended by Grafton Street Pub &  Grill’s expert bartender Paulo. Paulo showed us how to make this  subtly fruity summer drink, and now, we'll show you how to make your own.
Ingredients:
1. Pour some Stolichnaya Vanilla  Vodka.
2. Mix with Pineapple Juice.
3. Add a splash of Jero Grenadine.
And you’re done! Proportions  may vary, but the end product is a fruity drink with only a hint of  that harsh alcoholic taste. For a virgin version of the drink, try replacing  the vodka with a vanilla flavored beverage of your choosing. Of-age  drinkers should enjoy this cocktail in warm weather for the complete tropical  experience. Alternatively, you can sit in front of a heater and pretend  it’s not 30 degrees outside. Enjoy!

According to the newly released Currier House video “I Love Chaus,” natural selection has weeded out Currier as the most awesome House in the jungle.
Created by Cristoforo A. Magliozzi ’11 and Currier HoCo Social Chairs Alex P. McAdams ’11, and Mark E. Piana ’11, the catchy rap voiceover constantly refers to a fundamental principle: “I want to live in Currier for the rest of my life.”
With parties in the Fishbowl and apparent wellsprings of beer—and the absence of nasty bedbugs and noisy traffic—this vid claims that C-Haus has it all. (Although there is a frame depicting a student racing to catch the shuttle in his underwear….at least they're being upfront about it.)
Definitely check out the video for some pretty cool shots and special rewind effects.  Magliozzi mentioned that he wanted to create a film with a lot of replay value, so he hid some treasures for the careful observer.  Here are a couple to get you started:
*The newspaper on the table in Currier’s dining hall features a headline about a gas leak in Adams. Guess Adams just can’t catch a break in Quad videos.
*The top card in the deck that starts off this reverse shot sequence has been altered to say “King of Trees” and show the Currier symbol.
Also entertaining is the “evolution of houses” representation that depicts nature working its magic on houses over time, improving Adams to make Eliot and so on with Quincy, Dunster, Lowell, and finally C-Haus.
“Currier is a very welcoming, social, open place with a tremendous sense of community,” Magliozzi said. ”The group involvement you see house-wide in that video is indicative of the house in general.”
By the way, for those who want even more C-Haus love, Andre Pineda ’11 has a treat for you: pro-Currier lolcats.
Has your House produced its own video (or lolcats)? What other Housing Day antics can we expect? Tell us at flyby@thecrimson.com.
