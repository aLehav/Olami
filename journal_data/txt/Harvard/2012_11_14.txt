After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You are almost not a real member of the millennial generation if you do not have, somewhere, a certain collection of cartridges in a cardboard box. Edge connectors choked with dust, labels eroded, and booklets ripped—they fan out amid nests of useless cable in a familiar rainbow of Red, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Blue. I mean, of course, the Pokémon games—the great mass hysteria of our youth.
What made the Pokémon series so engrossing? The narrative of the games is straightforward, repetitive, almost so formalized as to be suffocating. You wander, catch, battle, gym-challenge, heal, lather, rinse, and repeat, and all in environments that differ slightly only in the most superficial sense. There are, everywhere, gyms and high grass, Pokécenters, Pokémarts, and Pokéballs. There is always another confrontation with Gary on the horizon, always another convalescence with Nurse Joy. Even the music rarely changes—that maddening eight-bit music which once heard can never be forgotten. What is it, then, that made us so crazed—that made us whine, in the cacophonous voice of an entire generation: “Mommy, I’m in a battle and you are making me die!”
The fundamental reason for the intense emotional investment that a game like Pokémon elicits from its youthful users is that the player-character at any given point represents only the game player’s own choices. There is a reason that the main character is such a cipher, so completely without personality. It makes the player’s choices—the trainer’s team—stand out as the only significant content of the game.
At the end of Super Mario, who wins? Mario wins—you have only lent your dexterous fingers to his eternal cause. Mario belongs to the world of forms, and your own mediocre Mario will never be anything other than an instantiation of this ideal Mario—this Platonic essence of Mario who never misses a Koopa or Coin.
But at the end of Pokémon, the winner is you, and this is because the player character signifies nothing beyond the gradual accumulation of player choice. Pokémon is always personal. Beneath the formulaic and repetitive surface story—Trainer goes to Pewter City, Trainer is attacked by Gary, Trainer is defeated by Brock—there is the player’s self-reflexive narrative of decision and consequence, cause and effect. “I can’t catch Mewto,” you lament, “because I used my Master Ball on Ditto.” “I can’t defeat Brock’s Onix,” you whine, “because I chose Professor Oak’s Charmander.” And when you do win, the triumph is yours alone. The sweaty-palmed and hyperventilating child who defeats the Elite Four does so with a team that has been constructed over the course of several weeks or months of painstaking hunting and selection, culled from an infinity of chances and choices.
It is in this that Pokémon achieves a pinnacle of fictional representation unique to real life and to games: the experience of the self as the contingent result of a history of decisions. No novel or other work of fiction can do this, because it will always have the immense drawback of having already been written. But Pokémon, for all its monotony, is infinite, and if our cartridges gather dust and clutter eBay, it is only because we have abandoned the game.

Do you believe in the Artist? It’s a loaded question, to be sure: the word “believe” already carries with it connotations of faith, dedication, and worship of a higher, mystical being, while “artist” is a title that asserts authority, individualism, and universality all on its own terms. But as melodramatic as it might sound, it’s a serious issue worth examining, as the endless idealization of the creative figure throughout history has prompted the emergence of a dangerous cult of believers. I, myself, was once a member.
It is easy to fall for the Artist—that figure sitting atop a cult of personality, every move perceived as an act of creative genius, a critical darling with unusually popular appeal. Thanks to the gripping prose of many a romanticized New Yorker profile and America’s own historical allegiance to supposedly rugged individualism and celebrity culture, the Artist has worn many iconic faces. At times he—and the Artist is almost always a “he”—has appeared as the intense brooder with brush in one hand and liquor bottle in the other. A cigarette might have once sat behind his now self-mutilated ear. At other times he has worn a furrowed brow beneath an understated bandana, playing the role of misunderstood genius, too sensitive and self-conscious for his own good.
While some may find it easy to dismiss these sketches as mere clichés, as descriptions fit only for hipster Halloween costumes, I find that most people actually find themselves allured by the magical opacity of the Artist. But like all magic, the Artist’s appeal is a trick that we are all too comfortable buying. In fact, the very existence of such a collective notion of creative genius reveals more about our own insecurities and needs for identification than the actual human being at hand. Moreover, it creates certain preconceptions and problematic pressures for those individuals who are still testing the waters of creative expression.
For one thing, the belief in the Artist mistakenly assigns a certain look and feel to talent itself, presupposing that innate skill will and must manifest itself in a particular persona. If, let’s say, we make the Artist out to be a bold revolutionary, someone who valiantly battles societal conventions, then we might forget that true talent (and true revolutionary potential) may be found equally in timid and initially hesitant individuals. On the other hand, if we always associate the Artist with silent pensiveness and reclusion, we might be too quick to dismiss his garrulous counterpart, assuming that compulsive outspokenness is somehow meaningless noise compared to the repressed, churning ideas of the reserved introvert.
Once the grand title of Artistry has been attributed to an individual, cultural critics quickly fall into the trap of projecting predetermined opinions in hopes of merely affirming their belief in the Artist’s existence. Take, for instance, the many notes, sketches, and diaries that galleries and publishers have exhibited after a particular artist’s death. This impulse reveals a desire to bestow brilliance upon what may have been simply a discarded draft or working scrap of paper, as spectators forget that the deceased may have hidden these projects for any number of reasons—reasons that include questionable quality. In these instances, the degree to which a figure is overrated or underrated as an “Artist” also emerges, often further clouding the consumer’s judgment.
But perhaps the Artist as a social construct is most harmful not to the critic but to the artist of tomorrow. For, even those who have the greatest creative potential will find themselves feeling uninspired, discouraged, and un-Artistic enough at times. In these moments, it is essential that the individual steer clear of the myth I’ve noted. If we start believing in the Artist too much, we might just stop believing in ourselves.

There’s nothing like a natural disaster to shake people out of idleness. It’s difficult to sit on the sofa in front of the TV if the roof has caved in. It’s difficult to spend hours on Facebook when there’s no power. Hurricane Sandy wasn’t too hard on us here in Cambridge: minimal flooding, no power loss, and, of course, no classes. But in some of the areas that were more severely affected, people had to seriously consider what was essential to their lives and what was frivolous. People in areas where power was lost went into a strange, quasi-hibernation mode.
My dear leisure-loving grandparents in Princeton had no power for a week. After several nervous calls that went straight to voicemail, I finally got a hold of my grandmother. No, they weren’t submerged in feet of saline water after all. They were just camping out in the library because the house was too cold.
Sandy left devastation, flooding, and havoc in its wake, but there was also time for leisure amid the chaos. In New York City, subways, offices, and businesses where shuttered. Working simply wasn’t an option. Our family friends living in Connecticut were without power for a week. The children were off from school, the parents off from work. And there was no power. What on earth was this rather normal American family of four to do? How on earth could they get through a week with so much leisure time and so few leisure outlets?
Under the soft, flickering candle light in their chilly living room, a remarkable transformation was underway. Instead of reaching for the video game consoles, the kids uncovered the Taboo box, the Scrabble board, the pickup sticks. Long neglected in favour of iPads, laptops, and Xboxes, these old friends were the only ones that were there for the family’s youngest in their hour of dire need. Just as the storm windows and sandbags helped the household weather Sandy, these stalwart board games helped the family through their suddenly pre-industrial evening hours.
Some miles down the coast in New York City, however, things weren’t so peachy for the metropolitan well-to-do. A friend described to me in eye-watering detail the trauma of being evacuated from Lower Manhattan to the ominous Carlyle Hotel. Running short of potable water, the evacuees had no choice but to make use of the hotel bar. At least there seemed to be ample supply of alcohol. Things were tolerable until the announcement that food deliveries had been disrupted due to the extreme weather conditions. With à la carte ordering in jeopardy, panic spread among the evacuees. Despondent, dehydrated, and acutely aware of the diminishing supply of bisque, all they could do was watch CNN on their generator-powered televisions.
But New Yorkers are as resilient as they are snobbish, and through sheer grit my friend and his fellow evacuees made it through even this most trying of ordeals. As for our family friends, once their power returned, the board games were once again exiled to the nether regions of the living room armoire. Hot water had never felt so good. Xbox had never been so fun. Lamentably, the delight that old-fashioned board games brought was short-lived. It will probably take another Sandy for the Connecticut kids to return to the Scrabble board. Until then, they’re sticking to Words with Friends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Crimson did not endorse a ticket for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President. Frustrated by the nearly identical tickets, none of which advocated for real ways in which the UC could represent students’ concerns to a reluctant administration, we advocated instead for students to channel their energy into organizing for change outside of student government.
One student who did that was Nicole E. Granath ’15. As the co-coordinator of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, she has organized students, faculty, and alumni in support of socially responsible investment to bring their proposals to the administration. However, this year she is running to be Vice President of the UC—on a ticket that seems prepared to address our concerns about the function of the council. While Michael C. George ’14 and his running mate Granath may not be precisely the “revolutionary” ticket they present themselves to be, we would like to express our support for their candidacy.
Most students’ interactions with the UC come in the form of student life activities and student group funding through grants. George’s experience as chair of the Student Life Committee and secretary of the UC suggest that he will be well positioned to keep this function of the UC running as well, if not better, than it has in the past. In addition, George and Granath’s platform includes many commonsense and well thought out propositions for improving student life on campus, the bread and butter changes that the UC is well-positioned to carry out, ranging from partnering with the Democracy Center to improving room reservation systems to making Harvard more bike-friendly. However, this ticket’s true draw is its commitment to really reforming the way the UC functions and, quite literally, making constitutional change for our student government.
In her work on the Responsible Investment campaign, Granath has organized from outside of the University governance structure, meeting with top administrators to advocate for real, tangible positive changes to the University. Her decision to run for the UC suggests a commitment to student advocacy, an important quality for a UC leader. We are pleased that this ticket at least has taken our critique of the UC’s previous ineffectiveness to heart and are actively working to make the UC better able to represent student concerns to the administration. 
This year’s UC election is novel for another reason—the ballot features three referenda on important University-wide campaigns. We encourage students to vote yes to express their approval of a social choice fund, which would allow donors to specify the option of donating their money to be invested in a socially responsible manner according to environmental, social, and governance criteria. We also advocate that students vote for the second referendum, which seeks to change Harvard’s sexual assault policies and practices in such important areas as adding a policy of affirmative consent, clearly describing “mental incapacitation,” and transparency. On the other hand, we are less excited about the first ballot referendum, asking for students to support divestment from fossil fuels; we don’t think this demand is practical or useful at this time, and would urge students to vote against it. It is exciting to see the many ways in which Harvard students can participate in democratic decision-making about University issues, and we’re glad the UC is taking the lead on conveying undergraduate opinion on these important issues to the Harvard administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Undergraduate Council election season, you will see three referenda questions on the ballot. Question 1 asks whether you support the campaign calling upon Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies and reinvest in socially responsible funds. Harvard has the largest endowment in the world, and we know for a fact that it is invested in fossil fuel companies. With fossil fuels linked directly to global climate change, Harvard is directly funding an industry that threatens our future. Voting “yes” on Question 1 is your way to call on our university to divest from climate change and reinvest in our future.
Harvard’s investments in fossil fuels sit uneasily with a recent report highlighting our university’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote environmental sustainability, and “build a better future.” We now have over 78 building projects across campus that qualify for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification, which have helped lead to a 16 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  However, as Harvard continues to establish itself as a leader in campus sustainability, it must be ready to engage in sustainable practices at all levels—especially with regards to our investment activities.
A fast-growing movement at 47 campuses across the country is calling on colleges and universities to remove fossil fuel investments from their endowment portfolios. Unity College has already divested, becoming a leader in this new movement. Harvard now has the opportunity to lead, as well. Either we can divest from the fossil fuel industry, which will help fight the climate crisis and mitigate further warming, or we can divest from the future of our students by supporting corporations that contribute to the increased incidence of extreme weather and threaten to cut the carrying capacity of the earth to one billion people.
At the Undergraduate Council and Harvard Graduate Council General Meeting on October 21st, President Faust said that Harvard considers divestment is considered: "Only in the most extreme of circumstances.” DARA, an independent, non-profit organization, recently released a report sponsored by 20 governments that shows that the human death toll from climate change could exceed 100 million by 2030. Most of these deaths are the direct result of burning fossil fuels. It is hard to imagine a circumstance much more extreme. Moreover, climate change is an equity issue. Most of the adverse effects of climate change disproportionately impact developing countries, while the majority of greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution have come from industrialized nations.
The movement to divest from fossil fuels continues to grow and could have significant social and political implications. In 2009, cap-and-trade successfully passed the House but failed in the Senate. This was partially due to substantial resources levied against climate action by some of the fossil fuel companies that are now being targeted by this campaign. Divestment may not pose an immediate threat to the annual turnover of the biggest companies, yet it does help to undermine the social and political capital of a powerful industry.
More than anything, divestment is a moral statement. As students come together around the country to support divestment, we are showing our campuses, communities, and politicians that we see climate change as a serious threat to our future. Harvard also has a precedent for divesting from abusive industries: we divested from Big Tobacco for human health reasons; we divested from and genocide in Darfur. The University also partially divested from South Africa during apartheid. Harvard should continue to uphold these values today in the face of the climate crisis.
This UC election, you have the option to send a clear message about our future. Voting “yes” on Question 1 may seem like a small gesture, but our individual voices come together to form a collective and powerful call to action. We respect our institution, and, as President Faust wrote, “We must continue to work together as a university to develop new approaches and solutions that will make a positive difference at Harvard and in the wider world.” Harvard’s divestment can be a part of that difference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent stories appearing in the Crimson and elsewhere have focused—understandably—on the challenges facing law students seeking public service jobs in a difficult economy. But in emphasizing the challenges, these stories have largely missed an important fact: There are jobs, and talented, committed students can get them.
This is a critical point. In this difficult economic climate, there is a greater need than ever for dedicated students to become advocates for those suffering from the global recession. Students who are interested in public service and who are able to attend law schools where the resources make it entirely possible to do public interest work should be encouraged to follow the public interest path, rather than deterred. If they are discouraged from becoming public interest lawyers, who will advocate on behalf of disadvantaged communities?
Those of us who work in the community of public interest lawyers welcome media interest in the nationwide shortage of legal services for the underserved. We also understand the temptation to write stories that say that part of the problem is that on-campus recruiting by big private firms is so much more robust than on-campus recruiting by public interest employers, but to suggest—as the Crimson has done—that the way for Harvard Law School to address that imbalance is to “set up [on-campus] interview programs for public sector organizations akin to its efforts to facilitate student interviews for private companies” is to miss the mark. The vast majority of such organizations cannot spare the funds to send recruiters to law school campuses around the country. Nor do their hiring cycles lend themselves to the kind of unified recruiting ‘season’ adopted by large law firms.
The task for law schools is to maximize the support available for students who will not be deterred by the fact that it is indeed likely to be somewhat harder—and to take somewhat longer—to land a public service position than to obtain an offer from a private law firm.
Harvard Law School offers unparalleled resources for students looking for public service jobs—beginning with the clinical program (the largest in the nation) that begins preparing them for public service legal careers. On top of that foundation, the Bernard Koteen Office of Public Interest Advising at HLS offers targeted career counseling, a global network of contacts and job-search assistance. HLS also offers guaranteed summer public interest funding for all students, and, even more critically, one of the best loan repayment programs in the country, the Low Income Protection Program. Growing numbers of students are taking advantage of LIPP; from 2008 to 2012 the total number of participants increased by nearly 60 percent to 520 in the 2011-2012 academic year. Despite this increase in LIPP participants, HLS has not cut back on LIPP benefits in any way, an important distinction at a time when many other schools have reduced the generosity and flexibility of their programs.
Another way in which Harvard Law School has supported students in recent years is by increasing the number of fully funded fellowships available for work at nonprofits and government agencies. These competitive fellowships help those with the potential for outstanding careers in public service to get a foot in the door at organizations that do not otherwise have the budget to hire at the entry level. The fellowships allow our graduates to gain the valuable experience that many public sector employers seek, while enabling organizations to maintain services to clients and causes at a time when needs have expanded but budgets have contracted. The fellows have all been able to land great jobs at the end of their fellowship year.
The track record of Harvard Law students parlaying these fellowships into jobs has been so strong that the Law School is now expanding this kind of support through its new Public Service Venture Fund.
Because of these kinds of resources, the numbers of HLS students going into public service have gone up rather than down during the recession, even as the number of entry-level jobs in the public sector have contracted (and not expanded as the Crimson claims). The most recent data show increasingly robust numbers of graduating students are headed for public interest and government jobs. What’s more, these numbers don’t even include the graduating students who take clerkships with judges after law school and then go on to public service jobs afterwards.
Prospective law students need to be careful to select a school that will provide them with the ability to train for public interest work, help them land jobs that offer a good fit, and provide them with financial support to allow them to take relatively lower paying work. They should not be daunted by stories that dwell only on the challenges of today’s job market. Such stories do a disservice not just to students, but also to the communities and causes that need talented public interest lawyers now more than ever.

When (or, more realistically given a certain level of apathy to the UC on campus, if) you vote for your Undergraduate Council President sometime between today and Friday, you’ll also have the option of asking Harvard to examine its policies on sexual assault.
The ballot measure, which grew out of an earlier petition, asks for a couple of key measures. One is as adopting a standard of “affirmative consent,” which sounds redundant but in fact is meaningful. The term refines the definition of consent from “not saying no to sex” to “saying yes to the sex with words or clearly enthusiastic actions.” This is necessary not to harshly punish people caught in seemingly ambiguous situations, but rather to prevent these situations from being as ambiguous in the first place. It rejects the “gatekeeper” model of sexual consent, where one partner, usually a woman, rejects sex repeatedly before finally “giving in,” a model normalizes sex after one party says no repeatedly. It sets the requirement of clear communication up front, and it puts the onus on someone pursuing sex to receive clear communication that their advances are wanted rather than only requiring them to stop if they get a signal it isn’t. It requires and encourages equal agency for both partners.
The goal, as with all campus disciplinary policies, is to set a standard of behavior that is clear and consistent. Several other Ivy League schools have already adopted affirmative consent as their standard. This concept has also been hashed out in legal terms in the Vanderbilt Law Review. As author Nicholas J. Little writes, “The introduction of an affirmative consent standard would not only incentivize rational behavior on the part of both women and men in dating situations…such a shift in the law would potentially shift public perceptions of women and their role in sexual relationships.” It would do a lot for everyone, actually, because everyone is susceptible to sexual assault.
Other parts of the petition relate to transparency and clarity from the University, like setting a timeline for resolving sexual assault cases, defining mental incapacitation for consent, using language that is inclusive of LGBTQ individuals, and ensuring the eventual release of the case results (sans names of the parties involved). A few points on the petition are admittedly more ambitious (I say this practically, not because I lack enthusiasm), such as asking for increased funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and “offering comprehensive and inclusive sex education for all students of all years.”
On the whole, these measures are reasonable demands; all but the last two would be easy for the University to accomplish, and even the last two would require relatively minimal funding. The measures would demonstrate Harvard’s prioritization of one of the most dangerous and pervasive parts of college life. The National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the Department of Justice, estimates that 20-25 percent of women will experience an attempted sexual assault during their time at college. This means that likely hundreds of Harvard students have experienced this kind of very traumatic event.
Besides addressing pressing ethical concerns, adopting the changes proposed in the petition would also be legally responsible. This year, Yale University finally settled a 15-month lawsuit with the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights after repeated failures to properly respond to sexual harassment and assault. The University is responsible for doing so because under Title IX, all educational institutions are required to create a reasonably safe environment for students regardless of sex. So long as any university receives Title IX funds, it is subject to a myriad of regulations, and one of them is making the campus as safe as possible for women, who are particularly likely to face sexual assault. Harvard can more effectively do so by adopting a standard of affirmative consent.
It is curious that despite evidence that peer institutions have faced serious trouble for lacking clear and consistent sexual assault policies, Harvard’s administration has declined to update ours since 2003. Even the current UC ballot measure does not demand some of the things that the federal government asked of Yale, for example, that the standard of proof in cases of sexual assault be a “preponderance of evidence:” a 51 percent likelihood of guilt. (In fact, different schools at Harvard have different standards of proof, as though it were easier to tell whether an undergraduate had committed sexual assault than a law student!) Certainly, it’s true that Yale’s investigation began because the administration did not respond to specific public scandals, where, for example, Yale students chanted abusive slogans in front of their women’s center. But the point of a sexual assault policy is to have rules in effect long before sexual assault or harassment takes place, to protect the victims, the accused, and even the university. This year’s ballot measure on sexual assault will pressure Harvard to step up on all three fronts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton University President and renowned molecular biologist Shirley M. Tilghman advocated for a new approach to science education that would integrate larger-picture ideas into everyday curriculum in a lecture at the Science Center on Tuesday afternoon.
This new approach, which Tilghman has termed “inverting the pyramid,” would introduce students early on to the major questions that plague the scientific community, represented now by the base of the pyramid.
“I think we need to invert the pyramid and begin with the big ideas, and then we need to continually connect the theorems and laws to the great task of solving the questions behind the big ideas,” Tilghman said as part of the Dudley Herschbach lecture series. University President Drew G. Faust introduced Tilghman.
Addressing the bigger questions in science while still retaining the smaller-scale fundamental information already taught in the classroom will allow for more original thinking among the students, Tilghman said.
“The science education system should be providing students with opportunities to be scientists and engineers,” she said.
Tilghman said that a new focus in science education is particularly salient given the United States’ declining status as an international leader in the field.
“America is widely acknowledged for having one of the worst K-12 education systems in the world. The more our children are exposed to our educational system, the more poorly they do on international tests,” Tilghman said. “It is clear we have a national problem on our hands.”
Tilghman also discussed the increasing number of online courses offered in high schools and universities. She questioned their effectiveness and what it means for universities that have historically promised close interaction between professors and students as the hallmark of their education.
“The to-be-answered challenge for me is how to use those freed-up contact hours to engage those 300 students,” she said. “That’s the challenge. Will online enhance or merely substitute traditional types of classroom teaching?”
Even with such unanswered speculation about the current science education system, Tilghman expressed her high hopes for the future of the American education system.
“As long as we in the education community approach education with the same degree of inventiveness as we approach research, and as long as our leaders protect qualities that make our scientific enterprise such a source of national strength...I am optimistic,” Tilghman said. “The seeds of that success are still with us.”
Keisuke Ishihara, a Harvard graduate student in systems biology and a teaching fellow for Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking” who attended the lecture, said she agrees with Tilghman’s assertion that students must become innovative thinkers and researchers.
“When you’re asking a question that no one had answered before, and you could figure out the answer by yourself, then that is one of the more memorable moments,” Ishihara said. “I think incorporating that in the middle school, high school, undergraduate programs is really important.”

After spending four summers conducting research both locally and abroad, Shaira Bhanji ’14 says she has begun to understand the hardships of being a woman in a scientific career.
“I’ve definitely had experiences where I’ve felt like my gender has been somewhat of a hindrance, or I felt like male colleagues looked down upon me,” said Bhanji, the co-director of Harvard’s chapter of the Scientista Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to encouraging females to pursue careers in science.
This winter, the Harvard group will raise awareness of continued gender discrimination through a series of blog posts. In an effort to encourage women to pursue careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), the foundation is currently working to bring together anonymous stories from female scientists.
“These are stories that we believe should not go unnoticed,” Bhanji said. “Sometimes, all that women in STEM really need is to know one other woman who has similar goals and is struggling through the same things.”
The seeds of the Scientista Foundation began in 2009, when then-Harvard junior Julia C. Tartaglia ’11 founded the online magazine WISE Words (Women Innovating Science and Engineering). Two years later, with her sister Christina E. Tartaglia ’09 on board as a co-founder, the team won funding in Harvard’s i3 competition to take their publication national. The foundation now has 17 affiliated organizations at 12 campuses, including MIT, Columbia, and Princeton.
For the co-founders, lingering issues of sexism in both the classroom and the laboratory can be countered through mentoring and partnerships like those the Scientista Foundation promotes.
“We believe that we can overcome these biases with the help of vibrant, supportive communities of women in science and strong role models for aspiring women scientists,” they wrote in an email. “The Scientista Foundation is not just a network of women, but a movement of scientists who are coming together to innovate science and technology and ultimately our future.”
Saraf Nawar ’14, Bhanji’s co-director of Harvard’s Scientista Foundation branch, cited the role of positive peer pressure in the organization’s work. The foundation aims to educate women about the various professional possibilities in the sciences. “Just knowing the variety of science careers out there and the variety of ways that women are approaching them can encourage a lot of girls to get involved,” she said.
In addition to highlighting undergraduate writing about the sciences through bimonthly publications, the foundation sponsors events featuring professional speakers to encourage women considering STEM careers.
“I think every woman in science who has experience in the field has a job to be a role model to a younger woman,” Bhanji said.

Harvard Square’s branch of The Upper Crust Pizzeria closed its doors indefinitely Tuesday as its parent company struggles to navigate bankruptcy proceedings that began in October, according to reports in The Boston Herald and The Boston Globe.
The Harvard Square location was closed during its normal hours of operation late Tuesday night with no visible sign of activity.
Tuesday’s reported closing of ten of the chain’s 16 locations, in both Boston and Washington D.C., represents the latest development in a series of financial problems and labor issues that have plagued the firm in the last few years. According to the Herald, the firm closed the locations in an effort to stay solvent long enough to find a buyer.
The pizza chain, which owes approximately $850,000 in back pay and wages and is on the hook for approximately $3.4 million to its creditors, declared bankruptcy in October. According to the Globe, about 140 employees will lose jobs as a result of the closings.
The Globe reported that even with the store closures, the company will need a cash infusion of at least $120,000 within the next week or so to avoid a complete shutdown and liquidation.
Mark G. DeGiacomo, the company’s bankruptcy trustee said that the company had only $14,000 in cash on hand and just four days of supplies at this Tuesday’s bankruptcy hearing, according to the Globe. He added that if the firm received an emergency cash infusion, it might be able to reopen some or all of the closed locations and rehire the laid off employees.
“We got in, operated them, wrapped our arms around it and quickly saw there was just not enough cash flow to pay all of the ongoing expenses,” DeGiacomo told The Herald.
A spokesperson for Upper Crust did not respond to a late Tuesday night request for comment.
The firm, founded in 2001 and based in Boston, experienced strong growth at first, but has been embroiled in legal disputes in the past few years.
Allegations of labor law violations sparked a federal inquiry from the US Department of Labor in 2009, and, according to the Globe, a later federal investigation found that from 2009 to 2011 the firm underpaid some employees a total of $425,000.
The labor lawsuits prompted a boycott of the location in Harvard Square by two Harvard Law School groups—the Harvard Immigration Project and the Labor and Employment Action Project.
Aside from its labor troubles, according to the Globe, the Upper Crust’s founder improperly used company funds for his personal use.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only recently discovered and still under much dispute, dark energy has proven baffling to physicists, mathematicians, and astronomers alike.
In a talk Tuesday evening as a part of a monthly series of introductory astrophysics seminars, Christopher W. Stubbs, a professor of physics and astronomy, provided insight into the nebulous concept dubbed “dark energy,” the cause of the universe’s expansion.
“One of the points I really want to make for you this evening is that you are right now, right this second, living through an intellectual revolution every bit as important as the advent of quantum mechanics,” said Stubbs. “When we finally understand [dark energy], it will completely change the way we think about physics.”
To contextualize the problem, Stubbs explained that the “vacuum of space” where dark energy functions is often mischaracterized as “nothingness.” It is, in fact, “a highly complicated, seething foam of processes.” Dark energy is the force that drives these processes.
Originally, theories miscalculated the “energetic content of the vacuum,” or the energy produced by these processes. The initial estimate, 10 to the 120th power, was, in Stubbs’s words, “the wrongest calculation in all of physics.”
Unsatisfied with this theory, Stubbs and his colleagues decided that the only way to determine the real answer was to directly measure it.
Stubbs came up with what he said seemed like a rather arbitrary number: 0.7. In response to people’s confusion, Stubbs stated, “The fact that this number is not 10 to the 120 power and also not 0...has thrown everyone for a loop.”
Students said they were intrigued by the lecture and its controversial yet captivating content, as well as the chance to discuss such a pivotal discovery with such a preeminent scholar.
“I felt that this talk was a great, intimate event,” said Nina L. Hooper ’16. “It was great being so close to someone who had a significant impact on his field and hearing from him how it all works in fairly basic terms.”
Indeed, Stubbs emphasized his belief that these discoveries should not be limited to technical jargon.
“I think these issues go to the heart of a long standing craving for humans to understand our place in the universe and understand how it’s all going to turn out,” Stubbs said. “We’re just lucky to be the ambassadors who get to go and worry about it full time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renowned Israeli writer Etgar Keret gave insight into his passion for storytelling and the influence of his personal life on his short stories at an event Tuesday night in the Harvard Museum of Natural History’s Geological Lecture Hall.
“At a very early age I decided that when I grow up I wanted to become a drunk, male prostitute,” he said.
Keret explained how his parents were the first to imbue him with a passion for storytelling. “My parents were both excellent storytellers,” he said. “But they would never read to me from books.”
While his mother told him “fantastical stories about fairies,” his father’s tales “took place in the whorehouse,” Keret said, “and all his protagonists were prostitutes and drunk people.” Although perhaps not the normal subject for bedtime stories, the stories of his father’s time spent living above a whorehouse, “really educated me for life,” said Keret. “They were really full of love, and hope.”
At the event sponsored by the Harvard Center for Jewish Studies and the Consul General of Israel to New England, Keret alternated between reading his short stories and speaking on topics ranging from family to loneliness to the subjectivity of art.
Keret then shifted to discuss his own experiences later in life and the impact they had on his writing.
Keret used his story called “Healthy Start” to illustrate this effect. The story, which stemmed from a chance encounter Keret had in Berlin, features a lonely man who would engage in random conversations with total strangers.
“The story kind of began with something that resembled the situation,” said Keret, “but it went in directions that weren’t dictated.” The story was written to convey how lonely he felt during his time in Berlin, a time that he described as “something that looks very nice on my bio, but...was one of the worst times of my life.”
Keret went on to explain how writing had actually helped him to combat loneliness. “When you write in a first-person narrative, you can kind of make yourself...feel like you’re less lonely,” he said.
Keret said he hopes that, through his stories, the reality of human experience can be shared.
“I think that art is always subjective and gives you the benefit to feel the subjective experience of another mind or entity,” he said. “I really don’t like to be limited by any rules...when I come to write. I really want to tell the things that I think are most real.”
Maxbetter S. Vizelberg ’14, a student in the Modern Hebrew program, said that the insights Keret gave into his life at the event were illuminating. “I was really glad to see that not only is he a wonderful author, he’s a wonderful dad,” said Vizelberg, “Seeing the man come alive...that was really amazing.”

Heading into Tuesday’s contest at the Mullins Center, the Harvard men’s basketball team had not lost to a squad from its home state since Dec. 10, 2008, when Northeastern claimed an overtime victory against the Crimson. But the 15-game winning streak against Commonwealth teams ended in heartbreaking fashion at the hands of UMass, as reserve Sampson Carter knocked down a three with 1.2 seconds remaining in the contest to lead the Minutemen over Harvard, 67-64, Tuesday morning.
The game—which aired on ESPN as part of the 2012 College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon—marked the first time that Harvard and UMass have met on the basketball court since the 1991-92 season, and with the win, the Minutemen cemented a 14-7 edge in the all-time series.
But the game, which morphed into nail-biter that included eight lead changes and five ties in the second half, was not as close a contest from the get-go. UMass scored first, 1:22 into the game, and was able to hold its advantage for the duration of the opening frame, leading by many as 10 points.
Down nine with less than two minutes left to play in the first half, co-captain Christian Webster came up big for the Crimson, scoring seven of his 10 points—his first double-digit scoring effort since Dec. 29, 2011—in the final 1:34 of the half, including a trey three seconds before the break, to keep the Crimson within striking distance, 38-37.
“We try to give our kids the mindset that we can keep battling through any adversity,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The word ‘composure’ was big for us, and I thought we had that pretty much throughout until that last minute or so [of the game].”
TENACIOUS D
UMass’s high-pressure defense—the Minutemen stayed in a full-court press for the full 40 minutes—helped the home team net 29 points off of turnovers to Harvard’s nine, including 16 points on Harvard mistakes in the second half.
But according to UMass coach Derek Kellogg, the Crimson was able to break pressure against the full-court press effectively.
“[Harvard’s] freshman point guard [Siyani Chambers] showed some composure out there against a pressing team,” Kellogg said. “They really had four ball handlers out there. It’s hard to press a team when they’re smaller and have four guys that can handle the ball.”
Although the Minutemen did rack up points on Harvard turnovers, UMass got into foul trouble early on, amassing its seventh hack with 10:54 still to play in the first half and its 10th just 2:47 after that. The second half transpired similarly, with any UMass foul in the final 8:14 bringing Harvard to the line.
“If you’re going to press and you force turnovers, you have to keep them off the free throw line, which we didn’t do,” Kellogg said.
Sophomore Wesley Saunders was able to capitalize on the aggressive defense, swishing 10-of-11 foul shots to help Harvard go 22-of-26 from the line on the game.
EN GUARD
In his first collegiate game at the Division I level, Chambers was faced with perhaps the toughest matchup on the court Monday morning: the task of defending UMass point guard Chaz Williams.
Last season, Williams averaged 16.9 points per game while also tallying 231 assists and 81 steals. At the onset of the 2012-13 campaign, he was selected as a member of the A-10 preseason first team.
Although the UMass redshirt junior finished with a game-high 10 assists—including the pass to Carter in the final seconds of the contest that resulted in the game-winner—Chambers held the playmaker to just 12 points and one trip to the line. Williams went 6-for-15 on the night, including 0-of-2 from three-point range.
“I thought [the game] was a magnificent performance by Siyani,” Amaker said.  “It was his first road game as a college player. To play the way he played, with the spirit, energy, and the toughness, I think he’s shown he’s going to be an outstanding player. It’s just too bad we couldn’t cap it off with a victory.”
“The kid has a lot of heart,” Williams added.
On the Harvard side, Chambers and Saunders combined for exactly half of Harvard’s scoring Monday night, dropping 14 and 18 points, respectively.
“For us to have a chance against [UMass’s] pressure…we knew how critical our ball-handling would be,” Amaker said. “Siyani and Wesley in particular were the two who the bulk of ball handling was going to fall on their shoulders, and I thought they did as well as you could possibly ask.”
The duo earned two steals apiece and totaled 12 assists, including seven from the rookie. Chambers was the only player on either team to play the entire game, while Saunders played for all but three minutes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Nov. 13, 2010. The Harvard men’s soccer team has just upset No. 18 Penn on the road in the last game for a senior class that has gone 17-8-3 in the Ivy League, including a 2009 conference championship.
It is a cathartic end to a disappointing season which saw the Crimson finish in the middle of the pack in the Ivy League after being ranked as high as No. 6 in the country under first-year head coach and former assistant Carl Junot.
It is the last time Harvard will leave the field victorious against a conference foe for at least two years.
With the Crimson’s loss to Penn, 3-1, on Saturday, Harvard (3-11-3, 0-6-1 Ivy) has concluded its second consecutive winless Ivy League season.
A deliberately difficult non-conference schedule that was meant to prepare the team for an easier conference season did just the opposite, as the Crimson was outscored 13-5 in seven conference matchups—the lone saving grace being a Sept. 29 0-0 tie against Yale.
In the 57 years that Harvard has competed in men’s soccer in the Ancient Eight, it has won 13 conference titles and had never gone winless until 2011. Now it’s done it twice in as many years.
Not since coach William R. Welsh went 5-12-1 (.306) in 1922-23 has a Crimson team performed as consistently badly as Harvard has under Junot the last three years (.304). But Junot is not completely to blame.
Despite the lackluster results on the field, Junot has continued to recruit players befitting a program that was recently in the top 10 nationally. Freshman Oliver White—who tied with fellow freshman Jake Freeman for second on the team with three goals this season—was the ESPN Massachusetts high school soccer Player of the Year as a senior; classmate Mark Ashby, who started at central defender most of this season, was ranked as a Top 100 recruit coming out of high school by ESPN Rise.
Up and down the roster you find players who excelled at every level and turned down big-conference offers in order to attend Harvard.
If the outcome of a game was determined merely by the talent amassed on each team’s roster, then the Crimson would dominate the Ivy League—or at the very least contend with nationally ranked heavyweights Cornell and Brown.
In the games it has won, Harvard’s talent has indeed carried it. Against Holy Cross in the penultimate game of the season, the Crimson won, 2-0, despite sloppy play—in large part due to the superior talent of individual players.
In fact, other than the 6-0 shellacking at the hands of then-No.3 UConn, I can’t remember a single game I watched this season in which I didn’t feel as if Harvard had a chance to win it. Seven of its 11 loses came by one goal, and three came in overtime. Defenders of the program would write these off as bad luck—and in some cases they would be right.
But across the last two seasons, the Crimson has lost 16 games by one goal and won just four by the same margin. If Harvard were just unlucky you might not expect its record in one goal games to be .500, but .200 seems a bit too skewed.
Rather, this failure to perform in close games is emblematic of a problem more damning than lack of talent or faulty strategy: a lack of effort and teamwork. Through balls sail down the field with no one giving chase. Players will take wild shots instead of passing to the open man.
The last two years of Harvard soccer are a case study on the limits of talent—and the importance of chemistry and teamwork.
It is difficult to decipher who to blame for this. While it is possible that some players have been selfish their entire soccer playing lives and had the talent to back it up in their high school leagues, it is unlikely that the Crimson is full of selfish a-holes. If you talk to most of the guys on the team you’ll know that isn’t true.
In situations where there appears to be a systemic problem, the blame must fall on the shoulders of the leader of the organization—whether he deserves it or not.
Coach Junot has come off as kind and capable in all my interactions with him. He seems to understand the concepts of teamwork in a way that only someone who has devoted his life to playing and coaching one of the consummate team sports can.
But unless he can get his players to demonstrate that same understanding on the pitch—and fast—then he may not be the right man for the job.

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
There is no need to cross the Atlantic Ocean when the taste of Belgium is only a short walk away. Located at 1154 Massachusetts Ave., Zinneken's serves two types of authentic, freshly-baked Belgian waffles—Liege and Brussels.
The Liege waffles are made from dense dough with pearls of sugar imported from Belgium. As the waffle cooks in the skillet iron, the sugar caramelizes into the dough to add an extra layer of sweet, chewy texture.
On the other hand, Brussels waffles are made from a liquid batter with fresh yeast for a light, airy taste.
You can choose from Zinneken's wide selection of waffle variations or customize your own by choosing a basic signature waffle ($4.70) and adding various toppings, such as fresh fruits, Nutella, and whipped cream, for an additional $0.50 or $1 per topping.
The Gourmand ($6.70)—a Liege waffle with whipped cream, sliced bananas, and a drizzle of caramel sauce—and Fruit Delight ($7.20)—a Liege waffle with strawberries, bananas, and Belgian chocolate—were served on round silver plates dusted with powder sugar. About the size of a hand, the waffles were extremely dense. With a crispy exterior and chewy interior, I felt like there was a firework of sweet indulgence in my mouth for the first couple bites, but towards the end, I definitely had a hard time finishing these overly sugary waffles.
The Veritaffles in the dining hall pale in comparison to Zinneken's Brussels waffle ($6.20), which was topped with strawberries and whipped cream. Biting into this fluffy waffle was like floating on a bed of clouds. The Brussels waffle is also not as sweet as the Liege waffle.
You can even try a Liege waffle today for free. Let me know how your experience compares!

Smiles have been emerging all over campus. While the impending inebriation of Harvard-Yale may have something to do with it, The Game doesn't explain the faceless posters and "Can You Tell?" signs. You probably can't tell just yet, but be sure to check out Thursday's Fifteen Minutes Magazine for the whole story.

Last night, the Yale College Council sought a way to gather student suggestions for improving campus safety. They forwent the traditional surveys and round-table discussions in favor of a novel approach: a Google Doc open to the entire student body. Just an hour and a half later, the YCC locked the Google Doc to prevent further editing. The reason? The document had been overrun by Internet trolls.
According to the Yale Daily News' Cross Campus blog, the document's creators tried in vain to salvage it as students submitted joke responses. "YCC WILL NOT TOLERATE TROLLS" was briefly seen at the top of the document until a prankster followed it up with "YOU SHALL NOT PASSSSSSSSSSSS." Eventually the YCC locked the document, asking students to fill out a form instead.
Though the YCC has since taken efforts to scrub the offending posts from the document, a few gems managed to slip through the cracks. Among the highlights are, "Can we give every student a torch for dark parts of campus? But not like a British torch. An actual torch. With fire." And, more ominously, "Sad people should be eliminated. Immediately."
Though Harvard students have had some trolling problems of our own, it seems that we've managed to nail down the formula for (mostly) troll-free crowdsourcing.
Harvard's own UC Presidential candidate Michael C. George '14 earned a special thank-you note at the bottom of the document for giving the idea to the Yale College Council. Unfortunately for Yalies, they failed to read the fine print of George's strategy.
In September, the UC put out a Google Doc on Advising at Harvard that they successfully kept free of ever-lurking trolls. "We had constant moderator presence eliminating any troll responses," George said.
We at Flyby are used to digging for Fales ripe for exploitation in anticipation of The Game each November. This year, the YCC did the work for us. Thanks for the help, guys! We'll see you Saturday.

Saturday's 129th Harvard-Yale game will be a blowout win for the Crimson, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith predicted in an interview on Wednesday.
Hammonds forecast a 21-3 win for Harvard, while Smith said he expects a 31-10 Crimson victory.
We at Flyby are hoping for a somewhat more dramatic win.
In a lecture he delivered Tuesday night titled "Harvard is Better than Yale," Lecturer in Organismic & Evolutionary Biology Andrew J. Berry predicted that, based on recent contests between Harvard and Columbia and Columbia and Yale, the Crimson would lead by at least 73 in the final count.
No matter which of these expert predictions you choose to trust, it seems clear that Harvard is poised to win its sixth straight Game, which would also be our 11th in the past 12 years.
Sorry we're not sorry, Yale.
