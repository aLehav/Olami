After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering the first loss of its season last night to No. 2 Cornell, the No. 10 Harvard women’s hockey team bounced back for a 3-1 win over Colgate (3-7-0, 1-3-0 ECAC)–its first win on the road. The No. 10 Crimson (2-1-1, 2-1-1) was led by tri-captain Kate Buesser, who tallied her first of the year to tie the game at one after the Raider’s Jenna Klynstra notched the opening goal of the game.
Harvard continued its scoring run in the third period, with the help of freshman Kalley Armstrong and tri-captain Leanna Coskren, who each found the back of the net for the Crimson.
Crimson sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy did her part for the victory, making 20 saves to keep Colgate to just a lone goal. The win was Bellamy’s second on the season. The Raiders’ Kimberly Sass recorded 31 saves in the loss.
Harvard will hit the road again next weekend to face Quinnipiac and Princeton on Friday and Saturday, respectively.

Looking for ways to be sexy? Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response has two suggestions: 1. Get consent. 2. Wear an OSAPR t-shirt.
The OSAPR Student Alliance will be giving away ten free “Consent is Sexy” t-shirts to the students who offer the most creative and effective ways to ask for consent before engaging in sexual intercourse. Suggestions must be e-mailed to OSAPR@fas.harvard.edu by Nov. 12, with the subject line “Consent Contest.”
The list of top ten suggestions will be distributed along with condoms—whose wrappers will read “Got consent? Ask before unwrapping”—and informational flyers at the Harvard-Yale game on Nov. 20, according to OSAPR’s Prevention Specialist Seth D. Avakian. “Consent is Sexy” t-shirts will also be on sale in front of the Science Center.
“There’s some hesitancy to ask the phrase, ‘Would you like to engage in intercourse with me?’” Avakian said. “There’s different ways to check in with people.”
Student Alliance member Jack J. Holuba ’13 offered some ideas: Should I get a condom? Are you ready for this?
While there are a lot of “playful” options, Holuba said, if consent is established “you avoid so many other issues.”
