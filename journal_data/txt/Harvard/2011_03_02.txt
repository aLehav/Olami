After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the two parties fight over America’s budget, Eric Cantor and the House Republicans have frequently mentioned the need to make “tough choices.” What many fail to realize is that Cantor and his party are not making any tough choices; rather, they are making ideological and unnecessary cuts in small but immensely valuable government programs, while avoiding the major sources of America’s fiscal problems. Namely, they have avoided discussion or consideration of rising Medicare costs, extremely low tax rates, and high defense spending, which far and away constitute the largest federal expenditures.
House Republicans have detailed $100 billion in cuts, mostly to domestic discretionary spending including the programs listed above, while avoiding the major sources of the long-term deficit; Medicare costs, defense spending, and low tax revenues. Allowing tax rates to return to Clinton-era levels would raise $226 billion over five years, while capping Medicare cost growth would be the largest possible source of long-term deficit savings, with $560 billion of savings over 30 years. Paul Ryan, the chair of the Budget Committee, once proposed a plan to cut entitlement costs; neither he nor the Republicans has mentioned that as of late. A serious plan to reduce the deficit would address these long-term entitlement and tax revenue issues, but Republicans have refused to even touch these issues despite claiming that they are ardent fiscal conservatives.
House Republicans have instead used the budget fight to achieve just about every political goal except substantially reducing deficits. The National Institute of Health funds the research and innovation that has spurred on America’s biomedical industry and led to major advances in medicine. Almost 1 million poor children benefit from the Head Start preschool program every year, learning integral skills that they would otherwise have no opportunity to gain. In their budget, House Republicans have proposed slashing the funding for these programs, as well as funding for science and research, high-speed rail, the Securities and Exchange commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Americorps—all relatively small programs that millions of Americans benefit from everyday.
These small programs are essential to America’s current and future economic growth. On a direct level, the government is a major employer, and decreases in funding will immediately increase unemployment through the mechanism of layoffs. Indirectly, funds for projects including scientific research and high-speed rail employ private-sector employees, who depend on public sector contracts for employment. And when we look at our nation’s future, programs including Head Start, Pell Grants, and research and development are essential for developing our stock of human capital and creating a strong workforce. Goldman Sachs has estimated that the proposed cuts to these programs that provide essential jobs and services will set U.S. GDP growth back 1.5-2 percent this year, which would be devastating in the midst of a fragile recovery.
House Republicans have framed these budget decisions as crucial to reducing our deficit and strengthening the economic recovery. In reality, they do not address any of the long-term causes of our fiscal problems, and would bring our recovery to a grinding halt. These cuts tear at programs that make our society more just and that ensure America will be a smarter and better nation in a decade. These are government initiatives that affect the lives of every single American, and it is crucial that the public makes its voice heard if we want to stop these cuts from becoming the law in a few weeks’ time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November, I invited the eighty year old political theorist, Gene Sharp, to my seminar, “Gandhi: Then and Now.”  We had reached the “now” part of our study, looking at the ways in which Gandhi’s strategic non-violent resistance had moved beyond India. Sharp spoke about why some movements, like Polish Solidarity, succeeded in achieving political change and why others, like the 2007 Burmese monks’ movement, faltered.
That day, none of us was thinking of Tunisia or Egypt. But when the revolutions of January began to take hold, I am sure everyone in the seminar recalled our encounter with Gene Sharp and his book, From Dictatorship to Democracy, a manual of non-violent strategies and tactics to bring down a dictator. In the last weeks of January, we saw some of those techniques in action in the astonishing events that captured the attention of the world.
On Feb. 9, when Google executive Wael Ghonim was released from twelve days blindfolded in detention, he told CNN that his heroes were Gandhi and Mark Zuckerberg. It was a potent combination: the strategic thinking of Gandhi’s non-violent resistance joined with the vast networking made possible by Facebook.
Gandhi would have loved the Internet; He understood the power of the press and the community it both forms and informs. The Internet has escalated this power and given it lightning speed.
Wael Ghonim was the anonymous manager of a Facebook page that played a critical role in the massive protests at Tahrir Square brought down the Mubarak government in 18 days. On his release, Ghonim stressed that this was not about him, but about the brave, ordinary, people in the streets. The power of ordinary people, resistant and mobilized around “what touches peoples’ daily lives,” as Ghonim put it, is indeed what Gandhi was about.
While the movements in Tunisia and Egypt were swift, we know they were not completely spontaneous. Young thinkers in both countries knew something of the strategy of non-violent resistance through, not surprisingly, the Internet. One source was that book by Gene Sharp, From Dictatorship to Democracy, downloadable in 24 languages, including Arabic. Banned in Russia and Iran and used widely from Burma to Serbia, the book serves as a generic guide for protesters, recognizing that every context is different and has to be shaped by the people on the ground.
Sharp, once a researcher at Harvard’s Center for International Affairs, has long been a scholar of Gandhi. Sharp believes, however, that non-violent resistance, non-cooperation, and collective action have strategic importance, even if one does not share Gandhi’s religious convictions about the ethics of non-violence.
In his twenty years in South Africa, Gandhi developed the form of non-violent resistance that strategically contravened racist, unjust laws. He called it satyagraha, "holding fast to truth." It was the active non-violence of the brave. Gandhi’s South African campaigns experimented with tactics of civil disobedience that he would later use in India. His declaration at the Empire Theater mass meeting in Johannesburg in 1906 has traveled the internet: “They may torture my body, break my bones, even kill me. Then they will have my dead body. Not my obedience!”
This echoes more than a century later in Wael Ghonim’s stirring declaration in the CNN interview, addressing himself directly to Vice-President Omar Suleiman: “I am telling you, I am ready to die. . . Kidnap me, kidnap all my colleagues. Put us in jail. Kill us. Do whatever you want to do. We are getting back our country. You guys have been ruining this country for 30 years. Enough! Enough! Enough!” Compliance was gone, and so was fear. As Gandhi put it, “A satyagrahi bids goodbye to fear.”
The Gandhian principles at work here are straightforward and, as Sharp insists, not dependent on Gandhi’s spirituality. When people withdraw their support from an oppressive regime and overcome their fear, the power of the oppressor is broken. But, it is impossible to challenge an authoritarian regime where it is strongest, that is, with force of arms. The strategic use of non-violent tactics is the strongest alternative arsenal. We have seen these tactics work for the people of Egypt.
Sharp cautions that nonviolent protest takes discipline and strategic planning. In the assault on the protesters in Tahrir Square, a New York Times reporter wrote, “A row of men stood silent as rocks rained down on them. An older man told a younger one to put down his stick.” In fact, the very brutality of the oppressor can fuel the movement. The largest Facebook group that enabled communication and support for the Egyptian demonstrators is “We are All Khalid Said,” which created a wide sense of identity with the young man brutally murdered by the police in Alexandria on June 6, 2010.  This mutual identity forms the strong bonds among protesters necessary for a movement of this magnitude to succeed.
This is not Gandhi’s moment, nor is it Gene Sharp’s, though their influence is considerable here. This moment belongs to the people of Tunisia and the people of Egypt, who have conquered fear and said, “Enough.” We are witnessing the enormously powerful fusion of the Internet and strategic non-violent resistance. It is not at all clear where this will take us, but the energy of the movements we now see emerging has begun to shake authoritarian regimes the world over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now we know what keeps Harvard admissions officers awake at night. It isn't the threat of nuclear proliferation, the fate of Palestine, whether the Sox can assemble a bullpen this year, or even whether Brad will choose Chantal over Emily. No. It's the fear that somewhere in America, a teenager is making a life-altering decision. Trapped in an unfair system and swayed by one-sided information, they commit a critical and permanent error. They choose to attend Yale.
With the threat of this kind of calamity stalking the land, it's no surprise that Harvard recently announced the return of early admissions. Five years ago, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons `67 boasted in The Crimson that canceling Early Action provided "a win for students in the bottom quarter and bottom half of the income distribution." And yet, five years later, Harvard has decided to abandon the bottom half of the income distribution to rejoin the group of elite institutions participating in a zero-sum competition over the strongest members of the existing application pool. Unfortunately, while Early Action is good for Harvard, it's bad for America.
When Harvard ended early admissions five years ago the stated goal was the opportunity to reach out to students that might not apply to Harvard or any other selective institution. The single application deadline gave admissions officers more time to tour high schools in the fall, correcting common misconceptions, touting our generous financial aid packages, and encouraging qualified students to apply.
Now we are restarting early admissions, but none of the offered explanations address the original goal. When Dean Fitzsimmons states—as he did recently in The Crimson—that "we started to hear that more and more people were applying early across the country" and points to rising interest in early admissions programs as a reason for the change, my response is: So what? What does interest in early admissions programs have to do with the diversity of the overall applicant pool? And when Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith's statement says "many highly talented students, including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students, were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on the opportunity to consider Harvard", my response is again: So what? If anything, increasing numbers of low-income and underrepresented students in the applicant pool might indicate our outreach efforts are working!
In a way this evasiveness is not surprising, because while operating an Early Action program drains resources from efforts at broadening our applicant pool, it does achieve several things: It helps Harvard compete for students already in the applicant pool, and boosts our all-important yield. But ignore the warriors in the Harvard v. Yale admissions wars that nobody outside our ivory towers cares about for a minute and ask the question: Do yield and the competition over over-prepared students matter?
Not to me. Despite Admissions Office fears, my reaction to the nightmare scenario in which a student chooses Yale over Harvard because of early admissions is simple and familiar: So what? Yale is a great school. The student will likely succeed there, and I'm guessing we will be able to find someone out of our thousands of qualified applicants willing to give Harvard a shot. How is this a bad outcome? The education we are providing is not so superior to what students at Yale or Princeton receive, and if it were we would worry even less about the quality of admits, confident that by graduation we would have transformed them into those peerless creatures: Harvard Women and Men.
Unless you work in the Admissions Office or care about the inane U.S. News college rankings, how well-qualified students sort out between Ivy League schools doesn't generate nightmares or even a second thought. Here's the nightmare scenario that keeps me awake. Consumed by competing over applicants that would have applied anyway, Harvard and other peer institutions abandon outreach efforts. Meanwhile, a qualified, lower-income student considers her application. She's heard that Harvard is expensive. Her peers that have been admitted are all wealthy. Discouraged, she pushes the application aside. Harvard can never admit a student that doesn't apply.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past week many of Harvard’s undergraduate organizations have been asked to participate in a boycott of The Upper Crust pizza chain over allegations made in court that claim that the pizza chain mistreats its workers. This boycott has been organized by two Harvard Law  School student groups, the Harvard Immigration Project and the Labor and Employment Action Project. The Upper Crust, a Boston-wide chain that was founded in 2001, has faced allegations of employing illegal immigrants and unfair treatment of workers for some time, charges that have been vehemently denied by the company’s management. In 2009, the company was ordered by the Department of Labor to pay some $340,000 in unpaid compensation.
Now, after a new set of lawsuits alleging labor abuses were filed in December 2010, the Department of Labor has decided to open a second investigation into employment practices. Following on from this, HLS students from HIP and LEAP have chosen to take the matter into their own hands, and would like all of Harvard’s community to do the same. Claire Valentin, the HLS president of HIP, stated in an email to The Crimson that the boycott was started in response to the Department of Labor’s 2009 order.  The Vice President of Advocacy of LEAP has said that the boycott will not cease their calls for a boycott until the company proves it is in compliance with labor laws. So far, the HLS groups claim that their appeal has achieved positive responses from many undergraduate organizations, some of who make up the forty groups who have reportedly signed onto a letter to be delivered to the restaurant chain.
It should be seen as a good thing that many people within Harvard University have become involved with workers’ rights in the local community. If it should prove any catalyst for Harvard’s undergraduates to become active defenders of the rights of workers—local or not—and to be informed of their situations, then we believe that this initiative will have long-lasting benefits. With the jobs of so many people in Harvard Square and the wider Cambridge area either directly or indirectly dependent on the Harvard community, we can be better Cambridge citizens by remaining abreast of such developments.
That said, we do not feel that a boycott is the best approach in this particular case or necessarily warranted. As a rule, the call for a boycott should be made with great caution and only after lengthy deliberation. Boycotts of a company or product do, by their nature, bring devastating economic consequences to those they target if they are successful. In the case of The Upper Crust, it is not only the founder—Jordan Tobins—who will suffer but also all of the business’ employees. In the case that the HLS student’s boycott should prove a popular cause, then the livelihoods of those very workers whom the boycott originally sought to protect will suffer, potentially seriously. Ideological opposition to labor violation allegations made in court must not trump practical considerations of what is in these employees’ real best interest.
Considering this, it is especially important to have a preponderance of evidence suggesting that labor abuses have taken place and are continuing before launching a call for a boycott. While it is significant that the Department of Labor has launched a new investigation into The Upper Crust’s labor practices, there is still no hard evidence that these practices are continuing. Nor is there a suggestion that these abuses are taking place at the company’s Harvard Square restaurant. For these reasons, it would seem wise not to call yet for a boycott.
This is not to chastise the HLS students for bringing this issue to light in the way that they have. We only disagree with the action which they gone on to recommend. Overall, the move at an individual, activist level should be viewed as a positive step that we might all try to fork out more time for in the future.
This boycott may not be in the best interests of The Upper Crusts’ employees or the local community, but we do hope that it might at least foster more dialogue on an important issue for the Harvard student body.

The human body’s gradual decay with age is, according to a budget consultant on physical aesthetics (Dr. Me), one of mankind’s greatest tragedies. We start off as round balls with soft heads and soft everything, move briefly to a period of hard-bodied vitality, and then begin a slow decline toward the descent of our fat parts. For gymnasts these years mark the end of life as they know it, but for the majority population aged 16 to 19—give or take two years—this time represents a period of unparalleled capacity for exercise, recovery, sleep, and, at least for males, bow-chicka-wow-wow. We’re supermen/women for the latter part of high school, a time when we’re generally too scared or too stupid to take advantage of our physical blessings. But by sophomore year of college, the moment we discover our physical prowess, our testosterone levels have started their decline, marking the end of the “I can eat nothing but Cheetos and still win this marathon” phase—for both sexes.
Of course, it’s entirely within our power to slow this steady fall from physical perfection. The most obvious solution is consistent exercise, which forces our muscles into an anabolic, or rebuilding, state, since loss of muscle mass accounts for a bulk of the physical drop-off surrounding aging. And the easiest, most fun way to get such activity is through sports, for many a main subject of conversation and for everyone else the “stuff they show on E-S-P-M.” Be it football, basketball, or golf, consistent athletic participation is a fantastic way to stave of death’s creeping hand, and the benefits range from increased cardiovascular capacity to emotional wellbeing through team dynamics and healthy competition. Cross-training is especially beneficial, and the combination of strength training with aerobic activity is a surefire way to extend your healthy time on this increasingly warm globe. Combine the above with a healthy-ish diet, and there’s no reason a middle-aged you can’t outrun toddlers on their comically underdeveloped legs. 
But in a cruel, ironic twist, team sports become less accessible just as we begin to need them most. Even Harvard is filled with auditoriums-worth of former high school tennis and track stars, individuals who ditched their warm-ups for Macbooks and a healthy dose of book learning. Those on college sports teams hold onto their vigor a little longer thanks to 6 a.m. practices and all the DHA sweat suits the university can provide. But aside from the handful of prodigies who graduate into the pro ranks, there isn’t much keeping us active after our organized sports careers end—except our ever-waning desire to hit the treadmill. Staying fit after teams part ways is, for many, a boring challenge, a routine we’re quick to throw on the backburner. Frankly, it becomes less fun to exercise when you lose the motivation—and snappy uniforms—that sports provide.
Yet while traditional sports options seem to dry up post-graduation, there’s nothing actually keeping us from pursuing athletic passions, new and old. Plenty of competitive outlets exist for adults willing to look for them, from triathlons to regional ping-pong leagues. Many of these endeavors lack coaching on the level of college or high school athletics, so there’s still a greater need for personal accountability to get in a lift or go on that extra run between practices. The trick is finding something that makes exercising seem once again like a means to a worthwhile end, even if that end is an otherwise inconsequential performance in a weekend softball league.
For me, that outlet is Olympic Weightlifting, a sport so obscure in this country that we get demolished—and I mean demolished—in international competition by smaller nations like Poland, Armenia, and Borat’s own Kazakhstan. The sport involves two lifts—the snatch and the clean and jerk—with the ultimate goal of putting a whole bunch of weight overhead. As any myopic observer could tell you by looking at me, it’s not bodybuilding, nor is it power lifting or strongman: two strength sports that thrive on shaved heads and music that makes Metallica sound like Elton John. It’s a unique combination of strength, speed, and flexibility, three qualities I possess in thimble-small amounts. But even though I’m far from the ideal competitor—and apart from the fact that training facilities and experienced coaches are notoriously difficult to find—Olympic Weightlifting has given me a reason to get off the couch and force my body back into some semblance of functionality. The sport even has “Masters” divisions for older competitors separated into age groups; among my greatest surprises was the first time I saw an 80-year-old whip 150 pounds overhead.
We will inevitably leave college to lead infinitely interesting and impossibly busy lives. The commitment to fitness can be a tough one, given the many other responsibilities we’ll accumulate. But fulfilling our obligations to our bodies pays dividends beyond comparison, and it helps us to be more productive in every other facet of our lives. Finding that lifelong sport or sports makes doing this so much easier—and a whole lot more rewarding. It’s also a great excuse to wear breakaway pants far into your golden years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a gathering at the Barker Center yesterday, MIT Psychology Professor Sherry Turkle—whose work has focused on the psychological impact of technology—said that despite technology’s potential to bring society together, its users often feel isolated.
The Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior invited Turkle to speak about her recent book, “Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other.”
Turkle said that “Alone Together” is actually the third book in a trilogy—also including 1984’s “The Second Self” and 1995’s “Life on the Screen”—that records the arc of society’s relationship with technology.
As a psychologist, Turkle said she was drawn to the world of technology when she first arrived at MIT.
She said she realized that technology—and computers in particular—had a psychological impact that received little attention at the time.
“It was a mind machine and people had a connection with this mind machine,” Turkle said.
In her research, she has followed technology’s expanding role in society.
Today, despite the apparent evidence, Turkle said she does not like to talk about technology “addiction.”
She said she has heard of mothers texting or checking their e-mail while breast feeding infants, and parents who would check their Blackberries while driving with children in the backseat.
Even so, Turkle said, she avoids the word addiction and instead uses “vulnerability” because addiction assumes that the only solution is to completely cut out the problem.
“Technology is our partner,” she said, adding that it would be impossible to entirely give it up.
Instead, she said, we should consider how technology interacts with our social values and the values we transmit to our children.
Turkle said she had seen many examples of children who have complained of their parents’ overuse of technology.
“If you don’t teach your children how to be alone, they’ll always only know how to be lonely,” she added.

The Harvard Institute of Politics has introduced a new, multi-year grant initiative called “Gov 2.0,” which will give a $5000 stipend to a student or group of students to support an entrepreneurial project in the realm of politics or government.
“The goal is for students to utilize new technologies—combining entrepreneurship and politics in innovative ways—to make a tangible impact on politics in today’s world,” wrote Amy A. Howell, director of the IOP’s internship programs, in an e-mailed statement.
Although students from all disciplines are encouraged to apply, Jenny Ye ’13, Internships Committee Chair at the IOP, said that the organization hopes that the creation of this grant program will especially push students involved in technology and engineering to consider how their unique skill sets can contribute to civic and political progress.
“We are looking for a combination of people with the technical skill set who may not be engaged with politics and public service [as well as] entrepreneurs and innovative groups that are trying to think of the next big thing,” said Ye. “We want them to apply [their] creativity and innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to thinking about how do we solve important civic and political problems,”
Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, president of the IOP, said that the program is designed not only to support the eventual winner, but also to create a community of political entrepreneurs on campus.
To foster this connection, the IOP has designed an intermediary seminar to be attended by all of the finalists before the official winner is announced. At the seminar, leaders in the field of political entrepreneurship will work with the students to help fine-tune their proposals and to connect them with individuals who might be helpful in pursuing their projects, regardless of whether they ultimately receive the grant.
Although the program has no official connection to the Hack Harvard program sponsored by the Undergraduate Council during Optional Winter Activities Week, Eric N. Hysen ’11, former UC vice president, said that both programs have a similar mission in their desire to apply analytical skills to solving problems within the Harvard community and beyond.
“The mission here is let’s empower some technical Harvard student who would otherwise think about working in the tech industry, completely not related to government, and let’s give them the ability to put their skills to work to make some government or some government agency or something with politics better,” said Hysen.
Applications for the Gov 2.0 Summer Grant are due on Friday, March 4 at 5 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a junior at Yale University, Willis “Chip” Arndt Jr. lived with eight other people in a dorm room that had originally been built to house only four.
Arndt, a resident of Calhoun College who graduated from Yale in 1990, describes the Calhoun he lived in as “antiquated.”
“People were living on top of each other,” Arndt says.
According to Arndt, in addition to a lack of space and leaky faucets, Calhoun failed to provide adequate accommodations for female students after Yale began admitting women in 1969.
Yale attempted to hastily renovate Calhoun College in 1989, planning construction in the summer months in order to minimize the impact on students. The original renovation was incomplete and required far more money and resources than Yale had anticipated.
“Corners got cut in ’89,” Jon E. Olsen, the project manager overseeing the 2008 renovation of Calhoun, told the Yale Daily News that year.
By the end of the century, when even the youngest colleges began to show wear and tear, Yale decided to embark on the ambitious renovation of all of its residential colleges. The construction process would cost Yale University about $1 billion and take over a decade to complete.
Harvard’s 12 Houses and Yale’s 12 colleges both serve as academic and social communities. Furthermore, the residential systems at these two Ivies trace their roots to donations from the same philanthropist—Yale alumnus Edward S. Harkness.
And the systems will soon take similar paths yet again, as House renewal at Harvard—which is slated to begin with the renovation of Old Quincy House as a test case in June of 2012—represents an undertaking similar in mission and in scope to the renovation of the residential colleges at Yale.
Although the plans for Harvard are far from finalized, those involved with House renewal have said that they have gained insight from observing the experiences of Harvard’s longtime rival.
LESSONS FROM A NEMESIS
Housing systems at Harvard and Yale are quite comparable. Although Yale assigns its students to their colleges before the beginning of freshman year, both universities provide upperclassmen with a similar residential experience, including dining halls, common rooms, and traditions.
Members of the committee that drafted the 2009 Report on Harvard House Renewal, which developed recommendations for House renovations, toured recently restored undergraduate dormitories at Yale and Princeton. According to Quincy House Master and committee member Lee Gehrke, the tours were helpful in teaching them about residential renovations, although the final plans, he says, will be “distinctly Harvard.”
“We have learned a great deal from Yale and Princeton about what worked and what didn’t work,” Gehrke said in January. “So I feel very confident that what happens will be very good for Quincy and for the entire housing system here at Harvard.”
RENOVATION TIME
Having realized the impracticality of renovating an entire residential college in a single summer after its experience with Calhoun College in 1989, Yale decided to embark on a new and comprehensive series of renovations.
The university began work at Berkeley College in 1998 and, from then on, proceeded to renovate a different college at the rate of about one per year, with each college taking an average of 15 months to complete.
Similarly, the renovation of Old Quincy House is projected to take 15 months in total, according to a January Harvard press release.
As the 2012 start date for the renovation approaches, Harvard administrators have confirmed that accessibility for students with disabilities and sustainability efforts will likely be among the initiative’s top priorities.
Yale contractors attempted to integrate more beds into each College as part of a larger effort to increase the size of Yale’s undergraduate class. No similar goal has been reported for the Harvard renovations.
Jonathan S. Holloway, master of Calhoun College, says that these issues, in addition to bringing facilities up to fire code, were extremely important during the Yale residential college renovation.
“This was an opportunity to physically restore the buildings and to make them better adapted to the lifestyles of late 20th century and early 21st century students,” Yale School of Architecture Dean Robert A. M. Stern says.
With goals akin to those of its counterpart in New Haven, Harvard has retained the services of the same architectural firm behind the renovation of half of the Yale colleges. KieranTimberlake, a Philadelphia-based company, has also tackled projects at Cornell, Middlebury, and the University of Pennsylvania as well as at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C.
A MATTER OF MONEY
In September 2006, Yale announced an ongoing capital campaign that seeks to fund improvements across the university, including renovations to its residential colleges. The campaign, known as “Yale Tomorrow,” aims to raise $3.5 billion by July 1, 2011.
That the university had to embark on a capital campaign to fund the large-scale renovations speaks to the enormous costs associated with residential renovations.
Estimates for the price tag of House renewal at Harvard have hovered between $1 billion and $1.3 billion. At Yale, the university had invested over $500 million into the construction process by November 2007, with four colleges then yet to be renovated.
Even after Yale’s endowment plummeted during the financial crisis—falling by nearly a quarter to $16.3 billion in the 2009 fiscal year—Yale refused to scale back on the construction, according to Morse College Master Frank C. Keil.
“The president and the corporation were convinced that because [college renovation] had been so successful in the past, they weren’t going to cut back,” Keil says.
Harvard faced a 27.3 percent loss in its endowment during the 2009 fiscal year—the largest single year decline in its history—but amid that decline, Harvard administrators similarly continued to assert the importance of House renewal. In an op-ed in The Crimson at the end of 2008, Harvard President Drew G. Faust, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds reiterated their support for House renewal, vowing to ensure that “Harvard’s nearly 80-year-old experiment in House life continues, updated and energized.”
Harvard is in the midst of launching its own capital campaign, with the primary goal of raising money for the renovation of the Houses, administrators say. One senior FAS administrator says that the fundraising goal of the newest campaign will likely surpass records.
TIME TO SWING
A lingering question that looms over House renewal is where to house the 180 students that will be displaced by the renovation of Old Quincy. In the January press release that announced the upcoming construction in Old Quincy, Harvard said that these students could potentially live in Harvard Real Estate Services-owned buildings.
But regardless of the plans that FAS devises to accommodate residents of Old Quincy, the renovation of full Houses will force far more students from their rooms, meaning the challenge of temporary housing will likely persist throughout renewal efforts.
Yale faced a similar dilemma during its renovations.
Yale elected to construct a brand new building—a “swing space”—where students would reside during the year that their college was being renovated.
Originally the building was intended to be temporary, but Holloway says that “it’s been so successful that it’s going to be there for a long time.”
No matter how Harvard solves the issue of swing housing, Gehrke says that it will likely be detrimental to Quincy House’s sense of community.
“During those 15 months, some of our students are going to be living in swing space, and we want to make sure that the Quincy community is still unified and that the students feel that they still have a House that welcomes them and that they’re excited about,” Gehrke said in January.
Some Yale students liked the modernity and novelty of their swing space, but others brought up the difficulty of maintaining a social atmosphere that Gehrke mentioned.
“It’s not a community,” says Kevin D. Adkisson, a junior in Morse College who lived in the swing space during construction. “We didn’t really bond much as a college.”
Yale college masters attributed the lack of community to the absence of a dining hall in the swing space. “The dining hall is the lifeblood of the college,” Keil says.
During construction at Harvard, those displaced from Old Quincy will still eat in the Quincy House dining hall, located in New Quincy.
‘A SHOT OF ADRENALINE’
Keil says that the renovation of the residential colleges “really has been a shot of adrenaline for the entire college.”
Keil’s own Morse College, which reopened this past fall after extensive construction, now contains a 120-foot theater, numerous skylights and floodlights, and a waterfall in the courtyard.
Each renovated college has a number of modern amenities, including fully-equipped gyms, dance and recording studios, and art galleries.
Though no comparable modifications to the Harvard Houses have been confirmed, “plans must recognize the place the Houses hold in our history even as they clear the way for future growth—both personal and physical,” Faust, Smith, and Hammonds wrote in the 2008 Crimson op-ed.
The 13-year renovation of Yale’s residential colleges is slated to conclude this year with the completion of Ezra Stiles College, but despite the fact that the official timeline for construction is almost finished, masters say that in reality the process is far from over.
Steven B, Smith, master of Branford College—the second college to be renovated—says parts of his building had to be redone even after Yale officially opened the renovated building.
“There were problems that started to come up a year later,” Smith says.
Construction on Morse College ended this past year, but Keil says that he expects that it will take well over a year to fix the “unanticipated” problems, which he says range “from toilets that don’t flush to lights that don’t go off.”
AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Although administrators have reaffirmed their commitment to renovating the Houses, the details of House renewal’s future remain uncertain. Harvard has yet to set a timeline for the remainder of House renewal or to finalize renovation plans for Old Quincy.
“Because the process is currently ongoing, there are no final decisions about specific designs to report at this time,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mail. “I expect we will have much more information about specific design concepts to share with the Harvard community and with The Crimson in May.”
Until then, according to Neal, architects are in the process of drafting plans and soliciting feedback from students, faculty, and staff across the College. Even with extensive preparations, however, any plan may face a surprise or two.
“The renovation of old buildings always presents unexpected challenges,” Yale University Planner Laura A. Cruickshank wrote in an e-mail. “So the rule of thumb is to ‘expect the unexpected’ and build time into the schedule to address the issues that arise.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last semester, Folklore and Mythology concentrator Noah A. Hoch ’11 paused from thesis-writing for a moment of reflection.
“I realized that I wasn’t enjoying or connecting with my thesis,” he says.
“I e-mailed the other seniors in the program to try to figure out if something was wrong or if I should just plough through.”
But when he conferred with fellow concentrators, he faced a surprising consensus.
“Every person told me that they were enjoying their work,” he says.
Hoch attributes the positive responses to the flexible thesis requirements that are extended to the five senior concentrators in Folklore and Mythology.
This year, the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology decided to further expand these requirements in order to give students the opportunity to assert more creativity in their thesis projects.
As a result, beginning next year, seniors will have the option to either complete a traditional written analysis or pursue another medium of representing their time within the concentration.
Struggling with his written thesis—a critical assessment of the internet as a medium for folklore creation—Hoch chose to take advantage of the flexible thesis requirements that are already in place.
He is now expanding upon an idea for a short story that he had devised—with folklore theory in mind—for a creative writing class.
NEW POSSIBILITIES
Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology Chair Stephen A. Mitchell says that the new flexibility in thesis requirements will focus more attention on what the students want to take away from their undergraduate experience.
“The [written] thesis is still in place, and people can still choose to do it, but they can also choose to do some sort of performance or exhibit, or an extended essay,” he says.
“We just were imagining that not everyone needs to do an extended scholarly essay to prove that they know the field [when] that could be done in other, more expressive ways,” he says.
When this issue had been raised in the past, the Committee had opted to retain the traditional view of the written thesis requirement, according to Mitchell.
But after a series of meetings this fall, he says, the Committee unanimously approved the new requirements.
The Committee was following the lead of concentrations such as Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, which also expanded thesis requirements beyond the traditional written thesis, Mitchell notes.
“We’re opening up for possibilities,” he says. “This is a recognition that not every student wants to go to graduate school and have an idea of exactly what they want to do once they leave Harvard.”
Deborah Foster, the director of undergraduate studies in folklore and mythology, acknowledges that this decision was made partly to offer students more opportunities to explore within their focus field in the concentration.
“We have begun to think seriously about the many ways in which knowledge can be represented and are expanding beyond the analytical essays to find other ways in which we can recognize the synthesis of knowledge,” she says.
THE CREATIVE PROCESS.
Folklore and Mythology concentrator Julia E. Cain ’11 does not boast of her knack for making tapestries, but she says that she could not fully understand her focus field in the culture of hand-made creations without practical experience.
“When I was working on finding a thesis, I knew that I wanted to do something with textiles,” she says. “But making them is an important part of being able to relate to it.”
Cain says that she first thought to create a tapestry for her senior thesis two years ago, and approached the Visual and Environmental Studies Department with a proposal.
“I approached VES to see if I should do a joint in the two concentrations, and they told me that they couldn’t help me because textile work wasn’t their wheelhouse,” she says.
But with her own concentration’s decision to expand the requirements, Cain’s proposal is now becoming a reality.
Cain is the first student to pursue the new thesis requirement, which will otherwise go into effect next year.
“I love that the Folk and Myth department is flexible enough to allow us to be creative in our thesis work,” she says.
Cain says that she feared abandoning her personal interests for the sake of a  traditional written thesis.
“I like the scale, the grandeur, and the ability of things that I can include [within a tapestry] because I am working on that kind of a scale,” she says. “[Folk and Myth Department] knows that we are a creative group, and that sometimes a giant paper is not the best way to show everything that you’ve learned and to be representative of your time.”
The new flexibility in the requirement will also help students prepare for future career paths, Cain says.
“I’m not going to grad school—I’m trying to be a costumer for television and movies,” she says. “In that sense, a paper won’t particularly impress anyone, but something that shows what I can do is not only impressive, but also goes in my portfolio and might get me a job.”
Cain also says her thesis is an accurate reflection of her experience within the program—more accurate than a written thesis might have been.
Her project is a tapestry piece spanning over 10 feet in both length and width, that depicts a series of fairy-tale and folklore scenes which incorporate weaving. The tapestry includes a variety of different techniques: crocheting, embroidery, silk weaving, and hand-spun yarn.
“My grandmother was a little skeptical. She said, ‘So what, you’re going to put it on a bed?’ I told her to think a little bigger: maybe on three beds next to each other,” she says.
Cain acknowledges concerns that theses of this nature may be difficult to assess.
“They asked me, ‘How will we know if you did a good job?’ And I told them, ‘You’ll just know,’” Cain says.

The proportion of seniors completing the General Education program has doubled from 10 to 20 percent since the start of the academic year, according to the Gen Ed office.
Seniors and juniors have had the option to switch out of the old Core program ever since the new Gen Ed program was introduced in Fall 2009, according to Associate Director of the Program in General Education Anne Marie E. Calareso.
“I don’t think it is surprising,” wrote Calareso in an e-mailed statement. “The Gen Ed committee worked to ensure that students who entered under the Core would have added flexibility in completing their requirements.”
Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen said the Gen Ed committee gave a Core designation to every course that was approved as a Gen Ed in order to give students options in deciding which program to complete.
“We made a deliberate attempt to make it easy for them to switch if they want, and have access to all [the Gen Ed] courses,” she said.
To switch programs, seniors and juniors must obtain the signature of their resident deans and propose a plan for how they intend to complete their remaining requirements. This paperwork is submitted using the Student Planning Portal.
Helen E. Bradshaw ’11, who switched to Gen Ed last year, said she thinks that Gen Ed requirements are more convenient for most seniors.
“I think a lot of people have switched over because requirements are easier to meet and more straightforward,” she said. “It’s easier than figuring out what’s exempt and what’s not exempt.”
Calareso added that some students have even switched programs when it did not reduce the number of courses they were required to take.
“I’ve definitely talked to students who have three Cores left to do and four Gen Eds, who switched to Gen Ed because the four Gen Eds they have left to do are more interesting to them than the three Cores they have to do,” Calareso said.
Brandon T. Perkovich ’11 said he was partially motivated to switch programs because he liked the philosophy of the Gen Ed program.
“It made this explicit push to find connections between the work you’re doing inside and outside the classroom,” he said. “That was the most meaningful change to me.”
On the other hand, Pelin Kivrak ’11 said she stayed in the Core program because she had already taken six Core courses by the time Gen Ed was instituted.
She added that she does not regret her decision to stay in the Core.
“I’m very satisfied with the Core program,” she said. “It’s my personality, I think. I don’t like switching in the middle of things.”
Sean K. Gil ’11 said he stayed in the Core program because he had planned out his courses in advance, but added that he wished he could have completed Gen Ed from the start.
“I do wish it had arrived sooner, at least relative to my education,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the death of Reverend Peter J. Gomes on Monday, Harvard has lost one of its most celebrated figures—a man loved for his oratory, his staunch advocacy for equality, and his three and a half decade-long ministry of Memorial Church.
Gomes died Monday evening after a brain aneurysm and heart attack. He was 68.
For many in the Harvard community, Gomes—who was the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at the Harvard Divinity School—was at the center of the University. As a minister, an adviser, and a friend to those who knocked on his door, he leaves a deep mark on Harvard’s history.
“No one epitomizes all that is good about Harvard more than Peter J. Gomes,” said professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. in a statement.
Gomes was a long-time advocate of political equality and emerged as a leading figure of the gay rights movement on campus. Gomes’ coming out as gay was hailed as a turning point at Harvard, and Gomes gained national recognition as a prominent Christian figure who was also a gay activist.
In recent years, Gomes became one of the most beloved figures at the University where he presided over countless Commencement and Convocation ceremonies. He was one of few individuals on campus who it was impossible to miss—whether preaching in his characteristically booming voice or welcoming freshmen to campus in an avuncular, friendly tone. And dressed in elegant tweed, tortoiseshell glasses, and a dark wood cane, he could do nothing but stand out to the students who saw him wander through the Yard.
“Peter Gomes was an original,” Harvard President Drew G. Faust said in a statement. “Through his wisdom and appreciation of the richness of the human spirit Reverend Gomes has left an indelible mark on the institution he served with unmatched devotion and creativity.”
SPEAKING UP
“I am a Christian who happens as well to be gay”—with those words, spoken before a crowd of protesters gathered in front of Widener Library, Gomes came out to the Harvard community. The year was 1991 and the crowd, gathered to rally against homophobic remarks published in a magazine, erupted in applause.
The announcement was a seminal moment for the gay rights movement at Harvard and quickly made Gomes one of its leaders.
“He was a scholar, a preacher, a teacher, and a public intellectual who brought religion into politics in ways that illumined our thought. At important moments, he stood up for things that mattered—for freedom, for liberty, and for equality,” said Memorial Church Associate Minister and longtime friend Dorothy A. Austin.
“As he stood there and watched various people come out in front of the crowd, I remember him saying, ‘This is the time to speak up,’” Austin said. “That led the way very powerfully in the movement.”
After the announcement, Gomes remained a powerful voice on issues of gay rights.
“The way to the future is always paved by extending, not restricting, liberties,” he wrote in the Boston Globe in 2004. “To extend the civil right of marriage to homosexuals will ... permit a whole class of persons both to benefit from a valuable yet vulnerable institution.”
Austin recalled Gomes arriving at the Massachusetts State House in 2004 wearing his characteristically ornate garb. He delivered an impassioned speech to gay marriage advocates.
“It was a very powerful moment,” Austin said.
According to Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey G. Cox Jr., Gomes never felt alienated at Harvard after revealing his orientation, as calls for his resignation were widely ignored.
According to Cox, Gomes once told him that when he “came out as gay there were fewer raised eyebrows and comments than when people found out I was a Republican.”
Gomes was a long-time Republican in a University known for its liberal faculty and delivered prayers at the inaugurations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.
But in recent years, Gomes’ political views began to shift to the left.
In 2006, he registered as a Democrat in order support of the gubernatorial candidacy of Deval L. Patrick ’78. Gomes delivered a prayer at Patrick’s inauguration.
“Peter Gomes was a unique individual and beloved friend,” Patrick said in a statement sent to The Crimson. “He taught so many that faith is not just what you say you believe, but how you live. His loss is profound for so many, including [my wife] and me.”
A LEADING VOICE
But Gomes will perhaps be best remembered for his sermons in Memorial Church, where he would address the audience in a booming, sonorous voice and deploy a style that seemed largely pulled from another era, harkening back to the great tradition of Baptist oratory.
With that voice—and a profound message of religious toleration—he tended to fill the pews.
“While attendance at some college churches has dwindled, it has not at all at Memorial Church,” Cox said. “Part of the reason for this is the eloquence of Peter’s preaching and his welcoming attitude.”
During his time as Harvard’s spiritual lodestar, Gomes became a leading voice for pluralistic religious ethics and was well known for saying that one could interpret the Bible in a variety of ways, noting that Biblical passages had been used to support both slavery and liberation.
“The Bible alone is the most dangerous thing I can think of,” he once said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times.
“You need an ongoing context and a community of interpretation to keep the Bible current and to keep yourself honest. Forget the thought that the Bible is an absolute pronouncement.”
“I think he is the greatest of the clergy men that Harvard has had,” longtime friend and Divinity School Professor Emeritus Preston N. Williams said.
“When it comes to the matter of Christian morals, he did a number one job for the University. What he did was for the University and not simply the Protestant community within the University.”
On Wednesday afternoons, Gomes opened his home to the Harvard community for tea, an event that became an institution of its own where faculty, staff, and students mingled in his elegant Victorian abode.
As the professor for Religion 1513: “The History of Harvard and Its Presidents,” University traditions and history were of primary concern to Gomes, Cox said. Last year, when Cox wanted to exercise the right—attached to his endowed chair—to graze a cow on Harvard’s property, Gomes was crucial in making the event happen.
When Cox said that he was worried that security guards might intervene, Gomes quipped, “They would never dare,” according to Cox.
EARLY DAYS
Gomes was born on May 22, 1942 and raised in Plymouth, Mass. As a child, Gomes was a voracious reader whose parents had always stressed the importance of education, according to Linda H. Bunza, a long-time friend who first met Gomes while studying with him at Bates College,
“When he was a little boy, he would go to the basement and stand on cranberry crates and pretend to preach to the crowd,” she said. “He was a born preacher.”
Gomes attended local public schools in Plymouth. He was elected president of his class as a senior and oversaw the research and genealogy department at the local library, Bunza said.
“I think he looks to that place as where he gained his confidence,” she said of Gomes’ coming of age in Plymouth. “They saw the great gift that young man had and they nurtured it.”
Gomes’ love of his native town continued throughout his life. He served as the chairman of the committee to celebrate its 400th anniversary.
“As an African American growing up in Plymouth he was of course a minority,” Cox said. “It’s rather indicative of how Peter was able to absorb, in his own way, traditions that were not biologically his own and make them his own. His whole life he was so steeped in the history of his hometown.”
After graduating from high school in Plymouth, Gomes attended Bates College in Maine, where he majored in history.
“He was a man about campus and everyone knew him,” Bunza said. “He didn’t act at all different than anyone else, but he was probably more regal.”
After graduating from Bates in 1965, Gomes enrolled at Harvard Divinity School. He was ordained in 1968.
Gomes then moved Alabama to teach history at Tuskegee Institute—where he remained until he returned to Harvard as an assistant minister in Memorial Church in 1970.
Four years later, he was appointed Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, positions he held until his death.
Memorial Church will be open tomorrow for the community to honor Gomes beginning at 9 a.m. The University is planning a formal memorial service for this Spring.

As if the Harvard men’s basketball game against Princeton on Saturday didn’t have enough riding on its outcome already, the contest will now be broadcast live from Lavietes Pavilion on ESPN3.com.
The announcement came less than a month after ESPN.com college basketball columnist Andy Katz named the Harvard-Princeton basketball rivalry as one of “the most competitive competitions for the next few years as Sydney Johnson and Tommy Amaker build conference powers.” The budding rivalry between these Ivy powers is undoubtedly gaining recognition across the country.
For the few Crimson sports fans unaware of Saturday’s significance, the 7 p.m. game will likely hold Ancient Eight championship implications. If both teams beat their respective opponents on Friday, Princeton (22-5, 10-1 Ivy) would clinch the title outright with a victory on Saturday, while Harvard (21-5, 10-2) would secure at least a share of the title with a win.
And now with the title on the line, the Crimson will have to compete before not only its own peers and alumni, but also before the eyes of the world—or at least the eyes of the avid visitors of ESPN3.com.
The highly anticipated game is sold out with four days still to go until tipoff. At nine this morning, 400 tickets were made available free for undergraduates at the ticket office in the Murr  Center, and as of 3 p.m. today, less than 100 tickets remained.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than two weeks left until the warm embrace of Spring Break, the college seems to have shaken off the deep freeze from this past weekend and now students and athletes alike head to the libraries to burn the midnight oil in time for midterms and papers. What’s more, this past week has been one of mixed emotions for Harvard's athletes. From heartbreak to exhilaration and everything in between, the Crimson men and women have experienced it all. So let’s take a breather around the water cooler and break down the latest and greatest from the Ancient Eight.
On the ice, the Crimson women’s hockey team advanced to the ECAC semifinals for the 12th consecutive year after a quarterfinal sweep of St. Lawrence. Next Harvard will face off against Ivy foe Dartmouth. So far the Crimson and the Big Green have met six times in the ECAC tournament with Dartmouth winning four of those contests. But Harvard has beaten the Big Green twice this season and looks to go three-for-three in a must-win contest between two bubble teams seeking a berth into the NCAA tournament.
This upcoming weekend, the world of Ivy League swimming and diving will converge at Blodgett Pool as the Ancient Eight vie for the 2011 Ivy League Championship trophy. Heading into the Championships, this year’s competition looks to be a complete toss-up. This season, Harvard has managed to remain unbeaten in dual meets with a 7-0 record, while Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn have each managed to gain three wins against fellow league competitors.
After a 10-1 start to the Ivy League season, the Harvard men's basketball team fell in final seconds to Yale, 70-69, and ceded first place in the league standings to Princeton. But the Crimson remains in control of its destiny. Victories over fourth-place Penn and first-place Princeton would give Harvard at least a share of its first-ever Ivy title.
On the women’s side, Harvard similarly fell against Yale, 78-64, and consequently dropped in the Ivy standings from second to third.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sky is low on a typical grey Sunday afternoon in Cambridge. Senior Michael Biega is sitting in his third floor Pforzheimer House room, holding court as challenger after challenger falls to his mastery of the Xbox 360.
“He’s the best I’ve ever met,” blockmate Chris Huxley asserts with awe.
“It really doesn’t matter the game, from Call of Duty to NHL, he’s really a dominant force,” remarks Michael Del Mauro, another blockmate. “I don’t think anyone has been able to top him.”
The scene isn’t much different from that of any number of college dorms; ask any Harvard student and he or she will tell you about that friend. But what is more remarkable about Chris, the two Michaels and their other blockmates—Matt McCollem, Pier-Olivier Michaud, Ryan Carroll, and Kyle Richter—is that in addition to being friends, roommates, and Call of Duty combatants, they have spent the last four years together on Harvard’s hockey team.
The seven of them are part of a senior class that has been through some tough times on the ice.
“They’re a great group of kids who have all suffered from unfortunate health problems throughout their careers here,” says crimson coach Ted Donato ’91.
But last Saturday on Senior Night, they put those times behind them as Biega, Del Mauro, and Michaud each scored once to lead Harvard to a 4-3 victory over St. Lawrence—their fifth win in the past six games heading into their ECAC playoff series with Clarkson this weekend.
“They persevered and fought through it all to allow for this little run we’re on right now,” Donato says.
“Our friendship, and how it’s translated to our entire team being so tight with each other, hasn’t always translated to success on the ice, but it’s definitely an important factor on any team,” Del Mauro adds. “Not having this team dynamic would be a recipe for disaster.”
When the seven arrived on campus in the fall of 2007 along with their eighth blockmate Sam Bozoian—who skated for the Crimson through his junior year—their only knowledge of one another was through word of mouth about their hockey prowess.
“We knew each other peripherally coming up through the ranks in hockey,” Del Mauro remembers. “It didn’t take very long for us to transition from being teammates to being something much greater than that—being friends.”
Though it was hockey that brought them all together and it is their team commitments that ensure they stay together for large parts of every day, they are quick to point out that their friendships go far beyond what it means to be on a team.
“We have a strong group relationship with inside jokes and established roles, but individually we all also have close friendships,” Del Mauro notes. “They’re not built purely on the fact that we are part of a team, or group; they transcend that and are meaningful one-on-one relationships with each other. It trickles down into the entire team where there is a strong group dynamic that doesn’t stifle individual connections.”
Coaches are always looking for that intangible ingredient to success: team chemistry. Donato attributes the squad’s recent success to the abundant locker room cohesion finally coalescing and manifesting itself on the ice.
“The chemistry in the locker room has always been excellent and in the last few weeks the chemistry on the ice has been much improved,” Donato says. “This group started the season with the intention of including everyone on the team and treating them with respect, and it’s great to see that showing on the ice.”
While the most important part of its season lies ahead, the group is still dealing with something all too common among seniors this semester: figuring out life after Harvard.
“These guys are and will always be my closest friends, and I definitely attribute my incredible time at Harvard to my relationships with them and the rest of my teammates,” Del Mauro says as his tone shifts from excitement over what the future holds to the realization that no matter the result of their series against Clarkson, the end of their time together with the Crimson is drawing nearer.
In a college sports culture so obsessed with winning that adults routinely compromise their morality in the pursuit of victory, it is encouraging to see a group of friends doing what they love for the right reasons.
“I’d rather lose with these guys than win anywhere else,” Del Mauro says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are days when the Harvard fan base seems nonexistent or perhaps just busy in Lamont. But when the Collegiate Squash Association National Team Championships took over Barnaby Courts last weekend, Sunday was not one of them.
In hopes of seeing the Crimson men’s squash team take on Cornell in the fifth-place match of the Potter Cup, what I stumbled upon instead was the last individual match of the national finals, which promised to break No. 1 Trinity and No. 2 Yale from a 4-4 stalemate.
The energy surrounding this contest was infectious, the intensity tangible. A Trinity alum standing near me in the mob which spilled out of the seating area expressed the pressure on Bantams’ senior Chris Binnie most accurately. “I mean, no big deal, it’s only 13 years on the line,” he laughed.
Drawn in by the crowd, I tried to find a place to watch before the fifth-place match began. Those on the outskirts could barely glimpse an occasional racket or the top of a head, but each sighting, however small, was cause for great excitement. Toward the back of the courts, the match was being shown on a TV screen with almost as many bodies bundled around it.
I wedged myself into the stands for a less obstructed view of the action.
The crowd was on its feet, alternating between tense silence and raucous cheering. Because of the nature of the squash viewing area, the end of every point sounded the same, with Bulldog and Bantam supporters interwoven on the bleachers in tangled rivalry.
After Yale sophomore Richard Dodd closed the gap a bit, his Trinity counterpart hit one into the corner and out of reach. 10-7 Binnie. With the next point, the senior sealed the deal, and Barnaby Courts erupted. In one swift motion, Binnie turned to salute the crowd of alumni, friends, family, and foes with a single, triumphant fist pump.
It gave me goose bumps. The day’s history lesson was complete and, as fans, we were a part of it: Trinity had won its 13th straight national crown.
The response to the Bantams’ winning streak—currently 244 matches, making it the longest in collegiate sports history—was visibly polarizing on Sunday afternoon. When bystanders came from various consolation matches to check the score, the news was either met with rejoice or with a groan, but always with extreme emotion.
Several fans wore “Fear the Chicken” shirts, which seemed to dare you to laugh. But how could you, really, as the Trinity capped off yet another undefeated year? After the match, Bantams young and old celebrated as Trinity players donned hats embroidered simply with the number 13.
It isn’t often that we get to see the top eight teams in the nation in any sport battle on our campus, and all of this happened right in our backyard.
Perhaps because it was a home contest or perhaps for some other reason, the area surrounding the fifth place contest between Harvard and Cornell was nearly as packed as that of the title match.
In the back courts where Harvard’s match took place, there were no scoreboards visible, making it impossible to follow along unless you were keeping track of points in your head. Though annoying at times, this added to the cohesive atmosphere for fans, as complete immersion in the contest was necessary.
For the second time on Sunday, the crowd was electric. In what could have been the biggest moment of the day, captain Reed Endresen earned a five-game win at the No. 2 spot to lead the Crimson to an eventual 5-4 victory over the Big Red.
As the senior outlasted his opponent, a deep chant of “Reed-o, Reed-o!” began to fill the Murr Center. As the game’s final ball escaped the reach of Cornell junior Alex Domenick, the crowd erupted into cheers once again.
There was something special about the fans standing, both literally and metaphorically, behind their team. As I pondered this, a Trinity player in a euphoric delirium stumbled into me and almost knocked the trophy he was carrying to the floor. I quickly snapped out of my momentary reflection.
The Harvard team remained in the Murr Center’s glass court to celebrate long after the other teams had boarded their respective buses.
It is a rare day like this that makes me most proud to be a Crimson sports fan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anything can happen.
We’ve seen it countless times in sports: the underdog triumphs, a team comes back from a three-goal deficit to win, or a shot is made with .4 seconds left on the clock. The Harvard women’s basketball team better hope for the unexpected as the Ivy League schedule comes to a close. The Crimson is clinging to the edge of the Ivy title race, and a single misstep could push it out of contention.
After starting out its season with a roller coaster of wins and losses, Harvard slowly gained the consistency that a championship team needs to win it all. It built a seven-game winning streak that included a win at home against defending Ivy League champion Princeton. But a loss to Brown and a sweep by Yale ruined the team’s unblemished Ivy record and pushed the Bulldogs above the Crimson in the Ivy standings.
The prospects do not look bright for Harvard (16-9, 8-3 Ivy), which sits in third in the conference standings behind Princeton (21-4, 10-1) and Yale (13-13, 9-3). But with three games left for Harvard and the Tigers, and two games left for the Bulldogs, there is still a chance for the Crimson. Let’s analyze the ways the Ivy league could unfold in the coming days.
All the Tigers need to do to make their second consecutive NCAA tournament is win two of its next three games against Dartmouth, Harvard, and Penn. With three wins, Princeton’s record would stand at 13-1, at least a full game ahead of the Crimson and Bulldogs.
Needless to say, the Crimson must win its next three games—all on the road—against Penn, the Tigers, and Dartmouth if it wants a chance at sharing Princeton’s spot atop the standings. But Harvard will also need some help from either Penn or Dartmouth. If either the Quakers or Big Green in addition to Harvard can upset the Tigers, then Princeton will have to hold off on booking its ticket to the tourney. The Tigers would finish with an 11-3 record, allowing the Crimson and the Elis to still be in contention.
The only way that Harvard or Yale could win the title outright is if Princeton lost its next three games; but with Dartmouth ranked seventh in the league, it’s unlikely that will happen. But here are two ways in which the Crimson could at least force a playoff for the title.
Situation One:
If the Tigers lose two of their next three games, Yale loses one or two of its games, and Harvard wins out, then the Crimson and Princeton would be tied at the top of the Ivy League with 11-3 records.
The probability of Yale losing at least one game is remarkably high, as the Bulldogs face fourth-ranked Columbia next Friday. When the squads first met, the Lions came out on top, 67-57. The first time Harvard faced Columbia, the Crimson pulled out a win with a buzzer-beater by freshman Christine Clark, proving that even with a 5-7 conference record, Columbia has the chops to pull out a victory against Yale.
With a loss to Columbia, the Bulldogs would be out of contention and Harvard and Princeton would square off in a one-game playoff with the winner claiming the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
Situation Two:
The most interesting situation by far is if Princeton loses two games and both Yale and Harvard win out. If this were to happen, all three teams would be tied in the Ivy League with an 11-3 record.
As Ivy League rules state, if more than two teams are tied, a pair of one-game playoffs will be held with a coin toss to decide which squad gets a bye in the opening round. The last time a three-team tie took place was during the 2007-08 season when Harvard, Cornell, and Dartmouth all finished the season 11-3. The Big Green beat the Crimson in the first playoff, while Cornell crushed Dartmouth in the final playoff to secure the NCAA berth.
So yes, anything can happen.

With eight nominations at the recently passed Academy Awards, The Social Network has the world thinking about two of Harvard’s finest alumni.
Not Mark Zuckerberg and his greasy haired friend, Eduardo Saverin–I’m talking about Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin 6’5”, 210-pound powerhouse rowers.
Before they rivaled Zuckerberg for the rights to Facebook, the Winklevosses rowed for the heavyweight men’s crew team. And while The Social Network portrays the Winklevoss twins as conniving, quasi-antagonists, at one point they were just ordinary Harvard student-athletes. Right?
Almost. The Winklevosses, both economics concentrators and members of the Porcellian Club, may have appeared normal on land, but in the water they were anything but.
As members of the class of 2004, the twins left their mark. The spring of 2004 is often regarded as the best men’s heavyweight crew season in school history, and the strength and depth of its graduating class played a large role in the Crimson's success.
Additionally, after Harvard, the Winklevosses have achieved incredible athletic success. They competed in men’s pair rowing for the United States in the 2008 Olympics and are currently training for the 2012 Games in London.
So even as the pair comes under scrutiny for their portrayals in The Social Network, remember: the twins win, and they could rack up one more victory on the world stage next year.

Right in time for Natalie Portman's Oscar victory on Sunday came what many of us have been waiting for: a "Black Swan" that's a little lighter. Last week, Insanitas—Harvard's newest sketch comedy group—dropped "African-American Swan," a three-minute "Black Swan" parody. The short film stars Edith J. Taylor '12 and Leslie R. Rith-Najarian '12 as ballerinas interacting with a director (Dante A. Pearson '12) who interprets "black" and "white" quite literally.
Though some may see political undertones in "African-American Swan," Pearson, who also produced the film, said that the comedy group—composed of Alejandro Berron '12, James W. Nitze '12, Pearson, and Caroline A. Solomon '12—made the video in good fun.
"I just thought it'd be a funny idea if the director had different ideas of what black and white mean … if you took that incredibly literally," Pearson said. "That'd be kind of fun if there was some controversy."
Nitze reported that Insanitas intends to produce two or three more videos this semester, with the next one scheduled for release before spring break.
"It's pretty ragtag right now," he said. "You produce a few videos, and you build a small following, and then maybe more people want to be involved."
As for the now, Insanitas has a simple mission. "We're just interested in making funny stuff," Berron said.

Housing day is now a week away, and Cabot is on a roll, having released two new videos in addition to one several days ago . Eliot has now entered the fray with a video claiming to be Harvard's top House.
 
Cabot is eager to show off its facilities. Following up on "Cabot Cribs," the House gives a tour of its gym, proclaiming "the weight is over." They also have a video featuring the infamous Cabot igloo. However, the video is more kid-friendly, featuring a youngster throwing snowballs by the igloo to the tune of the "Star Wars" theme.
 
Eliot also released a video, which claims all other Houses are trying to "overcompensate." Why? For one thing, Eliot was rated the best House last year by Flyby, an achievement proudly displayed in their video. We really can't argue with that logic.
