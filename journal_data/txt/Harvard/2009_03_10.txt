After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The diagnosis is in, and Harvard Medical School is still a little under the weather—not from the common cold or chicken pox, but because of its faculty’s nebulous relationships with drug companies. The practice of pharmaceutical companies having contracts with medical professors is not peculiar to Harvard—collaboration and financial backing of doctors by pharmaceuticals is common in the field. What is unique at HMS, however, is that these relationships are not openly disclosed to the student body or the public.
The lack of transparency in these partnerships has aroused quite a stir among HMS students uncomfortable with the influence that drug companies may have on their professors’ course material, and with good reason. Harvard’s policy of not disclosing its teachers’ ties to drug companies must end. Similar to common practice at other medical schools, HMS must create a uniform and standardized way of disclosing its faculty members’ ties to their funding, regardless of the effort it will take to collect this data.
Medicine and medical research are clearly not immune from the tough economic climate now facing every other aspect of society. Therefore, potential changes to conflict-of-interest policies should not diminish the beneficial cooperation between pharmaceuticals and medical schools but instead make this collaboration widely publicized. Beyond grants, drug companies still comprise a major source of funding for medical research, and this interdependence cannot change.
While research funding should stay constant, what must come to an end is the accompanying gifts doctors sometimes receive from drug companies—money that provides no benefit to the research being done. These gifts, similar to political kickbacks, only work to bias professors and physicians in their care and teaching, thereby harming students and patients. 
There has been some progress with this information disclosure campaign, and the recent ruling that students must be informed of their professors’ affiliations is a small step in the right direction. Pressure also to expedite this process has come from U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, who has requested that Pfizer—one of the leading pharmaceutical companies—disclose its ties to HMS. We are pleased to see that Pfizer has agreed to this request, but the impetus for funding transparency must come from the Harvard Medical School itself for credibility upon which medical education depends to be reestablished.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The prevailing fog that has occluded the administration’s plans for J-term lifted momentarily this past weekend, but the forecast looks bleak nonetheless. At a question-and-answer session for junior parents this past Friday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris informed parents that housing at the College during January of next year—which will no longer host reading period or exams—might only be granted to international students, athletes, and other special-interest groups. This sudden revelation is emblematic of the disturbing mixed signals that the student body is now receiving about J-term plans.
As late as April of last year, Harris engaged in dialogue with the Undergraduate Council to brainstorm a host of options for J-term, such as offering short classes on everything from PowerPoint to metalworking. This academic year, however, we have heard little or no concrete details from the College about its vision for the new term. Even a basic outline for the term or a window into its planning process would suffice, but, with next January looming closer, Harris’s comments are the first suggestion of a new and very different plan in the works.
The College is either being too obscure about J-term or it has clearly not planned well enough for the changing calendar. As we approach the end of this school year—with an administration that recently has tended toward pushing plans off—it is far too late to not have a clear conception of what January will be. The schedule change has been under consideration for years, and the idea that the College is still uncertain about this essential component is troubling. If budget anxiety is to blame for the prolonged uncertainty, then the administration ought to be transparent about that. And, if truly no concrete decisions have been made, then it must make finalizing this aspect of the calendar a priority.
Undergraduates had high expectations for the new January term. We anticipated the possibility of new and interesting classes, college-backed internships, and short-term study-abroad programs, all offered with the freedom for students to create their own January experience. It is lamentable that the College is considering not only dropping these possible opportunities, but also refusing the majority of students to even live on campus during the term. Without living accommodations, students will even be denied the liberty to participate in self-directed J-term activities on campus, whether that is research, an internship, or an extracurricular. January has also been an incredibly important time for senior-thesis writing—which could be deeply difficult to accomplish at home. Furthermore, it is shortsighted to believe that only specific groups of students will be excessively inconvenienced by a forced eviction. In short, J-term was not meant to be a College-wide shutdown.
If the administration intends to make drastic changes on J-term plans going forward, it needs to solicit input from students when considering possible decisions. The recent near-silence about calendar change plans does not bode well for university-student relations.
Presumably the slashing of J-term ambitions has resulted from the financial difficulty in which Harvard has suddenly found itself. However, if economic concerns are truly so dire as to threaten even the freedom to remain in the dorms next January, Harvard should instead consider cost-saving alternatives like closing the dining halls during this month or heating the Houses on a per-room basis. Given financial constraints, we understand if the College cannot fulfill student expectations next year of a J-term complete with limitless possibilities. But, by neither allowing students to remain on campus nor facilitating any educational experiences during that month, the university will have signaled a sad surrender in its mission, and in doing so it will deal a significant blow to the anticipated benefits of our calendar shift.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2007, then-presidential hopeful Barack Obama told a crowd of church members that religious good works make up “a thread that runs through our politics since the very beginning. And it puts the lie to the notion that separation of church and state in America means somehow that faith should have no role in public life.” Obama’s statement was met with much criticism—people complained that he was compromising the constitutional separation of religion and political action in an attempt to cater to the Christian right.
Obama was right, however—religion is no stranger to the political realm, nor is this inherently a bad thing. For better or worse, the two are constantly intertwined. America is not a purely secular democracy, and this is something we need to acknowledge.
From its very beginnings, America has been rooted in religion. Though the Founding Fathers instituted a “wall of separation” between church and state, they are also known to have used religious rhetoric in documents as fundamental to our understanding of nationhood as the Declaration of Independence. Indeed, what is so striking about the Declaration of Independence is that the objective source from which human equality and the listed inalienable rights are derived is a Supreme Being, “the Creator.”  The origin of our nation in religion is also manifest in many of the objects and traditions we today take for granted, like the motto on dollar bills and our celebration of Thanksgiving.
But religious sentiment persists even today, as the political arena makes abundantly clear. Our president and government officials swear their oaths on the Bible or other religious books, we have a National Prayer Day, and evangelical lobbying groups regularly make their way into the newspapers. In addition, the invocation of “faith” and “God” by political candidates is an everyday occurrence on the campaign trail, for reasons as much political as religious—a 2007 Gallup poll reports that less than half our nation would vote an atheist into the presidency. It is obvious that religion matters when the American public chooses its leaders.
For now, willfully maintaining that our nation is above religion can lead to dangerous results. Our nation is unhealthily divided over the issue, with some Americans frustrated by what they see as one particular religious group gaining dominance and others reacting to what they see as a secular onslaught on their faith. 
Some argue that, if we acknowledge our less-than-secular state, powerful religious groups in America might use this as an excuse to dominate American politics. It is apparent, however, that they do this anyway. Freedom lovers worldwide who look on American secularism with adoration would be repulsed by the revelation of how great an influence religious and pseudo-religious parties have in the United States. Failing to acknowledge this relationship will prove detrimental to our domestic as well as our foreign policy.
Under the charade that we ourselves are a secular democracy, we condemn groups that adhere to a brand of democracy that—like ours—is not quite “secular.” And, in order to prevent religious parties from coming to power, we enable far greater evils, such as sustaining dictators like Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak. The result is that we fail both to suppress religious groups and to promote democracy; religious groups merely become more popular, and Mubarak tightens his restrictions on freedoms. Yet our narrow mindset leads us to continue supporting the secular party even when indications that the religious party is more democratic come to light.
By shedding the pretense that we are secular, perhaps we can rid our foreign policy of one of its greatest hypocrisies. Furthermore, if we stop fervently brandishing secular democracy abroad, we can make more friends and fewer foes. Resentment of American foreign dominance will be tempered if we do not try to export, or impose, what we do not have ourselves—a strictly secular democracy.
It is time to recognize the importance that many people, including Americans, place on religion, even in government. Only an acceptance of our non-secular past will be able to define America in this way to itself and others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
That this is “Women’s Week” might not strike you as a miracle, but this is a good thing. This is how it should be, but not how it always was. It is normal that we now have a women’s center and a female president. The historical gender inequality at Harvard is thing of the past.
For the vast majority of its history, Harvard was a clubhouse with a “no girls allowed” sign on the door. In 1957, when Radcliffe women took the same classes as the Harvard men, they received a different degree. All ’Cliffies lived in the Quad, and there was no shuttle for transportation to the Yard. There were complex curfew rules, to which the men were not similarly subject. Absurdly, they were not allowed to wear pants unless the temperature was officially below freezing. It was “separate and unequal.”
In my father’s undergraduate classes in 1967, women still could not receive a Harvard diploma and were not allowed to even enter Lamont Library, for fear they would “distract” the boys from studying. By 1977, the feminist movement was in full swing nationally, but it was still a fight for a woman to be taken seriously as a student here. But, after the initial merger agreement with Radcliffe that gender-integrated Harvard College, women began demanding a women’s center. They were the first stirrings of a push that would continue for 30 years. This phase might have been “second-class citizenship.”
In 1997, I came to Harvard in a time of great transition for the college, when there were early experiments in “equal status.” But I realized within weeks that “my kind” didn’t seem to belong here, a feeling I heard echoed in comments of some of my black and brown friends. Pictures and statues were of white men, as were nearly all of the tenured professors whose famous classes I shopped. History recounted their stories. There were stories of negative administrative responses reports of sexual harassment and assaults on women. There were a number of gender-related resources (peer counseling groups for issues like eating disorders and sexuality, rape crisis resources, certain tutors sympathetic to women’s issues, the BGLTSA resource center, the Women’s Studies program, women’s and feminist student groups, and more), but these were disconnectedly spread across the campus. It was up to the individual with a gender-related difficulty to seek the available resources.
Yet it was a time of flux: Mine was the first class to experience the full effects of House randomization, which aimed to end the intensive racial segregation of the Houses. There were attempts to remedy racial disparities, but less attention to gender. Indeed, every time we raised the case for a centralized women’s center, we were referred to the Dean of Coeducation, Karen Avery, whose job was to ensure that “women’s stuff” didn’t interfere with more important work. The higher-up deans and officials were all men. For us, the idea of a woman president of the university was as inconceivable as the thought of a black man in the Oval Office.
There was an active feminist community, but it was relegated to Radcliffe. Everything changed with the final Harvard-Radcliffe merger in 1999, when Radcliffe ceased to exist as an undergraduate college, and Drew Faust became the first dean of the new Radcliffe Institute. Most of the woman-specific funding and programs disappeared or shifted to Harvard, and their future was shrouded in mystery. It seemed as though it would be hard to make Harvard treat us as well as Radcliffe had. We were afraid that Harvard would assume titular responsibility for us as full and equal students but would not accommodate needs that may have differed from those of our male classmates. 
After unsuccessful meetings with Avery and other deans, we asked Drew Faust for help. Despite the severed connection between Radcliffe and undergraduates due to the merger, Faust helped by arranging a series of “women’s teas,” where she met undergraduates and received their concerns. Then she arranged a brunch with the heads of all the women’s groups and invited Dean Avery. Universally, we all felt we needed more institutional support and funding, a centralized place to meet, new support for sexual violence issues, more faculty mentors and role models, and a women-friendly campus. Faust asked Avery how she was to address these students’ concern.
It was a political masterstroke. Students formed a coalition that included RUS, Association of Black Radcliffe Women, Latinas Unidas, the Coalition Against Sexual Violence, Students for Choice, the Women’s Leadership Project, and some interested women from the Undergraduate Council and from the Women’s Studies program. They all needed, as Virginia Woolf put it, a “room of one’s own.” 
Harvard was moving toward “equal status” for women, but it was not fully there. The women’s center was to centralize the existing piecemeal resources, support student action and activism around gender issues, and send a message: You belong here. In 1997, Harvard did not feel like “my” place. It did not feel like a friendly place for the women here in 1987, 1977, 1967, or 1957. There has been plenty of backlash to the idea of a women’s center and to the existence of Women’s Week. But this isn’t reverse discrimination; it helps women to feel like they are equal citizens of this college. 
Harvard was a boys’ club for centuries before women finally broke in. The disparities are not totally overcome; a forthcoming report from the Women’s Center on gender gaps in student group leadership suggests that men still tend to run the most “prestigious” student groups, defined by students themselves. But female freshmen come into the Women’s Center in their first few weeks to find a welcoming space for them as women. Full equal status has yet to come, but everyday miracles like Women’s Week and the Women’s Center bring us ever closer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looked like any other postal package, only it breathed. In California a whistleblower in the postal service reported opening a set of stinking boxes to find dying chickens inside. “They are crammed into these boxes,” she recalled, “and the live ones are climbing over the dead and dying ones and cheeping when we get them.”
This Easter, the live-chicken trade will reach its peak, and it will pass right through the innocuous looking U.S. Postal Office on Mount Auburn Street in Harvard Square. There, as at most U.S. postal offices, live baby chickens can be sent through the mail.
Minimal regulations stipulate that birds be put in ventilated boxes and be delivered within 72 hours. But that’s really all they require—senders needn’t provide food, water, or any other amenities for their living cargoes. 
Packed onto the “FedEx Lives” service, baby chickens will be sent across the nation to serve as egg layers and novelty pets this Easter. An online search revealed dozens of online vendors where I could purchase baby chicks for one to two dollars a bird, plus 25 cents postage and packaging. 
No one bothers keeping figures, but poultry industry estimates suggest that millions of birds will be posted this year. McMurray Hatchery in Iowa alone packs 200,000 chicks a week during Easter.
And, trapped in tiny postal packages, many birds will be crushed or suffocated in transportation. Most websites promised to pack extra chicks to account for the inevitable fatalities in the two to three days of transit. Premium sites even offered to insure my cargo against the off-chance that all birds show up dead.
One might think that, in such circumstances, the birds’ senders would seek to mitigate harms. Instead, Bird Shippers of America, the industry group, employs a lobbyist in Washington to push for the repeal of the few restrictions that still exist on this trade in sentient beings. 
In 2001, Congress acquiesced, passing a law that forced airlines—many of whom had previously refused to partake in this gory trade—to transport baby chicks. And, in 2005, Federal Express—the last big holdout—was similarly pressured into carting the animals.
More recently, Bird Shippers of America launched a campaign against airlines that had qualms about shipping birds in the extreme heat or cold. In 2006, in a petition to Congress, the group noted with outrage that some airlines “refused shipments of day-old chicks when temperatures reach 85 degrees” and called for an end to this impediment, citing “the right to ship live birds.” 
The U.S. Postal Service duly obliged, mandating that all air carriers accept chicks when outside temperatures are between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Shortly thereafter, a Minnesota postal worker reported disposing of boxes of birds that had perished in 95-degree heat. 
The public-health risks of this trade are manifest. The outbreak of avian influenza in Southeast Asia in 2003 was accelerated by the transport of chickens between farms—the crowded and unsanitary conditions of transport, coupled with the weak immune systems of hungry birds, furthered disease transmission. SARS and Exotic Newcastle Disease spread through similar processes.
Yet the real victims are the birds themselves. Chickens are complex animals, capable of communicating a wealth of information through 24 distinct cries. Dr. Joy Mench, professor of animal science at UC Davis, notes, “Chickens show sophisticated social behavior… They can recognize more than a hundred other chickens and remember them.” Dr. Chris Evans of Macquarie University adds that chickens can understand that a hidden object continues to exist—a comprehension beyond the ability of small children.
Crammed into tiny boxes, chickens exhibit few of these remarkable abilities. Instead, they endure three days of extreme confinement, deprivation, and stress. And, for some, this is their final voyage. One report suggested that in 2005 more birds arrived at their destination dead than alive.
Congress should act to prevent this abuse, using its right to regulate interstate commerce to stop the inhumane transport of animals. Students can avoid buying live chickens, or perhaps even the eggs they produce, this Easter. And the U.S. Postal Service should end the live chicken trade—a postal box is no place for a sentient being.

The teachings of Harvard are manifold. We are all student snowflakes: we each leave having learned a unique set of lessons. There are those who concentrate in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (is that a thing?) and there are those who concentrate in Folklore and Mythology (just kidding!). Some of us learn about history, others learn about literature, and still others learn about history and literature. Many of us leave with increased appreciation for “Lolita” and alcohol, with ineffable enmities for Henry James and sobriety (thanks DAPA!). There are even an elite few who learn how to tie bowties. But there’s one thing that all of us learn here, one thing that each individual in this snowstorm of learning we call Harvard takes beyond its ivied walls. That golden lesson? 
Never, ever be on time. For anything. 
We are all united by the democratizing bond of Harvard Time, which, in its infallible and infinite wisdom, decrees that classes start seven minutes after they’re actually slated to begin. This may not make any kind of sense, but it’s awesome. Harvard Time is a kind of communion that washes away our tardiness; unlike Gen Ed, it teaches us a very important lesson: our time is far more important than anyone else’s. And that goes doubly for tenured professors. 
Because while our teachers probably don’t have two classes in a row, we often do, and getting from Sever to Harvard Hall takes time, dammit! Especially when you have to print out a paper first, and also pick up coffee in order to stay awake, and also stop and talk to people you meet along the way. Those seven to 15 minutes are important! 
As your average overeager freshman, I quickly came to understand the ins and outs of Harvard Time. Arriving early to my Moral Reasoning section, I was forced to awkwardly schmooze with my TF, a pasty, terrified philosophy grad student. I realized that the logic of Harvard Time held true outside the academic sphere. No one cool goes to Annenberg before 6:00 p.m. Showing up on time to parties meant I had to help set up, plus everybody laughed at me, or at least they would have if they had been there.  
	Looking back, I realize fashionable lateness is the hallmark of a Harvard education, as my own studies attest. As I learned in a recent Harvard History lecture, the ninth president of Harvard College, Edward Holyoke (1689-1769), wrote Harvard Time into the bylaws of the Harvard Constitution after he noticed that plays and NBA games don’t begin until seven minutes after the hour. Tardiness was customary then: the professor went on to state that the American Revolution could have been avoided had the British Redcoats not committed a faux pas by showing up early to the Boston Tea Party. (I missed the first half of that lecture, but I’m pretty sure this is all true.) 
As a graduating senior preparing to move forward with my life, I’m grateful for the lessons of Harvard Time. After realizing the old boy network of Harvard employers probably sets its clocks several minutes slow, I’ve taken to showing up to job interviews tardy in order to reap the benefits of my Ivy League education. It’s been a successful tactic; while the hiring deadline has passed, I am currently waiting by the phone for offers that are sure to be fashionably late. 
Pundits of punctuality are most resistant to Harvard Time. They argue that classes should end early instead of starting late, that it encourages temporal laxity, that it makes us less polite. These are silly arguments. 
Because the vast majority of us set our internal chronometers to Harvard Time. This semester I have an oddly timed 5:30 p.m. section. After strolling in at 5:42, a student asked the TF whether the class had started at 5:30. The TF was shocked. “No, of course not,” she stammered slowly. “It starts at seven after. You’re fine.” She was dumbfounded that another option could possibly exist. I watched as the student, happy to have his belief in the universality of Harvard Time affirmed, placidly took a seat. He was twelve minutes late. He had missed nearly a quarter of the section. Absolutely no one cared. It was wonderful. 
In the uptight, restrictive atmosphere this institution works so hard to foster, the seven-minute rule is the lone, laid-back beacon of permissiveness. And it’s a rule I’ve enjoyed abusing. Thanks, Edward Holyoke. Or whoever. You’re the best.
	—Jake G. Cohen ’09 is a History and Literature concentrator in Leverett House. He handed this piece in several hours after deadline.

Benjamin G. Edelman ’02, assistant professor at Harvard Business School, is a leading authority on the Internet. His recent paper in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, “Red Light States: Who Buys Online Adult Entertainment?” presents evidence that traditionally conservative states actually purchase more online pornography than their blue counterparts. Last week, FM sat down with him to discuss business, politics, and 3D porn. 1. Fifteen Minutes: How did this study come about? BGE: I’ve always been interested in funding models for online media. The question is: Who will pay for online media? Who will pay for a premium Wall Street Journal online subscription? Who will pay for a TimesSelect? So far it seems hardly anyone will pay for those services, and we see newspapers really getting squeezed. Separately, adult Web sites manage to sell subscriptions –– even though, by some standards, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times might be more important or more useful. That was the impetus for this project –– the question of whether we could learn anything for the future of mainstream media by looking at the present of adult media.   2. FM: What about the porn industry is interesting to an economist?BGE: This is an industry that consistently manages to adapt innovations before just about any other sector. If you go back to cavemen, these folks were drawing adult materials on the walls of their caves about as early as they were drawing anything else. And so too for early terracotta, early photographs, early film, early recorded home video, DVD.  You name it, this industry has it first. So if you want to think about the future of technology, this is a natural place to begin.  3. FM: Okay, so, how did you collect your data?BGE: They gave me the zip codes on their subscriber list. I asked them for the list, and they sent it over. That was that. The data collection was surprisingly straightforward. FM: And “they” was a…?BGE: A leading online adult entertainment provider whose name I am obliged not to report by reason of my agreement with the company. I don’t think anyone would question whether this is an adult Web site. You go there, and you see, it’s a very adult Web site.  4. FM: So what did you find?BGE: There are many interesting patterns in this data: patterns in consumption according to education, age, cities versus rural areas, places where people are more religious versus less religious. There are patterns along all those variables.   5. FM: What surprised you about your findings?BGE: Well, one basic fact that came out here is that online adult entertainment seems to be of interest everywhere. Now you can talk about where it’s of greater interest and where it’s of lesser interest.  But if you compare the extent to which the United States varies by adult entertainment consumption, it seems to vary much less than, say, the amount by which the United States varies in snowfall or owning pickup trucks.   6. FM: What have the reactions been like from your colleagues? Your parents?BGE: My colleagues study a mix of subjects. We have people who study subjects that are absolutely sensitive...people who study fraud, people who study crime. My colleague Al Roth studies kidney transfers, including even the general possibility of selling kidneys. So no topic is off limits, and my colleagues have been supportive. Meanwhile, my parents are civil libertarians at heart. They support me in all things, and I’m greatly appreciative of that.  7. FM: You mentioned that you worked by zip code. How were the numbers for 02138? Did we beat Yale?BGE: [Laughs.] This is just going to take a second. It’s well worth doing. [Long pause as he crunches numbers.] I’d say the driving factor here if we compare 02138 to 06511 is that they’ve got 50% more people and only two more porn subscriptions. So I’d have to say Harvard folks are subscribing more. 8. FM: In your results, you rank states based on adult online subscriptions. When you account for different variables, the states all shuffle around, but Utah is very comfortably at the top of every list. What is Utah’s deal? BGE: One important difference is that if you live in Utah and want to buy your adult entertainment at a retail location, you’re going to have significant difficulty doing so. So when we look at high online purchases in Utah, we shouldn’t necessarily conclude that that means that there’s more adult entertainment of all sorts consumed in Utah. It might just mean that there’s more online adult entertainment in Utah, because there’s so much less offline.  9. FM: Your paper mentions that free porn is an “imperfect substitute” for subscription porn. Would you elaborate on what this means?BGE:  Imperfect substitute means it’s not quite as good, or at least it’s different. So what’s different about it? It tends to be less organized; a free-site user would have to spend more time searching for the desired material. Maybe a user of a free site wouldn’t be able to get the same variety of choices. On the flipside, a paid service has problems too, starting with the fact that a consumer has to pay for it, which costs money. Also, paying creates a billing trail, records being kept of the fact that a given customer paid for this material, and a person may prefer that there be no such records. So there are these special reasons why free services have extra benefits.  10. FM: Wouldn’t you think there would be an incentive in conservative places not to leave a trail because if you were to get caught you may be judged really harshly?BGE:  I’ve read a couple hypotheses from the bloggers and other folks who read this paper and responded online.  I convey these to you without meaning to endorse them. Maybe people in some states don’t know how to get free material as easily as people in other states. That’s one hypothesis folks have offered. Or, perhaps people in some states are experts at illicit methods of obtaining what they want for free. That might be something that is differentially known in some states more than in others. Then, it might be that there’s more of a respect for law and order and copyright in some states than in others...I think these ideas are ultimately just speculative, but they’re interesting ideas.  Maybe fodder for someone’s senior thesis!  11. FM: Eight out of your top ten porn states went for McCain in 2008. You show a significant increase in porn use in places where people agree with statements like “AIDS might be God’s punishment for immoral sexual behavior.” What do you think explains this?BGE: On a zip code level, most of the key results continue to hold. That tells me that this isn’t as likely to be a minority fighting against a majority that is suppressing their consumption of adult entertainment. It seems to imply that people in conservative places –– that the conservative people in conservative places –– are indeed the purchasers of this material.  12. FM: On that note, could you tell us why the phenomenon happens on Sundays, according to your study?BGE: Sure. People in religious places, where more people report going to religious services weekly –– they consume the same amount of adult entertainment [as in nonreligious areas]. That is, there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups. So they’re consuming the same amount on the whole, across the whole week. But on Sundays, they consume statistically significantly less. What does that mean? They’re taking their consumption, moving it out of Sundays and moving it to all the other days of the week.  13. FM: You mentioned that porn has always been involved in the adoption of entertainment technologies. What can the industry teach us?BGE:  I’m always struck by the industry’s repeated willingness to jump in with both feet on whatever new technology comes along: “Online video conferencing? Great, we’ll try it.” “High-definition video? Well, DVDs don’t seem half bad, but, okay, we’ll try that too.” Whatever it is, they’re willing to go along with it. I’m not sure you’d say the same thing about the mainstream content businesses in the United States. Now, they have significant challenges in adopting new technologies. They have long-term contracts. They have many parties, all of whom need to agree to move to the new technology. But maybe that’s part of the problem. They’re not set up to be as agile, whereas in the adult entertainment business, companies tend to be small, very efficient, and quite agile. They can move to the next thing as soon as the opportunity presents itself.  14. FM: There’s a striking anomaly here, though. Why don’t we have 3D porn?BGE: Not every new technology will be a winner. And to be sure, the adult entertainment business adopts plenty of technologies that don’t turn out to gain widespread appeal. So on 3D, with the polarized glasses, I wouldn’t be surprised if some of that actually does take off in due course. To date, the technologies have always seemed a little bit goofy to me. You have to wear some strange set of glasses and the pictures are harder to see. It gives you a headache after a while. It’s not the huge winner that it might be someday when the technology moves that much further. 15. FM: You’ve praised the innovation and spectacular growth of the porn industry. Meanwhile, Harvard students across campus are having trouble getting I-Banking jobs. Will the Northwest Valley be the new Wall Street?BGE: [Laughs.] Times are tough, but my general advice remains the same: creative, innovative entrepreneurship. Start a business, run a company, build a better mousetrap. That’s where the future lies.

At last night’s Cambridge City Council meeting dozens of residents voiced their opposition to a zoning change that would allow a more than 100-foot tall biotechnology lab building to be constructed within 50 feet of residential properties in East Cambridge.
Residents protested the possible loss of sunlight and an increase in industrial noise that may result if Beal Companies, LLP, a Boston-based real estate firm, is permitted to move forward with the project.
Several residents drew parallels between the current petition and the zoning variance—a one-time exception to zoning laws—granted last month to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc, a developer that plans to build biotechnology labs in East Cambridge.
Local attorney Heather M. Hoffman accused the council of conceding to industry pressure, rendering comprehensive zoning plans powerless.
“Imagine having a building the size of Holyoke Center in your back yard,” said resident Janice St. Clair.
Currently, commercial buildings in the area—located near the Kendall Square T stop—may not exceed 45 feet tall and must be at least 100 feet from residential property lines.
The current zoning rules, implemented in 2001, include a statement that the stringent regulations are intended “to provide an incentive for residential development within the designated [district].”
“The Beal Companies have not been working for the residents, they have been working the residents,” Cambridge resident Anthony J. Keeber said at the meeting. Keeber was one of 27 residents who submitted statements in opposition to the zoning change.
The zone is currently classified as a transition area between the industrial zone in Kendall Square and the densely populated Wellington Harrington neighborhood. According to resident Isabel Caseres, the neighborhood has the lowest percentage of people with a high school education anywhere in the city, and the second highest population density.
Lino R. Becerra, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard who lives in the affected neighborhood, presented the council with a study of the shadows that would potentially be cast by the proposed building, which he said would make neighboring homes 3 degrees colder.
Tonio Buonassisi, an MIT professor who runs an interdisciplinary photovoltaic lab, said that he had recently spent $18,000 to install solar panels on his home, which he said would be rendered useless by shadows if the proposed zoning change is passed and the is building constructed.
Sean D. Hope, and attorney who has done outreach for Beal Companies for the past 8 months, emphasized to the assembly that the current petition was only before the council as a preliminary step and said he would continue to attend meetings with residential groups.
But the Council is required by Massachusetts law to pass the measure along to the Cambridge Planning Board—one of several steps that stand in the way of the Council’s final vote on the proposed amendment.
Residents vowed to continue opposition to the proposed change as the process continues.

Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith expressed his support for the Dowling Committee’s recommendations to simplify the structure of student-faculty committees in a letter sent to Neuroscience Professor John E. Dowling ’57, who served as the chair of the Committee to Review the Undergraduate Council.Smith stated that he and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds agreed with the basic recommendations of the committee but still had reservations about some of the conclusions drawn by the report.“Dean Hammonds and I agree whole-heartedly with the recommendation to simplify the committee structure and to put in place chairs who are in the position to make decisions,” Smith wrote. “I would like to clarify, however, that the role of committees is to provide recommendations to the deans, who then make decisions with the benefit of those recommendations. It is important that we not conflate the two activities, even if the dean empowered to act is participating in the work of the issue.”While many believed that the Dowling Report left more issues open than resolved, its recommendation that student-faculty committees be organized in a hierarchical fashion and given decision-making power was widely considered to be its most ground-breaking conclusion.In the letter, Smith disagreed with the committee’s recommendation to have equal numbers of students and faculty members on every committee. Instead, Smith emphasized that this recommendation may only be appropriate in some cases.The Dowling Report also recommended that the re-organization of the student-faculty committees be accompanied by a restructuring of the UC’s student advocacy committee structure.UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said she looks forward to meeting with Smith.“I want to talk about implementation which wasn’t addressed in the letter,” Flores said.

One in every five women who has an abortion is an undergraduate living on a college campus and one out of every two women who has an abortion is college-age, the president of “Feminists for Life” reported in a speech at Harvard Law School last night.Serrin M. Foster—who became the president of the anti-abortion organization in 1994—attributed the high number of abortions in college to the lack of options that many undergraduates have, and added that most co-eds must unfairly choose between school and raising their child.“I’m here to free women from abortion,” Foster said to a packed audience in Pound Hall. “Abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women.”She argued that feminism is the belief that all people are equal, and that this “without exception” includes “the unborn.”“If you believe that all people are equal,” Foster said, “all choices are not.”She cited the mothers of American feminism, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, as the pioneers of the pro-life movement and as evidence that feminism and a pro-life stance are compatible. According to Foster, Stanton called abortion “infanticide, feticide, and murder.”Foster said in her speech that the pro-choice movement originated in the 1970s with two men who were the founders of NARAL Pro-Choice America, not from Betty N. Friedan and Gloria N. Steinem, the founders  of the National Organization for Women. She argued that Bernard Nathanson and Larry Lader convinced Friedan and Steinmen to take up their pro-choice cause. Jeremiah D. Braunlin—who recently graduated from the Harvard Extension School—said he thought that Foster’s definition of the word “feminist” was interesting.“When I think of the word ‘feminist’ I think of Foucault, J.S. Mill, or Katherine McKinnon, not necessarily a pro-life organization, but I think it was a politically cunning move to use that word because it drew together people who would not necessarily agree with them,” he said.Karen A. Narefsky ’10, the co-president of Harvard Students for Choice, disagreed and said that Foster’s use of the word “feminist” was inappropriate.When asked about the speech, she called the organization’s opinions “anti-woman” and “anti-feminist”.Narefsky attended an event in the fall with a “Feminists for Life speaker” and said that she was dismayed by the comments.  “I felt that women were talked about as though they were children or objects and not as though they were active, thinking adults,” she said.—Staff writer Sofia E.

A heated debate spilled over onto the UC general e-mail list just hours after Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10 cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of a contentious legislation to allocate $200 towards publicity for a for-profit student business, “Get Out of Cambridge.” 
Former UC Vice President Randall S. Sarafa ’09, who first posted to the open-list about the issue, said in an interview that he did not believe there was a precedent for legislation like “Get Out of Cambridge.”
“There has, in the past five years, been no instance in which the UC has given money to a for-profit organization except when the UC has required their services rendered,” Sarafa wrote in an e-mail sent to the list at 2:23 a.m.
At yesterday’s general meeting the UC voted unanimously to endorse and publicize getoutofcambridge.com, a Web site designed to help students coordinate cheap transportation from Harvard.
But two clauses that were separated from bill generated considerable controversy at the meeting. They allocate $200 towards publicity efforts to promote the Web site and to entitle the UC to 15 percent of the profits earned during the remainder of the term of the current administration.
Dunster House Co-representative and finance committee member Mohindra Rupram ’10 said that the $200 sum amounted to only about three cents per student and the controversy was largely unwarranted.
“I don’t quite understand why it’s become such a hot button issue since the amount funded was small relative to other things that we’ve funded,” Rupram said in an interview yesterday.
The unanimous vote in favor of the legislation to endorse and publicize the enterprise is in keeping with a similar arrangement that the council had with CrimsonReading.org, a site devoted to helping undergraduates find cheaper, used textbooks. Although, when Crimson Reading was created in 2006 it was a non-profit site and the site’s profits were donated to a charity in Zambia.
“The UC can provide free publicity support,” said UC Secretary Douglas R. Lloyd ’09. “It’s not the amount of money that’s being spent, it’s the precedent that’s being set.”
The legislation could potentially produce income for the UC—though some members were skeptical that the business would be profitable.
Sarafa also said the resolution could mean the UC would have to pay taxes on the profits it might earn.
So far, nearly a hundred people have registered on the site, which depends on a large number of student participants for its taxi cab matching service to be effective. The site is expected to officially launch in the next few days, according to Zachary Z. Smith, co-founder of Get Out of Cambridge. 
Publicity for the site, which the UC is funding, will cover some of the costs of postering, door dropping and Facebook ads.
Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09 voted against the legislation and wrote in an e-mail to the open-list that she worried that some non-UC members’ voices were not being heard.
“We have these grand plans for the student relations committee but if we are not taking the time to digest the responses of our constituents and reflect on them in a meaningful way, then I think its all for nothing,” she wrote.
But representatives who voted for the passage of the legislation emphasized the advantages students would receive from the travel site.
“The UC is partnering with the students behind ‘Get Out of Cambridge’ because it will benefit students,” said Daniel V. Kroop ’10, co-chair of the Student Relations Committee. “It’s a fully functional Web site that can provide student services better than the UC could.”

Following Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s recent letter criticizing Harvard’s decision to slow down construction of the Allston Science Complex, more local politicians are stepping forward to voice similar disapproval.
In a letter addressed to University President Drew G. Faust last week, Senator Anthony D. Galluccio expressed his opposition to the construction slowdown, citing the move’s negative impact on the vitality of the neighborhood.
“Despite current economic challenges, Harvard must make the completion of the Science Complex its top priority,” Galluccio wrote. “It is my hope that Harvard, as a world leader, will see the completion of this project both as a stimulus to the local economy and a statement about our priorities as a society.”
Though other politicians did not write formal public letters, many voiced similar concerns about the implications of a construction slowdown.
City Councillor Sam Seidel said that he was concerned that the decision to slow expansion would further weaken the economy, since the construction project would have employed many local engineers and construction crews.
“My personal preference is that Harvard moves forward with this work,” Seidel said.
In a letter last month to the Harvard community, Faust announced that the construction of the $1 billion science complex would be slowed following bleak projections for the University’s endowment that could plummet as much as 30% in the year ending on June 30, 2009.
University officials had heralded the complex as the cornerstone of the University’s Allston expansion. The structure was designed to become a hub of interdisciplinary science, and the new home of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. 
In addition to urging Harvard to stick to its original timeline for Allston construction, Galluccio also stressed his desire for greater financial transparency on the part of the University.
“Allston residents find it difficult to believe that [although] Harvard seemingly had unlimited amounts of money to purchase property, it doesn’t have enough to complete the project,” he said in an interview. “It doesn’t make sense.” 
Late last month, residents’ concerns about the construction slowdown erupted into active resistance as neighborhood groups decorated Harvard-owned properties with banners protesting the University’s presence. Objections that residents have raised include the unattractiveness of vacant Harvard-owned real estate and the ever-diminishing prospects for a revitalized neighborhood.
“Galluccio hit the nail on the head,” said Tim McHale, Allston resident and president of the Allston Brighton Community Planning Initiative, adding that the community and local politicians have been speaking with one voice. “Just because circumstances have changed on Harvard’s side does not mean that they can just walk away.”
State Representative Alice K. Wolf, who acknowledged Harvard’s financial difficulties, said that the University’s obligations to Allston are still binding despite the economic climate, and that the slowdown would “undermine the community’s support and trust.”
“Given how large the institution is and how many people and neighborhoods it affects, Harvard needs to make decisions that are in keeping with the needs of community, not just the University,” Wolf said. 
In response to Senator Galluccio’s letter, Harvard officials emphasized the need for ongoing dialogue and engagement between the different sides.  
“We understand the issues that Senator Gallucio raised, and we look forward to working with the senator and the entire local elected delegation to address those concerns,” said Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, Director of Community Relations for Boston.

Harvard students looking to rent party space from the Cambridge Center for Adult Education will face intensified scrutiny from the city’s License Commission following the recent surge in large party requests from student groups at the College. 
An upswing in requests for party space from Harvard students drew suspicion from the Commission about whether the Center was properly vetting party proposals for safety and propriety, said Elizabeth Lint, the executive director of the Cambridge License Commission. 
The Commission, which must approve a license for any group looking to hold a Cambridge event that charges admission and serves alcohol, will be reevaluating the Center’s viability as a party space for an unspecified amount of time. Licensing officials are intent ensuring that future party proposals are in line with fire-safety, alcohol, and curfew regulations. 
“What triggered the reevaluation in my mind was one group that requested a license for a party with over 200 people until three in the morning,” said Lint, adding that the Center’s rental space has only a 153-person capacity. 
“It’s not really the type of facility that would be hosting parties,” Lint said. 
Lint also said that the License Commission had recently appeared to be receiving unregulated party applications. 
“We’re used to requests for Harvard parties coming in to us through the Dean’s office, but now we’re starting to get applications and she doesn’t know anything about them,” Lint said.
Groups such as the Chinese Students Association and the Association of Black Harvard Women have recently held parties at the Brattle Street space.
Sean Li ’09, co-president of the Chinese Students Association, said that his group had plenty of options for spaces to host events if the Adult Education Center were to stop renting out their rooms.
“To be honest, the CSA has never used the Center’s space for parties before this year, and we could always just use spaces we previously used,” Li said. “I wouldn’t say it would have a devastating impact on our capacity to hold events or anything.”
Lint had no definitive answer when asked whether the non-profit organization would be allowed to continue renting out their space as they work with the Commission to tighten restrictions on events hosted there.
“They haven’t shown us that they are fire-code compliant, so I’m not willing to say one way or the other,” Lint said.
Cambridge Center for Adult Education’s executive director Jim Smith said that the Center has not violated any city ordinances. He also stressed the responsibility of individual event organizers to adhere to city policies on alcohol and curfew.
“If a Harvard group comes to us for a space, they need to go to the License Commission,” Smith said. “We don’t run these functions, so it’s also the responsibility of the renting group to obtain the license to restrict and regulate their parties.”
According to Smith, the Center also rents out its space for meetings and other non-alcoholic gatherings.
“There haven’t been any problems in the past with over-capacity, and we haven’t really had big problems with crowd control,” Smith said. “But the city is just being careful.”

Harvard’s Vice President for Administration Sally H. Zeckhauser—whose tenure has spanned four University presidencies—announced her intention yesterday to step down from her position at the end of the academic year.
Over the course of two decades, Zeckhauser guided eight administrative departments that provide basic services ranging from real estate management to facilities and maintenance operations.
University President Drew G. Faust lauded Zeckhauser’s “quiet” leadership in managing a diverse portfolio of behind-the-scenes operations.
“She has been not only a valued colleague but a good friend, and I know she will remain very much a part of the Harvard family even after she steps down at the end of June,” Faust wrote in a letter to the community yesterday.
University officials plan to discuss the organizational structure with members of her administrative departments before coming to a decision about the future of the position, said University spokesman John D. Longbrake.
Longbrake declined to comment on whether these discussions will result in a replacement for Zeckhauser.
During her tenure, the soft-spoken leader has seen her purview expand to include a large-scale renovation of Memorial Hall and the freshman dorms in addition to founding Harvard’s Bridge to Learning and Literacy Program, which helps University employees improve their English language skills.
Zeckhauser’s departure comes as the University finds itself in dire financial straits, potentially posing a challenge to both daily operations and long-term projects, including the much awaited $1 billion renovation of the 12 undergraduate Houses.
Though College administrators have said that discussions on the proposed renovations have not been placed on hold as a result of the economic climate, Zeckhauser said the time frame for these ambitious plans is uncertain.
Additionally, Zeckhauser cited the continued challenge of meeting financial constraints without sacrificing the quality of services offered.
“We need to think about how we can do things differently but at the same level or better,” Zeckhauser said.
In anticipation of a 30 percent drop in endowment value, University administrators are already scaling back on operating expenses and planning budget cuts for the next fiscal year.
Before assuming her current position, Zeckhauser, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College, served in several administrative roles at the University since receiving a Master’s degree from what is now the Harvard Kennedy School.
After retiring, Zeckhauser said she plans to pursue personal interests and hobbies, including volunteering at a public service program in the fair-weathered South and spending time with her grandchildren.
Zeckhauser will continue to chair Bryn Mawr’s board of trustees.

Harvard researchers have successfully constructed an essential cellular component responsible for synthesizing proteins—a discovery that marks a major stride towards creating artificial life, according to the lead investigator behind the project.  
The first man-made ribosome was announced to an assembly of Harvard alumni Saturday afternoon in a symposium titled “The Future of Life,” by George M. Church, the lead investigator of the project and a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.
“[The ribosome is] the catalytic core of the cell,” said Michael C. Jewett, a research fellow who worked with Church. “The advantage of building them [in a lab] is that you can manipulate the system directly. It’s like opening the hood of a car and having direct access to the machination.”
Although their work is “a milestone...towards artificial life,” according to Jewett, both he and Church emphasized that they have not yet created any synthetic life, nor is that their main goal.
Instead, the research team’s aim is to “make useful products,” said Church.
The research behind the ribosome, funded by the National Institute of Health, could give scientists “unprecedented power to evolve ribosomes to produce unique proteins for compelling applications,” Jewett said. Crucial vaccines and pharmaceuticals could evolve from the discovery.
“The idea of being able to make new polymers, maybe one day making a mirror-image cell, which is resistant to almost all viruses and enzymes, would be of industrial and philosophical significance,” Church said.
Church, whose announcement Saturday came at an event sponsored by the Harvard Origin of Life Initiative, also said that studying ribosomes—one of the few cell components common to almost all life—can be relevant to our understanding of the first life on Earth.
“Ribosomes...allow us to connect the dots between the origins of life and the modern organism,” Church said. “Synthetic ribosomes will hopefully allow us to do those things better, or do things that haven’t been able to do before."
The next step, researchers said, is to create a ribosome that will be completely synthetic, without the use of bacterial RNA and other protein additives.  
Labs have created functional models of ribosomes in the past, Jewett said, but never in a way that so closely mimicked life itself.
“We’ve shown for the first time that we can actually carry out ribosomal synthesis, assembly, and protein synthesis in one compartment” said Jewett.
Jack W. Szostak, a genetics researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School professor who has been investigating the origins of life, acknowledged yesterday the significance of Church’s discovery.
“It’s always been a very difficult thing to do,” Szostak said. “It opens up more interesting experiences where you make something useful. It’s a step in a long pathway [to creating artificial life].”

A Yale student business peddling school-specific footwear on the University’s New Haven campus is aiming to bring the same service to other colleges, including Harvard, one of the operation’s founders said yesterday.     Yale senior Timothy Kau and his partner, junior Christopher Chau, founded the startup footwear company known as Campus Kings which is already marketing its first two lines of sneakers.“We wanted to introduce a shoe that someone who went to Yale would immediately be able to recognize and relate to,” said Chau. “We have made it our mission to provide a fresh aspect to college apparel.”Campus Kings’ two product lines—dubbed “Eli” and “Bulldog”—will each target different demographics, offering both an athletic sneaker and a more casual, canvas shoe.Both lines, Chau said, are intended to emphasize school spirit—right down to the image of Yale’s famous Harkness Tower printed on the shoe’s heels.“We are not just going to change the colors or layout of already existent Yale apparel,” said Chau. “Our goal is to contribute to the overall pride of the school community.”Chau’s plans to expand his operation to other universities might be met favorably even by Yale’s gridiron enemies, according to Rick Calixto, Harvard’s director of trademark operations. “We always encourage entrepreneurial students to pursue their ideas, and we would certainly be in support of a Harvard sneaker line so long as it fell within accepted traditional parameters,” Calixto said.For now, the idea behind Campus Kings has already drawn some approval on Yale’s New Haven campus. “Shoes depicting the Yale logo could most likely be a good and profitable item,” said Ken Stewart, a Yale Bookstore employee, when asked about the venture yesterday.  Yale senior Clayton Crooks emphasized that the shoes, which Campus Kings has said will sell for anywhere between $40 and $70, are affordable. Crooks said he believed that designer shoes without school logos tended to sell for more.  “Given all of the college and graduate school alumni harboring intense Yale pride, I think that these sneakers will do very well,” Crooks added.Chau said he intended to push his venture ahead even in what has lately been a bleak consumer climate. “I don’t care if we do anything more than break even,” he said. “So long as college students are wearing our shoes and enjoying the increased sense of school spirit and pride.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Cambridge weather gods appear to be wavering in their decision to bestow spring upon us, the Harvard sailing team showed over the weekend that it is more than ready for the blue skies and, more importantly, the fair waters of the year’s second season. Competing in its first event since mid-November, the Crimson took advantage of an unseasonably pleasant weekend here in Cambridge to claim second place at the Sharpe Trophy Team Race on the Charles River.“The weather was great” sophomore Grace Charles said. “It was great to get back out there again this weekend. It was a good opportunity for a learning experience.”“We were very pleased with our performance this weekend in a pretty competitive tune-up regatta” sophomore Teddy Himler said. Harvard displayed its depth over the two-day regatta as nine different Crimson sailors contributed to the squad’s 18-5 record, which fell just one win behind the event’s champion, Roger Williams University.“Roger Williams is going to be really good this year and someone we will have to watch out for all season long,” Charles said.“We held our own against Roger Williams with a 3-2 record against them,” Himler added.Harvard appeared to have no trouble shaking off the rust in its first action in about four months, as the Crimson ended the first of two full round robins among the eight competing teams on day one of the regatta with a 6-1 record. This quick start propelled Harvard into the gold round robin on day two, where, along with the Hawks from Roger Williams, the two schools easily showed themselves to be the class of the field. Boston College finished the gold round robin with an 11-12 record, while Tufts took fourth overall with a 10-13 record. Connecticut College finished the silver round robin at 12-11 to claim fifth overall, with MIT (11-12), Yale (7-16), and Brown (4-19) claiming the sixth, seventh, and eighth positions, respectively.“Many of the teams did not have all of their members compete here this weekend,” Charles said. “So we should have better competition throughout the rest of the year.”Harvard’s counterparts from Chestnut Hill, the Golden Eagles from Boston College, should remain a force this year after being one of the best sailing squads in the country last year.“Boston College should be really good again this year,” she added.Himler compared the relationship to one of David vs. Goliath, yet remained optimistic. “BC has a great squad, but I believe we will continue to improve the rest of this season and will perform well.”Newly-elected captain sophomore Alan Palmer skippered over the weekend, where he was teamed up with senior Lauren Brants as crew. Senior Jon Garrity, sophomore John Stokes, and Himler also served as Crimson skippers. Juniors Michelle Konstadt and Winston Yan, sophomore Quincy Bock, and Charles all competed as crews.While no freshmen competed this weekend, Harvard anticipates some rookies should be able to contribute this season.“Brendan Kopp was a great junior sailor and is really committed to learning how to sail on the collegiate level,” Himler said. “He will be integrated into the team over the next couple of weeks and should make some great contributions.”The Crimson will compete in its first intersectional regattas of the spring next weekend, with the St. Mary’s Team Race Intersectional taking place in St. Mary’s City, Maryland and the Navy Women’s Intersectional taking place in Annapolis, Maryland.“I believe we have very good prospects for the rest of the year,” Himler said. “We have a pretty young team but our sophomore and freshmen are really dedicated to learning and improving the rest of this season.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

With redemption comes a crown.The Harvard women’s basketball (19-8, 11-2 Ivy) will seek to avenge an early season loss tonight in Hanover, N.H., as it plays division rival and current league-leader Dartmouth (17-10, 12-1 Ivy).If the Crimson wins, it will share its 12th division title with the Big Green, forcing a decisive game later this week between the two teams to determine who will receive the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.The last time the two teams met, Harvard could not pull off a comeback, getting to within three points in the final 25 seconds, only to eventual fall 59-55. Freshman Brogan Berry led the Crimson with a career-high 20 points, but it was not enough to overcome Dartmouth’s stifling defense that kept high-scoring sophomore Emma Markley in check. The Big Green is the leading defensive presence in the league, keeping opponents to a mere 46.8 points per game. “I think Dartmouth is a really well coached team,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They are an athletic team, and their defensive statistics are better than ours. We are not known for defense, we are known for offense. Of late we are playing good defense, so hopefully we can put both of those ends of the court together.”Harvard has been dominant all season with its run-and-gun offensive system. The Crimson is an offensive powerhouse, averaging 69.5 points per game. However, Harvard will need a solid performance all around to keep Dartmouth at bay.“I think it will come down to playing strong defense, boxing out, all those simple little things we need to do,” Berry said. “We just need to come out with more energy than they do. We’ve had a couple slow starts this year, so [we need to] come out strong, and keep our intensity up.”Saturday night’s game against Yale highlighted the Crimson’s scoring ability. Harvard bulldozed the Bulldogs in a crushing 91-57 win, which included a 34-point contribution from co-captain Emily Tay.Dartmouth is also going into tonight’s tense encounter hot after the Big Green easily took care of Brown with a dominant 64-43 win. Sophomore Brittney Smith led Dartmouth with a 20-point, 11-rebound performance, and will be one player the Crimson will need to stop. The last time the two teams met, Smith put on a clinic with 18 points and 11 rebounds. She will be seeking to secure Dartmouth its 17th division title and a tournament berth. Harvard seems to have history on its side, but recent encounters have proven that the Crimson will not have it easy. Harvard leads the series 35-29, though it has only won one game in the last four meetings. Two of the last three at Leede Arena, however, have gone in the Crimson’s favor. Harvard is undefeated on the road against Ivy League opponents this year, and it hopes to keep that streak going in order to extend its season. “We still have a lot of work ahead of us,” co-captain Niki Finelli said Saturday night. “Dartmouth is a very dangerous team and we have to respect them completely. But I think right now we just have to carry this momentum that we have, and really play Harvard basketball and just get that good feel back and that flow back and good things will happen for us.”If the Crimson forces a playoff game, it will be the second consecutive year that the team will have competed in a league playoff. Harvard is also a win away from their ninth 20-win season and the second league title three-peat in school history.It’s now or never for the Crimson, and the pressures of a championship will determine just how great this season can be for Tay and her team.“We are really excited to play them, and we’re just happy we have the chance to get a piece of the championship,” Tay said.

Not many athletes score 1,246 points in their career. Not many athletes can rack up 34 points in one game. Not many athletes can boast of having won back-to-back Ivy League Player of the Weeks. And not many athletes get the opportunity to receive a standing ovation from a crowd.
Emily Tay is an exception. 
During Senior Night at Lavietes Pavilion Saturday night, co-captain Tay proved once again why she is a major factor for the Harvard women’s basketball team (19-8, 11-2 Ivy). In a 91-57 crushing of Ivy-rival Yale, Tay scored a career-high 34 points to finish off her last home game for the Crimson.
The win came only a day after Tay scored 14 points and notched eight assists in a 81-57 victory over Brown. The two games allowed the Crimson to remain in second in the Ivy League standings, and ensured the team of a chance to play for a share of the title.
But Saturday night was truly Tay’s night. 
“This was the Emily Tay that we’ve been trying four years to get,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “When we lost Nikki—a huge scorer for us—Etay knew she had to step it up.”
Her 20 points at halftime illustrated just how well Tay played. As the first period ran out, she alone had scored three more points than the entire Yale team could manage. 
In the opening of the game, Tay nailed the first basket for Harvard, on a reverse layup.
And the shots kept on coming. 
Tay followed it up by scoring 10 of the team’s first 12 points, as Harvard jumped out to a very comfortable 12-0 lead.


Tay, who moved into eighth all-time on the Harvard scoring list, was one of three Harvard players to score in double figures. 
Besides being perfect from the free-throw line and from outside the perimeter, Tay also shot 15-for-19 from the field. In her 33 minutes of play, Tay also grabbed five rebounds and two assists.
But the 5’8” Tay was not just great on offense, but also on defense. 
“Etay’s defense tonight was outstanding,” Delaney-Smith said. “She rebounded really well… she still got to do her crowd-pleasing passes, so we got the best of both worlds. She was positively immense tonight.”
The crowd knew it too. When Delaney-Smith pulled Tay out with a little over four minutes left in the game, a standing ovation erupted from the Harvard fan side, startling the modest Tay.
“I was not anticipating that,” she said. “I’m just pretty happy the team played well. Everyone played, and everyone played their hearts out. This is awesome.”
She may be modest, but Tay is nothing short of a beast when on the court. This season, she has won or tied for the most number of shots per game in eight match-ups. Starting 26 of the season’s 27 games, Tay also grabbed 81 rebounds this season and scored 346 points, second only to sophomore Emma Markley on the team. 
It is these extraordinary feats and her positive attitude that, according to her teammates, make Tay such a key part of the squad. 
 “The seniors do a tremendous job of leading this team,” said freshman point guard Brogan Berry. “As a freshman, I really look up to Etay a lot. She has been a great leader, especially to me. I just look to follow her lead.”
Tay’s leadership does not go unnoticed. Yesterday, Tay became—for the third time this season—the Ivy League Basketball Player of the Week for her outstanding weekend performance in which she shot a combined 71 percent from the field. 
“She’s just phenomenal,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “It’s just a privilege for me to be a teammate of hers and a co-captain with her.”

HANOVER, N.H.—Two were sweet, but three would have been that much sweeter.
The Harvard women’s basketball team (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) was denied a share of its third straight Ivy League title last night at Leede Arena in Hanover, N.H., falling to 2009 champion Dartmouth (18-10, 12-1), 64-51.
“They’re a championship team, and we didn’t play like one tonight,” senior forward Katie Rollins said.
The Big Green, having clinched at least a share of the Ancient Eight crown after a win over Brown last Saturday, was in control throughout the contest. The story of the game was the Dartmouth frontcourt, for which the Crimson was prepared after a physical loss in January, but for which it ultimately had no answer the second time around. The team numbers told the story: the Big Green finished with 51 rebounds, including 20 on the offensive glass, to Harvard’s 27. 
Dartmouth was led down low by sophomore Brittney Smith, who converted seemingly every chance she had in the paint and had Harvard’s forwards in foul trouble early and throughout. Smith finished with 19 points, nine rebounds, and two blocks in a dominant low-post effort. Co-captain Koren Schram chipped in 18 points.
“Our scouting report was to shut down [Smith] and [Schram],” Rollins said. “If you can’t execute your scout, you can’t really expect to win the game.”
The Big Green entered the game as the defensive specialist, and it certainly lived up to its billing in disrupting the Crimson’s offensive scheme from start to finish. Harvard expected to counter Smith with some star power of its own, but co-captain Emily Tay, who poured in a career-high 34 points last Saturday against Yale, was held to just seven points on 3-of-8 shooting and didn’t score her first basket until 12 minutes remained in the contest.
The breakneck pace of last night’s game would tend to favor Harvard’s running offense, but instead it led to turnovers and quick, one-and-done possessions.
“[Tay] played maybe her worst game of the year,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She took some bad shots, made some bad decisions, and maybe her teammates saw panic in her.”
Sophomore Emma Markley, one of the Crimson’s most consistent scorers on the season, struggled to double digits with 11 points on 5-for-14 shooting. Freshman point guard Brogan Berry led the team with 12 points, but neither she nor Tay was in typical playmaking form against the Big Green’s stingy defense.
Harvard stayed within striking distance until the final few minutes of the game, but was never able to pull closer than nine points down the stretch. Berry’s three-point play with 9:54 left cut the deficit to seven and might have ignited a run, but Dartmouth’s Darcy Rose quickly responded with one of the Big Green’s many layups on the other end, and Schram followed with a three a minute later to push the lead to 12.
Harvard’s usually high-powered attack didn’t expect to meet its match in Dartmouth, but while the Crimson struggled for shots and rarely converted them, the Big Green put three players in double figures and shot 41 percent for the game. The difference? From start to finish, rebounding.
“The rebounding is the one single factor we have control of, but we’re just not a good rebounding team,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Dartmouth] had 20 offensive rebounds in one game? We cannot win that game.” 
After being outrebounded by a 33-13 margin in the first half, the Crimson was lucky to be down only seven as it headed into the locker room for halftime. But it knew it would need an offensive spark and stronger defense down low, and it didn’t get either one.  Berry hit a jumper right out of the gate, but a quick layup from Smith and a three from Schram pushed the lead back to 10 and nearly blew the roof off Leede Arena.
Schram, a fixture in the Big Green backcourt since her sophomore season, had a memorable night in her last game in Hanover. With a late-game three that brought the Dartmouth faithful to its feet, the senior passed the 1,000-point mark for her career in Hanover. 
While the Big Green awaits its placement in the NCAA Tournament with its automatic bid as conference winners, Harvard has accepted an invitation to play in the Women’s National Invitational Tournament. The location and opponent of its first-round matchup will be announced next Monday night, and the game will take place either March 18, 19 or 20.
The Crimson will be grateful for another chance to play its last game of the season, but this one will leave a sour taste in its mouth long after the 2009 campaign is officially over.
“I’d love to make my kids feel better,” Delaney-Smith said, “but unfortunately, in the biggest game of the season, we played our worst.”

Sarah Vaillancourt, a tri-captain of the Harvard women’s hockey team, was named a top-three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award yesterday. The Kazmaier Award is given annually to the top player in collegiate women’s hockey.
Vaillancourt, who won the award in 2008, is looking to become the first two-time winner since Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03. 
The other two finalists are Mercyhurst forward Meghan Agosta and Wisconsin goaltender Jessie Vetter. 
Vaillancourt led the Crimson in scoring for the second consecutive season, accumulating 52 points on 25 goals and 27 assists. She ranks fourth in the country in both points per game (1.93) and assists per game (1.00). 
Vaillancourt has already been honored as the Ivy League and ECAC Player of the Year this season. She looks to extend Harvard’s tradition of Kazmaier success—the award has gone to a Crimson player in six of the 11 years that it has been given out.Agosta is the first person in Kazmaier history to be named a top-three finalist three times. The junior  has led Mercyhurst to a No. 3 national ranking, and is first in the nation in points (2.59), goals (1.31), and assists (1.28) per game.
Vetter recorded 30 wins in net for top-ranked Wisconsin. The senior boasts an NCAA-record 37 career shutouts and 88 career wins. Vetter is second in the country in save percentage (.936) and goals-against average (1.33). 
The Kazmaier Award will be presented on March 21 in Boston in conjunction with the NCAA Frozen Four.

After two crucial victories against Rutgers-Newark and NJIT last weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team picked up where it left off, sweeping Endicott, 3-0 (30-25, 30-23, 30-24), last night at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Crimson (6-5, 2-1 EIVA Hay Division) showed no signs of a letdown, as it came out determined to overpower the visiting Gulls (19-8, 10-0 NECVA).  
“I’d like to think that we’ve turned the corner,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We played some really good ball over the weekend, and we continued with that for the most part tonight. The guys are playing hard, and I was really glad that the team didn’t let down after the weekend.”
It was clear that the Crimson was more offensively skilled and defensively disciplined than its opponent, but more striking was an emerging sense of confidence found in all of the players. 
“We know what to expect,” Baise said. “When we need points, we know how to get them, and where to go. In the first half of the season, we were still figuring that out. When it’s 28-all, the questions are where do we go, what is the set, what play do we run. I think that’s the biggest difference.”
Harvard started the match off firing on all cylinders, setting the tone on the first play of the game with a block by junior setter Gil Weintraub. With the set tied, 13-13, freshman sensation Matt Jones got comfortable on the outside by slamming down kill after kill, igniting a run that gave the team a 21-13 lead. 
“I think we have confidence right now, and that’s really important,” junior Soren Rosier said. “As a team, we’re really starting to come together. We’re a really cohesive group, everybody likes each other. When you come into a game with confidence, things work out.”
Harvard also tightened up on the defensive end, allowing only 14 kills for an Endicott team that hit .184 in the first set. Senior co-captain Brady Weissbourd dominated the undersized team with his 6’9 height, tallying six kills in the first set alone, including one that went untouched to wrap up the first set.  
The second set would bring more of the same. With the two teams knotted at 6-6, it appeared that the Endicott players were not ready to go down without a fight. But after a heroic save by Weintraub and two straight service aces by Weissbourd, the Crimson reestablished its offensive rhythm against the Gulls. With the team holding on to a tight 27-23 lead, back-to-back blocks by Weissbourd and Jones ended any hopes of an Endicott comeback.
While Harvard has struggled all season to put teams away in the elimination set, the Crimson had no trouble at all taking care of business in the third set last night. Though Harvard hit just .355 and committed seven service errors, its defense continued to disrupt Endicott’s offensive game plan, holding the Gulls to just seven kills and six errors for a team attack of .042. 
“We actually tried out a few different rotations today, mixed and matched players,” Rosier said. “There wasn’t anything in particular that they were doing that we were trying to key in on. This was one of those games where we were playing pretty well in the game, so our coach wanted us to work on the small things.”
As a result, Weissbourd put on an offensive clinic, totaling 20 kills, three service aces and nine digs. The reigning Hay Division Player of the Week logged his fifth 20-plus kill game in a row, an impressive feat in itself. At the same time, Weissbourd demonstrated his role as a leader, rallying the team and calling the plays on the court.
“Brady’s our go-to guy on offense,” Baise said. “He makes it tough for the other team. With him, I know we can kill at any point. Whenever we’re down, we make sure we find where he is.”
Jones continued his strong freshman campaign with a solid night, racking up 12 kills. Though he had trouble at times serving the ball, Weissbourd made sure that the rookie did not get frustrated. 
“As freshmen, there’s still a lot of learning to go, and one of the things you learn in your college career is how not to make mistakes in those crucial moments, settle down, and fit into the team,” Baise said. “[Jones has] been great for us.”
The win against Endicott lifted the Crimson above the .500 mark for the season, but the team will now hit the road after playing five straight games at the MAC. Harvard has not won a game away from home all season, and will now face two solid teams in Princeton and league opponent East Stroudsburg. 
“Being here, we’re in our comfort zone, so we’re still yet to be tested,” Rosier said. “We’ve yet to win some really big road games, and that determines whether we go to the playoffs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—First Brittney Smith, then her sister Margaret, grabbed offensive rebounds on Dartmouth’s final possession of the game, keeping the ball with the Big Green as the team clinched the Ivy League title and a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
For the Harvard women’s basketball team, this was the story of the night as a whole. 
The Crimson was completely manhandled on the boards, getting outrebounded, 51-27, in the 13-point loss. Of the 51 Dartmouth rebounds, 20 came via the offensive glass, leading to 15 second-chance points.
Good rebounding has been a staple of the physical Big Green squad all year, and its athletic prowess helped to expose the Crimson’s deficiency in the area.
“We know they’re strong rebounders, so we knew we had to keep them off the boards,” senior forward Katie Rollins said. “They’re a great defensive team—number one statistically—so we had to find a way to put the ball in the basket. And we didn’t do either of those things.”
With Harvard leading the league in scoring, the game had been billed as a battle of offense versus defense.  As it turned out, Dartmouth was better on both ends of the floor.
The Big Green shot 41 percent from the field and had three players in double figures. 36 of the team’s 64 points came in the paint, as Dartmouth was able to outmuscle the Crimson down low. The Big Green was consistently able to use its athleticism to find holes in the Harvard zone, leading to a number of easy baskets.
The Crimson, on the other hand, was made to work for everything. The Big Green defense held the Crimson to just 51 points, 19 below its season average.  
Most impressive, though, was how Dartmouth was able to shut down Harvard’s two most dangerous weapons, sophomore Emma Markley and co-captain Emily Tay. The two lead the Crimson in scoring, averaging 14.1 and 12.8 points per game respectively. Markley and Tay’s success this season has been due, in large part, to their athleticism. 
The 6’3 Markley has the speed of a guard, controlling her body as if she were half her size. And Tay flashes her natural gifts on a regular basis—anyone who has made the trip across the river to Lavietes Pavilion will have seen her fly through the air and sneak in a reverse layup.
But last night, the two were almost non-factors. Markley managed to finish the game with 11 points, but was limited by some early foul trouble that prevented her from finding her usual rhythm.
“[Dartmouth’s] really athletic, really physical,” Rollins said. “We found ourselves going over their back and fouling them.”
Tay, who scored a career-high 34 points on Saturday, went into halftime scoreless, with only one assist to show for her 20 minutes of play. The senior was never really able to penetrate the Big Green’s zone, and at times seemed hesitant to push the tempo.
“We were playing not to lose instead of playing to win and attacking them,” Rollins said.
Dartmouth’s speed on the court allowed the team to use a quick double team to shut down Markley and Tay, and the Big Green was never really challenged by the Harvard offense.
But with the stands in Leede Arena full of Dartmouth fans in awe of their team’s physical gifts, there was at least one person who left the building talking about the mental side of the game.
“I think we’re just as athletic, they’re a little taller,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They just played looser than we did—we were real tight.”
However, the knowledge that Harvard could have dealt better with the Big Green’s athleticism will be little consolation. Dartmouth now heads to the NCAA Tournament, while the Crimson settles for the WNIT.
“To be honest, there was nothing good about the game except how Dartmouth played,” Delaney-Smith said.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate's blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
FlyBy would like to welcome you to the VOID on this fine Monday evening. What is the VOID, you ask? Technically, it is nothing more than the space of time between 5am and 8am. But, in truth, it can only be described by those who have been there. It is cruel. It is painful. In its wake lie nothing but tears, agony, and spent cans of Red Bull...ineffective as usual. Try as you may to flee to the sanctuary of The Onion, Youtube, or FML...to no avail: the VOID is a black hole that seeks to sucks the life out of any and all comers. 
But we’ve got your back. Be strong, grab another diet Coke, crack open a new internet tab and head wherever your heart desires. But most importantly, pop in some headphones to listen to our inspirational song for the night (if only to drown out the whirring of that vacuum getting to work in Lamont café). O_O

Adams has long stood out for its restrictive dining policies, though FlyBy has a pretty good record of getting our food there come dinner time. But last night, the House with the convenient, if dimly lit, dining hall took interhouse restrictions to a new level.  The absurdity after the jump.
Beginning at around 6 p.m., proud Adams resident and FM columnist Vinnie Chiappini clambered into a turquoise lifeguard chair and heckled mercilessly into his megaphone at non-residents from his perch. Those denied swipe access were given mere seconds to scan the dining hall for a friendly Adamsian face before Chiappini and his helpers broke into a rousing chorus of a hearty tune as the meek freshman or quadling slunk away in red-faced shame.
It wasn't until after an hour of House-wide schadenfreude that Chiappini attended to the more worldly needs of his digestive tract.
"I'm stepping down because I'm hungry," he blared into the megaphone at 7 P.M. "It's been an hour-long hunger strike for me."
Good thing FlyBy has Pfoho immunity.

Oh come, all ye unfortunates, to Pfoho dhall.

Ew.
Good thing no one eats in Cabot anyway.

The AP reports that our esteemed President has won the fourth annual American History book prize for her 6th book  "The Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War."
This is exactly the kind of skill we at FlyBy love to see in our leaders: the ability to write  meticulously researched exposes on fascinating historical events from previously untouched angles.   While we love giving you props for your fantastic scholarly work in assessing the cultural impact of the 600,000 casualties of the Civil War or whatever...how about that endowment, Drew?
But don't let that spoil your hopefully lavish celebration--Faust will receive $50,000 along with the award. A sincere congrats Drew, from FlyBy to you.

The MAC pool manager called the cops on Adams upon recognizing a megaphone-wielding rabble-rouser perched on his lifeguard chair in a photo gracing the front of today's Crimson. At the indignant alleged chair-owner's behest, HUPD officers promptly cut the bike lock securing the chair to one of Adam's guardian lions and toted the chair out of the dining hall.
Though currently off duty, Adams resident and FM columnist Vinnie Chiappini declares his intention to "reclaim what is not justly ours, but which we consider ours anyhow."
Stay tuned.

UPDATE: And, we were right. Ratatat is basically a lower-key version of Girltalk, although they do create their own beats. Hopefully the electropop duo will stay on stage a bit longer.
