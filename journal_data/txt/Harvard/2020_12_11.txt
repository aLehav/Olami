“I Hate Suzie” truly does it all First created for Sky TV, the show is at once a heart-stopping portrait of a woman in crisis, an irreverent dramedy satirizing the Hollywood machine, a grounded story about an unhappy couple in the English countryside, and a fictionalized take on the horrific hacks that countless female celebrities have endured over the last decade. To top it all off, in one slightly confusing moment at the end, it is even a musical. Starring actress Billie Piper and “Succession” writer Lucy Prebble, this multifaceted show follows the eponymous Suzie Pickles (Piper) — an actress whose world crumbles when a hacker releases explicit photos from her phone which reveal her extramarital affair.
Piper, Prebble, and the episode’s director Georgi Banks-Davies masterfully portray Suzie’s mercurial success while grounding the story in her flawed humanity. In the show’s opening scene, a young, achingly eager singer performs a song onstage and a disembodied voice asks her name. “Well, that’s the last time anyone’s gonna ask you that, Suzie,” the voice responds. “You’re gonna be a star.” In this moment, like so many others throughout the episode, the focus stays on Suzie’s reaction; even in the midst of an adoring crowd and a jubilant game-show judge, she is alone in the frame, and the scene masterfully layers that visual loneliness beneath the surface of her success.
In the next scene, Suzie is 20 years older and at the apex of her career, screaming with happiness as her agent tells her that she has landed a role as a Disney princess. In this moment of triumph, as in the prior scene, she is strikingly alone — pacing around in the yard outside her house, apologizing to her confused neighbors for the noise. The mismatch between the unglamorous setting and career-defining news emphasizes the disconnect between the glitter of her career and the reality of her life. Once the show has established her bona-fide movie star status, it is disinterested in portraying the excitement of celebrity — instead, it zeroes in on the everyday difficulties defining her life. As Suzie navigates the fraught awkwardness of her marriage, celebrates her casting news with her son, and eventually escapes upstairs to avoid her disgruntled husband, this isolation becomes all the more uncomfortably palpable.
The grounded vulnerability of Suzie’s character (and Piper’s performance) in the episode’s opening makes the chaos of what follows truly overwhelming. In a frenzied sequence, Suzie learns she has been targeted by hackers in a massive nude photo leak. She tries desperately to seal her home off from the onslaught, unplugging her Wi-Fi router and seizing her son’s ipad, but the onslaught, of course, comes to her in the form of a magazine photo crew, who takes over her house for a shoot.
The episode’s frenetic cinematography heightens the feeling of a sensory overload, brilliantly bringing the audience into Suzie’s internal meltdown. As Piper told Vulture, the creators wanted the episode to unfold like “a literal panic attack,” and Piper’s shattered performance in the bustle of the photoshoot hauntingly evokes the feeling of a living nightmare.
The production design leans into Suzie’s isolation, immersing the viewer in her insulated country hamlet as her public persona collapses. The creators cleverly portray the disconnect between Suzie’s stardom and her real-life experience, ultimately offering a nuanced look at the personal impact of the hacking campaigns that have invaded the privacy of many high-profile actors in the last several years. Rather than a glittery, Sorkin-esque drama, however, the show embraces a more lighthearted, comedic approach that ushers the viewer into Suzie’s inner world and highlights the superficiality of Hollywood.
While at times the litany of characters can be hard to track, “I Hate Suzie” is worth pausing for, even if it takes a moment to get your bearings. The “I Hate Suzie” premiere is witty, fast, and introduces a charismatic protagonist the audience is immediately rooting for. It begins an in-depth exploration of the impact the photo hack has, shedding light on an untold side of a story that has played out in the news again and again in recent memory, with little attention paid to the pain the photo hacks cause. For fans of other sharp dramedies like “Succession” and “I May Destroy You,” “I Hate Suzie” is truly a must-watch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve tested positive … for a great virtual semester! I write today to share silver linings I have seen as byproducts of the unfortunate COVID-19 crisis. Someday, masks will go. By the time my blue light glasses break, I doubt I’ll need to replace them. However, being removed from the traditional campus environment has helped me see my college experience differently, especially regarding what I want to pursue during it. This new metaphorical lens that I now see through affords me 2020 vision. Pun intended.
First, I recognize that my experience with COVID-19 has been mild (literally and figuratively). In July, I actually did test positive for the virus, but was mostly asymptomatic. Other aspects of my life were affected in ways standard to most students: my classes are online, I’m not living on campus, and I spend vastly more time alone in my textbooks, since collaborating with classmates requires juggling time zone differences. I am blessed to not have had any immediate family members die from the virus, and grieve for those who cannot say the same thing. All that said, I hope that my experiences may relate to each person reading this, in some fashion.
Being removed from the campus environment enabled me to see that I had experienced a form of groupthink — the phenomenon in which individuals modify their opinion to match that of a group — during my freshman year at Harvard.
In a speech to my fellow freshman and me at the beginning of the year, Dean Rakesh Khurana advised us to avoid entering college with a completely hardened idea of what we want to pursue. Those who go in with these preconceived notions often treat their classes as “transactional” in nature, getting them from where they are to where they perceive they need to be. Rather, he argued for us to make it “transformational” and to be open to exploring new ideas. His speech gave me the assurance that I could afford to take time away from my expected concentration to broaden my horizons and experiment with classes I otherwise may have forgone.
That freshman fall, I took four classes in fields completely unrelated to each other. I was excited to run the gamut and see more of what the world had to offer. However, I quickly entered a semester consumed by friends and friends of friends recruiting for investment banking and consulting jobs. Over the course of a few short months, my vision of what I should go into narrowed to those two paths. Additionally, getting As began to supersede actually learning the material I was passionate about.
Don’t get me wrong. Investment banking and consulting are amazing career paths, which set you up fantastically for other opportunities afterwards. They pay well. They push you. There is a reason why there is such a premium on them and who knows, I may pivot later and pursue one or the other after all. Regardless, in this environment, it was easy to feel that I could not afford to branch out and focus on anything else. Being entrenched in a community so engrossed by these two career paths, made me want to pursue what everyone else seemed to be pursuing.
Now, I do acknowledge that my favorite part of my Harvard experience has been exactly this, being surrounded and inspired by greatness. However, the reality set in for me, that though I thought these were my interests, I had not given myself the opportunity to step back from the group mentality and evaluate if investment banking or management consulting really lined up with my true passions and aspirations.
The isolated COVID-19 environment and the opportunity to take classes online have afforded me this much-needed chance to step back and evaluate what I really want out of my Harvard experience and beyond.
With more time at home by myself to think, I was able to explore different career paths and analyze my natural strengths and interests. I rediscovered a love for computer science that I’d fostered in high school. I know that in studying computer science at Harvard, I will be challenged. I recognize that in doing so, I may not leave college with a transcript as “unscathed” as I would studying something else. However, having been fortified by these experiences off-campus, I feel the courage that I need to take a road “less traveled by,” as Robert Frost describes. It’d be a shame to miss opportunities that I personally wish to explore, because of the fear of failure or the fact that those around me are not pursuing the same.
When “two roads diverge” in life, consider the advice of others, but ultimately proceed to where you personally are excited to go. I’ve found that as I make decisions intentionally, understanding my personal reasons for it, it no longer matters whether others are doing the same or not. Not that I’m studying something super niche — I’m concentrating in computer science, the second most popular major at Harvard. Call me basic! My point is that I’ve had my most fulfilling semester yet (regardless of it being via Zoom) because it has provided me the time and the space independent of others and their opinions to comfortably and confidently know why I am pursuing the course that I am.
Every one of us has heard something like the statement, “honestly, in the end, it doesn’t matter what you major in if you graduate from Harvard.” Do we trust that enough to be honest with ourselves and pursue what we are truly passionate about? I recognize that I haven’t done this perfectly myself, but do know that the increased satisfaction which comes from reevaluating what we’re pursuing and why is universally available to us all. While I absolutely love the faculty, students, and opportunities for learning that Harvard offers, I believe the online learning environment offers a unique and perfect opportunity to hold this personal assessment away from the influence of a classroom or peers. May we enter 2021 with increased clarity, even that of 2020 vision. Semper veritas!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When online classes resume this spring, 3,100 campus beds, the University announced earlier this month, will be full. Though capacity will still be limited to one person per bedroom, this creeping advance towards normal college life is exciting — but also has us worried. More students returning to Cambridge and the loosening of public health restrictions come spring means the ghost of a campus that’s existed these past eight months is coming back to life. The question remains, however, whether it will haunt us.
The University showed the strength of its pandemic planning this fall, keeping undergraduate COVID cases to 29: leaps and bounds better than what other campuses managed. This victory was hard-won. Rigorous testing, zero guests, no indoor socialization, and taxing isolation were the way this semester. More students will have the option to partake in that experience this spring, with conditions potentially relaxed in accordance with a five-tiered system the College has laid out that modulates how restrictive campus looks in a manner “directly tied to student behavior and public health conditions.”
We miss our friends and the hubbub of normal college life that our unthinking past selves took for granted. These past nine months have been hard, isolating, and sometimes desolate. Establishing even a semblance of normalcy and keeping students sane are important priorities, and in ramping up safe capacity, the University deserves credit for enabling students who want it to have a campus atmosphere to return to. But keeping undergraduates — and the professors, graduate students, and staff who make our University what it is — safe remains critical, even with vaccine distribution on the horizon.
This is the balance that must be struck in reopening next semester, and Harvard’s attitude on how to strike it seems just about right. The University’s communications on the decision were open and frank, providing information about the tiered system of reopening and concrete details about what kinds of socializing will or will not be restricted on campus, depending on the intensity of communal spread. But they also projected optimism about the move, with other plans to pilot some in-person instruction coming as part of a broader effort to prepare for a resumption of normal campus life.
Optimism is great, but so is honesty. So while the upbeat tone was heartening, most of the reason we appreciated these communications is that they dealt with the concrete questions of what and how much will be restricted that students need to make informed choices about whether or not to return.
That said, juniors and seniors are arguably far more likely than their younger peers to socialize in potentially dangerous ways. First, they have far more access to peripheral social spaces, like finals clubs, which the University can’t control. Second, they have a higher percentage of 21-plus students, who can not only purchase alcohol but go to bars and other venues for transmission. Third, they have a place to pick up — their social careers arrested in mid-flight last March, painfully suspended over nine long months. As such, juniors and seniors have the means and impetus to party and illicitly socialize in a way freshmen really didn’t.
Moreover, they lack the trepidation of freshmen, who, fresh and unjaded, are more likely to follow College policies. Juniors and seniors have dealt with College disciplinary structures before; they know how to dodge enforcement, and they are just less likely to take threats seriously than their younger peers.
To be sure, we’re glad that the college’s plan for reopening includes the possibility of indoor socialization, beginning at “level three” when students are allowed to welcome one visitor at a time into their rooms. With most of the semester spent in the coldest, most miserable Cambridge months, outdoor socialization will be more difficult than ever and students will be more isolated than ever. It’s clear that the worst is yet to come and moderate, controlled indoor socialization is something that should definitely be considered given low-to-no case counts.
But it’s a fine line to walk, and sanctioned indoor socialization — combined with the penchants of seniors and juniors — may well have its consequences.
The College, like so many institutions, continues to have its work cut out. The balance, as it has been, for these last nine months is between the socio-emotional well being of the community and the physical health of that community and the city it occupies. We’re no doubt worried about what’s to come — we’ve still got a tough way to go. But on balance, the College has done a solid job — in the material of its plan and the specificity of its communication.
Until the spring!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vladimir Nabokov was a lepidopterist — a scientist of butterflies.
His American literary career started close to Boston in 1941, at the helm of Wellesley College’s Russian department. At the same time, he was the curator of the butterfly collection at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. You can see Nabokov’s fastidious devotion to the Museum’s vast and varied collection in his anatomical drawings, his published entomology papers on different elements of taxonomy, and of course his books. Take “Pale Fire,” his 1962 poem-as-novel bursting with butterfly as theme: “I can do what only a true artist can do — pounce upon the forgotten butterfly of revelation … see the web of the world, and the warp and the weft of that web.”
I’ve been thinking a lot about the scientific-literary axis of Nabokov’s work ever since I declared Chemistry and Comparative Literature as a joint concentration — a decision that has been attracting raised eyebrows for weeks on end. Sure, it’s unusual; yes, there are a lot of requirements to get done; but mostly, I think people were surprised that I wanted to follow two seemingly alien disciplines to high academic levels.
Personally, I’ve never found it a weird combination. Arts and sciences always went together for me like Nabokov’s books and butterflies — I’d puzzle through biochemical interactions just as I teased apart dense knots of 20th-century French literature. But my classmates were surprised, prompting me to defend myself with examples from the greats. So I turned to Nabokov.
Nabokov wasn’t the only writer-scientist (or scientist-writer?), of course. I’d point to Aristotle as an early example of the genre, though he was less of a creative writer and more of a true scholar. Aristotle’s writings teach us about science in its purest sense — as not only the accounting of observations but, more importantly, the making connections between them. To use a mathematical metaphor, as Leo Tolstoy would, Aristotle’s science is the derivative of one’s observations, the novel analyses that propel our understanding.
But Aristotle didn’t limit his science to the domains of biology and chemistry, what we would consider today conventional “science.” Aristotle dissected disciplines from physics to poetry, holding their foundations up to the light with a pair of ancient tweezers, scrutinizing how they fit together. In applying the same careful scholarship to both the quantitative and the qualitative, he demonstrated a fundamental similarity between the two, a shared basis of inquiry and wonder.
The list of thinkers melding science and art stretches on and on — I can think of more recent moments of science in literature from authors like Tolstoy; T.S. Eliot, Class of 1910; Anton Chekhov; and Milan Kundera; not to mention the outstanding professors at Harvard today who strive to breach the quantitative-qualitative divide. Like my immunology professor, who began his lecture on organ transplantation with a fresco by Fra Angelico depicting medieval surgery. Or my Government professor, who had us study the early women’s suffrage movement by looking at both the wording of a women-led petition and a statistical analysis of the overwhelming percentage of women signing petitions at the time. Why, then, do we students find problem sets and papers so immiscible?
We hear it in the pre-med groans over the full-year English requirement, the glee in a humanities concentrator’s voice as they proclaim they’ll never take a math class again, the way we all defensively start our opinions with “I’m a STEM person,” or “I’m a humanities person.” Our parlance presents it as a binary: STEM vs. humanities, p-sets vs. papers, Cabot vs. Widener. How can we stop ourselves from forgetting that the same foundation of observing and making connections underlies both so-called sides?
I’m not asking everyone to run and sign up to do a joint concentration or grab a Human Evolutionary Biology secondary or anything — the diversity of our passions and the dedication with which we pursue them is what makes our world an interesting place. But I am suggesting that, when distaste rises at the thought of a writing assignment or a quantitative distribution requirement threatens to puncture a paper-lined bubble, we approach it instead with the same curiosity we do our own concentrations.
The p-set aficionado might treat the essay as a logical puzzle of words, phrases, and ideas; and conversely, the essayist could see their p-set as a window into the languages of mathematical or biological thinking. Think of it as exercising our Aristotelian skills of connection in a perhaps unfamiliar environment — making us better thinkers, students, scholars.
Because that’s the point of this liberal-arts education we’ve all undertaken. All these General Education and distribution requirements aren’t about parroting off high-level buzzwords to look good at fancy dinners, but instead using what we don’t know to reexamine what we do. It’s about making connections between biology and poetry, between economics and philosophy, between lepidoptery and literature.
Would Nabokov’s writing have been as categorically novel without his entomological work? Aristotle’s physics as beautiful without his tussle with creative art? Who’s to say? But let’s do the experiment — peering into both worlds for just long enough to see them blur together — and find out for ourselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Determined to leave their mark, President Donald J. Trump and his allies have pursued a bold policy agenda that has limited immigration to the United States.
With a litany of immigration-related administrative policy reviews, rule changes, and contentious court battles coming out of the White House, many Harvard affiliates and immigration advocates have expressed concern that the outgoing president has harmed American higher education.
Harvard administrators have been front and center in expressing those sentiments. University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott have reiterated in interviews and statements that Trump’s policy pursuits would have severe consequences for Harvard and, more broadly, American higher education.
Bacow lobbied lawmakers and sent letters to several Trump administration officials pleading with them to commit to installing visa protections for international students.
In an Oct. 16 interview with The Crimson, Elliott criticized Trump’s efforts, saying that Harvard and all of American higher education “has suffered.”
Efforts to limit entry from certain countries, restrictions to make it harder to obtain work permits, and proposed rules that would threaten visa-holders’ legal status have worried and, ultimately, interrupted many international students’ experiences on campus.
The White House Press Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
During the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration began a concerted effort to tighten provisions for international students seeking employment, setting its sights on the Optional Practical Training provision of F-1 visas.
OPT allows international students who receive a STEM degree to apply to stay in the U.S. for up to three years post-graduation, and is considered by some to be a common pathway to obtaining an H1-B work visa.
The program is widely popular — U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reported a record 223,284 applications approved for Employment Authorization Documents under OPT in 2019.
Chris Chmielenski, deputy director at immigration reduction nonprofit NumbersUSA, lambasted OPT in an interview, arguing that the extension program “circumvents the will of Congress.” These arguments have found their way to the Trump administration. Officials considered severely limiting OPT, but ultimately decided not to pursue these changes, according to Politico.
Chmielenski said he hoped the Trump White House would work to implement OPT restrictions, arguing that the program goes beyond the legal definition of F-1 student visas.
“The law is pretty clearly written when it comes to F-1 visas,” Chmielenski said. “And the law that was passed by Congress says that F-1 is to be used for the purpose of international students coming to the United States for the sole purpose of studying in the United States.”
“In our opinion, it was never intended for those students to be able to stay and work in the United States after they graduate from college,” Chmielenski said. “We shouldn’t just automatically be giving every single international student who graduates a work permit so they can stay and work in the United States for between one and three years."
Bacow, in a June letter to the U.S. Department of State and Homeland Security, expressed concern over what the University and other institutions would stand to lose had OPT been limited.
“The loss of OPT threatens to erode our ability to enroll the best and brightest,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow urged government officials to avoid taking steps to adopt stricter immigration policies, adding that it could cut universities off from a global community of science and research.
“Not only do these policies threaten to undermine our national ideals and core institutional values of openness and inclusivity,” Bacow wrote. “They threaten to cut off the United States from the global scientific community in critical fields of science and scholarship."
In his first week in office, Trump issued Executive Order 13769. This travel ban went through three iterations, originally barring the entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries to the U.S. for 90 days.
The ban has taken a toll on some Harvard students, who say it has separated them from their families and led to frustration and even isolation.
“I feel professionally and emotionally exhausted more than ever in my life,” Electrical Engineering postdoctoral fellow Shahab Asoodeh, who is from Iran, wrote in a message to The Crimson.
When Trump signed the first iteration of his executive order, Asoodeh was a Ph.D. student in Canada planning to come to the U.S. as a postdoctoral fellow at both Harvard and MIT. But soon after the ban came into effect, he received a notice from immigration officials that they had suspended his visa application. His colleagues at Harvard later rescinded his offer since the project was time sensitive.
Reluctant to stay in Canada after finishing his doctoral studies, Asoodeh came into contact with faculty members at the University of Chicago, who offered him employment. Officials there later sent Asoodeh’s information to the office of Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).
“His office contacted me several times, and ostensibly helped me get my visa from [the] US Embassy in Ottawa,” Asoodeh wrote.
Durbin’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Asoodeh’s case.
While in the U.S., Asoodeh kept in touch with his colleagues at Harvard and was able to transfer to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a postdoctoral fellow in 2019.
Life in the U.S. has not been any easier for Asoodeh. Given his visa status, he has not been able to leave the country over fears that he would not be allowed to return. Since his arrival in 2017, he has not attended international conferences and research workshops that he said are critical to meeting his postdoctoral obligations.
“This has been detrimental for my current faculty job search as I didn’t give any talks or lectures in international conferences,” Asoodeh wrote.
Ralph Estanboulieh ’21, originally from Aleppo, Syria, was preparing to study in the U.S. in the months leading up to the 2016 election. Once Trump won the presidency, and Estanboulieh gained admission to Harvard, he said that he anticipated some difficulties obtaining his student visa.
The President’s travel ban took effect on Jan. 28, 2017, but U.S. District Judge James L. Robart struck down the order less than a week later, temporarily halting it.
In March 2017, Trump implemented a second version, which was preemptively struck down by a federal court in Hawaii. Estanboulieh’s ability to obtain entry to the country and join his first-year peers hung in the balance of that court's decision.
“I was very lucky I was able to slide into a flight right between, I think, the second and the third versions,” Estanboulieh said.
Between March and July of 2017, the Trump administration took the order all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld provisions that prohibited entry to refugees with no ties to the U.S.
Estanboulieh was spared, but he has not been able to see his family in Syria for more than three years.
“Of course, being far away from home here is — it can be painful sometimes like, of course, you can imagine homesickness,” Estanboulieh said. “I don’t want to say ‘get used to it’ because you don’t really get used to it, but you get used to how it feels.”
With Joseph R. Biden’s election, Estanboulieh is only now entertaining the possibility of a trip back home.
“I mean, one of his promises was on day one, he would remove the travel ban,” Estanboulieh said. “And so, as long as he keeps his promise, I think that should be good, and then once he does, then we can start thinking about potentially visiting home.”
With mounted expectations, President-elect Biden faces a series of challenges. The Trump administration is rushing to finalize immigration rule changes that would make it harder for Biden to ease travel and visa restrictions.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” on Sept. 25 that would reduce the amount of time international students can spend inside the country. The ruling has not yet gone into effect, since the federal government is required to read and respond to all comments before processing the proposal for a final review.
The notice has received 32,083 comments, which could take months to respond to. But if the rule were to be approved and sent to Congress, it would be harder for the Biden administration to overturn it, according to Danilo A. Zak, a policy and advocacy associate with the National Immigration Forum. The process of overturning a final rule would involve months of administrative review.
It remains unclear how the incoming Biden administration will pursue protections for international students.
In July, Biden tweeted that international students should not face any significant barriers to studying in the country.
“Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are,” he wrote.
Ned Price, a spokesperson for Biden’s transition team, declined to comment on their plans for reversing President Trump’s visa restrictions, instead referring to Biden’s campaign website.
On the website, the Biden campaign wrote that his administration would work to increase the number of employment-based visas and liberalize restrictions for Ph.D. graduates coming from any science, technology, engineering, or mathematics background, while also temporarily reducing the number of visas during times of high U.S. unemployment.
Regardless of Biden’s policy priorities, Trump’s actions, combined with the onslaught of the pandemic, appears to have contributed to a declining number of international students enrolling in American universities.
The Institute for International Education, an organization that advocates for foreign student enrollment in the U.S., published a report showing that new registrations among international students have declined for the past four years.
From 2017 to 2018, 271,738 new international students enrolled in American universities. This number was markedly lower than in years prior, dropping 6.6 percent from the preceding year — the greatest decrease in six years.
Katie Moon, a spokesperson for the Institute for International Education, declined to comment.
The declining number of new international student enrollments concerns immigration advocacy groups. Zak, the National Immigration Forum associate, said the trend is worrying since students from abroad are now turning to other countries to pursue their studies.
Zak pointed out that growth rates of international student enrollment in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany have remained markedly higher than in the U.S., citing the countries’ less stringent visa policies.
“There are just broader problems with the way the U.S. treats international students,” he said. “If you compare our policies with the U.K., Canada, Germany, you know, other countries with comparable educational institutions, you’ll see that those countries have remarkably more welcoming policies for international students to stay and work after they graduate.”
David A. Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College, offered a similar observation. Hopkins speculated that Trump’s immigration agenda has likely shaped public opinion towards the U.S. for years to come.
“The fact that Trump got elected and did what he did is now a matter of historical fact,” Hopkins said. “And that has the effect of possibly changing public opinion in the rest of the world and changing the decisions made by students and scholars considering coming to the U.S. to study or pursue their academic career.”
“There’s a residue of distrust or fear or acrimony that may endure even with a Biden presidency and even with Trump defeated.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since she received her acceptance letter, Samantha G. Marks ’25 dreamed of her time on campus. As senior year of high school waned, she motivated herself by imagining the intellectual wonderland she would soon access: top-tier research labs, extraordinary peers, and tight-knit communities around her favorite activities.
Her initial stance on taking a gap year? “Absolutely no way,” Marks said.
During the following months, however, COVID-19 surged across the United States and the world. On March 10, 2020, Harvard ordered all residential students to vacate campus and continue the semester virtually.
Still, Marks held out hope that Harvard would be able to provide the traditional campus experience in the fall. She waited to make her decision until the “heartbreaking” announcement on July 6 that all courses would be taught remotely. Marks would be unable to conduct lab research as she had hoped, or participate in clubs as she had imagined.
“I knew it wouldn’t be the same,” Marks said.
Like 340 first-year students — representing over 20 percent of those admitted — Marks ultimately deferred enrollment until fall 2021. Over a thousand other students also elected to take leaves of absence.
The Crimson spoke to nine students who chose not to enroll for the fall semester, representing members of each of Harvard’s four classes. Challenged to create a meaningful gap year experience despite the pandemic, they pursued professional opportunities, explored the world around them, and focused on personal growth.
When Jessica L. Eng ’21-’22 learned that classes would be virtual, the choice to take time off was clear. Although she had enjoyed her online classes, she craved the freedom provided by unstructured time. She had interned for the Washington Post during the summer, and the option to continue into the fall proved too enticing to ignore.
Eng eventually decided to intern with National Public Radio instead — an opportunity she would otherwise have been unable to pursue.
“I wanted to work on the election,” Eng said. “Being able to be directly embedded in a team working on election graphics and all that cool stuff — that only comes around [every] four years.”
Eng decided to move from her hometown of San Francisco to Washington, D.C. for the fall semester. However, she still felt a connection to home, particularly when writing about the same wildfires that filled her summer skies with smoke.
“I was looking through data and helping write a story about the California wildfires, which actually impacted my family, even though I was writing it in Washington, D.C.,” Eng said. “Actually reporting on things that were super personal to me felt a little bit weird, but also rewarding, because I was able to report these stories and share them with my family.”
Others students, such as Shira Z. Hoffer ’25, pursued opportunities in social activism. She interned part-time for Massachusetts State Senator Jamie B. Eldridge, going on to work with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire.
“I think working with the ACLU has definitely been the most impactful,” Hoffer said. “Instead of having, you know, administrative work that I may have expected as an intern, I've actually been reaching out to recently freed people from county jails and talking with them about their experiences.”
In some cases, students helped their communities by working on the front lines.
Jessica P. Miller ’21-’22 relished the opportunity to work full-time as an emergency medical technician rather than attend virtual classes.
An aspiring doctor, Miller gained insight into the dilemma healthcare professionals face when trying to balance community needs with their families' health during the pandemic. She expressed concern about exposing her grandmother to COVID-19, even while following all health precautions.
“It just comes with the job if anything major like a pandemic pops up,” Miller said. “I think that's something that healthcare workers have struggled with lately, because it's like, oh, I didn't sign up for this whenever I decided to become a nurse or something like that. But like, yeah, you kind of did.”
Nevertheless, Miller and Hoffer both said they remained happy about their decision to spend time off in service to others.
“I've met really cool people,” Hoffer said, “And I've had these really neat opportunities that have been meaningful both in and of themselves, and also, hopefully will lead me to future opportunities in the same kind of fields and possibly beyond.”
Sarah L. Packman ’25 spent her fall semester circumnavigating the Atlantic Ocean.
She had heard from her high school scuba-diving and sailing instructor of a gap year experience called Seamester, which involves spending a period of up to three months at sea.
“My thought process was that, I've been just going continuously in high school, pushing myself really hard in school and keeping my head down, not really doing anything super adventurous or out of the box,” Packman said. “And since COVID struck, I’ve basically just been at home all summer, and it just seemed like it's now or never, right?”
Some of Packman’s favorite experiences have been at port cities around the Atlantic. She highlighted scuba diving in the Caribbean — an experience she said “spoiled” her — and rappelling down huge seaside cliffs.
“I've definitely discovered that a sit-down desk job is not the only path in life,” Packman said. “My eyes have been opened to the different kinds of lifestyles that people can lead and still be super happy and fulfilled.”
Some students didn’t have to go far for adventure. For example, Miller described kayaking, riding four-wheelers, and hiking mountain and forest trails in the wilderness in her home state of West Virginia.
A number of students also expressed a desire to go on more traditional gap year adventures during the spring semester, when they believe the threat of coronavirus will be less severe.
Not content to spend his gap year at home, Ryan D. Nguyen ’25 began organizing a road trip across the lower 48 states with two friends who are also on gap years. The trip is set to begin in March.
Other students plan to travel abroad for the spring. Hannah R. Frazer ’25 said she’ll join a programin Tel Aviv, Israel for six months, where she will learn Hebrew and Israeli history, as well as taking field trips to Jerusalem and other areas.
“I don't really know that much about my religion, history, and culture, and so I'm very excited to go there and learn a lot more about it,” Frazer said. “I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to use all of my energy in Israel doing a lot more exploration and stuff like that.”
When Michal Goldstein ’25 decided to take a gap year, she never intended to take a break. She had originally planned to work a full-time job during the fall, but ultimately was unable to do so due to her family’s health concerns.
In hindsight, Goldstein said she was grateful for the opportunity to take a breath and use her unstructured time for introspection.
“You learn so much more about yourself when you're not doing other things,” Goldstein said. “I have all this time to read books and write and stuff and do all that introspective thinking for fun, and not because I'm doing it for a class or grade.”
One self-discovery that Goldstein made, she said, was her ability to embrace the unknown. For example, she said she’s not concerned about lacking plans for 2021 — as opposed to high school, where she said she always knew what she had planned for a given year.
“If you had told me that my thinking would have been like that a year ago, I would have thought you were crazy,” Goldstein said. “The truth is that you actually never know what's happening in the future, and that's just something we tell ourselves, and COVID has just made that really apparent.”
Elissa M. Taylor ’21-’22 said she also appreciated the downtime.
“I really feel like I won't ever have a time like this again where I have the mental space to think and philosophize, if you will, and read and dive into these topics that are honestly really, I guess, you could say academic in a lot of ways,” Taylor said.
In particular, Taylor said she came to a number of realizations regarding race and systems of privilege around her, as well as her responsibility to speak out against them rather than allowing others to feel marginalized.
“I feel like a lot of the issues that I'm interested in [that] I'm kind of trying to understand better are not actually that hard to grasp, conceptually, but they're really difficult to come to terms with emotionally,” Taylor said. “As a white person, I still had to go through the kind of emotional realization of just how much I was directly benefiting from a racist system.”
Other students pursued self-improvement by learning new languages and picking up new hobbies, such as playing the guitar. For example, Eng honed her cooking skills, exploring ancient Egyptian and traditional Chinese dishes and creating a cookbook with modern interpretations of these recipes.
Still, some students found their gap year experience intellectually unsatisfiying. To that end, Marks, who had long wanted to learn additional programming languages, decided to do something counterintuitive: take a Harvard class.
“One of the classes I'm taking is actually CS 50 because it's online,” Marks said. “It's been really fun because Professor Malan, he records all of his lectures that are going on right now, so I can find them on YouTube and do them, and he has all the problem sets from last year, so I'm completing them. So I sort of feel like I'm still slightly there in spirit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite their unusual introduction to classmates this fall, Harvard freshmen will face the process of blocking — choosing students with whom they will share an upperclassman House — this spring, administrators explained at a virtual panel Wednesday.
Senior Assistant Dean of Residential Life and First-Year Students Nekesa C. Straker, Director of Housing Carina A. Myteveli, and other College administrators discussed the housing application process for rising sophomores at the panel.
Straker — who was joined by Assistant Director of Housing Brian M. Boughton and several peer advising fellows — opened the panel by acknowledging students’ anxieties about applying for housing given the atypical fall semester. In addition to the social distancing regulations on-campus freshmen navigated in the fall, Harvard College announced on Dec. 1 that it would prioritize housing for upperclassmen in the spring, reducing in-person socializing opportunities for freshmen.
“We want to emphasize that we understand many of you are nervous about this process or feel as though you haven’t had time to meet many classmates to form a blocking group. We know that this is especially true for our international students,” Straker said.
Myteveli then provided an overview of Harvard’s housing system. She underscored that the lottery process is designed to “randomly assign” blocking groups to houses, and that non-health-related factors will not affect housing assignments.
“Factors such as legacy status, religion, athletic affiliation, and siblings are not considered. It is, as I mentioned before, a random lottery, so we do not take any of those things into consideration,” she said.
As in previous years, each blocking group will elect a group leader responsible for coordinating information via the residential portal, Myteveli said. Only group leaders are able to confirm a “link” between two groups, which is done via email. Linking groups — which are not required for entering the housing lottery — are guaranteed houses in the same "neighborhood."
Peer advising fellows then shared their personal experiences with the lottery process. Frances Hisgen ’21, a resident of Currier House, refuted the common misconception that the “Quad” — comprised of Pforzhemier, Currier, and Cabot Houses — is geographically isolated from other houses and campus facilities.
“This may be a fairly obvious point, but it is really not that far from the Quad to Winthrop. There’s a shuttle from the Quad to Mather. You will keep your friends no matter where they end up, if they’re important to you,” she said.
Matthew “Matt” Thomas ’21, a resident of Kirkland House, said he thinks considering roommate compatibility is paramount when forming a blocking group.
“Some of the best advice I was given is that your best friends don’t necessarily make your best roommates. They might, but the people you’re compatible living with are not always the people who you’re closest with,” he said.
Freshmen who attended the panel reacted with a mix of satisfaction and lingering concern. Arjun A. Akwei ’24 said that despite the comprehensive nature of the panel, some students may still feel anxious given the dearth of socializing opportunities this semester.
“I think they did answer a lot of questions about how the blocking and housing process would work. But I do believe that a lot of students still feel very underprepared because of the nature of socializing this semester,” he said.
Cynthia Chen ’24, who also attended the panel, said she appreciated the peer advising fellows’ emphasis on housing as a holistic experience.
“Through the panel, they emphasized that your blocking group doesn’t matter as much, and the whole point of the lottery is to place you into a house. And the house community is what’s the best part of it at the end of the day,” she said.
Myteveli said Housing Day will look significantly different this year, given that most freshmen will be living off-campus come March. She added, however, that Housing Day plans have yet to solidify.
“Unfortunately, with everything that’s been going on in the last year, our usual plans for Housing Day are not going to happen most likely. But we don’t have any additional information as of yet,” she said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that administrators hope to collaborate with the First Year Social Committee to facilitate opportunities for socialization before blocking groups are finalized in March.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will permanently close four University Dining Services facilities and lay off the employees at each location, according to Harvard Campus Services spokesperson Michael D. Conner.
The four operations impacted include the Heights restaurant in Smith Campus Center, CGIS Café in the Center for Government and International Studies, the Observatory Cart, and the Culinary Support Group kitchen. The CSG kitchen serves as the central kitchen for HUDS, providing the various soups, sauces, salads, and pastas used across all of Harvard’s dining halls.
The announcement entails the layoff of 17 workers at the CSG kitchen, a point of contention for many HUDS workers, some of whom are already facing potential layoffs after Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced last month that the University would stop compensating contracted workers whose work had been idled by the pandemic.
Michael Kramer, executive vice president of UNITE HERE Local 26 — the union that represents HUDS employees — said the announcement came as a surprise after the University’s commitment to supporting its labor force throughout the pandemic.
“Throughout the pandemic, Harvard has been a good actor as an institution in protecting jobs and making sure that people didn’t lose their income during a global pandemic,” Kramer said. “This is a really shocking and unfortunate change of course that is going to destroy jobs and is unnecessary and cruel in this moment.”
The University chose to permanently close down some HUDS facilities, including the central CSG kitchen, because the landlord of the building insisted that Harvard vacate the premises in the wake of financial strains brought on by the pandemic, according to Laquiesha N. Rainey, a Local 26 chief shop steward.
Still, Rainey and Kramer say they believe the University should have waited until the worst of the pandemic was over before letting employees go permanently.
“This is not the time for layoffs. Harvard should not be acting like the cynical and callous corporations that are using this moment to eliminate jobs and restructure their workforces,” Kramer said. “This is a moment when we need to be coming together and protecting people and not allowing the most vulnerable members of the community to be thrown out onto the street right before the holidays.”
Kramer said the union would explore legal challenges if this policy is to take effect, and Rainey said the union had already filed a formal grievance against this measure.
In addition to the layoffs of the directly hired employees at CSG, many of the contracted dining workers across the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the Law and Medical Schools will also be laid off and lose their ability to access the “excused absence” policy guaranteed to direct-hires starting Jan. 1. The policy allows workers whose jobs have been idled by the public health crisis to maintain their compensation despite the lack of work.
Conner, spokesperson for Harvard Campus Services, said the University is working with Local 26 members to address these concerns.
“Talks have been initiated with the union leadership regarding the closures as defined in the union contract for impacted employees. An effective date has not yet been finalized,” he wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a turbulent year for the University and its finances, Harvard is set to grapple with an uncertain economic outlook in 2021, University Vice President for Finances Thomas J. Hollister said in an interview with The Crimson Thursday.
“There are three critical factors that we just don't know how they're going to behave. One is the pandemic itself. We all hope that we'll be back to normal, you know on campus in the fall, for example. We also have the uncertainty of the economy and the capital markets,” Hollister said.
Despite global economic turmoil, Harvard Management Company reported strong returns on its investments in the 2020 fiscal year. The endowment climbed to a historic high of $41.9 billion as of September — making it by far the largest university endowment in the world.
Hollister acknowledged HMC’s success, but stressed that the endowment returns do not present a complete picture of the University’s financial standing.
“We are very fortunate that the HMC had a comparatively strong year and that really has helped the overall financial picture for this year, but that alone is not enough to offset the other significant revenue declines, nor relieve us of the necessity of watching every penny,” Hollister said.
Harvard lost $138 million in revenue in fiscal year 2020, according to the University’s annual financial report.
Hollister also said the University has been operating at a deficit — spending more than it is earning — throughout the year. Harvard is set to do the same in 2021.
Hollister said the current status of undergraduate life poses a financial challenge. Harvard plans to invite about half of its student body to reside on campus in the spring, decreasing the revenue it draws from room and board. Nevertheless, Hollister said, the University’s expenses have increased, owing in part to the cost of personal protective equipment, testing and tracing programs, and increased financial aid.
In a September interview with The Crimson, University President Lawrence S. Bacow estimated that the school spends “tens of millions of dollars” in COVID-19 testing, among other pandemic-related costs.
Activists have, throughout the year, also urged the University to draw on its assets to compensate workers for the duration of the pandemic. Harvard most recently faced criticism for its decision to reduce pay for direct staff and stop compensating idled contract workers beginning on Jan. 15.
In an interview with The Crimson on Wednesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended the decision due to Harvard’s other financial commitments.
“We have literally thousands of people that we’ve been paying full time who have had no work since March. And we’ve tried to do as much as we can,” Bacow said. “But we also have responsibilities to students and faculty and staff, and we have to prioritize the academic enterprise as well.”
Hollister likewise defended the decision.
“Well I think there's an impression that Harvard has unlimited funds. And as the CFO, I can quite certainly say that's not the case,” Hollister said. “We're deficit spending this year.”
Hollister noted that administrators have drawn on the endowment to help correct the University’s pandemic-related losses. The Harvard Corporation announced in June that it would make 3 percent of the University’s restricted endowment funds available for immediate use as part of a “special assessment” of Harvard’s assets.
“There's also an oft-voiced perception that the endowment is somehow hidden away, and unused as being hoarded, when in fact, it's the opposite. Earnings from the endowment are distributed annually without fail, and it's our primary revenue source for both teaching and research,” Hollister said.
The University’s total student revenue dropped to $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2020, according to the annual financial report. The University increased its financial aid payments by 5 percent, totalling $645 million in scholarships, during the same period.
When asked if Harvard has enough money to continue operating while the pandemic rages on, Hollister had a muted response.
“Hope so,” he said.
Correction: December 11, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard's total student revenue dropped by $1.1 billion. In fact, it dropped to total $1.1 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Currier House Resident Tutor Molly C. Ryan ’14 Zoomed with students for her Quarantine Book Club, she was excited to see a copy of "Children of Blood and Bone" — a novel written by author and former Currierite Tomi J. Adeyemi ’15 — sitting on the students’ bookshelves.
In September, Ryan started the Currier Quarantine Book Club as a way to bond with students during the virtual fall semester. Through Porter Square Books, Ryan has shipped copies of the novel to around 30 students to places as far as Australia and Italy.
“They are now someone that I'll get to see and talk to and have this connection with because we've read the same book,” Ryan said.
As the pandemic scattered Harvard students across the world this semester, resident and non-resident tutors alike have endeavored to preserve the sense of community that has long defined Harvard residential life. Ryan said that prior to the pandemic, Currier House was known for its welcoming social spaces, including the Fishbowl, Solarium, and Ten-Man — all popular party spaces on campus.
“If you're coming off the shuttle, you're gonna walk by and see something going on, and maybe you hang out or say hey for a little bit,” she said.
During the pandemic, that spontaneity has disappeared. Although more than 1,600 students lived on campus this fall, the majority of upperclassmen lived off campus. Instead of in-person House orientation events that occur at the beginning of the semester, students were assigned to virtual entryways and convened over Zoom. For sophomore advising, Ryan said that meetings felt more structured in a virtual setting and often happened around certain academic deadlines, such as the course add/drop deadline.
Beyond providing students with important guidance on internships, career choices, and schoolwork, Ryan said, the role of a resident tutor also involves making meaningful connections with others in the House.
“Being around and being yourself is part of what it means to be part of a community and to build a community,” Ryan said. “And because of the way things have to be more structured and planned on Zoom, it's a little bit harder to get to know people in those informal ways.”
For decades, tutors have bridged the gap between students and House administrators, including Faculty Deans.
Ann B. Georgi, along with her husband Howard M. Georgi ’67-’68, served as an adviser to students for two decades, from 1998 until 2018, as Faculty Dean of Leverett House. Georgi was also the first Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Advisor. She created the position to expand the Life Sciences advising opportunities she informally provided to Leverett students to all undergraduates.
As Faculty Dean of Leverett House, Georgi coordinated the activities of the tutors throughout the House, ensuring that selected tutors were both approachable and well-informed in their field.
“We actually felt that hiring tutors was the most important job we did in the House,” she said.
Resident and non-resident tutors and faculty deans also play a large role in the application process for summer internships, early careers, and graduate school, including medical and law school. Tutors work to ensure students are able to convey their strengths in any application, Georgi said.
Current Harvard Law School student Neil S. Davey ’18, a former Cabot House resident, said that a pre-law tutor helped him shift his perspective when he was applying to law school. The tutor advised him to focus on a problem he wished to solve rather than solely discussing his accomplishments.
“Obviously, you get some credit for where you went, but at the end of the day, you’re on a new playing field with the people you're working with,” Davey said. “I think it’s just important to take to heart that it still requires hard work and passion and compassion, which is, I think, a super valuable advising lesson.”
As applications for medical school require House letters of recommendation, advisors would gather to decide how best to recommend a particular student. According to Georgi, although other Houses did not feel that House letters of recommendation were important for law school applications, the former Leverett Faculty Deans also wrote House letters of recommendation for pre-law students, believing that this additional component may have contributed to the applicants' success.
House letters of recommendation are particularly important for eager fellowship applicants. Howard M. Georgi wrote many House letters for applicants to the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships.
“We knew our students,” Ann B. Georgi said. “And so, it was easy for us to really point out their strengths.”
Coordination among tutors, and casual student-tutor interactions throughout pre-pandemic school years bolstered a strong sense of community that contributed to the overall success of advising at Harvard, Georgi said.
“The tutors really were a very close knit community,” she said. “And yet, when you walked into the dining hall, they were almost always sitting with students, and not just the tutor table.”
Across the Houses, tutors are fighting to preserve House traditions and encourage students to attend virtual programming. Many are experimenting with translating in-person House events into virtual meetings. Lowell House Resident Tutor Sarah E. June ’14 hosted a "Britney Spears Superfan" event in early December to discuss the pop star’s acclaimed career. Another Lowell Resident Tutor, Ryan E. Hulett, hosted the "Great Tutor Bake-Off" over Zoom.
Rita Guan Ye, a non-resident tutor in Adams House, hosts a live sutra-chanting session every Tuesday evening over Zoom. She and the students take turns chanting the Heart Sutra, a sutra in Mahayana Buddhism. As opposed to students who pass by a table casually in the House, the students who click on the link have real desire to learn, she said. In her emails to students, Guan Ye includes the English translation as well as an introductory video for students who are interested in learning more.
“Sometimes I feel like I'm the spiritual counselor or something because you have to really focus, because the students who really click the link, they are really interested and they want to know something,” Guan Ye said. “There are questions all the time and because of my own unstable connection sometimes I drop out, and we have to re-enter [the Zoom room] five times.”
Makinde Ogunnaike, a Pforzheimer House resident tutor and the head of race relations advising, also said that the formal nature of scheduled, online meetings allowed him to talk about sensitive topics.
“Oftentimes you need to be very, very close with a student before they feel comfortable discussing very difficult issues,” Ogunnaike said. “And this year, for better or worse, that's that barrier has been lowered a little bit. I'm able to have some real conversation with students.”
Ogunnaike, who also serves as a fellowships tutor, added that more students have reached out to him about fellowships than in previous years.
“You can just broadcast things to students and then it's kind of expected that you can just meet whenever you want, over a computer,” Ogunnaike said. “So it's actually been a lot easier, or I've gotten a lot more face time with students this year than in years past when everyone wanted to meet over lunch but had a tough schedule.”
For some fields of advising, the pandemic has not prompted much refashioning. Benny Goldman, a Winthrop tutor for Economics and intramural sports, has not witnessed a significant change with many Economics courses as a result of the pandemic, and thus advising in that field has remained largely unaffected.
“I would say in general the pandemic has not affected Economics that much,” he said. “A lot of econ classes are actually pretty conducive to being taken online, because it's a lot of lectures with PowerPoint slides, which is reasonably simple to translate to Zoom.”
Because Economics classes have been more successfully able to transition onto an online platform than lab-based STEM courses, advising in Economics is less complicated.
“I've still been able to touch base with advisees via Zoom and I think just by the nature of what economics is — not a ton of that involves being in person— so I think much can continue on virtually,” Goldman said. “But I would imagine, relative to other fields, it’s kind of one that translates nicely virtually.”
While the online format has pushed tutors to adapt in new ways, fostering a vibrant sense of student life has become a unique challenge.
Grant M. Jones ’14, a Winthrop House resident tutor who coordinates sophomore advising and BGLTQ events, said that while matching sophomores with appropriate advisors did not change this year, the virtual nature of the Fall 2020 semester forced adjustments to sophomore orientation traditions.
For example, the sophomore advising orientation and outing committee could not organize a beach excursion, like in previous years, and conducted activities over Zoom instead. Jones has noticed changes to other traditions and dwindling attendance for remote programming within the House, including study breaks.
“Nothing’s really that well-attended,” Jones said.
“I think everyone kind of rolls these days with some level of Zoom fatigue,” he explained. “I think people are trying to moderate their relationship with screens, as a result. And so I think, doing programming in this year, reaching out to folks, it's different, it's a lot harder. That being said, folks still show up sometimes to some things but it's definitely a different energy.”
Goldman, like many other tutors, felt that group events within a House have become less beneficial for students given the remote semester.
“I think in general just when students have been on Zoom all day for classes, it's really hard to get them to show up for extra Zooms in the evening,” Goldman said. “Most of my meetings with students have had a specific purpose. It's been less kind of just meet-and-hang-out type of thing just because that's less natural to do on Zoom.”
In a typical school year, intramural sports are a large component of House life on campus, as students are recruited to play on a team against the other Houses. Because of the online semester, the College has implemented new strategies to encourage physical activity and community-building. However, the absence of in-person intramural sports has had a great impact on student involvement in athletics, Goldman said.
“The challenge is when students are at home, the coaches are competing with non-Harvard resources, so it's quite easy to go on YouTube and find your favorite yoga instructor or a bootcamp class,” said Goldman. “I think sometimes when students are not physically at Harvard, it's hard to get students’ demand for these things very high.”
In addition to sports, Ogunnaike said that he misses learning about students’ interests through dining hall conversations.
“They often swerve into really unexpected areas where you get to know people really deeply,” he said. “You can start talking about some weird choice for YardFest, and then five minutes later, you're talking about deontology or some completely different frame on literary criticism which has lots to say about modern movements and politics. You have no idea how you got there but now you have a new perspective on something in the world [...] and oftentimes a huge new respect for lots of the people speaking around the table.”
Regardless of the difficulties presented by the pandemic and remote semester, tutors said they are actively looking for ways to engage and support students.
“For me the heart of the role really relies on the one-on-one interpersonal relationships that you can create with students. Those are just really special,” Jones said. “That’s definitely by far the greatest reward of the job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department and the FBI are investigating four bank robberies that struck Cambridge within the past three weeks — two of which occurred in Harvard Square.
The rash of bank robberies marks the first to hit Cambridge in more than two years.
The most recent robbery took place Wednesday afternoon at Central Square’s TD Bank — located at 617 Massachusetts Ave. — at roughly 4:15 p.m. The suspect, a white male with a slim build, passed a note demanding money and fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of cash toward Somerville, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. The suspect did not appear to have a weapon.
In each of the four robberies, a suspect passed a note to the bank teller. The robbers, who remain at large, did not display weapons in any of the incidents, Warnick said. In three of the robberies, the suspects fled with an undisclosed amount of cash.
CPD believes a serial robber is responsible for at least two of the incidents, both of which occurred just before Thanksgiving, Warnick said in a Wednesday interview.
On Nov. 23, a suspect held up the TD Bank located in Harvard Square at 1270 Massachusetts Ave. at approximately 4:11 p.m. Two days later, on Nov. 25 at roughly 9:12 a.m., the suspect passed a note to an employee of Cambridge Savings in Inman Square located at 1378 Cambridge Street. The suspect demanded money and threatened to shoot a weapon; they then fled with cash in the direction of Somerville.
Warnick said law enforcement believe the suspect, whom he described as a middle-aged, white male, in those two incidents is also responsible for bank robberies in Brookline and Boston.
In a separate incident, on Dec. 1 at 2:01 p.m., another man passed a note demanding money from Cambridge Trust in Harvard Square located at 1336 Massachusetts Ave. The teller was unable to immediately access the money, and the suspect fled the bank before he successfully obtained cash.
“This appears to be a standalone situation,” Warnick said.
Warnick said the suspect involved in the Dec. 1 attempted robbery, who he identified as a Black male, is not the same man who struck the banks before Thanksgiving. Warnick said the unsuccessful robber may have been inspired by the previous robberies.
“Like any crimes, any successful crimes — that can create potential copycats. And so that would not be a surprise,” he added.
Note-passing — whereby the perpetrator passes a note to the employee demanding money — is the most common method of bank robbery, according to the FBI.
Per the FBI’s most recent Bank Crimes Statistic Report, which is from 2018, there were 1,813 robberies that used a note during that year. Bank robberies that involved firearms were the second most popular type of bank robbery, with 545.
Prior to Nov. 23, the last bank robbery reported in Cambridge occurred in August 2018. Cambridge witnessed seven bank robberies in 2016, 11 in 2017, and four in 2018.
“Bank robberies now are nothing more than glorified shopliftings,” Warnick said. “The measures that are put in place, they’re just not going to be able to get a significant amount of money. And it’s a pretty high risk for a potential low reward.”
FBI Boston Division spokesperson Kristen M. Setera confirmed in an email that the FBI’s Violent Crimes Task Force is assisting Cambridge in an ongoing investigation. Setera declined to comment on the investigation and deferred to CPD.
Kelly D. Coveney, a Cambridge resident who banks with Cambridge Trust, said she was surprised to learn the bank was held up. Still, she said she was not concerned about conducting business at the bank.
Despite the sudden surge in bank robberies, robberies in Cambridge are down 19 percent compared to this time last year, according to a monthly crime report that CPD put out earlier this week. Per that report, the city witnessed 57 robberies over the first 11 months of 2020 — 11 classified as commercial robberies and 46 that took place on the street.
Overall, violent crime has decreased four percent so far this year, while property crimes are up seven percent with 134 additional crimes than occurred at this time in 2019.
CPD has also identified crime trends associated with COVID-19 that have continued in the city. They include a spike in bike thefts, package thefts, commercial burglaries, and a spike in fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits.

It’s that time of the year again! We’re deep into the season treasured more than any other by the overachieving high schoolers eventually accepted to the hype Harvard institution. College admission season is upon us, and this year it’s going to be wilder than ever. But imagine, Harvard doesn’t exist, and it never has. All of us currently attending Forbes’s number one school in the world definitely would have ended up at some other Ivy League establishment. Relive your pre-college glory days and find out where you would have ended up if the best college ever just didn’t exist. (Disclosure: Yale will not be displayed in your results because they only want to be us. There’s just no way they could exist without Harvard here to do everything first)
1. Where can you be found on a typical Monday at 1:07 a.m.?
A) Reviewing my stock portfolio.
B) In the library. Crying. And trying to dry the tear stains off my crumbled papers.
C) Sleeping, of course.
D) Doing math. Or coding. Or doing math while coding.
2. What’s your favorite family game night game?
A) Monopoly because I want to own the world.
B) Hardcore Operation.
C) Candy Land is pretty chill.
D) I like chess. IDK.
3. Choose a type of water.
A) Fiji
B) Brita
C) Refreshing Cambridge tap. Duh.
D) I don’t really drink water?
4. What Harvard building do you most identify with?
A) Littauer is the only relevant building so that one.
B) The Science Center isn’t the only building on campus?
C) I feel a spiritual connection with Boylston.
D) The one and only Maxwell Dworkin
5. Who’s the coolest?
A) Jordan Belfort!
B) Rosalind Franklin because she basically discovered how life works.
C) Shakespeare is a baller IMO
D) Elon Musk. Is that a hot take?
6. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
A) Yea, so as you know, I’m currently perfecting the usage of my superfluous vocabulary and implementing a technique through which I say a lot of seemingly important things that actually amount to meaningless extravagance. Peep me as a partner at my dream consulting firm or maybe even owning Wall Street in five years.
B) Ummm, I can barely see myself tomorrow, let alone in five years. My mountainous pile of psets has obstructed my entire view of life. If I make it through Chem 17 and actually get into med school, maybe we can talk, but I’m already late for something so bye.
C) I’ll probably be chilling. It’s not like my humanities classes are completely destroying my will to live, and I’m pretty sure my Ivy degree is going to help get me places. I’ll probably be at business school, divinity school, or pursuing the meaning of life in a remote mountainous location surrounded by Budhist monks in five years.
D) As Mark Zuckerberg.
Results
Mostly As: You’ll be Cheering for William the Quaker Now
Your life would be almost as good at UPenn! Meaning, you’ll still be able to embrace your big snake, ec bro tendencies. After graduation, your fellow alums will include John Legend, Warren Buffet, and Willian Henry Harrison, so that’s kind of cool. Plus, the Wharton School of Business is right in your backyard. It’s no HBS, but we’ll all be settling in this parallel universe.
Mostly Bs: Looks like Roaree the Lion for You 
Your love for science and debilitating premed tendencies could probably be satisfied at Columbia. You’ll have prime access to the beautifully named Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and who doesn’t enjoy the idea of that? Alicia Keys and Timothée Chalamet will be in your alumni network, so maybe you can get famous if your dreams of medicine fade to nightmares.
Mostly Cs: Time for Bruno the Bear bb 
You could probably be happy anywhere, but Brown might fill the Harvard humanities void. You’ll have some pretty fire donuts at your fingertips in Providence (at least that’s what they flex on their campus tours). And the ability to basically create your own requirements seems pretty appealing, too. One day, if you’re feeling brave, you’ll be able to hit up fellow alumna Emma Watson, and how cool is that?
Mostly Ds: Umm, Say Hi to the Cornell Bear Apparently
While you can no longer imagine yourself as the star of “The Social Network,” Cornell has your back. You might be missing out on the hustle and bustle of city life, but you’ll be surrounded by the beautiful scenery of Ithaca, New York. The Ivies aren’t especially famous for their tech programs, but Cornell looks like your best bet. Maybe you should have saved yourself from this quiz all together and gone to MIT, but here we are. At least you’ll get to share a college experience with Bill Nye the Science Guy!

Jingle bells, I can’t smell, I have to wash my hands… Remember when we all thought life would be back to normal by now? What a time. But with the holidays creeping around the corner, it’s time to get into the festive mood and find some time to unwind. Although we may not be on Harvard’s campus together, there are still plenty of ways to stay connected (unless your Wi-Fi drops) during this jolly season!
Decorate Together
Holiday decorating is something to look forward to every year, but this year, share the joy through your Zoom screen! Take your friends on a tour of your house as you hang up your Christmas lights and wreaths. Share stories about your favorite Christmas tree ornaments, or even better, your favorite Christmas recipes (eggnog vs hot chocolate?). And if your friend doesn’t have any holiday decorations, let them annotate the screen so that they can decorate along with you!
Stream a Holiday Movie 
This is a classic holiday festivity. Pick out a holiday movie to spend the night in with. Enjoy some hilarious commentary from your friends about blind spots in the film, or perhaps you’ll be brought to tears by the sight of people gathering to spend the holidays together. Wow remember when we could do that? Yea me neither. Either way, there are so many holiday classics out there, it’s hard to miss them: “Home Alone,” “Elf,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” the list goes on. Hot take: is “Die Hard” a holiday movie or not? You decide.
Playlist Collab/Dance Party
The best part about the holiday season is, without question, the Christmas music. Sorry, it’s a fact. Now, you can share your favorite Christmas tunes with your friends! Start a collaborative playlist or a group listening session on Spotify, and jam out to the iconic Mariah Carey (note that she starts with “I don’t want a lot for Christmas” and then reveals she wants “you,” ouch). Each person can add a little of their own ~spice~ to the playlist for everyone else to enjoy. Show off your dance moves, your cozy pajamas, and your creative Christmas apparel, all in one fun virtual party setting!
Virtual Secret Santa
Virtual or not, a holiday party would not be complete with a gift exchange. Secret Santa can help recapture some remnants of spending the holidays with your friends, and while you won’t be able to see them in person, you can see their faces light up on the Zoom camera instead. You can use a gift exchange generator online (try Elfster!), then send each other presents, and pick a designated time to open gifts together at a virtual party event. Whether it be a physical gift package or a simple gift card, virtual Secret Santa is another classic way to stay in touch during this season.
Holiday Photo Booth
Probably the singular downside to photo booths was that it was impossible to squeeze everyone into one picture. Well, up your photo game with your ~months~ of Zoom expertise and take some creative group shots. You can even add photo booth props to better capture (hah) the experience: Santa hats, reindeer ears, colored lights, etc. If all else fails, Zoom filters and backgrounds can easily transform your screen to red-and-green galore. And the pictures will be easy to distribute to everyone as well!
Hopefully, these virtual holiday happenings will save some of the jolly spirit of the season. Mix and match different activities together for optimal fun! It’ll be a different Christmas this year, but let’s all make the most out of it. And don’t forget to sing some holiday carols! Deck the halls with sanitizer, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
