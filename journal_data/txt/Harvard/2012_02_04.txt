After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When actor, writer, and comedian Jason Segel was honored as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year on Friday night, he quickly learned that the Pudding Pot comes at a price.
Segel, who currently stars in the CBS comedy “How I Met Your Mother,” said that he did not watch footage of previous Hasty Pudding Theatricals roasts in advance since he did not want to know what to expect at his own roast.
Jyotika Banga ’13 and Mary Jane Sakellariadis ’13 began the evening by asking Segel, who wore a blue velvet tuxedo, to “slay” three Hasty Pudding Theatricals members dressed as vampire sisters by telling three vampire jokes.
“This is my worst fucking nightmare,” Segel said with a laugh.
Throughout the roast, as cast members in drag continued to challenge Segel—calling on him to drink a bowl of barbecue sauce and dressing him in a Miss Piggy wig and a sparkling pink bra decorated with characters from the 2011 Muppets movie which he wrote—Segel did not hesitate to talk back.
When cast members asked Segel to sing a modified version of the Muppet’s famed “The Rainbow Connection,” Segel skimmed the new lyrics and said, “These are crazy words, you assholes,” giving cast members the middle finger.
Though many of the evening’s jokes played off of Segel’s involvement in the latest Muppets movie, Segel is also known for his comedic roles in “Knocked Up,” “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” “I Love You, Man,” and the cult-classic television series “Freaks and Geeks.”
When Segel, who said that he had spent the previous three evenings at Tommy Doyle’s pub in Harvard Square, earned his Pudding Pot at last, he said that he wanted to use it for a practical purpose.
He might not fill it with pudding, but “you could drink out of it,” he said.
Segel said he was grateful that his family members, who live in Massachusetts, were able to join him in Cambridge to celebrate his recognition.
In his final remarks, he promoted his family’s business, Mr. Sid, a men’s clothing store located in Newton, Mass.
The Man of the Year celebration preceded the opening performance of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ annual show, which runs through March.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pedagogy was the buzzword at a University-wide symposium on teaching and learning that brought together 250 faculty, staff, and invited panelists on Friday.
The symposium was organized by the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, an effort to foster innovation in the classroom funded by a $40 million dollar grant from Law School alumni Gustave M. and Rita E. Hauser in October.
“Today we see innovation happening all across Harvard,” University President Drew G. Faust said in her opening remarks on Friday. The question at hand for the symposium, Faust said, was, “How can we embrace all the possibilities before us as teachers and learners...and make constant renewal a part of every teacher’s life?”
Change in higher education was a recurring theme of the event. Speakers presented novel teaching techniques that cater to the science and technology of the 21st century.
Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen discussed the possibility that many of a university’s functions could be supplanted by online schooling.
“I believe that if we can be replaced by a computer screen, we should be,” said fellow panelist and Duke professor Cathy N. Davidson.
In response, some faculty members argued that some aspects of the traditional university—including research and mentorship opportunities—could not be replicated by online academies.
“We need to think about technology not as being the silver bullet that’s going to solve all these problems—but it might help support the underlying pedagogies that are actually the real root cause for improvement,” said Bridget T. Long, a professor at the Graduate School of Education.
A panel of three professors, including psychology professor Steven A. Pinker, drew on insights from cognitive psychology to suggest teaching methods designed to improve long-term retention of information, particularly at the undergraduate level.
In afternoon sessions during the daylong event, faculty swapped ideas for innovative teaching techniques, such as education that makes use of peer instruction, video, music, and photographs.
Many of the professors at the symposium expressed satisfaction that Harvard is making a clear commitment to discussing the classroom experiences of teachers and students.
“Harvard as a university has not traditionally devoted a lot of energy to education,” said molecular and cellular biology professor Richard M. Losick. “This is great.”
One attendee pointed out that the people present at the symposium were those already most concerned about improving education, saying that addressing the attendees was akin to “preaching to the choir.”
Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 responded, “The challenge of the innovators in this room is how to be evangelists among their colleagues. We will support you in the central administration.”
Samuel M. Galler ’12 coordinated a group of undergraduates who presented a video on learning styles and teaching techniques to the faculty on Thursday evening.
“The Hausers wanted students to be involved in this,” Galler said. “I think the student voice is often left out of these discussions.”
Galler said that the ways he was taught in middle and high school outnumbered the methods employed at Harvard.
The Hausers’ donation will fund grants for “sophisticatedly evidence-based” pedagogical initiatives that can be applied across disciplines.
For the inaugural year of the Hauser Grants, 255 faculty, staff, students, and alumni submitted letters requesting a total of $9.96 million in aid.
The letters are currently being evaluated by 52 reviewers, and the awardees will be announced in April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At one point in the second half of the No. 23 Harvard men’s basketball team’s 71-60 win over Cornell Friday night, three freshmen—Steve Moundou-Missi, Wesley Saunders, and Corbin Miller—joined senior co-captains Keith Wright and Oliver McNally on the floor.
In many ways, that lineup, and its opponent, represented how much things have changed in Ivy League basketball in the four years between the freshman seasons of Wright and McNally and those of the Crimson’s talented class of rookies this season.
When the co-captains were freshmen in 2008-09, Cornell was in the middle of a mini-dynasty, on its way to its second Ivy title—it would go to the Sweet Sixteen a year later—while Harvard finished .500.
Fast forward four years, where things are very different for both programs. The Crimson now sits atop the Ivy basketball world, and the Big Red must fight just to finish in the middle of the pack.
Looking for back-to-back championships of its own this season, the Crimson (19-2, 5-0 Ivy) continued to surge in that direction Friday night, winning a program-record 24th consecutive game on its home court.
Sophomore guard Laurent Rivard led the Crimson with 16 points, while junior forward Kyle Casey added 13. Meanwhile, a young Big Red (7-13, 2-3) squad struggled with fouls and turnovers throughout the evening, unable to generate any offensive rhythm before it was too late.
But after a sloppy second half of its own, Harvard left the game feeling it still had a lot to work on.
“We lost focus, [and] I think we relaxed,” Rivard said. “Obviously, that’s something we don’t want to do ever again.”
Harvard went into the break with a 14-point advantage, but Cornell came out with a quick 5-0 run, as Drew Ferry knocked down a three, and following a Casey turnover, Jonathan Gray scored on a transition layup.
“At the beginning of the second half, they came out and I think made a statement that they were going to try to make a run at this,” Amaker said. “I was not very happy with how we responded.... I was perplexed and disappointed with how we came out of the half.”
But Ferry would turn the ball over on the Big Red’s next possession, and McNally found Wright for a dunk at the other end.
Moments later, Casey drove baseline and threw down another slam. On the ensuing Cornell possession, Rivard jumped the passing lane, raced down court, split two defenders, and finished with the layup to put the Crimson up, 45-31.
From there, Harvard would go on a 15-8 run capped by a left corner three from junior Christian Webster to put the Crimson ahead, 60-40, with 5:57 to go.
By then, the contest was out of reach, but Cornell would finish on an 18-9 run, something the home team was not happy about.
“We lost a little concentration,” Casey said. “Not to take anything away from Cornell, because they played a solid game, but we’ve really got to stay focused for a full 40 minutes.”
Harvard looked inside early in the contest, as two early Wright layups—one an and-one—and two Casey free throws gave Harvard a quick 7-2 lead. Cornell fought back on two Gray baskets to tie the game at nine, but the Crimson went on a 16-6 run capped by a Rivard three to go up 25-15. Later, another Rivard long-ball—on which he was fouled but missed the free throw—put the Crimson up, 30-18.
Two Saunders free throws stretched the lead to 14 with 1:24 to go, and the freshman hit a layup at the buzzer to give the Crimson a 38-24 lead heading into the half.
Harvard held Ferry, the Big Red’s leading scorer, to just six points on 2-of-10 shooting.
“We knew they set a lot of screens for him,” Rivard said. “He runs a lot [and] has a really quick release. So we really focused on helping out with screens, having a hand on him, and footstepping.”
Freshman guard Corbin Miller played a season-high 21 minutes for the Crimson but shot zero-for-seven from downtown. The rookie had been 17-for-28 (61%) coming into the contest, which would have led the NCAA if he had qualified with more attempts.
“During the game I just told him, ‘Keep shooting’,” Rivard said. “Tomorrow he’s just got to shoot his first shot like nothing happened, and that’s what great shooters should do.”
Cornell committed 27 fouls, allowing the Crimson to get to the line 34 times. It hit 29 of those free throws, but Amaker was disappointed with his team’s performance on the whole.
“I just wish we could play better and more consistently throughout the game,” he said.

The Harvard men’s hockey team continued its late-season surge towards the top of the ECAC standings Friday night.
Down by two less than four minutes into the contest, the Crimson secured another come-from-behind victory, scoring five unanswered goals to erase the early deficit en route to a 6-3 win over Quinnipiac at the TD Bank Sports Center in Hamden, Conn.
The Bobcats (13-9-5, 5-6-4 ECAC) took two early leads of 2-0 and 3-1 in the first period, but then Harvard (7-6-9, 6-4-7) took control of the game, as sophomore goalie Raphael Girard replaced freshman Steve Michalek and saved all 26 shots he faced.
The Crimson, which had never won at Hamden, Conn. beat a Quinnipiac squad that had not played in two weeks. With the victory, Harvard extended its unbeaten streak to six games.  The Crimson now remains tied for third place in the ECAC standings, one point behind Ivy League rival Cornell.
The Bobcats scored twice within 86 seconds to put the Crimson in an early 2-0 hole. Bryce Van Brabant opened the scoring with a quick one-time wrister that Michalek initially saved but couldn’t hold on to as the puck trickled past him. Kellen Jones then scored soon after with a shot from the right.
“We just didn’t come out with a lot of energy, and they jumped on it,” sophomore defenseman Dan Ford said. “It was probably one of our worst periods all season.”
But junior forward Marshall Everson was able to cut the early deficit in half, rebounding freshman defenseman Patrick McNally’s blocked shot into the back of the net.
With just under 30 seconds remaining in the first period, Bobcat Loren Barron put Quinnipiac up by two once more with a backhand shot from the left side to beat Michalek.
In the frame, the freshman netminder saved 17 of the 20 shots that came his way.
The second period was a whole different story for Harvard, as the Crimson put Girard in net and appeared to come out with much better energy.
“I don’t think the guys came out and played real well in the first period,” Girard said. “So I don’t think you can blame it on [Michalek]…. We started hitting a lot in the second period, so it slowed them down a lot too. At that point, we took over.”
Having given up two goals in quick succession two games in a row, Harvard was finally able to provide one of its own flurries early in the second.
Freshman Colin Blackwell initially shot the puck at Bobcat goalie Eric Hartznell before he and junior Luke Greiner had a few whacks at the puck on the rebounds. The puck finally popped out to McNally, who sent it to senior Eric Kroshus, and the forward promptly buried it in the net.
Nineteen seconds later, junior defenseman Danny Biega, who also added an empty-net goal at the end of the game, took a shot from a distance by the point and beat Hartznell as he tried to make a glove save.
Tied 3-3, the Crimson appeared to take the momentum after those two quick goals.
At 5:42 in the third, Greiner broke the deadlock by finishing the rebound from a shot from the right by a streaking Blackwell on the counter.
Hartznell, who stopped 20 of 24 shots, was also replaced after Grenier’s score, with senior Dan Clarke stepping up in net.
Harvard finally grabbed its own two-goal lead towards the end of the game, as senior forward Alex Killorn skated down the right side and found junior forward Alex Fallstrom open near the left crease. Fallstrom, who had returned from an injury for Friday’s game, then easily tapped it in.
Quinnipiac outshot the Crimson, 46-33, and won more face-offs, 45-32, but Harvard still came away with the victory, providing Girard with his first collegiate win.
“It felt great,” Girard said. “I always have to be ready to jump in the game, and I just used my opportunity and played well.”
The Crimson is coming on strong at the right time, with the annual Beanpot tournament starting Monday evening. The opening game is against Boston University, who beat Harvard, 5-4, in overtime in January.
“They might have taken us easily when they came in and played in our barn,” Girard said. “But I think we showed them what we’re made of, and it’s going to be a really good game. I think it’s going to be really tight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the start of its first road trip of the winter season, the Harvard men’s tennis team began its triple-header weekend going 1-1 against Vanderbilt and Indiana, with the victory over the Commodores. Freshman Denis Nguyen was a standout against Vanderbilt, posting a clutch performance deep in the match.
Led by a strong performance in singles play, the Crimson (4-1, 0-0 Ivy) defeated the Commodores (2-2, 0-0 SEC) on Friday afternoon, 4-3, at Currey Tennis Center. Previous to the match, Vanderbilt was ranked 32 spots above Harvard, at No. 34 nationally.
The beginning of match play didn’t go quite as planned for the Crimson, as the strong performance by the Commodores’ doubles team put the visitors in a 2-1 hole. In the first match-up of the day, senior Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster faced Blake Bazarnik and Austin Gonzales. Vanderbilt’s duo held the lead throughout and took the match 8-5.
The second match of doubles play went decidedly better for Harvard, and Andy and Denis Nguyen, junior and freshman, respectively, beat the Commodores’ Charlie Jones and Joe Offerdahl, 8-6.
But, despite the success of Nguyen and Nguyen, the next match was dropped by the Crimson, 8-6, when sophomore Christo Schultz and freshman Henry Steer were taken down by Vanderbilt’s final doubles team.
On the singles court, it was a different story. Despite senior Jonathan Pearlman losing one of the initial matches, 6-4, 6-1, to Jones, Harvard was able to rally and, largely thanks to a resilient last-minute performance by Andy Nguyen, earn the W.
Following Pearlman’s play, freshman Alex Steinroeder handily defeated his opponent Joe Dorn, 6-1, 6-4, and Schultz captured a narrower victory over Odderdahl, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Next up was Steer, who lost to Bazarnik in three sets, 6-7, 6-4, 6-1.
After freshman Shaun Chaudhuri beat Alex DiValerio, 6-1, 6-4, the stage was set for the tiebreaking match-up: Denis Nguyen versus Gonzales. After losing the first set, 5-7, Nguyen managed to pull out the second, 6-4. The day’s results were thus decided on the third and final set. Nguyen was put to the test of match point five times in that round but, ultimately, defeated Gonzales, 7-5, and earned Harvard the 4-3 win.
Despite gaining momentum against Commodores, the Crimson struggled against No. 27 Indiana (4-2), and lost overall by a score of 5-2 on Saturday.
Doubles play once again proved to give Harvard the majority of its trouble, as the Hoosiers managed to take all three of the matches. First up were Felton and MacMaster who once again fell to their opponents in a tiebreaker, 9-8. Nguyen and Nguyen followed their teammates loss with a defeat of their own, 8-6, and the pattern was continued by Streinroeder and Pearlman with a score of 8-5.
But the Crimson scratched first on the scoreboard when it came to singles. Chaudhuri won his second singles match in two days, 6-2, 6-3, as did teammate Steinroeder who beat Dimitrije Tasic, 6-3, 6-2. Those points would prove to be the last for the Crimson, as Pearlman, Nguyen, and Felton all lost their singles matchups despite the fact that the Nguyen and Felton forced their respective competitions into three sets.
Harvard heads to Butler on Sunday to complete the triple-header.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite its top two scorers combing to shoot 5 for 21, the Harvard women’s basketball team topped Columbia, 68-56, Saturday in New York.
While co-captain Brogan Berry and sophomore Christine Clark struggled from the field, they made up for it from the charity stripe, making all 14 free throws they attempted. The rest of the team was just as perfect from the line, as the squad finished 21-21 on the day. Never before had a Crimson (11-8, 4-1 Ivy) squad been perfect on more than 15 free throw attempts.
Clark led the squad from the stripe, going 12 for 12. In doing so, the sophomore tied the program record for best single-game free-throw shooting performance. Despite shooting 4 of 15 from the field, her free-throw excellence propelled her to a team-high 21 points. Junior Victoria Lippert added 19, and junior Elle Hagedorn finished with 11 coming off the bench.
Columbia was led by sophomore Courtney Bradford, who tallied 17 on the night. Junior Tyler Simpson contributed 15 and Melissa Shaffer had 11, but it wasn’t enough to keep up with the Crimson.
Harvard grabbed an early 5-0 lead but couldn’t hold it as the Lions (2-17, 0-5) stormed back to tie the game at five. There were five more ties during a tightly contested first half before the Crimson went on a 9-0 run to end the period to go up, 32-23.
Coming out of the break, Harvard succumbed to an offensive lull in yet another game as the Lions clawed back into a 37-37 tie. Before a Clark layup six minutes into the half, the Crimson was shooting one of five with four turnovers in the period.
“That’s something that we are not happy with,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We’ve done everything to try to address that particular ‘M.O.’, and we will just keep working until we find that answer.”
During that stretch, Harvard prevented more damage from being done by playing stingy defense, as Columbia began the half shooting two of eight from the field.
“We did a lot of changing defenses and making adjustments, and they worked,” Delaney-Smith said. “We had to switch our defenses a lot to shut them down. Hats off to our team for doing that.”
With the game tied at 37, the Crimson rediscovered its offense just in time. Hagedorn nailed a three-point shot and finished an old-fashioned three-point play to fuel an 18-7 run that ended with the Crimson leading, 57-44. Harvard never faced another scare as it coasted to a 68-56 finish.
On the night, Hagedorn provided key points as the team’s stars faltered.
“Miriam [Rutzen] has been doing that at times. Emma [Golen] has been doing that at times. Last night, it was Elle who did it for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “They are capable of doing some damage. We are trying to get the other players to realize they are scorers as well.”
Berry finished with only five points, just her third single-digit outing in her last 14 matchups
“She’s a pretty unselfish player. She’ll put on her assist hat at times,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s too good of a shooter to stop shooting. Teams come in and put their best defender on her…and try to wear her down. She loves to get the big assist, so if she misses a few, she will get a little too generous when I think she can shoot more.”
Even without the consistent scoring of the Crimson captain, the squad posted one of its most complete performances to date. For the first time in 2012, Harvard outscored its opponent in both halves on Saturday. The team has now won six of its last eight and appears to have hit its stride in the middle of Ivy League play.
The Crimson currently sit in second in the Ancient Eight at 4-1 in conference and will have a chance to claim the No. 1 spot when Princeton comes to town on Saturday. Next weekend, the Crimson will also get two chances to tally its 300th conference win and become only the second Ivy League member to reach the milestone.

David A. Javerbaum '93, former executive producer of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," spoke at the Coop today in promotion of his latest book, "The Last Testament: A Memoir By God."
The book, which was released in November, is billed as a memoir dictated by God to Javerbaum, as God's way of clearing things up before the impending apocalypse.
Javerbaum spent most of the event at the Coop reading aloud from his book, showcasing the same wit and satirical bite that characterized his writing for Jon Stewart.
Topics covered in the excerpts Javerbaum read include:
The story of Adam and "Steve," Adam's gay lover (described as a "power-bottom.")
God's most elaborate practical joke­: planting fossils and DNA as seemingly incontrovertible evidence for evolution throughout all of creation.
Jesus's siblings, "Zach and Kathy."
God's view on sex­—"stop shouting my name!"
Javerbaum, who left "The Daily Show" in 2010, is the winner of 11 Emmys and two Grammys, and one of the three principle authors behind the bestselling book "America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction." While at Harvard, he was a member of the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, and co-writer of two Hasty Pudding Theatricals shows.
God has also opened a Twitter account.
