After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A word amiss, a sour phrase here and there: these offenses can be hard to pardon in a novel. All the same, knowing the enormity of their enterprise, one must allow the Homers their periodic nods. But shorter works get slimmer margins for error. The flash fiction story, dwarf cousin to the corpulent novel, affords no room for lapses in its brief performance. Every part must sing.
Jac Jemc’s recent collection of stories is the kind that qualifies for applause at intervals only. The title, “A Different Bed Every Time,” is perhaps too appropriate for its own good. Jemc goes to great pains to vary the length, style, point of view, and progression in the 42 stories, so each story is its own different bed of modern life, so to speak. The shortest, “The Effects of Rotation,” fills one-third of a page; the longest, “The Tackiness of Souls,” runs 10 pages, which is still considerably short. But most are flash fiction, two- or three-page siblings with a shared tightness of constitution. Sameness belies the differences; people in the stories share the perpetual fate of being lonely, foreign, and sad no matter how often they change where they sleep.
Granted, Jemc is a keen craftsman. Her plots meander artfully and her characters intrigue. She can be lovely, now and then, with a line like, “I could find beauty everywhere. When I woke each morning I could see that the day was capable of forking like the foot of a crow.” It is a graceful vision: the day “forking” ahead into its possibilities, turning avian and taking flight. The line is from “A Violence,” Jemc’s first story and one of her best, in which a young woman sleeps with round after round of motley urban men. Other great lines in that piece also show this touch of beautiful discretion: “Sometimes it was all I could do to be comforted by some vague ending glimmering in the distance.” Jemc never needs to say the woman is sad or alienated. It’s all there in the comforting, distant “ending” to the love cycles, an ending that her young protagonist considers but defers.
If only the language were consistently this good. Alas, Jemc nods off more than a few times, and it isn’t forgivable. “The Dark Spot” could have been an impressive two-pager about a woman taking refuge from a Thanksgiving family party in her basement closet. Instead, its rampant clumsiness threatens enjoyment of the story. The first paragraph is guilty of an embarrassing indulgence in alliteration: “By the fourth day I snuck into the smoky basement and pulled open the pressboard panel door of the furnace room. Cobwebs caught my forehead as I reached for the light chain. I pawed my face clean and cleared a path.” Of course, not all alliteration iterations are bad. To have as many as are here, however, and with no real justification, is inevitably amateurish and distracting.
Another story, “Unaccounted,” also could have been a gem, but Jemc writes goofy sentences like, “His face, he was sure, had crawled with surprise as her eyes imploded into their sockets each time she blinked.” Or, later, sentences like these: “He wanted to feel the cotton of her skin magnet to him with sweat. He wanted to taste the metal of her blood and feel the gold flecks of her eyes shine all fake on him.” The questionable metaphor and use of “magnet” as verb; the cliché “flecks of her eyes”; the underwhelming “shine all fake”—they destroy the piece’s fragile music. Such carelessness lies like a dull patina over too many of Jemc’s otherwise entertaining, psychologically incisive stories.
And then there are the stories like “The Chamber of the Enigma” and “Let Me Be Your Tugboat King,” which try to imitate slang. The former starts with “Buzzard and I made a baby, but that baby ain’t anything like we’d ever expected,” but then abruptly jumps to suspiciously lyrical speech: “Buzzard and I are small and soft, malleable and handpowered.” The latter story manifests the same awkwardness: “Dance it down for me. Let me see your sequins shimmer and shake,” says Jemc’s hokey old-fashioned narrator, who tries his moves on the unencouraging ladies. Jemc ventures beyond her comfort zone, which deserves praise, but the result of these ventures is less than satisfying.
Perhaps Jemc knows these shortcomings. In “Alcyone,” the character of an aging female writer says, “I have written boring poems like thick thighs. I have watched the ceiling ride around the room. My mentors have torn apart my work like chicken bones. I have been cracked open, jacked off, spiraled up.” Like the Greek mythological story of Alycone, who was changed to a kingfisher, this flash fiction is a metacommentary on the changing, ever-accommodating shape of Jemc the author. Her writing is a shape altered by former “mentors,” “cracked open,” criticised as “boring,” and thereafter reconfigured. More importantly, it is one that insists on calling its own content into being. “Am I lost or found?” the narrator asks. “No, the lost are an invention of the finders,” she says a moment later.
Jemc the writer finds her characters and shuffles them among a range of different beds and different lives as “lost” souls. Each time, her hopeful inventions, like the writer in “Alcyone,” tumble into a new situation but find the same disappointments. Similarly, every time the hopeful reader keeps falling into the same old bed of poignantly almost-there writing. But there is hope yet for Jemc, as for her people. In the words of one of her characters: “A vibrant person will rebuild herself. Only the dead break down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rarely does one encounter an espionage novel told in as straightforward and unadorned a voice as Ha Jin’s. The National Book Award laureate and two-time PEN/Faulkner-winning author’s new novel, “A Map of Betrayal,” chronicles the story of Gary Shang, “the biggest Chinese spy ever caught in North America.” The novel features two narratives in alternating chapters. The first tells the story of Gary Shang, who infiltrates the CIA on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party during the height of the Cold War. He leaves his new wife and parents behind in China to follow the government’s orders to settle in the U.S., where he marries an Irish-American woman with whom he has a daughter, Lillian. The other plot is told by a middle-aged Lillian, who embarks on a search to find her half-sister in China after learning about her father’s past via his secret diaries. In “A Map of Betrayal,” Ha Jin reaches his usual high standards by combining a gripping narrative with an elegant, straightforward style of writing. However, the book is occasionally bogged down by historical technicalities and an ambiguous protagonist.
Ha Jin’s incredible writing once again proves its potency in this novel. His simple, matter-of-fact prose adeptly expresses the bleak wariness of a spy caught between two worlds against his will. Disillusioning yet deeply moving, “A Map of Betrayal” reads like a compilation of the best traits of two masterpieces—John le Carré’s “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,” for its realistic, unglamorous portrayal of espionage, and Ernest Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms,” for its sparse prose chronicling an individual psychologically scarred by war and forces greater than himself. Ha Jin does not try to impress with his ornamentation, yet it is in the absolute absence of embellishment that one can access the pure, raw emotions of the characters.
However, the book is not without its shortcomings. Although the lucid tone of Jin’s writing first appears ideal for a historical novel, in some unpolished parts the narrative does not mix successfully with historical facts. The author’s recounting of U.S.-China relations is superbly executed, clearly written, and easy to digest. It firmly grounds the reader in the current of history and the fraught relationship between the two countries. However, the background information sometimes goes on for too long and veers into a rather dense textbook-style footnote. This severs the emotional flow of the novel and may create a barrier for some readers, especially for those not too familiar with Cold War history or the mid-20th century East Asian political landscape.
Ha Jin also stumbles in his attempt to create a convincing protagonist. Although some readers may find Gary Shang’s ambiguity appealing, Jin ultimately fails to create a persuasive lead. Unlike the other characters in “A Map of Betrayal,” Gary suffers from lack of development. His characterization as a lonely spy suffering from an identity crisis does provide the perfect ground for the author to exercise his signature style of writing—penetrating insights into human emotions and societal contexts. However, this very narrative construct paralyzes the character to the point that he becomes vacant and less fleshed-out than some of the supporting characters. For example, in comparison to Gary, his friend Bingwen Chu is a more complex character who enigmatically shifts between being Gary’s long-time confidant and a communist informant who withholds information about his family to ensure that his friend will continue to spy for the government.
Even if one likes Gary for realistically representing the world of espionage, his lack of agency and quick resignation make him unsympathetic, which detracts from the charms of the novel. In contrast to Lillian, who feels more approachable—partly due to her chapters being told in her first-person perspective—Gary is not helped by the omniscient perspective in which his chapters are told. The sparse soliloquies that give insight to his inner turmoil are rather distant and read like summaries of his emotions. For example, when Bingwen tells Gary that he might have to start another family and live overseas for many years, the narrator states, “He came within a breath of protesting but realized that would only make matters worse and might jeopardize his family. He heaved a sigh, unable to fathom the full implications of the directive.” Jin could have better elaborated on Gary’s struggles, even if it was only to show his eventual submission into his fate. Gary Shang may be a good spy, but he is not the most endearing lead character.
Perhaps it is Jin’s intention to make Gary an inaccessible character to the readers. After all, he is inaccessible to his colleagues, to his friend, to his wife, to his own daughter, and maybe even to himself. Maybe he becomes a shadow of his former self when he becomes Gary Shang, abandoning his former name, Weiman. Despite the shortcomings in characterization and treatment of historical facts, “A Map of Betrayal” is elegantly written and deeply haunting, and it deserves another acclaimed spot in Ha Jin’s bibliography.

On a sunny day in spring 2014, the constant humming of the crane that echoed across Broadway and Quincy streets suddenly halted, signaling the beginning of the end to the Harvard Art Museums’ renovation. In the months that followed, makeshift structures, designed to aid or veil construction, were dismantled one by one, finally revealing the brick façade of the Museums’ new home. The post-construction debris was swept away, and the barrier between the sidewalk and the building was taken down. Now, seven months later, the Museums are finally ready to reopen their doors.
In 2008, the Fogg Museum and the Busch-Reisinger Museum, both housed at 32 Quincy St., closed their doors, signaling the beginning of a six-year major reconstruction project helmed by the Renzo Piano Building Workshop. When reconstruction began, works from the Fogg and the Busch-Reisinger were exhibited in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, located just across the street. However, the significantly smaller size of the Sackler limited how many of the more than 250,000 works in the collection could be displayed. Well-known works were displayed for visitors from the general public; classes offered by the Department of History of Art and Architecture could also request that particular other works be exhibited. On June 1, 2013, after five years of provisional exhibitions, the works in the Sackler were moved to the storage facility in Somerville. The building on Quincy St. was finally preparing to open again—not as the Fogg and the Busch-Reisinger, but as the Harvard Art Museums.
The newly renovated building houses the three museums—the Fogg, the Busch-Reisinger, and the Sackler—in different sections of the same building. According to Director of the Harvard Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz, who received his Ph.D. in HAA (formerly called Fine Arts) from Harvard in 1985, this change will drastically alter the way the museums function. “By bringing the three museums together in one building under one roof, we can put the collections in dialogue,” Lentz says. Such interplay seems to be key for the Harvard Art Museums. By emphasizing the ways the museums’ collections intersect, as well as reaching out to various communities within the University, the Harvard Art Museums has reinvented itself as a university museum that combines the prestige of a metropolitan art museum with the mission of learning and research.
THREE MUSEUMS, ONE ROOF
Housing the three museums in one building is a decision that aims to foster a more multi-dimensional presentation. When the museums were in different facilities, the curatorial staffs of each did not often communicate with one another—something that Lentz says he wanted to address with the reconstruction. “If the curators aren’t talking, the collections aren’t talking to each other.” Lentz says. “If we wanted to talk about the importance of Greek and Roman sculpture in the classical tradition to Renaissance Italy, the materials were separated in two buildings. It wasn’t a viable operating model.”
The new architectural layout of the Museums seems to be key in ensuring that the three museums interact. Elisabetta Trezzani, a partner architect at the RPBW who was involved with the renovation process, stresses the importance of the Calderwood Courtyard in connecting the three museums. “The Calderwood Courtyard is in the center of the building. It’s a center point for the three museums, spatially and visually,” Trezzani says. “When you’re in the space, you can see the three museums through the glass door, and you have the three museums divided in the building. There’s an open view between the different galleries and the three different museums. There’s always some connection through the glass door.”

At the same time that the staff worked on uniting the museums, they also focused on maintaining the three distinct identities. As independent entitites, the museums were all created at different times and housed different collections: the Fogg opened in 1896 and exhibited a wide variety of Western artworks from the Middle Ages to the present. The Busch-Reisinger Museum was founded in 1903 and displayed Germanic art, such as works of German Expressionism and Bauhaus. The Sackler, which opened in 1985, housed non-Western art from East Asia, the ancient Mediterranean to India and the Islamic world.
For Lentz, the separate histories were an important aspect of the renovation. “They were all formed at different times for different reasons,” he says. “All of that is wonderful and is a celebrated part of history.” The architects and the museum staff worked together to preserve the museums’ personalities. “We really wanted to create one museum but keep the three different identities,” Trezzani says. According to Lentz, the objects all have labels that state which museum they belong to. “Philosophically and ideologically, it was important for us to do that,” he explains.
In addition, Lentz says he hopes that the combination of the museums will help combat a disparity between Western and non-Western art. “All of our ancient and non-Western collections sat [in the Sackler],” he says.”There was an uncomfortable perception that basically said all the important things were at the Fogg, which happened to be European. [The] rest of the world was across the street. With this new building, where all three museums are under one setting, the benefits will be obvious to people.”
A UNIVERSITY MUSEUM
The decision to bring the museums together is a part of the Harvard Art Museums’ renewed mission as a university museum—a key difference from the other major museums in town. For many of the sources interviewed, the Harvard Art Museums’ identity as a university museum is driven by Harvard’s broader mission as an educational institution. According to Lentz, the pedagogical function of the University accounts for the emphasis on visual-based learning in the Museums. “A lot of what the museum presents has been the hallmark of this institution—a deep belief in the power of original works of art, and attending to that, the notion that there are enormous benefits that come from the process of looking and thinking closely about original works of art,” Lentz says.
The proximity of the Harvard Art Museums to other major museums in Boston, such as the Institute of Contemporary Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, was a crucial factor in reconsidering the function of the Harvard Art Museums. “We thought long and hard about what it is that we do that’s a little different, what is unique to us, and where we can really make a contribution,” Lentz says. One pointed decision was to make the galleries relatively sparse. “We didn’t want to overhang or overcrowd our galleries. We want to slow people down by showing not 150 works of art, but 50,” Lentz says. “By doing that, we increase the chances of people stopping, looking and thinking about the art. You walk through a gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and you look at 200 coins. Your eyes are going to blur across that.” At the same time, Trezzani says, the RPBW worked to maximize space in the galleries.
The Harvard Art Museums has also made administrative changes to emphasize its pedagogical role to a greater extent than possible before. One example is the creation of the Division of Academic and Public Programs, which will help integrate all the University’s academic programs with the Museums as one of its main jobs. Jessica L. Martinez, the director of the DAPP, highlights the cooperation between the University and the Harvard Art Museums. “The mission is how to partner with faculty members across campus,” Martinez says. “How do we support the work of students, and how do we encourage new ways of viewing originals works of art?” Martinez’s colleague David Odo, the director of student programs and research curator for University collections initiatives, adds, “We want to combine the Museums’ mission with the University’s mission. We want to bring the academic work that’s being done at Harvard to the Museums.”
MATERIAL LEARNING
What Lentz calls the Museums’ function as a “giant, transparent classroom” goes beyond the gallery space. The Harvard Art Museums also bring in academic work through the new and improved facilities, such as the Art Study Center, the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, and the Materials Lab. These spaces will provide visitors to the Museums with alternative ways to interact with the collections. At the Art Study Center, for example, visitors can request to see objects that are not displayed in the galleries but are housed under a glass rooftop through which natural light shines.
The facilities will provide valuable opportunities to professors as well as students. Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, a professor of fine arts in the History of Art and Architecture Department, said she plans on holding classes for her course HAA 278g: “Drawing: Object, Medium, Discourse” at the Museums. The class, which teaches exhibition design and curatorial skills, will use the Art Study Center extensively. “Because of the study room, we will be able to look at the objects during the seminar, which is crucial,” Lajer-Burcharth says. “The students will get to examine the materiality of the object and think about it with others. It is training in art, not only as an image but also as a material thing. Otherwise, you won’t get a sense of handling or a subtlety in rendition. These are the most basic things that you must have access to.”
For both Lajer-Burcharth and Whitney T. Gao ’16, an HAA concentrator, close physical handling of artworks is crucial to a deeper understanding. “I often had things brought to class when the museum was closed, or we would go to the storage facility,” Lajer-Burcharth says. “We were always surprised at how much could come off from our collective looking.” Gao adds that the Museums will make a difference in her studies. “Knowing from excursions to museums that seeing the objects in person makes a huge difference, I’m very excited to experience the museum,” Gao says.
While the Art Study Center encourages analysis of artworks as material objects, other facilities allow people to explore different aspects of art. Museum officials say the Material Lab is meant to be a space where visitors can interact with the materials that go into works of art. “It’s a place for people to really experiment with materials that artists have used over time and to explore the materiality,” Martinez says. “We can get our hands dirty and experiment.”
Although the Conservation Room is mainly for professionals, its glass walls enable it to educate the public. “The conservation room is completely transparent to the public, which will let them know what’s happening in the spaces,” Trezzani says.
Lajer-Burcharth believes that the combination of these facilities with the vast artistic resources of the Museums presents students with a unique opportunity. “There are art museums elsewhere but they don’t have a great collection. If they do have a great collection, it’s a different kind of access,” she says. “Here, you have both—a museum that belongs to the University, whose mission is defined by the mission of learning and teaching, and a great collection.”
INTERSECTIONS
Although the Museums will be a key location for the HAA Department, they are also working to encourage interactions with other Harvard communities. The DAPP has created the Student Guide Program and the Harvard Art Museums Student Board to ensure exposure across the University. Led by Odo, the Student Guide Program has 18 undergraduate students from different concentrations who will give tours of the Harvard Art Museums. “We purposefully selected students from a wide variety of disciplines so they would bring fresh eyes to the collection,” Odo says. “We’re training them to think about the museum, the different types of collections, and to have interesting conversations with visitors who come on the tours.”
Meanwhile, the Harvard Art Museums Student Board includes students from all 12 graduate schools as well as the College who serve as liaisons between the larger Harvard community and the Museums. Siddhartha G. Jena ’16, a joint chemistry and physics and mathematics concentrator and a member of the Student Board, highlights its diversity. “We try to reach out to every possible demographic of the student body, especially the ones that wouldn’t have been reached before,” Jena says. “We have students ranging from president of the Wine Society [to] heads of investment groups at the Business School.”
Erin Northington, the student outreach and program coordinator for Division of Academic and Public Programs, thinks this variety of extracurricular interests will enliven the museum space. “We want the museum to be an active, vibrant space. In addition to encouraging curricular use of our space, we want Harvard Art Museums to be a vibrant part of extracurricular use,” Northington says.
Another mission of the Museums is to serve as a juncture point between Harvard and Cambridge, museum leaders say. According to DAPP, the Phillips Brooks House Association is working with the Museums on bringing students and mentees together with curators. They have also been collaborating with the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and the Graduate School of Education. “We’re training six students from the GSE to teach high school students from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin school. They’re working with the students in the classroom on art, and they come to the museum,” Odo says. “Next semester, various classes will visit the museum with their teachers, forming relationships with the high school and the Museums.”
In addition to the programs, the three entrances to the building—one on Prescott, one on Broadway, and a student entrance on the side—will ensure the physical intersection of the different communities. “The Calderwood Courtyard is the intersection between Cambridge and Harvard, and you can access it from both Prescott and Broadway,” says Northington. “Hopefully we’ll have neighbors and the greater Boston [population] perhaps cutting through the museum on their way home.” Trezzani believes that this architectural layout will foster more transparency. “Between the works of art, the galleries, and the communities, we have the idea of circulation,” she says. “We hope that the museum will be more open to the city, and more part of the community.”
OPEN TO RISKS 
After countless hours of planning and discussions, the Harvard Art Museums are finally ready to open—to an excited audience. According to Northington, tickets to the Student Opening on Nov. 6 sold out within one day at the Harvard Box Office; various students took to their residential house email lists to ask for tickets.
But one could say that the Museums has spent the last six years engaged in a process of opening; through its new layout, facilities, and different curricular and extracurricular programs, the Museums aims to make itself a welcoming and productive space for casual visitors, as well as students and experts. It’s a process that administrators for the Museums hope will continue even after opening celebrations have concluded. Martinez stresses that there is still plenty of room for further development. “We’ll figure out the future,” she says. “We’re thinking about how to make it so that people feel free and welcome to experiment.”

The red chalk strokes project off the yellowed paper. Two female nudes sit with fabric draped over their legs. Inside a gallery filled with paintings by artists like Van Gogh and Picasso, the piece—the sole chalk work in the room—is even more striking. It is Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s “Two Nude Women, Study for the ‘Great Bathers,’” one of many French drawings in the Harvard Art Museums collection.
“This is a study for a large painting in Philadelphia, one of Renoir’s most famous works because it was his grand statement about the Western tradition,” Elizabeth Rudy, assistant curator of European paintings, says. She goes on to explain how “Great Bathers” marks Renoir’s turn to classicism and how this makes the sketch study even more significant. “You might argue you see more into the artist’s process in this working drawing than you might see right away in the painting,” she says.
Rudy’s sentiments reflect the newly-renovated Harvard Art Museums’ mission to act as a laboratory for learning. In line with this undertaking, the museum’s galleries focus on historical and thematic elements rather than national boundaries or media. “We’ve tried real collaboration, and it’s about creating a space for real debates,” chief curator Deborah Martin Kao said during the press preview. For drawings like Renoir’s “Study for the ‘Great Bathers,’” this emphasis on fostering debate manifests itself in the works being displayed in the same room as finished paintings, a design unlike that found in most museums. “Each gallery has a wall dedicated to works on paper,” Rudy says. “It allows the visitor to get a fuller sense of artistic production in each of these eras.”
Among the featured drawings is the Museums’ collection of 18th- and 19th-century French works, which boasts artists like Jean-Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, and Jacques-Louis David. Mostly from the Winthrop and Sachs collections, the drawings showcase the artists’ range and development. But these valuable drawings are also fragile, requiring care and creativity to display in a way that does them justice. “Works on paper have to be kept on lower light so they do not become overexposed,” Rudy says. According to Rudy, due to conservation requirements, the Museums can only show the drawings on rotation, switching out drawings every four to six months.
Nevertheless, the drawings’ contribution to the Museums is worth the effort required to exhibit them. “There’s a hierarchy that privileges more permanent art like paintings or sculptures over more temporal things like drawings and prints,” Rudy says. “We hope our new installations will shake people’s expectations.” As the Harvard Art Museums ushers in a new era, its collection of drawings is also poised to make waves. Beyond the artistic merit of these drawings, their display reflects the Museums’ commitment to breaking boundaries.

As President Faust took the stage the morning of Nov. 7 at the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, she described the museum as a place to “bring Harvard’s world-class collection together in a space that inspires engagement.” While the entire museum, from its architecture to the way it arranges its various collections, seeks to encourage this engagement, perhaps no space is so completely dedicated to this as the new Art Study Center.
According to Mary Lister, the study center manager, the 5,000-square-foot oasis on the museum’s fourth floor will give visitors the ability to access the museum’s expansive works of art first hand. “One of our goals, by all means, is to have an engagement with the artwork in a really lovely, intimate setting,” Lister says. “Close viewing, I think, is our key.”
Lister and her staff are excited by the center’s ability to give visitors access to “the depth of [Harvard’s] collection,” with most of the pieces held in storage available for viewing upon request. This personal accessibility is a major facet of the museum’s philosophy; Faust describes the entire space as a “teaching machine.” Lister says “The Arts Study Center really is a public facing…representation of our dedication to education, to learning. I keep telling my staff, ‘We are just about learning on this floor.’”
While museum director Thomas W. Lentz says the conceptualization of the newly renovated space is due “to more than a decade of new thinking about the museum,” its commitment to first-hand interaction with art is by no means new. Both the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger Museums included study centers, and the Sackler Museum worked to accommodate requests for individual viewing as they were received. “The concept of the study center is historic. It’s really intertwined, I feel, with all of the museum’s philosophy,” Lister says. “Now we’re able to merge all of the collections in one facility and share the space among all the collection pieces. It’s just an amazing time to be here.”
The Art Study Center also represents another goal of the Harvard Art Museums: engagement with the wider community. Students, faculty, and community members alike will be allowed to utilize the center via an online request form, available on the Museums’ new website. While Lister warns that they may not be able to accommodate all of the requests they receive upon opening, she says that the entire staff is committed to “ramping up” their services as time goes on. As for what to request, that remains purely in the hands of the visitor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the end of the world approaches, books mysteriously fall off shelves and dust lands in strange patterns on the ground—seemingly undecipherable messages from beyond the stars. So begins “Interstellar,” a new science fiction adventure film from director Christopher Nolan, co-written with long-time collaborator and brother Jonathan Nolan (“The Prestige,” “The Dark Knight”).
Fresh off a slew of awards and nominations for “Dallas Buyers Club” and “True Detective,” Matthew McConaughey stars as Cooper, a single father and former pilot raising two children, Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy), on a farm in the Midwest. An unexplained blight compounded by devastating sandstorms has threatened crop production and ultimately the long-term survival of the human race, so the government has taken control of central planning and career assignment. Cooper is a man of science frustrated by the limited educational opportunities for his precocious daughter Murph (aptly named after Murphy’s Law), and this dissatisfaction is only exacerbated by his own unfulfilled career ambitions—astronauts have been deemed unnecessary in a NASA-less era where space exploration has been passed over for crop management.
The plot of “Interstellar” can best be described as operating within a “clockwork universe.” In their Chekhovian script, the Nolans go to painstaking lengths to ensure the seamless interconnectivity of every element in the film. For instance, after a requisite first act of character development on the farm (where McConaughey’s native Texan accent shines), a chance encounter with former acquaintance Professor Brand (Michael Caine, because this is a Nolan film) very plausibly inserts Cooper into the literal pilot’s seat of an interstellar space expedition to potentially habitable exoplanets that are humanity’s last hope. Accompanied by a crew that includes the professor’s daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and a charmingly sardonic AI robot named TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin), Cooper embarks on the greatest journey of his career at the cost of leaving behind a heartbroken 10-year-old Murph and the brooding teenaged Tom.
It’s this painful departure that sets the deeply emotional tone of the film. Although “Interstellar” achieves remarkable emotional resonance at times, it also delves into muddled and trite metaphors about the intangible power of love—a surprising shift for a dark, cerebral filmmaker such as Nolan. Nonetheless, certain scenes hit home very powerfully: Cooper’s awkward goodbye to his daughter is marred by the uncertainty of his return, as he (in a misguided attempt at humor) dryly remarks that the two might be the same age upon his return due to the unpredictable effects of relativity and time dilation. Later in his journey, McConaughey delivers one of his finest performances in a scene that intimately shows his regret about leaving his daughter. Nolan maintains a lengthy close-up on a tearful McConaughey that is set to an understated yet moving score penned by Hans Zimmer. It differs significantly from the booming strings and bass of “Inception” and “The Dark Knight Rises,” as the steady organ progression of the film’s central theme accurately reflects its emotional core: the father-daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.
Behind the character drama, “Interstellar” is also an adventure film meant to simultaneously evoke self-awareness of human cosmological insignificance and inspire wonder. When Cooper’s ship first departs Earth, it is set to a voiceover of Brand reciting Dylan Thomas: “Old age should burn and rave at close of day; / Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” Indeed, interspersed between the hard sci-fi concepts of wormholes, black holes, and time dilation is a primal yearning for exploration and an unshakeable faith and optimism in the face of the unknown. While Cooper explores faraway exoplanets, adult Murph (Jessica Chastain, delivering a remarkably moving performance as the abandoned, fatherless Murph) tackles impossible problems in theoretical physics with Professor Brand and adult Tom (Casey Affleck) attempts to care for his family on a less and less hospitable Earth. A previously marooned astronaut (an unbilled cameo) weeps at the improbability of his finally being rescued from an arctic wasteland. Cooper’s spaceship, appropriately named Endurance, flies past Saturn’s rings to the forbidding silence of space, a mere speck of metal next to the massive gas giant.
These powerful space visuals truly realize the film’s grand ambitions, putting Smithsonian IMAX documentaries and Michael Bay both to shame. During production, Nolan actually recruited theoretical physicist Kip Thorne as a consultant in order to ensure the scientific accuracy of astronomical phenomena in the film. Detailed visualizations of exoplanets, wormholes, and black holes were precisely and rigorously modeled before being rendered by visual effects company Double Negative (“Inception”), with the full film taking up almost a petabyte (one million GB) of data. Planetary vistas are equally impressive: the chaos of massive dust storms, colossal tsunamis, and frozen cloudscapes punctuates more human travel scenes in space. These intimate interior spaceship shots tend to be close-ups focusing on the faces of each astronaut, reflecting Nolan’s emphasis on character.
Yet “Interstellar” falls short of perfection due to its tonally awkward emphasis on love. Moreover, the film’s internal science fiction rules only make sense until they stop—Nolan’s understanding of time is similar to that of David Tennant’s Tenth Doctor: “It’s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey…stuff.” Yet despite these minor narrative shortcomings, “Interstellar” succeeds on a grand visual and thematic level because the film’s emotional undercurrent propels its discourse on faith and adventure. “Do not go gentle into that good night,” Brand warns. Much in the same way Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” redefined science fiction in 1968, Nolan’s “Interstellar” reimagines the frontier adventure amidst a galactic backdrop of existential obsession.

Everyone already knows what happens in “Citizenfour”: Edward Snowden, government-contractor-turned-whistleblower, reveals in no uncertain words that the National Security Agency monitors much of what Americans do on the Internet. Almost two years have passed since the events that “Citizenfour” depicts transpired, and while the film does indeed serve as an exposé, its primary purpose is much different. “Citizenfour” illustrates that Edward Snowden is far from the mythological figure that many make him out to be. In fact, for all of his determination, Snowden is in fact a very reserved and low-key figure with whom the viewer can connect. In that sense, “Citizenfour” is not the story of a country or of an entire world, but an intimate and revealing—albeit tinted—portrait of one man.
“Citizenfour” was filmed and directed by Laura Poitras, whom Snowden contacted in Jan. 2013. After a few months of correspondence, Snowden met Poitras and her colleague Glenn Greenwald in a Hong Kong hotel room. Their conversations over eight days were filmed and comprise around half of the 2-hour-long film. Although this close-up, intimate footage solely consists of Snowden and the journalists, it is incredibly captivating.
What makes this simple dialogue so riveting is not exactly his revelations—they are now commonly known. Rather, it is his quirks and peculiarities that subtly reveal facets of his personality. Snowden is hyper-cautious, even paranoid: he will only type critical passwords while hiding under a blanket (to prevent prying eyes), he unplugs the hotel phone for fear of being recorded, and at the end of the film he communicates by passing notes off-camera and instantly shredding them.
In another vein, it is fascinating to learn about Snowden’s intentions when he leaked millions of top-secret documents. Some might assume he did it for fame—for his name to be known and revered. “Citizenfour” shows that this Snowden believes the contrary. Snowden, Greenwald, and Poitras strategized for days over exactly how to release the documents and if—and when—to reveal Snowden’s identity. Snowden claims to believe in truth for the sake of truth; he wishes for the impending leaks to be more about their content and direct implications than about the personality of then-29-year-old Edward J. Snowden. And while some might consider him a hero, he doesn’t think of himself as one: Snowden declared that he acted to inspire more to follow in his footsteps as a whistleblower. This is one of the most striking points about the film, as it helps add a great amount of either humility or arrogance—depending on the viewer’s stance on Snowden’s morality.
While the film itself is very convincing, it seems to all be based on a faulty premise. The film’s central goal appears to be to establish that Snowden was a well-intentioned man with honorable values and an actual personality—essentially putting a face to the name. And, ironically, this is exactly what Snowden said he hoped wouldn’t happen. Revealing Snowden’s humility in fact violates it, creating an uneasy dissonance for the watcher. What’s more, the film actually omits a good deal of information that taints the saint-like image of Snowden. Just after the events of the film, Snowden passed information about U.S. activities in China to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. In fact, while he is somewhat hesitant to share some documents with Greenwald and Poitras, according to the South China Morning Post, he revealed specific targets which the NSA investigated. Although omitting this information was not necessarily journalistically unethical, “Citizenfour” would have been strengthened by an all-encompassing perspective of Snowden, not a rose-tinted one.
Despite its weaknesses, “Citizenfour” delivers a lasting impression. The intimate perspective afforded by the fact that filmmaker Poitras is actually one of Snowden’s collaborators creates a window into a world of secrecy. By showing that Snowden is a real human being, “Citizenfour” polarizes the viewer’s opinion of him. Those that believe he was justified will recognize him as a humble man dedicated to truth; those that take him for an agent of espionage will only be infuriated. Regardless, “Citizenfour,” while not one of the most well-made documentaries of this decade, is perhaps the most important and iconic one of our time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Megan (Keira Knightley) is in a bit of a rut. Megan is a “Laggie”—a person well into adulthood still desperately clinging to some semblance of youth and the lack of responsibility that accompanies it. But it’s only after half-heartedly agreeing to marry her milquetoast high school sweetheart that Megan realizes she needs a vacation from the mounting pressure of her life. Enter Annika (Chloë Grace Moretz), a rebellious teen in search of someone to buy her booze but in need of a role model. The two cross paths, and after a single night of debauchery, Megan decides to move in with her underage new friend and her attractive divorcé father in order to sort out her priorities, like any sane 20-something would. Cute? Sure. Slightly disturbing? Definitely. But while Lynn Shelton’s “Laggies” could pass as an exercise in immaturity, even insanity, Knightley’s utter commitment to her role steers the film away from the far-fetched. “Laggies” is a charming, breezy picture that, despite its gradual descent into cliché, is bolstered by Knightley and a bevy of other strong performances.
Director Lynn Shelton’s films are quiet, often humorous meditations on human connection, dissecting and celebrating the inherent complexity and protean nature of relationships. Her critically acclaimed past efforts, including “Humpday” and “Your Sister’s Sister,” possess improv-heavy scripts and minimalistic performances that elevate their realism. However, “Laggies,” Shelton’s sixth film, differs in one aspect: not only is this the first movie Shelton didn’t write, but it’s also novelist Andrea Seigel’s first attempt at penning a screenplay. The results are mixed: while “Laggies” retains a number of typical Shelton motifs—a Pacific Northwest setting, subdued cinematography, and, to Seigel’s credit, strikingly natural dialogue—the film gradually relinquishes Shelton’s singular voice for a more universal, trite story. The events of the entire second half of the film are, for the most part, unsurprising, and they occasionally verge on schmaltzy: at its nadir, “Laggies” could pass for a mediocre Disney Channel Original Movie, a far cry from Shelton’s trademark indie edge.
Luckily for “Laggies,” Keira Knightley’s captivating performance buoys the film, preventing it from drowning in predictability. Having gained both credibility and a myriad of awards playing posh nobility (“The Duchess,” “Anna Karenina”), it’s refreshing to watch Knightley perfectly capture characters at the opposite end of the spectrum: puckish ingénues, both here and in last year’s “Begin Again.” The film serves as a testament to Knightley’s unexpected range as an actress, a vehicle for her infectious charm. As Megan, a flurry of bony limbs and facial expressions conveying a wealth of emotion, she oozes charisma. From nonchalantly twisting the nipples of a Buddha statue to attempting to feed a tortoise presumed to have an eating disorder, Knightley unabashedly throws herself into the character and embraces her idiosyncrasies, and it’s a pleasure to watch.
Moretz uses her full capabilities as an actress to play Annika. Granted, she has essentially three acting techniques—satisfied grunt, concerned grunt, and snarl—so the performance is passable at best. However, she develops an easy rapport with Knightley early on, and their friendly dynamic renders the film infinitely more watchable. And the always reliable Sam Rockwell doesn’t disappoint; he manages to craft a character who is simultaneously cynical, defeated, and utterly endearing. Knightley and Rockwell possess an undeniable chemistry, and though Shelton’s reliance on typical rom-com ploys renders the trajectory of their budding relationship frustratingly predictable, the palpable tension between the two keeps the audience engaged.
Throughout the film, Megan frets over whether she’s “floating”—that her latent fear of straying from the familiar inhibits her from taking control of her own life. By the film’s conclusion, however, it’s clear Megan grounds herself—at least partially—in reality, musing, “You can’t keep putting aside what you want for some imaginary future; you just got to go with your gut.” Unlike its protagonist, “Laggies” has a clear direction from its shaky home-video opening and is perfectly content with another sort of “floating.” From scenes still rich with untapped comedic potential to a final third packed with ephemeral conflicts that resolve themselves within minutes, “Laggies” skims over several opportunities to delve deeper into the material and form insights in an original manner. Though this relative shallowness occasionally disappoints, the film deserves credit for fully embracing its own whimsy. Like Megan herself, “Laggies” has clear flaws and bears them with pride.

If you were able to effortlessly shrug off any sense of guilt or empathy, how far could you go? “Thrillingly and illegally far” is the answer according to “Nightcrawler,” the directorial debut of Dan Gilroy, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. “Nightcrawler” depicts the early career arc of Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal), who lives alone in a small apartment in Los Angeles and makes a living by selling stolen construction hardware on the black market. This “career” changes when Lou witnesses some self-employed videographers filming the aftermath of a fiery car crash. Entranced, he quickly and efficiently learns the tricks of their trade, pawning a stolen bike to get an amateur video camera. Lou seems borderline sociopathic; he is ruthless, cutthroat, and enterprising, wiggling his way into the news industry and manipulating every character he meets.
The “crime thriller” aspect of the film comes from Lou’s quick development into the type of video freelancer who will do absolutely anything to obtain the most incredible, graphic footage for his employer Nina (Rene Russo). Nina manages one of the less popular news networks for L.A., and finds herself increasingly dependent on the manipulative Lou. Elements of voyeurism emerge as Lou deals clinically with the victims of terrible city crimes and accidents. His composure is downright uncomfortable—no human should be as comfortable as he is with the violent and graphic nature of his job. His absolute disregard for his own safety and the comfort of others creates a number of situations where the tension simply skyrockets. In one scene, Lou gets to the accident before the police arrive. In the interest of achieving the perfect framing, he pulls the body of the injured driver around to the front of the car as if the man is but an object for his art. The frenzied expression that contorts his face as he continues to film is one of almost masturbatory pleasure. It is clear that, in addition to the money, he adores the power he feels as the cinematographer of this violent scene.
Jake Gyllenhaal’s performance is absolutely enthralling. He reportedly lost over 20 pounds for the role, growing his hair out long and greasy. There is something incredibly disturbing in the way his eyes communicate a sociopathic intensity. The script contributed to his performance in scenes where Gyllenhaal could use precise articulation and a sense of energetic drive to demonstrate Lou’s intensity. His varying personality, which he alters for each confrontation with another character, demonstrates his instability. At one point, when Lou makes a cloying, faux-inspirational pitch to Nina in an attempt to obtain a more secure job, the audience feels compelled to laugh and jeer—he seems utterly ridiculous. In another scene, however, when Lou makes calculated sexual advances on Nina, the audience feels that same sense of humor, but with a darker underbelly. The connection the viewer feels with Lou—spellbound yet fearful, excited yet disapproving—is electric, and complicated by moral quandaries.
Riz Ahmed’s performance as Rick, Lou’s hired driver, is also of note. He plays the foil to Lou, the empathetic yet desperate counterpart who constantly voices the audience’s rational reactions. Though Lou needs him to drive the car to each accident location, Rick is not entirely on board with Lou’s dedication to the work. But he needs the money. Whenever Lou proposes an incredibly dangerous plan, Rick reacts both authentically and humorously, resisting Lou’s detachment and revealing him to be not quite normal. “You’re crazy!” he repeats at various points in the script, a declaration that most of the audience probably thinks at one point or another. In response, Lou both acknowledges Rick’s point and remains unfazed by it. He seems to not know fear: “Get out of your mind, Rick. It’s not a good neighborhood to be in.”
The musical score, by James Newton Howard, does not shine as brightly as the film’s other components. At certain tense points in the beginning of the film, the music feels awkwardly optimistic, most likely intended to create sympathy for Lou. As the film progresses, however, the score improves—and the music for the climax parallels the tone of the narrative.
As Dan Gilroy’s directorial debut, the film is a strong showing. The raw acting of Gyllenhaal combines with cinematography that captures Lou’s gritty world without becoming monotonous. The movie’s publicity tagline summarizes Lou’s story quite well: “The closer you look the darker it gets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the years since “Harry Potter,” Daniel Radcliffe has been on a mission to establish himself as a versatile, “real” actor. He’s stripped naked for the provocative play “Equus,” starred in the horror movie “The Woman in Black,” and sung in the Broadway musical “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” His new film, “Horns,” continues this sense of departure and boundary-pushing: Radcliffe plays a young man who sprouts satanic horns after the murder of his lifelong girlfriend. It’s an adult part in a definitively grown-up movie; it’s also complex, requiring him to pull off dark humor, rage, viciousness, and tenderness all at once. Radcliffe executes his character nicely, though, and despite the bizarre premise, the movie is generally successful. Equal parts romance, mystery, horror, and camp, “Horns” is an original and intriguing piece of work, containing only minor flaws.
In terms of basic plot, the movie adheres closely to its source material, a 2010 novel by Joe Hill. Ig Parrish, the protagonist, lives in a small town with his family and girlfriend, Merrin (played with requisite incandescence by Juno Temple). Merrin disappears, though, and when she is discovered murdered, Ig quickly becomes the town’s prime suspect. As he struggles to clear his name, he inexplicably begins to sprout horns. Initially distracted by the pain and shame they cause him, Ig eventually realizes that they come with the power to control those around him. In his presence, people give in to their wildest impulses, shoveling donuts in their mouths or confessing desires to abandon their children. He then decides to use this power to help him track down Merrin’s killer and discover the truth.
What could easily have devolved into a silly mess instead comes off as a wry fable about the potential for good and evil in everyone. Partly, it owes it success to a script that cleverly portrays the little vicious impulses underlying everyday life: we see a mother long to be rid of her screaming child, a doctor vent his frustration about the one-sided nature of his profession, and a waitress rhapsodize about getting famous via sex tape. It’s sharp satire. The gleefully blasphemous script also riffs on religion without becoming too tame or too unsettling. Most importantly, though, director Alexandre Aja handles different tonal elements with ease and skill. Just when a scene of grotesque horror verges on too much, it gets undercut by a moment of incisive humor. In a particularly memorable instance, Ig watches with terror as a crowd of enormous snakes emerges at his feet. To cope, he quickly grabs a pitchfork, making for a great, brief sight gag. Longer, darker segments are also usually paired with sweet, romantic ones, to mutual effect; the genuinely touching chemistry between Ig and Merrin relieves some of the grimness, while injecting a conventional murder mystery with some pathos.
The mood shifts work because they occur subtly and rapidly, creating a kind of tonal mosaic. Just when one mode becomes familiar, another kicks in, keeping the film surprising and consistent. It also helps that the film’s aesthetics are gorgeous. The special effects are excellent—the horns, and everything that comes with them, ends up being impressively believable. The movie is also packed with lush shots of Pacific Northwest forests and water in a way that recalls “Twilight,” either accidentally or jokingly on purpose. Every scene is expressively framed in sleek, rich colors, and the latter half of the film uses lighting particularly well. After Ig embraces his status as emerging-devil-incarnate, everything becomes bathed in some sort of red glow—neon diner lights, lamps, flames. It’s beautiful, and it reinforces the kind of subtle campiness that permeates the movie.
This latter section of the movie, however, is where flaws begin to emerge. The tone shifts become harder to maintain: camp escalates in an attempt to moderate the increasing violence, but the primary result is that both elements become hard to buy in to. The final revelation of the murder scene edges past splashy gore and into the territory of deeply unsettling and hard-to-watch. The camp likewise changes from subtle to absurd, taking some of the gravity out of the climax—which, incidentally, occurs far too late. It takes the movie several false-alarm endings to come to a close, and it feels long for a two-hour running time.
Daniel Radcliffe is also much better in the first half of the film. As a ragged, grieving, good-hearted man, he’s successful—less so when he’s asked to project an aura of dark, sadistic power. Radcliffe is talented and plenty versatile beyond his Harry Potter role, but he isn’t really much of a villain/anti-hero. Still, he remains compelling enough to anchor the movie, keeping it plenty watchable and frequently engaging.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I began teaching classes, I was lucky enough to have unusually small sections: usually under 10 students. My experience, consequently, was dynamic, and as a teacher, I was able to get to know my students personally.
Our interactions went well beyond the particular focus of the course: I assisted one junior who was struggling to frame his senior thesis topic, and worked closely with freshmen and sophomores to improve their writing. As for the students, a small section size pushed them to constructively participate in discussion—they all had a clear stake in the momentum of the classroom conversation. And they left our courses as far sharper students.
But in later years, I taught larger sections, ranging from 13 to 17 students. While I had many excellent students, the larger classroom size led to a clear deterioration of both the learning and teaching experience. In large sections, it is far easier for a few select students to dominate discussion while the rest slip into anonymity.
And it is far more difficult for me, as a teaching fellow, to fulfill my responsibilities of giving my students the time, attention, and feedback that they deserve. As section size increases, the classroom dynamic steadily begins resembling that of a large lecture course.
There is much talk about the “Harvard experience.” For undergraduates, socializing, networking, athletics, community service, and campus organizations are important components. But let us not forget that classroom education is the bedrock of this experience. It is the reason why students come to Harvard in the first place.
Smaller section size, as campaigned for by my peers, is an important component of the solution. But the other, oft-neglected component is improving conditions for the graduate students who teach.
As a Ph.D. candidate here, I am well aware that I am privy to far more support and resources than my peers at other institutions, and I am deeply grateful for it.
Nevertheless, simple comparison elides the fact that overall conditions—at Harvard and peer institutions—could be much better. Large sections compromise our ability to be good researchers as well as good teachers. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to complete substantial work on our dissertations while earning our pay as teaching fellows—and our salaries do not reflect the additional teaching burden we face. This, of course, ends up lengthening our graduate careers.
There are many other factors that deleteriously impact our ability to teach and do research. GSAS guarantees teaching for G-3s and G-4s, which is commendable. Yet, these are precisely the years where many of us, at least in the humanities, are off campus conducting research. I faced great difficulty securing teaching assignments after I returned from my research abroad. As a recent Graduate Student Council survey indicates, many of us have not receive our paychecks on time.
For me, there were a few times where, due to paycheck delays, I have had to dip into my meager savings in order to pay rent.
This problem is aggravated by the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult for graduate students to live around campus as rents in Cambridge and Somerville continue to soar. Other universities located in cities with high costs of living, such as Columbia University, offer their graduate students subsidized housing.
Speaking as a former resident, I can testify that Harvard’s graduate student housing stock is, quite frankly, too small and too expensive. I know few graduate students who can afford a studio at One Western Ave., which can cost as much as $1,914 per month, or a studio in Peabody Terrace, which now goes for anywhere between $1,414 to $1,812 a month. At my current yearly salary of $26,020 (accounting for tuition waiver), I could have as little as $356 per month for food, transportation, and other essentials after paying rent for such a studio. This does not make for productive students or effective teachers.
We TFs take our work responsibilities seriously: We are committed toward maintaining Harvard’s academic excellence. But, quite often, we feel let down by the administration.
Last semester, I taught for one professor who was deeply committed to undergraduate teaching. After the Office of Undergraduate Education tried cutting a section from our large lecture—which would have put 18 students in each—our professor had to fight in order to retain the one additional section. This additional section cost Harvard a trifling amount, provided financial support to a deserving graduate student and—most importantly—gave all of our undergraduate students a far superior learning experience.
Such experiences sap the morale of undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. Harvard should, and can, do better.

Describe an environment in which you feel content. Recount a moment of failure in your life and explain what you learned from it. Share something about your background or family that you feel is central to your identity.
Most students at Harvard—or at over 500 other schools across the country—began the road to college with a prompt like these. The essay is the centerpiece of the Common Application, the product of a membership organization that seeks to simplify the college application process by providing a uniform platform for students to share their accomplishments and ambitions. But Harvard and many peers—calling themselves the “Coalition”—are questioning the Common App’s success. They have proposed a new application, one that in their eyes will promote fairer review of students from a wider range of backgrounds.
The goals underlying the alternative application are noble ones.
For one thing, this call for change follows the Common Application’s decision to open its doors to universities that do not conduct a holistic review of applicants. But the best, most just way to make admissions decisions is to consider all aspects of an applicant,  the "holistic" approach. The Common App’s questions were originally designed to facilitate that full, fair review—and the application no longer serves that purpose if it abandons that ambition.
The Coalition is also right to take issue with technological issues with the Common App that have complicated the application. The Coalition seeks to make it easier for students to upload aspects of their portfolios like sound and video clips, and to add and save information before submission. A functional technological interface is essential in an age when many students, some with less than perfect Internet access, apply to college exclusively online. What’s more, increased opportunity to upload content online contributes to the concept of a holistic review by allowing applicants to share their strong suits—besides test scores and grades—with admissions committees.
Finally, the Coalition plans only to include among its ranks institutions that have committed to providing substantial financial aid and to conducting equally substantial outreach to lower-income students. This vision—which will encourage schools that seek entrance to the Coalition to amp up aid and outreach—will aid in cultivating truly diverse communities in schools nationwide.
Of course, this proposal is in its early stages, and we look forward to more specificity around how these schools will achieve their worthy goals. If the concrete steps fall short of their aims, adding this application might result in an unwelcome burden, with some students filling out the same information in different places. Still, because Harvard and its peers will still accept the original Common Application, it will remain up to students which application to complete. For Harvard at least, students will be able to select the form they feel best communicates their abilities and identities. The goal of more choice and comfort for more students is one worth seeking.

UPDATED: November 11, 2014, at 2:50 p.m.
The reports of the demise of the Republican Party were greatly exaggerated.
Republicans swept races at every level of government in the 2014 midterm elections, capturing seven Senate seats, increasing their margin by 10 in the House of Representatives, and picking up four new governor’s mansions in Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Maryland. Now, they also control a full two-thirds of state legislatures in the country, with 24 states governed entirely by Republicans and only seven under total Democratic rule. The outcomes of two Senate races and several House contests remain unsettled. Nonetheless, this was a wave election in every sense of the word.
But the murmurs have already begun among the liberal pundits. As their logic goes, the Republicans didn’t really win the 2014 midterms because they cheated. How? By instituting restrictive voter ID laws in conservative states in order to keep minorities and the poor away from the ballot-box. This would be a fine explanation—if results from exit polling actually backed it up.
Let’s look at North Carolina, home to the author, as well as the most expensive Senate race in American history. North Carolina passed a voter ID law in 2013, prompting outrage from the left. Several pundits have already credited this law with ensuring Thom Tillis’ victory. There is only one problem: The law does not take effect until 2016.
This year when voters arrived at the polls they were asked the question, “Do you have an official form of photo identification?” If the voter answered yes, he was handed a ballot and sent on his way without having to offer proof. If he answered no, he was provided with an informational pamphlet detailing how to obtain a free state-issued ID in the two years before the 2016 election and—get this—then handed his ballot and allowed to vote. Nobody was turned away from the polls this year in North Carolina by the voter ID law passed in 2013.
According to exit polls, black voters constituted 21 percent of the electorate in this year’s Senate election. That number is extremely close to the actual percentage of residents who are black in the state of North Carolina, which is 22 percent according to 2010 Census Bureau data. Tillis did not win because of disenfranchisement; in fact, 2014 turnout was slightly higher than turnout in 2010. He won because of widespread discontent with the Obama administration, and because Hagan did not share that sentiment.
If one is still skeptical that Republicans can succeed without voter ID, let us now examine a state that went in the opposite direction. Colorado mailed every registered voter a ballot for the first time this year, in an effort to ensure widespread participation in the democratic process. Under the prevailing assumption that higher turnout aids Democratic candidates, this procedure should have saved Senator Mark Udall from defeat. Instead, Republican Representative Cory Gardner won by a 2.5 percent margin. He achieved this even with a slight increase in turnout over the 2010 midterms, with 52.4 percent of registered Colorado voters participating this year.
Still unconvinced? Maybe you believe that Democratic voters simply had less of a reason to turn out in force this year? Perhaps one of the most polarized states in the nation will change your mind. There is no Republican governor in the country more despised by the left than Scott Walker of Wisconsin. In 2012, after a single year in office dominated by public battles with unions, Walker was recalled–and won the election with 53 percent of the vote in a blue state. This year, he held fast with his earlier total, winning 52.5 percent with a margin of six percentage points over his opponent Mary Burke. All this in a year with 56 percent turnout of the voting age public in Wisconsin, the highest for a midterm in 60 years.
None of this means that Republicans should not be working to improve their margins among minority voters. The highest percentage of African-American voters captured by any statewide Republican candidate this year was 10 percent for Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, who engaged with black voters by touting his reform of the state criminal justice system. It is downright pathetic that hitting double digits now counts as an accomplishment.
That being said, we should combat the misinformation regarding recent measures intended to cut down on voter fraud. As the books close on the 2014 elections, the proof is in the data: Republicans did not win because they depressed turnout. They won because in this election, voters considered two sets of opposing policies and chose the set that has gathered dust on the top shelf for the last eight years. Let us hope that it makes a difference.

Completion of the Harvard Square Tunnel has been delayed by a few more weeks due to weather, according to Commissioner of the Cambridge Department of Public Works Owen O’Riordan. This follows an initial construction complication that first delayed the completion of the project by one year.
According to the Cambridge Department of Public Works website, the city began the reconstruction project in order to improve the structural conditions of the tunnel at the northern end of Harvard Yard.
The construction of the Harvard Square Tunnel, also referred to as the Cambridge Street Underpass, began in Oct. 2012 and was supposed to be completed in the fall of 2013. The project was delayed last fall, however, because of difficulties with the concrete that required it to be reset.
“The concrete product that was placed last year on the floor of the tunnel didn’t bond properly. We needed to have it replaced again,” O’Riordan said.
Although the Cambridge Department of Public Works expected the concrete to be replaced and the project to be completed by Oct. 2014, the completion of the project has now been delayed further as a result of weather impediments like rain.
“We had some wet weather when we were pouring some concrete, which set us back," O'Riordan said.
According to O’Riordan, the majority of the work is now complete and what remains to be done is some asphalt work on both sides of the tunnel, anticipated to take a couple of weeks. He expects the project will be completed by the end of this month.

Researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute have discovered a possible new method to remove from blood stem cells the biological receptor that helps host the HIV virus, marking a potential breakthrough towards combating or even curing HIV/AIDS.
Inspired by the treatment of Timothy Ray Brown, the only person thought to be cured of HIV, researchers Chad Cowan and Derrick J. Rossi targeted a receptor—the CCR5—on blood-making cells that aid the progression of HIV.
“HIV uses the CCR5 receptor to enter T-cells,” Rossi said. He said that he and his colleagues felt comfortable isolating the receptor because “it is known that the stem cells can function well without CCR5.”
Cowan said that if the genome manipulation he and Rossi executed in the lab can be replicated, it may be able to mirror the treatment given to ex-HIV patient Brown.
“If successful, the gene therapy treatment we propose might accomplish the same thing as the transplant of cells into Timothy Ray Brown, only better because it would be the patient’s own cells that would be made resistant to HIV and then transplanted back to ‘cure’ them of AIDS,” he said.
Rossi said that a major benefit of modifying the patients’ own stem cells is the fact that they are guaranteed matches.
“You have to have very specific matches,” he said.
Cowan and Rossi, both professors in the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department, piloted the effort. They said they were cautiously optimistic that, if it survives years of human and animal trials, the advance could one day help cure the deadly virus.
According to a press release from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the researchers think that their work could be ready for human trials in about five years and perhaps sooner.
The method has “a lot of hope,” Rossi said. He added, though, that HIV is extremely complex.
“You have to bear in mind of course, that there are other tropisms for HIV,” he said. “There is still more to be done.”

To celebrate the ancient Hindu festival of Diwali, Harvard University Dining Services served students an array of Indian food for dinner Monday—a twist on standard dining options in honor of the "festival of lights."
Christian J. Floyd ’18 said that the food was a “nice change of pace from the normal Annenberg fare.”
In collaboration with Monsoon Kitchens, a local Indian restaurant, HUDS offered a menu which included classic dishes such as a rice cake named idli, lentil-based dal makhani, tandoori salmon, and butter chicken.
“We've had Diwali [dinners] periodically over the last several years,” said Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications. “Indian food has been a rising food trend, so it originally came to our menus some years ago at student request, and it remains some of our most popular menu items.”
According to Martin, the food was cooked by the dining hall staff. She said her favorite part of the tradition is helping students celebrate the many cultures on campus.
Students gave the culinary experiment mostly positive reviews; in particular, many were fond of papadum, a thin, crisp disc of oil-fried flour and rice.
Kimberley Yu ’17 of Adams House said that she appreciated that HUDS was serving international cuisines.
“I really like Indian food in general, so it is nice to see that [HUDS] is trying out diverse cuisines,” agreed Michelle A. Chang ’15 of Dunster House.
“It was a pleasant surprise,” said Currier resident Joyce C. Zhou ’17. “I really enjoyed the dinner.”
Both Yu and Zhou said they loved the “thin, flat thing.” They were not alone.
“The food was great. I especially liked the thin, round rice cakes,” said Emma R. Payne ’16 of Dunster House.

“It’s terrible—neck pain, shoulders, my eyes get tired, pretty much everything you can think of,” Masahiro L. Kusunoki ’17 said, describing the physical pain he has been dealing with since his freshman year at Harvard.
Long hours of working over his computer and carrying heavy books in his backpack has strained multiple parts of Kusunoki’s body, though he has no diagnosed chronic condition. During his freshman year, Kusunoki said, he experienced insomnia and often slept only three hours a night—a condition he said only started when he arrived at Harvard.
While Kusunoki’s experience may not be representative of the entire student body, it sheds light on the physical cost that can come with studying at an institution like Harvard.
Although much attention has been paid to stress-related mental health, the University has also made great efforts in recent years to bolster physical wellness resources. But while students applaud the changes, they continue to struggle to fit them into a life filled less with sleepless nights and more with a constant buzz of anxiety—an  indicator, student activists say, of the need for a broader cultural shift spearheaded by the student body itself.
SLEEP AND EXERCISE
According to the 2014 Harvard University Health Services Health Assessment—a comprehensive survey with more than 2,000 student respondents administered last spring—64 percent of respondents rated their overall physical health as “very good or “excellent” and 70 percent indicated that a physical health issue has never or almost never had a negative impact on their academic performance.
However, Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira said that students’ perceptions may not accurately reflect their physical wellness. This may be indicated by lifestyle habits such as sleeping, eating, or exercise—all of which can positively or negatively affect the health status of the students, Barreira said.
The survey results showed that 10 percent of respondents reported getting less than six hours of sleep on a school night, while two-thirds indicated they sleep for six to seven hours. Although Harvard students may be getting more sleep than the popular campus image of “Lamonsters”—students who toil away all night in Harvard’s only 24-hour library—suggests, they may still be regularly sleeping less than scientists suggest is optimal.
“Sleep deprivation” for the college age group has been defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as getting less than seven hours of sleep. By this standard, more than 70 percent of respondents would be categorized as “sleep-deprived”—a condition that can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression, scientists have found.
“I know students say ‘I’m healthy,’ but they are also getting only seven or less hours of sleep,” Bareirra said. “If [UHS] were going to name one general health concern, we would say sleep deprivation.”
The survey also reveals that students may not be balancing other aspects of their physical health at Harvard, such as exercise. Only 30 percent of  respondents met the national guidelines for recommended weekly physical exertion, though Barreira said the data suggested that Harvard students’ level of physical activity is not dramatically different from that of the college age group nationally.
Barreira added that students who structure their lives so as to maintain healthy habits generally report less stress or are better able to cope with their stress—another dimension of student life with implications for physical wellness that administrators said they are monitoring.
“Oftentimes there are threads between [mental health and physical health],” said Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, whose office conducted an assessment of student stress last year.
According to a study conducted by the Freshman Dean’s Office, 86 percent of last year’s freshman reported significant stress from academic challenges. Sixty-seven percent reported challenges related to time management, and an increasing number said they experienced stress from extracurricular activities. Other reported causes of stress included searching for summer opportunities and social relationships.
The FDO’s results are in line with the findings of the Workgroup on Student Stress, which concluded in its 2013 report that student stress had four primary causes: time pressure, academic and extracurricular competition, identity and belonging, and managing digital media.
Dingman noted that extracurricular activities, instead of relieving student stress, have increasingly contributed to higher stress levels in recent years.
“It used to be that people did their extracurricular activities as a way to recharge their batteries, and feel some unencumbered pleasure,” Dingman said. “Now, a number put their extracurricular activities with their ‘should list.’”
With stress permeating an increasing number of aspects of student life, sleeping and exercising habits that are less than optimal leave students poorly equipped to cope with stress and maintain their physical health, administrators say.
HARVARD HAS YOUR BACK
Acknowledging the link between stress and physical wellness, Harvard administrators and staff point to a number of existing and developing initiatives meant for students seeking to alleviate their stress.
Barreira cited the Workgroup on Student Stress as a product of growing awareness of a connection between stress, mental health, and physical wellness. The group made several recommendations, one of which was recently realized with the opening of the Serenity Room for freshmen in the basement of Grays Hall.
While Dingman said he thinks the College has greatly strengthened its mental health resources in recent years, he added that it still needs to improve its physical health resources, particularly in encouraging its students to look after their physical health.
Although there have been some discussions among administrators of re-instituting a physical activity requirement for students, Dingman said, he believes the College should work to encourage rather than mandate students to get exercise.
Perhaps the most prominent example of an institutional resource that encourages students to prioritize physical wellness is the Center of Wellness at UHS, where students can get discounted hour-long massage or acupuncture appointments with a professional therapist. The Center also offers yoga classes and free meditation sessions. According to Director of Center for Wellness Jeanne Mahon, undergraduate students had more than 1,300 massage and acupuncture appointments during the 2013-2014 academic year.
The College also provides the freshman class and each upperclassman house with wellness tutors or proctors, who plan events to promote healthy living for their community. According to Kirkland wellness tutors Kelly P. Brock and Rory B. Lindsay, while the Center of Wellness coordinates trainings and assists tutors in scheduling some events, services vary from house to house because tutors are autonomous, planning everything from a puppy study break to Buddhist meditation based on resources and personal interests.
“[House administrators] are thinking about how to create calm spaces—how do you help students manage stress more effectively, as well as helping them change their habits?” Barreira said.
TOO STRESSED TO DE-STRESS?
While the 12 students interviewed for this article said they were aware of the resources that Harvard provides, most had not taken advantage of them—a state of affairs student wellness activists said indicates a need for broader cultural changes on campus regarding stress.
One student said that she is too busy to de-stress, questioning whether the College’s wellness programs would be an effective use of time for Harvard students caught in “a culture of continuous competition.”
“I do know about [the resources]. I’ve never actually taken advantage of them,” said Leila Y. Islam ’15. “[Getting a massage] takes up a lot of time. I’d rather take that time to do my work.”
Islam’s statement is representative of a broader lack of motivation for students to utilize these resources. Some said they heard about wellness resources in general terms from Harvard’s advertisements, but none of their close friends have made use of these resources, making them hesitant to seek them out.
“I’ve been informed [of the stress resources], but not well enough that I’d feel comfortable using them,” said Natasha H. Sarna ’18. “In the practical sense, I can’t see myself ever using it.”
According to student activists, that reluctance to seek out University initiatives places greater responsibility on student groups, who can not only offer resources to students in a friendlier manner, but can also help shift the culture on campus so that students will prioritize their own health.
Mimi Yen ’16 is the organizer of Stressbusters, a group of around 15 students who give free backrubs to fellow students. According to Yen, all Stressbusters have gone through a training process at the Center for Wellness, and their mission is to create “deliberate moments of calm.”
“There’s a culture here that says: if you’re not working, you are not being productive and therefore you are wasting your time here,” Yen said. “We should promote a culture that says: it’s okay to take a break. That’s something Stressbusters strives to do.”
Administrators also acknowledge the need for a cultural shift, a transformation that they say students can help to catalyze, while staff and faculty continue to act in support.
“I believe it is possible for Harvard students to maintain a high level of physical wellness, said Ryan M. Travia, director of health promotion and prevention services at UHS. “It requires some effort and for some, an altering of the mindset to prioritize things like sleep, exercise, and a healthy diet in order to ensure optimal health and peak performance both in and out the classroom.”
Dingman agrees.
“I think our role as advisors is to keep asking questions of the care people take of themselves,” Dingman said, noting that administrators should support students’ efforts to adopt healthier habits, rather than imposing changes from above.
Though his symptoms have not disappeared, Kusunoki, who as a freshman had experienced a great deal of physical repercussions for his work and sleep schedule, said he has been slowly making adjustments in his sophomore year. He now visits spas, sleeps the full night, regularly frequents the gym, and takes breaks from campus.
“I feel so much better when I wake up,” he said. “I’m putting my own well-being over my academics.”

The Cambridge City Council approved a six-month pilot program for Bridj, a transportation startup, on Monday night. The Council granted the company, which has already conducted limited beta testing in and around Boston, a jitney license, allowing it to operate within city limits.
City Manager Richard C. Rossi and his team worked with the Cambridge License Commission to put Bridj’s application on the Council agenda. The company, which brands itself as a smart transit system that uses big data to produce flexible bus routes, will be monitored by the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department during its evaluation period.
Several council members praised Bridj, hoping that it could provide much needed innovation for transportation in the city. Mayor David P. Maher, although uncertain of the ultimate outcome of the pilot program, noted the potential for progress that Bridj could offer.
“I think that there is an opportunity here. None of us know where it will all go in the future,” Maher said. “But it’s rather exciting.”
According to Bridj’s website, the company will offer comfortable and affordable bus service in the city, using information about where individuals live and work to best design speedy routes. Currently, the service is only available in the Boston area.
While most Councillors embraced the new technology, some had worries about its accessibility to all Cambridge residents. Citing the fact that Bridj utilizes smartphone technology, Councillor Craig A. Kelley argued that the council should not forget the needs of certain residents.
“Not everyone has a smartphone, and we want to make sure that we don’t leave those people behind,” Kelley said.
Similarly, Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan asked the city manager and his staff to consider offering reduced fare rates for seniors and disabled citizens, for whom Bridj might be more difficult to access.
According to the memorandum of understanding submitted by Bridj to the Council, its mission is to “increase mobility for every urban resident by: connecting neighborhoods to jobs that would otherwise be out of reach...providing Bostonians and Cantabrigians with a convenient, environmentally sustainable and affordable alternative to driving in the city and alleviating the peak demand stress on public transit infrastructure.”
Following the addition of an amendment to the policy order regarding proof of commercial auto insurance, Bridj’s application was adopted.
After the six-month period, Bridj will be evaluated for its long-term presence in terms of its safety, noise and visual disturbance, impact on MBTA bus stop congestion, and interference with cyclists and pedestrians among other criteria.

Drawing from first-hand research, professor Vikram C. Bhatt discussed urbanization in India on Monday evening at the Center for Government and International Studies, advocating for a more innovative, cost-effective design strategy.
The lecture, sponsored by the South Asia Institute and India GSD, focused on concerns about urban design and the suggestion that certain aspects of the design of slums can be more efficient than planned housing.
Bhatt cited growing urban populations in India as a serious problem that has necessitated a unique design approach.“Governments must understand [that] the broad urban landscape of India has turned into slums,” he said.
A professor of architecture at McGill University, Bhatt argued that the traditional approach to low-income housing projects is too theoretical and overlooks the basic question of how inhabitants actually use space. In offering an alternative solution, Bhatt introduced the concept of a "jugaad" city. The term refers to innovative design hacks that solve technical problems with limited resources.
“They are very nimble, these groups of people,” Bhatt said. “An urban landscape is a mix of all these strands.”
In the 1980s, Bhatt studied informal settlements around India, comparing the use of space in slums and planned cities. Assessing landscapes, house extensions, workplaces, and commercial areas revealed the weaknesses of traditional urban planning.
Bhatt noticed, for instance, that the slum communities often planted trees.
“A coconut tree which gives you twenty-five coconuts in a thirty-day cycle…[is] a great contribution to someone who is earning a dollar a day,” Bhatt said.
He also analyzed the use of stoops and porches as literal extensions of the house. Like with trees, most low-income housing developments fail to incorporate porches or stoops, with some considering them unnecessary luxuries.
In slums, these extensions “host a whole variety of domestic activities: washing, sleeping, [and] storing domestic materials,” Bhatt said.
Bhatt suggested that using "jugaad" strategies would make future urban developments more cost-effective.
With India’s population at more than 1.2 billion people and its urban slums growing every year, he said his research is more relevant than ever before.
“Professionally, politically, from the business point of view, the opportunity is very much there…to arrive at a more positive solution,” Bhatt said.
Tzyy H. Yeh, a GSD student who attended the talk, also said that slums are "not just housing."
“[Slums are] a kind of non-professional housing, an understanding of space,” Yeh said.

Michael J. Landry ’16 and Connor M. Harris ’16 dropped out of the Undergraduate Council presidential race Monday night, following a conversation with Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the vice presidential candidate of a competing ticket.
Landry and Harris, who say they are friends with Goyal, made clear they did not feel forced out of the race, but rather that their conversation with Goyal rekindled skepticism they already had about their chances of winning and their ability to effectively lead the Council if elected. Neither Landry nor Harris have served on the Council, making theirs the only ticket without a UC veteran.
The pair officially dropped out of the race Monday night, UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18 confirmed. The development leaves four tickets competing for the Council’s top spots.
Prompted on why his ticket dropped out, Landry first quipped that “it had a lot to do with Dhruv talking to us and not wanting us to screw up the vote.”
Goyal originally declined to comment on whether he spoke with Harris and Landry, citing a personal policy against commenting on other candidates. In an interview afterwards, however, he described Harris and Landry as his friends and said any possible conversations regarding the election that may have already or will occur are “purely informational.”
Harris and Landry, who had garnered the signatures required to be placed on the ballot in just a day, said Monday that they were originally skeptical about running and agreed that their conversation with Goyal cemented already existing doubts.
Harris said he and Landry have never served on the UC and may not understand the institutional procedures.
“We thought about seeing it through, and that was our plan until we realized it was a bad idea,” Landry said.
Harris added that the pair may have been “the Ralph Naders of the campaign, in the sense that people who voted for us might just be throwing away their votes, and it would distort the rest of the process.”
Landry said that in most cases, he would consider a competitor discussing another candidate’s prospects of winning as inappropriate, but that this case was an exception. Both reiterated that they were not forced out of the race, and said that Goyal, along with his running mate Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, may incorporate some of their ideas, which were to include General Education reform and greater handicapped accessibility in their platform.
Harris said he had originally agreed to support the Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal ticket, and plans to do so.

It was a great weekend on the water for the No. 9 Harvard coed sailing team. The Crimson competed in three regattas over both days and finished in the top two spots for two of the three events. It was a final tune-up before Harvard prepares for its last week of sailing next week with the Atlantic Coast Championship.
HAP MOORE TROPHY TEAM RACE
Harvard’s strongest performance of the weekend occurred at the Hap Moore Trophy regatta, where the team finished in first place out of 12 boats that raced.
The regatta was in the form of team racing, which junior captain Andrew Mollerus explains is not the primary style of sailing in the fall.
“As a result, few schools put more than a week or so of team racing prep in before the event,” he said. “We as well as many of the other teams were somewhat rusty coming into the weekend.”
The Crimson finished with an 11-3 record for the weekend. Boston College and Tufts University followed right behind in second and third place.
“Overall, this was a great weekend for Harvard sailing,” junior Jacob Bradt said. “While it certainly was not the toughest team race regatta of the year, I definitely think that, as a team, we are leaps and bounds above where we were with respect to our team racing abilities as of this time last year.”
Bradt believes that the biggest weakness for his team this weekend was in its race starts. His teammates see potential for growth in other ways.
“Our team struggled to sail the boats as fast as we could while thinking about how to beat our competitors, which we have diagnosed and will emphasize in upcoming practices,” senior Brian Drumm said.
Drumm and Mollerus were joined by seniors Michael Drumm and Gram Slattery, and junior Marek Zaleski as skippers in this regatta. The crews for Harvard were Bradt, junior captain Sydney Karnovsky, sophomore Emma Wheeler, and freshman Kevin Coakley.
“Everyone did a great job of adjusting to new conditions and situations that came up during racing,” Coakley said. “We had 5 skippers and 4 crews rotating throughout the regatta, so everyone played different roles on the water at different points over the weekend. It reflects well on our team’s preparation and depth that we were able to be successful regardless of which combination was sailing.”
SISTER ESTHER ANNUAL REGATTA
The wind was shaky all weekend for the sailors down in Narragansett Bay for the Sister Esther Regatta. The Crimson competed against 19 other boats and finished in second place overall.
Sophomores Matthew Mollerus and Olivia Kjorlien finished in fifth place in the A division, while freshman Nick Sertl and sophomore Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj took first place in the B division to round up the final result for the Crimson.
Salve Regina hosted this in-conference regatta which showcased the 420 style of boat. Boston University finished in first place, scoring nine points lower than Harvard.
MIKE HORN TROPHY
The Crimson came in fifth place out of six teams in the Mike Horn Trophy on Saturday. The regatta was hosted by Harvard and took place on the Charles which experienced stable winds and clear skies throughout the day.
Racing was done in a round robin style that included three rounds of 45 races in total. The Crimson finished the day with a record of 3-12.
Junior Sophie Bermudez, sophomore Bennett Capozzi, and freshmen Taylor Ladd and Dylan Farrell were the skippers for the Crimson. Senior Ashleigh Inglis, junior Kristina Jakobson, sophomore Cara Kennedy Cuomo, and freshman Kristin Anderson were the crews for the day.
Boston College took first place with a 13-2 record and Tufts was right behind in second place. The regatta was in the style of team racing with FJs.
“We are always trying to improve at every event,” Coakley said. “We took this weekend as an opportunity to get better at team racing and prepare for the Atlantic Coast Championship next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I walked into Harvard Stadium Saturday expecting not to learn anything about the Crimson football team during its matchup with 0-7 (now 0-8) Columbia. I walked out of the Stadium admitting I had been wrong.
Of course the game was the blowout everyone expected, a 45-0 win only because Harvard (8-0, 5-0 Ivy) did not want to score anymore in the fourth quarter. The Lions still have not scored on the Crimson since 2011 and have won just four games in those four years.
It was the way that the Crimson scored that surprised me, and would have been even more surprising to me at the beginning of the year. It also spoke to this team’s true identity.
Harvard scored three touchdowns on interception returns. Another came on a one-yard drive following a fumble recovery. In total, 28 points on one yard of offense.
The Crimson offense finished with a more-than-respectable 440 yards of offense including a couple long scoring drives, but the team’s defense owned the day. With interception returns of 48 and 49 yards, linebacker Connor Sheehan contributed more yardage than any receiver. And the pass defense netted as many sacks (five) as first downs Harvard’s passing offense earned. I can’t remember seeing a similar box score in either regard.
The post-game press conference brought more firsts. The sports information director introduced the speakers from right to left: Sheehan, Harvard coach Tim Murphy, senior defensive tackle Obum Obukwelu, and junior defensive back Asante Gibson. Defender, coach, defender, defender. I had never been to a press conference lacking offensive representation before, but this one had good reason.
Yes, freshman running back Semar Smith had a nice day on the ground, but Saturday will be remembered as the day Harvard’s defense laid sole claim to this team’s identity. This is the defense’s team now.
Who da thunk it?
Coming into the year, all the big names were on offense--returning quarterback Conner Hempel, Pinball Wizard running back Paul Stanton, NFL prospects Nick Easton and Cole Toner. The defense had Ivy League Player of the Year Zack Hodges and captain Norman Hayes, sure, but those two combined for just one solo tackle after Hodges had an injury scare on the first play of the game.
I bet I could count on one hand the number of times Obukwelu, Sheehan, or Gibson has gotten their name in the paper this year. This team could be the second-coming of the 1972 Dolphins’ “No-Name Defense” except that it’s been even more dominant.
Thanks to Saturday’s shutout, Harvard now leads all 121 FCS teams in scoring defense, giving up 9.4 points per game. That includes multiple touchdowns given up by the second unit at the end of blowouts.
North Dakota State, 33-1 in its last 34 games, is second in the country with 11.5 points per game. No other team has given up less than 14 points per game. And as I mentioned last week, Harvard’s 9.4 average is likely to go down against Penn and it’s 98th ranked offense.
Some of the credit goes to a couple other people who never get mentioned in this spot. Assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99 took increased responsibility this offseason as Murphy took a step back after heart surgery. Larkee, who was also an assistant on the undefeated 2001 team, made sure this young defense did not suffer as a result. Ryan Crawford deserves recognition too for leading an inexperienced defensive backfield to a top-10 passing efficiency rating against thus far. His special teams unit also contributed a blocked punt Saturday.
Those coaches and their players deserve respect for the work they have put in without public recognition thus far. They have earned mention by posting some historic numbers.And they better get your attention because they are two games away from leading the Crimson to its third undefeated, untied season in over 100 years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first outing of the year, both rookies and veterans made an entrance to the competition stage as Harvard wrestling took on opponents at the annual Binghamton Open. With two podium finishes and multiple falls registered, the Crimson had a strong performance on the day.
“When we go into tournaments like this, the main thing is to get the guys matches at this point in the season and kind of go from here,” coach Jay Weiss said. “We were able to see where we were lacking and where we needed to work on. I was really happy with the guys on the team because if this is where we are starting from, and I know we’re going to get a lot better.”
Junior co-captain and defending EIWA champion Todd Preston fought his way to the final of the 141-pound weight bracket, where he ultimately fell to Cornell’s Matt Grey. Preston commanded his first four matches of the day, winning by technical fall, quick decision, and two major decisions before falling short of first place.
“I had a good start and eventually actually fell to one of my former high school teammates,” junior co-captain Todd Preston said. “It’s the first tournament of the season, which I think is the best part because we have so much room for improvement. This tournament was just a stepping-stone, and I was honestly just trying to go out there, have fun, and do what I love to do.”
Newcomer Josef Johnson contributed a noteworthy performance in his first competition for the Crimson, as he registered a fall against Sacred Heart’s Mark Boyle to claim victory in the consolation semi-final. The freshman went on to complete the day with a solid 4-2 record.
“[The younger guys] might have all fallen a little bit short,” Preston said. “But that’s what you’ll get when you’re going up against some of the best wrestlers in the country. We’re a pretty young team, so we’re just getting the experience and competing against the best guys in the country to hopefully realize that we’re not that far away from beating those ‘best guys.’”
Johnson was not the only freshman to make a strong start in his Harvard athletics career. Fellow rookies Tyler Tarsi, Mason Miller, and Kanon Dean also snagged their first collegiate wins, with each registering a fall on the day. Miller advanced to the fourth consolation round when he bested the Pioneers’ Bobby O’Neill in the 141-pound bracket.
“Many of the freshmen got to wrestle in this tournament, which is great to see,” Weiss said. “This was their first shot at college wrestling and it’s a lot different. They adjusted really well. They often look back and say ‘I did some things well and I realize I didn’t do some things well and I have to work on that in practice,’ which I think if they do that then they’ll be fine.”
Co-captain James Fox matched Preston’s podium finish in his 197-pound weight bracket. While three of his matches were won more easily in falls, his match against Penn State’s Anthony Cassar was decided with a 9-4 finish. Unfortunately, Fox was unable to compete in the final of his weight class because of an injury.
Classmate Ryan Osleeb also performed well in the 133-pound class with two wins to claim a spot in the fourth consolation round. Juniors Michael Mocco and Josh Popple also earned two wins each, with Popple fighting hard to win a major decision in one of his matches.
“We wanted to be able to fight for seven minutes,” Weiss said. “And be able to really keep the action going because I really feel like a day like this—with only two weeks of practice—is just so valuable for us. We were trying to push the pace a little bit, and I felt we did that. We made mistakes that were easily fixable and we will [fix those], but I’m pleased.”

The Harvard Art Museums open their doors to the general public on Nov. 16, when you’ll have to navigate crowds and elbow other viewers for space to truly enjoy the gems on display. Flyby took the time to scope out the offerings so you know where to start.
1.  “Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen,” Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas
Whether you want to rekindle your dreams of being a dancer or want to see firsthand a masterwork from your HAA textbook, stop by “Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen.” With her upturned face, confident stance and tulle skirt, this dancer has all the markings of a prima ballerina.
2. “Mosaic Pavement Fragment with a Peahen,” unidentified artist
With Thanksgiving around the corner, frequent sightings of the Harvard Square turkey, and a research project on that turkey in the works, birds are on the brain (not that we’re calling you a birdbrain). This mosaic peahen does not disappoint. Each of the multicolored tesserae (bits of glass or ceramic) forms an intricate pattern, which is only more mesmerizing the longer you linger in front of the piece.
3. “Astor Hotel,” Reginald Marsh
“Hey, you looking at me?” the woman in this Depression-era painting seems to say in a Brooklyn accent. Arms akimbo and cherry-red lips pursed, despite her poverty, she stands ready to make her next move. Marsh’s fresco-like loose brushstrokes and muted color palette, seen here, put him at the forefront of the social realist painters. The painting is a far cry, though, from some of his other work, which features dancers—both are worth checking out.
4. “Woman in the Night,” Joan Miró
For those more interested in abstract art, make sure to check out Harvard’s extensive modern art collection. Treasures include sculptures, mixed media works and paintings, like this whimsical piece by Miró. A surrealist, Miró used curved forms and bright colors to illustrate the twisted body of a woman. We dare you to try this pose at home.
5. “Kneeling Attendant Bodhisattva (from Mogao Cave 328),” unidentified artist
If you want to stir up a debate with your museum companion, the “Bodhisattva” and accompanying paintings from the Magao Caves are for you. The pieces, removed by art historian Langdon Warner from Dunhuang, China, in 1924, raise questions about cultural heritage and art conservation. And what’s better than having intense conversations with the evidence (beautiful evidence!) right in front of your nose? You are, after all, a Harvard student.
6. Bonus: the building itself, designed by architect Renzo Piano

Whether you need to pull an all-nighter, hammer out a paper, or drown your sorrows in endless caffeine, Lamont baristas (Laristas) are there for you. But nobody knows what their jobs are actually like. Luckily, Flyby went in to investigate.
Barista Jack C. Smith ’15 is a manager at the Lamont Café. According to Smith, there is no typical day at the Lamont Café.
“We only work in four hour shifts,” he said. Depending on which shift he choses to work, the experience is quite different. One of the busiest times is lunchtime, when they sell “all the sushi and sandwiches.” Maybe students’ love for Lamont sushi and sandwiches is saying something about the quality of food in the dining halls.
The café is especially packed “the night before an Ec 10 problem set is due,” said Smith. If there is one thing Harvard students know how to do right, it’s procrastinating. On nights before pset due dates, “the 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift is packed.”
Laristas also get some pretty weird customers. “One of our other managers said one guy pointed at the menu, said ‘double espresso’, and threw his credit card at her,” explained Smith. Looks like someone was having a bad day.
They also have had problems with a person stealing food. The Laristas had to “take a picture of him,” and said “watch out for this guy.” Eventually, they had to kick him out of the café. I guess he must’ve drained his BoardPlus buying $20 brunches for his parents at the dining hall.
Others just ask for “really strange drink combinations.” What can I say, I like my hot chocolate with two and a half pumps of caramel syrup, five and three quarters spritzes of whip cream, and exactly 17 mini marshmallows.
“The best order at Lamont is straight up iced coffee,” said Smith. The general population seems to differ because according to Smith, the most popular order is the Chai Latte. The hardest order to make is the Frappuccino. So next time you hit up Lamont to spend your BoardPlus, have mercy on the laristas’ souls and don’t order Frappuccinos.
The Laristas also have some pretty intense barista problems. “We run out of stuff,” or “have too much stuff,” said Smith. This all makes it “difficult to organize” the storage in back. It sounds like a typical college dorm room. You either have four empty walls with a single desk or you have a two-foot layer of rotting food and clothing on the so-called floor.
Despite the hardships, Jack says “It’s an awesome job,” and that there is a “great community.”  Laristas have it pretty good. And besides, they have Larista parties.

Happy Tuesday, Harvard! Today is Veteran’s Day. For those of you who don’t know, Veteran’s Day is a federal holiday celebrated every year on November 11th, the anniversary of the 1918 Armistice, which was the agreement to end the fighting during World War I. Armistice Day was originally intended to honor those who had fought and died in World War I, but after World War II and the Korean War, it grew to celebrate all veterans, and was renamed Veteran’s Day. Most public schools, banks, and government offices will be closed today, including the majority of the administrative offices at Harvard. Yet, classes, as always, (mostly) go on. If you’re finished early or have a break, head into Boston to catch the Veteran’s Day parade, which leaves from the corner of Boylston and Tremont Streets at 1 p.m., and marches around Boston Common, City Hall Plaza, and ends at Faneuil Hall, where you can hear patriotic speeches alongside anti-war poetry, and lots of music. Whether you have time for the parade or not, take a minute to recognize or thank any veterans in your life, we’re sure they’ll appreciate it!

3) The State of the Student Body: Although much attention has been paid to stress-related mental health, the University has also made great efforts in recent years to bolster physical wellness resources. But while students applaud the changes, they continue to struggle to fit them into a life filled less with sleepless nights and more with a constant buzz of anxiety—an  indicator, student activists say, of the need for a broader cultural shift spearheaded by the student body itself.
