After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, Kentucky’s outgoing Secretary of State, has been named director of the Institute of Politics, according to an announcement Friday.
Grayson will replace former Senator John C. Culver ’54, who had been serving as the center’s interim director since July 2010, and will begin his term at the end of the month.
As Kentucky’s Secretary of State, Grayson worked on programs in civic education and launched numerous online advisory services to support businesses. Last fall, he launched a bid for the U.S. Senate but lost in the Kentucky Republican primary.
Grayson served as the vice chair of the IOP Student Advisory Committee as a Harvard undergraduate and is currently a member of the IOP Senior Advisory Committee.
"The IOP played a pivotal role in developing my interest and approach to politics and public service," Grayson said in a statement, adding that he hoped he would be able to inspire a new generation of leaders to pursue a career in politics like he did.
Grayson was selected by an IOP search committee chaired by Caroline Kennedy that included Kennedy School faculty members as well as IOP Senior Advisory Committee members.
"Grayson is an inspirational young leader committed to civic engagement, bipartisan cooperation and civil debate," Kennedy said in a statement. "He is exactly the right person to lead the IOP."
In an e-mail to the IOP community, Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, the president of the Student Advisory Committee, wrote that he was "thrilled" with Grayson’s appointment.
"We are confident that Sec. Grayson's energy, unique perspective, and commitment to public service will add volumes to [the IOP]," Solnet wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many celebrate the new year with the drop of a giant crystal ball. The Harvard women's hockey team rang it in with the drop of a puck—and five unanswered goals. Turning its first game of 2011 into its own celebration, the Crimson (6-6-2, 5-2-2 ECAC) dropped Union (1-17-3, 0-7-2), 5-0, in Schenectady, N.Y., on Friday afternoon.
"It was a good game, a good start to 2011," Harvard coach Katey Stone said. "We played with all kinds of passion and energy. We saw a lot of great opportunities from different kids."
But the Crimson didn't get on the scoreboard until the second period, after all nine of the team's first-period shots were stopped by Dutchwoman goaltender Alana Marcinko. The sophomore would end the game with 26 saves.
But Harvard quickly made up for the lost time in the second period when sophomore defenseman Josephine Pucci scored the eventual game-winner two minutes into the frame. After recovering the puck from a battle at the blue line with help from rookie Kalley Armstrong, Pucci raced to the cage and put the puck past Marcinko before Union even had a chance to get in position.
"Josephine Pucci had a great rush," tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said.
The Jillian Dempsey insurance goal once again showcased the Crimson's superior speed. On the left side of the offensive zone, Ryabkina backhanded the puck to freshman Lyndsey Fry, who found a wide-open Dempsey waiting on the right side of the goal. With an open net in front of her, Dempsey, a sophomore, converted the pass to put Harvard up by two.
The second period proved to be a sophomore showcase, with Kaitlin Spurling scoring the third goal of the game 15 minutes into the frame. Spurling stole the puck in the defensive end and scored on a fast break.
The Crimson finished the period with a 16-4 advantage in shots.
"We switched up the lines a bit, and it worked," Ryabkina said. "We usually outshoot our opponents, but today we had a lot of good shots."
Meanwhile, on the other end of the ice, Bellamy and the Harvard blue-liners kept the Dutchwomen from finding any offensive momentum.
"Our defense did a really good job staying up and not letting their forwards shoot and intercepting passes," Ryabkina said. "Our defense did a good job wheeling away from the pressure and giving the puck back to the forwards."
The defense allowed Union only 10 shots all afternoon.
"Overall we shut them down and gave them very little to work with," Stone said.
And when Bellamy was challenged, such as on penalties, the sophomore stood strong.
"On [one of the] PKs...someone passed the puck in front of the net and [Bellamy] made a great save," Ryabkina said. "Those saves definitely gave us energy and helped us keep scoring."
And keep scoring the forwards did. The Crimson hadn't needed a power play to score its first three goals but wasted little time scoring when it got the man-up scenario in the final frame. Senior Katharine Chute scored an unassisted goal only 25 seconds after junior Dutchwoman Chelsey Heinhuis was called for hooking.
Harvard still had one more goal to put away, with its final tally coming from Fry. The rookie converted an assist from Pucci nine minutes into the final frame. Pucci and Fry both finished the game with a goal and an assist to lead the team.
Not only did the squad post a convincing win, it also had its five goals scored by five different players. Perhaps more importantly, the Crimson killed all three of its penalties. Harvard struggled with penalties throughout its first two months but has only allowed one power play goal in its last three games.
"I think we're healthy, which is huge," Stone said. "Kids are playing smart, playing aggressive. That's what we want. So far, so good. We've just got to keep getting better."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team had a tall task in its first match of 2011, taking on No. 14 Rutgers and Maryland yesterday at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Despite strong performances from sophomores Steven Keith and No. 11 Walter Peppelman, the Crimson (0-4) fell in both contests, dropping a 31-10 decision to Maryland (5-3) and a 32-9 decision to Rutgers (10-1).
Keith—wrestling at 125 lbs.—and sophomore co-captain Peppelman (157) each picked up a pair of wins on the day, but the rest of the Harvard lineup combined for just two victories.
“I don’t think we wrestled tough top to bottom—that’s what we are trying to do,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said following the opening match. “I think this is a young team, but I’m sick of saying that this is a young team.“
Harvard was aided by wrestling in front of a supportive crowd at the MAC in the squad’s home opener.
“It’s always nice to wrestle at home,” Weiss said. “More importantly, our guys slept in their own beds last night. That comfort is bigger than a crowd.”
MARYLAND 31, HARVARD 10
After taking a 32-9 loss to Rutgers to start the day, the Crimson returned to the mat for a night duel with the Terrapins.
Despite grabbing an early 4-0 lead, Harvard suffered the same fate as it did in its afternoon matchup, suffering a 31-10 defeat.
Keith got the Crimson off to a hot start, earning a 15-5 major decision over Maryland’s Pat Strizki to establish the 4-0 lead and to earn his second win on the day.
“It was nice to pick up two wins,” Keith said. “I thought I wrestled pretty well in both matches.”
The Terrapins pulled within one in the next bout, as Maryland’s Lou Ruland grabbed a 10-5 decision over Harvard sophomore Shay Warren.
The visitors grabbed the lead for good in the next matchup, as senior 141-pounder Fermin Mendez lost by fall, giving the Terrapins the 9-4 lead.
Peppelman narrowed the Crimson’s deficit by earning his second win of the day—a 5-4 decision over No. 15 Kyle John—but it wasn’t enough to stop Maryland. The Terrapins closed out the match with three straight wins to earn the 21-point victory—its third largest of the season.
In the final matchup, co-captain Andrew Knapp—who made his first appearance of the 2010-11 season earlier that afternoon—suffered a close loss to Maryland’s Spencer Myers, losing 2-1.
“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen him wrestle,” Keith said. “He brings so much to the team. He just loves the sport.”
“[Knapp] hasn’t wrestled in a long time, so it was really fun for me to see him just get on the mat,” Weiss added. “He’s got a lot in store. He’s going to do a great job this semester—I know that.”
No. 14 RUTGERS 32, HARVARD 9
In the afternoon matchup, the Crimson fell to a talented Scarlett Knight squad led by a trio of ranked wrestlers in No. 5 Dominick Russo, No. 6 Mario Mason, and No. 20 Daryl Cocozzo.
Rutgers jumped out to an early 20-0 lead behind major wins from Russo and Mike Wagner, but the Crimson made it competitive down the stretch, racking up three wins in the final five bouts.
Keith sparked the Harvard comeback, battling back from an early 2-0 deficit to grab the 4-2 decision. After evening the score at two at the end of the first period, Keith took the lead off a takedown in the third, securing the Crimson its first win of the day.
“Steven is always a spark plug for us because he goes out and wrestles hard all the time,” Weiss said. “We were planning on that. He does a nice job.”
Warren followed on Keith’s performance, securing a second win for Harvard to cut the Scarlett Knights’ lead to 20-6.
Taking on Rutgers’ Mike DeMarco, Warren took an early 2-0 lead and never looked back. DeMarco pulled within one, but Warren rattled off a 2-0 run before the final whistle to score the 4-1 victory.
“I think [Warren] wrestled the hardest out there today,” Weiss said. “He kept wrestling from start to finish.”
The Scarlett Knights responded with back-to-back wins, but the Crimson closed out the match on a high note when Peppelman earned a 2-0 decision over Cocozzo. In the battle between two ranked foes, neither grappler was able to get on the scoreboard until Peppelman earned a late takedown.
“That was a good match for him,” Weiss said of Peppelman. “He just wrestled every position really tough, and that’s what you’ve got to do every time. You can’t take a break, and he did a good job with that.
