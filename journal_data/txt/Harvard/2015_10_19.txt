After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our first assignment in the freshman expository writing course I took at Harvard exactly 50 years ago was “The Moral Equivalent of War,” by William James, the great psychologist for whom that unsightly white tower on Kirkland Street was named.
A pacifist, James hated war but loved martial discipline and purpose. His essay, published in 1910, made the case for a non-violent “army enlisted against Nature,” by which James meant a struggle against the forces that kept people poor and suffering. I never forgot it.
It’s time for a Jamesian campaign today—against diseases that kill men and women by the millions because they can’t get treatments that are readily available in richer parts of the world. When Americans help make people in developing nations healthier, we not only fulfill a deeply moral humanitarian mission, but we also make the world—including the U.S. itself—much more secure.
In his National Security Strategy this year, President Obama referred to partnerships with other nations that “can deliver essential capacity to share the burdens of maintaining global security and prosperity,” because “The United States is safer and stronger when fewer people face destitution.”
There’s no better illustration of the impact that a well-executed, bipartisan global health program can have than PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.  In 2000, with AIDS sweeping Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia, President Bill Clinton declared the disease to be a “national security threat.” In his 2003 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush introduced what would become the largest global health program by any country ever. “Seldom,” he said, “has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.” Congress passed PEPFAR 12 years ago. It’s been renewed twice, with nearly $65 billion in spending across two administrations.
As of last year, PEPFAR had provided anti-retroviral treatment for 7.7 million people. Some 95 percent of at-risk children are now born HIV-free as a result of the program. The number of AIDS orphans has fallen dramatically in most PEPFAR countries: by 28 percent, for example, in Zambia and by 31 percent in Kenya.
But there are other effects as well:
According to Gallup poll data, PEPFAR countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 2007 and 2011 gave the U.S. an average approval rating of 68 percent, compared with a global average of 46 percent.
According to World Bank data, African PEPFAR countries since 2004 reduced political instability and violence by 40 percent, compared with just 3 percent for non-PEPFAR countries in the region. Rule of law ratings in PEPFAR countries increased 31 percent, compared with 7 percent in non-PEPFAR nations.
Average output per worker in PEPFAR countries rose, in constant terms, from about $6,000 in 2003 to $8,000 in 2012. In non-PEPFAR countries, growth has been flat.
HIV prevalence has dropped sharply among military personnel in PEPFAR countries, falling from nearly 66 percent to 8 percent in Uganda and from 66 percent to 9 percent in South Africa.
PEPFAR is a shining example of what is being called Strategic Health Diplomacy—the idea that addressing disease in developing nations helps advance America’s strategic interests and makes the world safer. But PEPFAR is only the beginning. The U.S. is already addressing other global health challenges—including Ebola and cervical cancer— but it should do much more.
With budgets tight, it’s important to select and design future global health programs that have clear strategic benefits. We should look to diseases that are both leading causes of serious illness and death and that can be cured, such as Hepatitis C and malaria. We should invest in efficient programs that do not lock us into spending large sums over many years. And we put part of our focus on diseases in countries that have strategic value, such as Egypt and Pakistan.
A small group of former officials—led by former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist—started a movement earlier this year to promote Strategic Health Diplomacy. And the concept will be the subject of a panel discussion on Monday at 4:30 p.m. at the Kennedy School as part of its Future of Diplomacy project.
Moderating will be Nicholas Burns, the former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and Roy and Barbara Goodman Family Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Relations at the Belfer Center.  The panel will include retired Admiral William Fallon, former commander of CENTCOM (the joint Central Command, which includes the Middle East); and Douglas Shaffer, chief medical officer for PEPFAR.
Harvard—with its strengths in public health, medicine, economics, and public policy—is the best place to kickstart this movement. And, of course, there’s another reason Harvard is so appropriate: William James. A serious effort to wipe out disease in developing nations is not just the moral equivalent to war, but its moral superior.
James K. Glassman ’69, managing editor of the Harvard Crimson in 1968, served as Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs from 2008-2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I met chair of the House Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, this summer—months before I (and likely he) knew that he would be at the core of one of the most stunning power transfers in American politics. He was soft-spoken and charming in a folksy Midwestern kind of way—hardly a firebrand who could dethrone one of the most powerful men in government, stave off his deputy, and thrust an inert Republican establishment in the throes of revolution.
But if not a fire, I could at least sense a feeling of betrayal burning inside him, one that was evidently intense enough to cut short an infuriating Boehner era. Addressing a room full of writers, Jordan lambasted the largely Democratic push to renew the Export-Import Bank, and, more crucially, the GOP leadership’s unwillingness to do anything about it. He was reasonable and persuasive—eventually convincing even me, a procedural conservative too jaded to even roll his eyes when he get called a RINO, to support actually ending an institution.
That was the last time I thought about Jim Jordan until his Freedom Caucus, an invite-only group of conservative Congressmen in the House that was founded just earlier this year, gained traction in the last couple months over their role in stopping Planned Parenthood funding and, of course, the race to find John Boehner’s successor. Their political capital lies in their numbers—at around 40 members, they can prevent even a Republican majority from getting a minimum number of votes on resolutions. But much more notably, their political capital lies in the recent populist push for a radicalist Republican revamp—it’s the same fire that championed the Tea Party movement in the 2010 midterms, and certainly the same fire that pushed Boehner over the edge a couple of weeks ago.
This latter source of the Freedom Caucus’s power scares me. A movement grounded in popular fervor rather than rational principles is doomed to be fixated on short-term victories rather than far more important goals down the road. And as Election Day approaches, we must remember to play the long game. Republicans in their multifarious state—you have your evangelicals, your libertarians, your neocons—are more prone to accusations of dysfunction and disunion. The insurgency of the Freedom Caucus won’t help this image come election year, especially when juxtaposed with the ideological diversity of the 2016 candidates.
But what really irks me about the Freedom Caucus is that there is room for an intellectually rigorous movement from young legislators to reaffirm conservative principles in an entrenched GOP. I don’t think that the Freedom Caucus has met that standard yet.
It's nominally interesting to note that Freedom Caucus members are twice as likely to hold doctorates and three times as likely to have a medical degree than unaffiliated members of the GOP. The caucus members also tend to be younger and more geographically diverse. These are all indicators that the Freedom Caucus has what it takes to provide a healthy internal push to bring the GOP back on message—far more so at least than the deliberately contrarian, intellectually weak Tea Party movement.
Yet in this race for Speaker, the Freedom Caucus has simply inserted itself in the vacuum left by Boehner instead of reforming the undemocratic power structure altogether. For a group that came about to prevent a few people at the top from imposing their will on the entire House, the Freedom Caucus sure is hell-bent on imposing their will on the entire House—whether it’s by voting or withholding votes as a bloc or threatening to shut the government down altogether if they don’t get their way. It’s this total lack of self-awareness (a leader of the Caucus actually said in reference to establishment leadership, “The worst scenario is where you have one person or a small group of people dictate to everyone else what the outcome is going to be in advance.”) that prevents the Freedom Caucus from filling the admittedly necessary void in the GOP of starting a conservative renaissance.
The Jim Jordan I heard this summer could have filled this void, but he seems to be past the point of retrieval. He served an incredibly important purpose. Ousting Boehner presents Republicans with a chance to better capitalize on their “hundred-years majority.” But the Freedom Caucus needs to check its ambitions: when we ask for fire, it should not give us an inferno.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first Democratic debate, held last week at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, was, refreshingly, more a clash of ideas than one of personalities, though it did not lack for interesting characters either. Last week’s contest was well-moderated, focused, and as incisive as can be imagined in today’s world of endlessly on-message politicians—a remarkable feat when compared to the last two Republican debates, which more closely resembled reality television-style prize fights than substantive discussions. The relatively small number of participants and their choice to focus on their policies, not their celebrity, made it far more informative. CNN, the host of the debate, deserves its share of the credit, too: The hard hitting questions, on-the-fly fact checking, and Anderson Cooper’s refusal to settle for the usual political tropes were all vital.
This debate, despite its flaws, showed what a model debate should look like. Compare the question asking Republican candidates to raise their hand if they would consider running as a third party with CNN’s query about the Democratic candidates’ support of capitalism. One was clearly designed to isolate Donald Trump over a procedural matter of political theater; the other sought to ferret out differences about the fundamental nature of our economic system. It is a remarkable effect of Bernie Sanders’s campaign and the tenor of the race overall that capitalism genuinely seemed to be up for debate.
Indeed, the discussions in this debate were about the budget, trade, the cost of college, and other similarly substantive issues. There was, of course, a discussion of the candidates’ backgrounds and experiences, but those focused on the qualities needed in a president, rather than insults and name-calling. Whether you agree with him or not, Senator Sanders’s remark that policy matters more than Secretary Clinton’s “damn emails” was memorable; it was also representative of the spirit of the debate.
We hope that other networks took notes and will focus on creating more civil, substantive Republican debates in the future. The debate allowed candidates to shine—they demonstrated passion but also expertise, principles but also policies, smoothness but also depth. It was a credit to the candidates, a credit to CNN, and a credit to our civil discourse to see the big ideas as the subject of the conversation.
Anderson Cooper also stood out as a dispassionate moderator. He challenged candidates, calling out their hypocrisy and following up when needed. Other journalists, like Megyn Kelly, have also done this well, but the scale of the debate enabled Cooper to do it particularly effectively. Moreover, he focused the questions so that the candidates did not devolve into ad hominem attacks.
Regardless of political beliefs, it is difficult to argue that this was not a more civil debate than the two Republican contests. It was about the issues, not the personalities; the moderator helped shape the debate, not dictate it. The debate set the standard for the coming debates, both Democratic and Republican—hopefully our political discussion will continue to be more civil, more reasoned, and more substantive in the months leading up to next November.

In response to widespread confusion and disapproval surrounding his unconventional bid for the United States presidency, Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig has fundamentally altered his campaign strategy, pledging to remain in the position instead of vacating it as he had previously promised. 
Lessig, who officially launched his campaign last month, previously said that, if elected, he would aim his presidency at passing a set of reforms to change how campaigns are financed and elections are conducted. If he passed those reforms, Lessig said he would immediately step down from the presidency and relinquish power to his vice president.
But in a candid essay published in The Atlantic on Saturday, Lessig wrote that “[f]rom the start, the idea hit a wall—or at least part of the idea did.”
Now, Lessig wrote that if elected, he will remain in the position “to make sure the reforms stick. I will work with Congress to assure they are implemented. I will defend them against legislative or legal attack.”
Lessig wrote that the resignation idea “weakened the credibility of the campaign” and that people and national media outlets were not sure whether he was actually serious about running for president or simply wanted to promote a message.
The Democratic National Committee, which has not officially recognized Lessig as a candidate, “took advantage of this skepticism.. and fueled it,” Lessig wrote. He was not invited to the first Democratic debate last week. Nor did a number of national election polls, like the Fox News or CBS News include his name on their favorability polls until only recently, if at all.
But now, Lessig has changed the nature of his campaign to better clarify his message about mitigating the influence of big money in elections. Because Lessig said he intends to remain in the position if elected, he will need to convince the American public of his ability to perform other presidential functions as well, he wrote.
Lessig, known for his work in copyright law and government reform, is not new to politics or campaign finance reform. In 2008, he briefly considered to run for a vacant seat in California’s 12th congressional district. In 2014, he created a crowd-funded political action committee called Mayday PAC, aimed at electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform. He also helped found the New Hampshire Rebellion, a grassroots organization dedicated to campaign finance reform.
Lessig officially announced his bid in early September after raising $1 million in crowdfunded donations to kickstart his campaign. He is currently on leave from the Law School to focus on his campaign, traveling across New England and the country to meet with voters.

Nobel Peace Prize winner and children’s rights advocate Kailash Satyarthi, whose efforts have saved more than 83,000 children from child exploitation, accepted Harvard’s Humanitarian Award on Friday in Memorial Church.
“Kailash Satyarthi has dedicated much of his life to the protection of the most vulnerable among us,” Harvard Foundation director S. Allen Counter said while presenting Satyarthi with the award. “He exemplifies all of the qualities of humanitarianism.”
Satyarthi has been actively involved in advocating for children’s rights since the 1980s. He established Bachpan Bachao Andolan, otherwise known as the Save the Childhood Movement, which has rescued child victims of human trafficking and slavery. In 1998, he led the Global March Against Child Labor, bringing together non-governmental organizations and individuals in the fight against child servitude.
During his speech, Satyarthi called attention to the plight of children around the world. “How can we call ourselves rich and educated if so many children have no education, no dreams, no present, no future?” he asked. “What kind of world are we living in?”
Satyarthi proceeded to describe his vision for solving the problem of child exploitation. He discussed the importance of having a clear strategy to changing governmental policies and mobilizing mass support, emphasizing that child exploitation is a problem on a global scale.
“Children are the easiest and most powerful way to connect the world,” he said. “Let us use compassion to make this world better for our children and give them freedom.”
Outlining his plan for an upcoming campaign called “A Hundred Million for a Hundred Million,” Satyarthi described ways in which young people, including Harvard students, could become the voices and advocates for exploited children around the globe.
“The idea is that at least 100 million young people in the world are looking for something to believe in,” Satyarthi said in an interview. “They are full of energy and enthusiasm and idealism and creativity, but they don’t have a platform.”
Satyarthi hopes that this campaign will provide young people with a platform to become voices for change, expressing optimism for the fight against child slavery.
“No generation can match the creativity and power you have in this generation,” he said during the speech. “Let this generation create a legacy of freedom, of putting an end to the slavery in the world.”

From Latin hits to summer 2012 chart-topper “Gangnam Style,” the music pulsing in the Science Center Plaza tent Saturday night electrified participants of the Zumbathon “Party in Pink for a Cure,” a dance charity event supporting breast cancer research.
Sponsored by the Center for Wellness at Harvard University Health Services, Party in Pink welcomed people of all levels, and participants were encouraged to donate $10. About 30 people cropped up at the start of the two-hour long dance fest, with more people trickling in as the night progressed.
Organizer Moira “Molly” R. Dillon, a Zumba instructor and fifth-year graduate student at Harvard, appeared unaffected by the brisk 50 degree weather in a bright pink tank top.
“Breast cancer awareness is close to me and a lot of my friends, so I thought it would be a great opportunity to try something new in the Zumba community,” Dillon said.
With October designated as breast cancer awareness month, Dillon selected the option to host a "Party in Pink," one of several offerings that dance fitness company Zumba provides to individuals wanting to host their own events.
The event is part of a worldwide call to action from Zumba Fitness, which partnered with nonprofit Susan G. Komen to raise money for breast cancer research. Thus far, $1.4 million has been raised out of a $3 million goal.
Dillon recruited some of her fellow Zumba instructors to volunteer their time, including Kymberlee M. O’Brien, who leads classes outdoors every week in coordination with the Center for Wellness.
Hanako I. Sawada, a student at the Graduate School of Education, heard about the event through the Center for Wellness website. She said she participated because she knows family members, as well as those of her friends, who have cancer.
“I think it’s a dual reason: for me to get out and get out of studying, but also to raise awareness,” Sawada said.
Another attendee Kelli A. Costello, an assistant director in the General Education program, said she has been doing Zumba for a couple of years.
“This is my first time coming to one of these events,” Costello said as she waited for the first song to begin. “I just hope it’s fun, and I hope I can make it the whole two hours.”
Dillon only began teaching in June after attending Zumba classes for three years.

UPDATED: October 20, 2015, at 5:02 p.m.
Celebrating Nigeria’s 55th year of independence, the Harvard Nigerian Students Association organized spoken word and dance performances on Saturday, offering a chance for Nigerian students on campus to reconnect with elements of their culture while introducing them to others.
At the Sixth Annual Nigerian Independence Day Gala, women wore geles—traditional Nigerian head wraps—and many wore patterned outfits. NSA board members wore clothing decorated with green and white designs, the colors of the Nigerian flag. Many of the performances focused on the theme of Nigerian identity.
Spoken word artist Simone Abegunrin ’18 recited an original poem, starting with the question, “What does it mean to be Nigerian?”
“I think everyone here is a child of Nigeria in some way,” she said to the audience at Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall.
Comedian Abdulazeem Dulo Harris, the event’s master of ceremonies, made many references to Nigerian culture, singling out attendees and asking them personal questions.
“Some of you have forgotten where you’re from,” Harris said, addressing the whole audience, Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike. “Own where you are from.”
Students from neighboring universities also attended the event. Joanah Sylla from Tufts University performed with the Tufts African Dance Collective. “Being able to dance and incorporate parts of my culture into what I’m doing [is] hard but rewarding,” Sylla said.
Another dance group, the NSA Dance Team, debuted at the gala with their first live performance. With matching colorful skirts, black tops, and face paint, the team of six Harvard freshmen women danced to a medley of Nigerian music.
Keynote speaker Bunmi Adekore added a more serious note to the evening’s celebrations. He discussed the challenges facing Nigeria today and expressed hope for the young generation, pointing out the fact that 62 percent of the Nigerian population is under 25 years old.
“Can young people come up with innovations?” he asked the college students in the room. Adekore stressed the importance of improving energy access and sanitation, urging the audience to use the resources at hand to apply their skills and get to work.
“I’m very proud to be Nigerian,” NSA vice president Simisola Tani-Olugbemi ’17 said, reflecting on the event. “I love having that experience with people on campus who also share the same feeling.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 20, 2015
An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the vice president of the Nigerian Students Association. In fact, Simisola Tani-Olugbemi, not Similolu Akintorin, is the vice president.

Heated debates and thought-provoking questions marked the Harvard Business School’s 12th annual Energy Symposium this weekend.
Hosted by the school's Energy and Environment Club, the conference consisted of a series of keynote speakers, including CEO of SunEdison Ahmad Chatila, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum Aldo Flores-Quiroga, and Miguel Galuccio, CEO of the Argentine energy company YPF. Additionally, the event featured break-out panel sessions on specific aspects of energy-related industries and issues. Attendees ranged from local students and private sector employees to officials of energy conglomerates.
Speakers presented their views on some of the most pressing issues facing the environment and energy industry.
“From all the environmental issues we discussed, climate change is a real issue we have to discuss,” Galuccio said. “I’m very conscious of that, and if you look at what happened in the last few years, I believe that the end solution for climate change is here.”
Break-out panels focused on the categories of energy finance, energy policy, technology and innovation, and managing change. Panelists in each field were presented with a variety of questions from conference attendees, spurring discussion on current legislative issues on energy and options for growth in key energy sectors.
“There’s an amazing amount of infrastructure in place, and pieces of technology exist everywhere— the question is how to put it all together to create a different kind of system for the future,” said panelist Ellen S. Smith, senior managing director of FTI Consulting.
“Whether you’re focused in Hawaii, or upstate New York, everyone’s trying to figure out the tools we need to create cleaner, more reliable, more sustainable energy,” she said. “The forefathers asked how to electrify our nation. Now we’re re-electrifying the nation and we need to be unified in our approach.”
Attendees praised the symposium’s focus on fostering dialogue and helping them to achieve greater clarity on the energy concerns of the future.

The Harvard Ed Portal partnered with online art marketplace ArtLifting this Saturday to officially open a new exhibit in its Allston gallery titled “Life-Changing Art,” which features the work of homeless and disabled artists.
The exhibition focuses on the positive potential of the artists ArtLifting represents.
“Today is a celebration of that [potential], and our big goal is to treat our artists as professionals and with dignity,” ArtLifting co-founder Liz J. Powers ’10 said at the opening. “This show is a perfect example of that with the professional gallery walls and perfect gallery lighting.” 
ArtLifting sells the original paintings and prints of the artists it represents. Powers said the initial idea behind ArtLifting was to change lives by focusing on the artistic talents of homeless and disabled individuals. Earning income from their artwork gives the artists confidence, and it has a domino effect on other aspects of their lives, Powers said.
Eva B. Rosenberg ’10, arts program manager for the Harvard Ed Portal, said she hopes the new exhibit will promote community ties between Harvard and Allston—one of the Ed Portal’s primary goals.
“When I started working here, and I knew we would have a gallery with the mission of bringing Harvard and the community together, I thought immediately of Liz and ArtLifting,” Rosenberg said.
According to Powers, the positive results of ArtLifting have been numerous. Since its founding in 2013, five of the previously homeless artists have secured housing at a rate much faster than the seven years it takes for an average homeless male in Boston to find housing. Additionally, ArtLifting has expanded its network from four artists in Boston to nearly fifty artists across the country.

The Undergraduate Council passed a proposed electoral timeline for its upcoming presidential race with two abstentions at the Council’s general meeting on Sunday.
Candidates for UC president and vice president must submit their intent to run by midnight on Sunday, Nov. 1—exactly two weeks from Sunday’s meeting. Additionally, the declared candidates must submit petitions with at least 150 student signatures by the following day.
Candidates will be allowed to begin campaigning on Nov. 10 at 12:01 a.m., with voting opening the following Monday, Nov. 16. The voting period is set to close on Thursday, Nov. 19, and results will be announced that evening.
Campaign rules for this year’s presidential elections are identical to those of last year’s.
Also at the meeting, members of the Honor Council, part of the College’s new honor code, briefed UC representatives on the purpose of the Honor Council and solicited advice on how the two bodies can collaborate in the future.
“Academic excellence is meaningless without integrity,” said Daniel V. Banks ’17, the UC’s Student Initiatives Committee Chair and the only UC representative to serve on the Honor Council.
According to Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, another member of the Honor Council, one of the group’s main responsibilities on campus is to “reach out to the community” about academic integrity and to try and create an honest culture throughout Harvard College.
“I think the UC would be a tremendous help to us,” Jeffrey said. “It would be a… great partnership.
In other business, the Council voted unanimously to allocate $1,000 from the Student Initiatives Committee’s budget toward an event for sophomores to celebrate choosing their concentrations.
At the meeting, Lowell House representative Berkeley Brown ’18 and Winthrop House representative Madeleine H. Stern ’18 said they saw a sharp decline in the amount of student programming from their freshman to sophomore years at the College.
As part of an effort to ramp up sophomore programming efforts, Brown and Stern received funding from the UC, the Advising Programs Office, the Harvard Alumni Association, and the Office of the Dean of the College for the event, which is scheduled to occur in Annenberg Hall on Nov. 13, the day following the sophomore concentration declaration deadline.
The two said that they seek to continue the increased effort to plan class-wide events for sophomores, adding that they eventually hope to create a body similar to the First-Year Social Committee for second-year programming.

After a recent downturn, the Pakistani film industry is showing signs of renewed life, according to the hosts of the 2015 Harvard-Brown Pakistani Film Festival.
In part to celebrate this positive outlook, several Harvard faculty joined with their Brown University counterparts to host a weekend-long film festival in Harvard’s Northwest Building. The almost 600 attendees hailed from locations ranging from Ireland to Harvard Law School.
The event marked the second iteration of the festival, held at Brown last year. The 2015 program comprised three feature films, documentaries, short films, and other forms of visual art ranging from social comedies to biopics.
Asad Ahmed, an associate professor in Harvard’s Anthropology department, served as co-curator and co-organizer with Brown historian Vazira Zamindar. According to Zamindar, the inspiration for the film festival came from a meeting she and Ahmed had with Pakistani filmmakers a few years ago.
“There was this burst of energy among professional young filmmakers,” she said. “It seemed that something like Pakistani cinema was emerging … and we wanted to [start] a conversation with [people] interested in thinking about what forms these new films were going to take.”
Until recently, the film industry in Pakistan was in decline, according to organizers and curators of the event.
“It got to the point where there was a physical deconstruction of [movie] theaters,” said Pakistani filmmaker Sarmad Khoosat, whose film “Manto” screened at the festival. In the past seven or eight years, however, Pakistani cinema has seen a revival, he said.
“All of a sudden, [Pakistani cinema] is coming back,” Ahmed said. “Last year, there were maybe just over a dozen Pakistani films produced, and this year 15 or 16 have already been released.”
At the festival, Ahmed and Zamindar brought together academics, activists, and filmmakers to discuss this recent revival and place it in a broader political context. “How should we think about this reemergence? What forms of censorship and regulation are still occurring in Pakistan? These were some of the questions that we had,” Ahmed said.
Khoosat, however, took issue with the term “revival.”
“We are not trying to revive the formula or the mainstream that existed before the temporary death of Pakistani cinema,” he said. “What we are trying to rejuvenate is a cinema-going culture. In terms of the kind of films that are now coming out, they are a completely new language.”
Khoosat said he hopes that, in coming years, Pakistan’s movie-going population will grow more socioeconomically diverse—currently, only the wealthy can afford to go to the movies. “They’ve recreated cinema spaces in Pakistan, but they’ve followed the international patterns of making multiplexes, so it’s not affordable entertainment,” Khoosat said.
The festival itself reflected the socioeconomic tilt of the Pakistani film industry. Mustafa Samdani, the festival coordinator, said he was disappointed by the attendees’ homogeneity.
“It was mostly well-educated professionals and their families,” he said. “I’d been hoping for taxi drivers. I invited the guy who delivered food [for the event], but he never showed up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EASTON, Pa.—For the top scoring defense of the Ivy League, there were remarkably few theatrics. There were no interceptions, no strip sacks, no forced fumbles.
But on Saturday afternoon, the Crimson needed no flashy antics to get the job done as it swiftly and methodically dismantled Lafayette’s offense in every facet on Fisher Field.
Spurred by a dominant defense that has allowed just three points over as many games, Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) delivered a thrashing to a battered Leopards squad (1-6, 0-2 Patriot), 42-0, to wrap up nonconference play and win its 19th straight.
It took less than five minutes to realize that Lafayette quarterback Drew Reed wouldn’t spend much time in the pocket.
On the Leopards’ second drive—the first having resulted in a quick three-and-out—Reed faced a third-and-13 after a first down run went the opposite direction. Reed dropped back and scanned the coverage for just a second before captain Matt Koran came flying in his direction. The Lafayette playcaller barely evaded the sack by throwing into double coverage, and the ball sailed over his intended receiver’s head.
The next Leopards series—now with the home team down seven—fared about as well. Both times Reed dropped back to throw, he backpedaled so far that his passes barely broke the line of scrimmage. Three possessions in, Lafayette’s offense still had yet to move the chains.
“Any time you can limit an offense to three-and-out, it’s big,” senior cornerback Chris Evans said. “You get your offense the ball back almost immediately, and usually with good field position, so that’s how you want to come out every game.”
For the remainder of the game, the Harvard’s defense didn’t make it much easier for Reed, who was sacked four times by four different white jerseys and hurried another five times. The Crimson front seven also continued its domination against the run, holding Lafayette to negative 18 yards on the ground.
The Leopards offense did come close to putting points on the scoreboard early in the second quarter, but a turnover on downs at Harvard’s 26 stymied the scoring attempt. Another pair of unsuccessful fourth down attempts kept Lafayette scoreless despite two trips into the red zone in the second half.
The Crimson’s defense has now kept opponents out of the end zone for the past 188 minutes of play, since Brown scored a touchdown three weeks ago.
“Every game, our goal is to not let them score,” Evans said. “If they can’t score, they can’t win.”
THE HURT LOCKER
Harvard entered Saturday’s contest missing a few crucial players on offense—senior right tackle Cole Toner to a soft tissue foot injury, senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer to an upper body injury, and junior tight end Anthony Firkser to a high ankle sprain.
Early on, it seemed that the Crimson’s veteran offensive line was missing Toner. In Harvard’s opening possession, Lafayette defensive end Beau Bosch broke through the right side to take down senior quarterback Scott Hosch, the play-caller’s first sack of the year. Junior right tackle Willie Nichols, who is filling in while Toner recovers, and the rest of the line eventually settled in to find clean running lanes for senior running back Paul Stanton, who notched 123 yards and two scores.
Hosch managed 272 yards passing even without Fischer and Firkser, two of his top targets in the first few games, due in large part to the depth of the Crimson’s receiving corps.
“We have a lot of experience, not just with the ones, but with the twos as well,” said senior tight end Ben Braunecker, who accounted for 123 of Hosch’s 272 yards. “It’s a great feeling knowing that when the second guy steps in, it’s not a letdown whatsoever.”
On the other sideline, Lafayette suited—by Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s count—just 59 players, and was sorely missing its injured players, especially on the offensive line. Leopards coach Frank Tavani attributed much of the lack of success in the run as well as pressure on Reed to the youth and inexperience of the line.
Lafayette’s line Saturday featured two true freshmen at center and right guard, and a sophomore at right tackle, as well as a player at left guard who had never played an offensive position prior to this season—in high school or college.
“None of them were totally ready to play, but you have to do that,” Tavani said.
ONE FOR THE BOOKS
The win in Easton marked Harvard’s 13th straight on the road, the longest in program history, breaking a record set by the squads from 1974 to 1977. If the Crimson posts another undefeated season, it will tie the longest winning streak at 24 games. The last time Murphy’s team lost was in 2013 against Princeton, a triple-overtime defeat in Harvard Stadium.
Through five games, the Crimson has turned the ball over just once—an interception in week one against URI. The mark leads the FCS in fewest turnovers lost, and the defense trails only McNeese St. in the FCS for points allowed, with just 8.0 points per game allowed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forward Midge Purce’s eighth goal of the season lifted the Harvard women’s soccer team to a 1-0 victory over Brown in a physical Saturday afternoon contest at a windy Jordan Field.
It was supposed to be a matchup of two teams going in different directions. The Crimson (7-6-1, 4-0-0 Ivy League) had rolled through its first three Ivy League contests, winning each by at least two scores without conceding a goal. Meanwhile, the Bears (4-7-2, 0-3-1) had yet to tally an Ivy League goal en route to a winless Ivy start. But Brown gave Harvard all it could handle.
“Brown is a really challenging team and hats off to them, but it’s good to have challenging games in the middle of the season,” co-captain Haley Washburn said.
The Crimson offense came out firing to start the game, posting 13 first-half shots—including five from junior forward Rachel Garcia. But only two of Harvard’s 13 tries were on goal, and none found the netting, marking the first time the Crimson had been held scoreless in the first half of an Ivy League game this season.
Coming out of halftime, Harvard attacked the Bears’ zone, and in the 73rd minute, the Crimson finally cashed in. After a struggle and a series of passes in front of the net, Purce beat Brown freshman goalkeeper Christine Etzel to put her side ahead. It was the sixth goal for Purce in her last four games and her fifth Ivy League score. Garcia picked up an assist on the play, and the pair combined for 14 shots on the afternoon.
“[Rachel and Midge] were awesome,” Washburn said. “I don’t have much else to say. They were really good.”
Despite posting 25 shots—tied for the most the Crimson has had in a game this season, Harvard only put six on goal, resulting in just the one score. Brown’s physical defense, which has struggled at times in Ivy League play, contained the Crimson attack.
“Our finishing was really off today,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “It was a very difficult game, we did not play well. I have to give my credit to Brown. They had a lot to do with it.”
But on the other end of the field, the Crimson backline held the Bears in check all afternoon. The Harvard defense has not surrendered a goal in conference play and has only allowed one since Sept. 26. Brown had five first-half shots but none in the second half.
“We’re working on things every week, places we’ve been exposed in previous games,” Washburn said. “[We’re] just staying positive when we make mistakes and helping each other through stuff because we’re always going to be making mistakes, and there’s always room for improvement.”
Defenders Marie Becker, Bailey Gary, and Alika Keene all played the entire game. The Crimson only utilized three substitutes on Saturday, and each of them played less than 20 minutes. The 14 players used are tied for the fewest Harvard has used in a game all year.
Junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack stopped both of the shots she faced. The junior has only needed to stop eight shots total in the team’s four conference matches.
The game proved to be a wake-up call of sorts for the Crimson following an entire week off from games after four consecutive contests in which the team had scored at least two goals.
“It’s a help to keep the edge of a rough game, a 1-0 game,” Leone said. “Everyone wants to score goals like crazy, but if you don’t, it keeps your edge.”
Harvard improved to 7-2-0 against the Bears under Leone, with victories coming in the last five matchups. Freshman netminder Christine Etzel, the twin sister of Crimson backup goalkeeper Danielle Etzel, finished the game with five saves for Brown.
Following her goal against Cornell last week, senior forward Emily Mosbacher notched five shots in 86 minutes of action, while sophomore midfielder Dani Stollar added two. Seven different Harvard players registered a shot, while eight played the entire game.
“I thought we did really well supporting each other,” Washburn said. “It was a really weird game. It was windy and the balls weren’t really going where we wanted them to. I thought we worked well together, we got through it, we had a lot of grit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu absent from the midfield Saturday evening because of a hamstring injury, Harvard men’s soccer coach Pieter Lehrer had to shuffle his lineup to accommodate for his missing player.
Among those adjustments was the relocation of senior Andrew Chang. Chang, normally a stalwart in the backline, moved up to the midfield, a role he had not played all year. But despite being out of position, however, the senior never missed a beat.
Following a weak clearance by a Brown defender in the 68th minute, Chang controlled the ball with his chest, setting up a volley that he struck into the bottom left corner of the net, giving the Crimson (5-4-2, 3-0-0 Ivy) a 1-0 victory over the Bears (6-5-1, 1-1-1) and its first three-win start to conference play in seven years.
“[During] halftime we talked about the second balls in the box,” Chang said. “When it came to me, I trusted it and kicked it as hard as I could, and it went in.”
Following a long throw-in and a series of deflections in the box, senior forward Michael Innocenzi crossed the ball into the center before the ball redirected to Chang, whose first goal of the season raced past diving junior netminder Erik Hanson.
The score was the result of a relentless Harvard attack that kept active throughout the game. The Crimson controlled possession and managed 16 shots—only three of which were on goal—compared to nine for the Bears, who managed to put five on goal.
Harvard threatened early, as senior forward Oliver White struck a powerful attempt from outside the box, forcing Hanson to tip the shot over the bar. In the second stanza, classmate Jake Freeman nearly doubled the Crimson’s lead after a botched clearance by Hanson laid the ball onto the senior, who took a few strides into the box attempting to get past defender Jack Hagstrom but sailed his effort over the crossbar.
The storyline, however, could have been vastly different for both teams.
After a series of deflections off a Brown corner in the 16th minute, Brown rookie Jack Hagstrom managed to get his head on the ball deep inside the penalty box. But the attempt at goal was cleared off the line by junior center back Alex Leondis, preserving the nil-nil scoreline.
“He has been one of the best defenders in the conference,” Lehrer said. “He’s been fantastic. He is a great defender [and] he communicates well. His clearance off the line is his heads-up play and he’s been outstanding for us.”
Co-captain and goalkeeper Evan Mendez was called upon to preserve Harvard’s lead with just seven minutes left, as the senior parried away a strong effort by Brown sophomore midfielder Louis Zingas and alertly swatted it away with his glove to prevent further shots.
After struggling early in the season, the defense has come to life for the Crimson as the back four—which incorporated sophomores Justin Crichlow and Tyler Savitsky as fullbacks for the first time this year—registered its third straight shutout.
Mendez continued his string of strong performances as well, saving all five shots which came on target. Following the early scare, the Harvard defense held the Bears to no shots over the last 25 minutes of the first half.
The Crimson has conceded just one goal so far in Ancient Eight action and became just the second opponent to stifle the Bears’ attack.
“Defensively, we held our ground,” Chang said. “I think that’s what we’re good at. We play defense hard, and we keep fighting.”
The victory gives Harvard its first 3-0-0 start in conference play since 2008 and leaves them in a tie atop the Ancient Eight with Dartmouth.
“The guys have earned it, and they fought for it,” Lehrer said. “We still haven’t found our rhythm as a playing team; in training we’ve been fantastic… and it hasn’t moved onto the field yet. But the fight has not stopped, so we’re getting a result just by the fighting and the grinding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final tune-up meet before the Ivy League Championships, the Harvard cross country team struggled against a field comprising many of the top teams in the nation. Racing at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational in Madison, Wis., the men’s team took 32nd out of 36 teams, while the women finished 26th.
The invitational is one of the premier races in the country, boasting a slate of top-30 teams. Over 20 NCAA ranked squads, including five of the top 10 in the nation for both men and women, raced at the Zimmer Championship Course.
“From a competitive standpoint, that meet is as good as any national championship,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.
Against top-tier opposition, co-captain Tom Purnell paced the men’s team, finishing first for the Crimson in the eight-kilometer race with a 24:27.4 mark. The senior ended up 100th overall.
Close behind Purnell, sophomore Ben Huffman and co-captain Chris Allen crossed the line just three seconds apart for 130th and 138th, respectively. Junior Brandon Price and sophomore Louis Colson rounded out the scoring for Harvard.
The Crimson came up short against the three Ancient Eight opponents that also raced in Madison. Harvard was beaten out by Columbia and Dartmouth and narrowly edged out by Princeton, which finished one spot ahead of the Crimson.
In the women’s 6k race, Sophomore Courtney Smith shined once again for Harvard and took 16th place overall. She covered the course in 20:04.2 to top the first finishers from a number of nationally ranked programs. Smith was only bested by one Ivy League competitor, Elizabeth Bird of Princeton, who edged the Crimson runner out by four seconds.
The sophomore improved vastly on her performance at the same event last year, when she finished 169th. She also moved up the Harvard ranks, transitioning from the Crimson’s fourth finisher in Wisconsin in 2014 to the team’s first scoring runner this time around.
“Smith continued to have an outstanding season and really solidified her place as one of the nation’s best distance runners,” Saretsky said.
Over a minute and 107 finishers separated Smith from the next finisher for Harvard, sophomore Elianna Shwayder, who finished 123rd. Captain Paige Kouba. senior Emma Payne, and freshman Kathryn Gillepsie filled out the scoring field for the Crimson behind Shwayder.
Payne put in an especially strong performance. The senior came into the race ranked as the sixth Harvard runner, but she was fourth across the line for the Crimson.
“[Payne] really stepped up this weekend,” coach Patrick Wales-Dinan said. “She continues to get better every week, and we’re really pleased with her performance.”
Although disappointed with the overall outcome, the team recognizes the value of competing against such formidable opponents.
“I think that the process of becoming a championship-level team is filled with success and disappointment equally, so I think in order to have a healthy dose of both of those experiences, you need to race the best people,” Wales-Dinan said. “I think that a race like this can serve as a very good barometer of what you’re doing, what’s working, and what you still need to focus on.”
The Crimson also sent a young group of runners to the Rothenberg Invite, hosted by Brown in Providence, R.I.
Freshman Samuel Oh had a breakout race, finishing first for Harvard and 16th overall. Sophomore Gabe Montague and freshmen Emmanuel D’Agostino, Colin Price, and Robert Hope all finished inside the top-35 to guide the Crimson to a fifth-place finish in a field of eight teams. The Cambridge squad finished second of three Ivy League teams at the meet, topping Brown but behind Dartmouth.
The Harvard women did not enter a full team in Providence, but junior Madeleine Ankhelyi put in an impressive showing for the Crimson to cross the line in 11th place.
Although the result in Madison was not what the team was hoping for, it has not changed the Crimson’s goals going forward.
“We started off our season with two really solid meets, and this was just a little bit of a bump in the road,” Wales-Dinan said. “We want to continue to capitalize on our early success and finish as high as we can at Ivy League Championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a comeback win at home against Princeton in the last minute, the Harvard women’s rugby team (3-2, 2-2 Ivy) saw itself in a very similar situation at Dartmouth (4-1, 4-0) this weekend. With the clock winding down and down by a score of 20-15, it seemed as if the match was over when the Big Green attempted to put the ball into touch to end the game.
With seconds left on the clock, freshman Susie Clements blocked the kick to allow the Crimson one last attempt. Senior Ann-Marie Barrett made one last push, but the Dartmouth defense would make a pivotal tackle and hold on to the lead as the clock ran down.
“It was one of the most exciting finishes I’ve seen despite the fact that we didn’t score the try,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “Ann-Marie Barrett was the final ball carrier who was her way into the try zone for the game tying try when she got hit by a Dartmouth player, and that pretty much ended the game.”
In its first year of varsity status, Dartmouth came in hoping to remain undefeated in Ivy League play after a big win against Princeton last week. In what turned out to be a close match, it was the Big Green’s defense that ultimately decided the game. Harvard was limited to only 15 points, with two of the Crimson’s three tries coming late in the second half.
“I think we had a lot of chances,” co-captain Hope Schwartz said. “The momentum at the end of the game had really shifted in our direction. We scored two really quick tries to get within five and we were on the goal line when the game ended.”
Despite being shut out for much of the game, the Crimson defense would also hold its own after a difficult start. The defense shut down the Big Green after two early tries in the first half, holding the Big Green at 10 for the rest of the first half. Harvard stayed within two tries for much of match, but couldn’t come through with the tying try at the goal line when the game ended.
“It’s a really tough place to have run out of time,” Schwartz said. “But you have to credit Dartmouth for holding us for the whole first half and most of the second half.”
The match would start with a quick Dartmouth try. Despite keeping possession throughout much of the first half, the Crimson couldn’t seem to score. After gaining possession again, the Big Green pushed the ball to the try line where the Harvard defense would make a strong stand before Dartmouth would finally score to make the score 10-0.
“They went up pretty quickly in the first half. The biggest thing was that they dominated the point of contact,” Schwartz said. “They stole some of our balls out of our own hands and used those turnovers to put the ball in the hands of some of their stronger runners and capitalize on our mistakes.”
Despite going down early in the match, the Crimson closed out the first half with a quick try from freshman Grace Chao off the assist from classmate Genevieve Quirion to close the half with a score of 10-5 in favor of Dartmouth.
In the second half the Big Green would again dominate early on, scoring two consecutive tries to take a 20-5 lead before the Harvard defense would stop Dartmouth. Following the Big Green’s two tries, the Crimson would rally again, scoring two tries within five minutes of one another to put Harvard within five.
The first try would come courtesy of freshman Caitlin Weigel off a successful scrum at Dartmouth’s 22 yard line. The second would come from Quirion off the assist from Chao. All of the Crimson’s tries on the day would come from freshman.
Despite the loss, Parker was positive about where the team is as the regular season comes to a close.
“What we did really well this time was we improved our play at the point of contact, we were much more intense,” Parker said. “What we need to improve on is getting the ball to our outside backs for wide, fast running strikes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week before it begins its 2015-2016 season in earnest, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team defeated McGill University, 3-2, in the Crimson’s annual preseason exhibition game. Saturday’s contest also marked the first time No. 5/4 Harvard has been in the rink since reaching last year’s national Championship game.
At the end of two periods, McGill (4-8-0) held all the momentum. The game was tied at two apiece, and a carryover power play meant a man advantage coming out of the gates.
Early in the third period, though, Crimson freshman forward Grace Zarzecki reached the slot with the puck, got tripped, and still managed to shovel home a short-handed goal from her knees. The score, which also drew a McGill penalty, not only abruptly swung the momentum in Harvard’s favor, but also turned out to be the game-winner.
Before joining the Crimson, Zarzecki was a member of the U.S. Women’s National Under-18 Team. She was the only freshman to register a point in Saturday’s game.
“To come into the first game with a Harvard jersey on—it’s always nerve-wracking, a rush,” said sophomore forward Haley Mullins regarding Zarzecki’s key goal. “The fact that she was able to pull that out for us was pretty sweet.”
Long before Zarzecki’s goal, though, the Crimson seemed to have the game under control.
Harvard came out of the gates flying, scoring twice midway through the first period to take a 2-0 lead on goals by sophomore forward Karly Heffernan and Mullins. Heffernan’s goal was unassisted, while Mullins extended the lead by dumping an accurate pass from junior forward Miye D’Oench into the net for a power play goal.
D’Oench has been a steady force on the Crimson side, as she led last year’s Harvard team in goals scored with 19 and was tied for fifth in assists with 14. Over the last two seasons, she has totaled 72 points.
“We were on the power play, and I just skated hard to the net,” Mullins said. “Miye put the puck right on my stick.”
After the first period, the Crimson offense slowed heavily, generating three shots on goal throughout the entire second frame. Neither team was able to consistently keep the puck in the offensive zone.
“We had a great start, we had a good jump in our step, but in terms of our conditioning, we’ve got to maintain that pace,” said Harvard coach Katey Stone, now in her 20th season with the team. “The game was a good measuring stick for us, but it also says that we have a lot of work to do.”
McGill was able to take advantage of the lapse in urgency by scoring a power play goal at the 5:15 mark and an even-strength goal at the 17:44 mark to knot the game at two. McGill senior center Melodie Daust tallied both an assist and a goal.
“At the end of the second quarter, we didn’t kill the penalty very well,” Stone said. “They had a nice power play, and suddenly, we’re right back where we started. We got a little—I don’t want to say selfish—but we got a little too singular-minded; we didn’t move the puck. All of a sudden, we’re trying to create 1-on-3s instead of 3-on-1s.”
The Crimson held McGill scoreless in the final period, as backup junior goalie Molly Tissenbaum stopped all eight shots she faced.
Zarzecki’s crucial goal helped win the game for Harvard, but perhaps the most important aspect of the exhibition game was simply getting some ice time under the team’s belt.
“We worked on getting the jitters out the first game,” Mullins said. “We played a little bit rough on the edges. We need to get more comfortable playing with our lines teams.”
Ahead of the season opener at Dartmouth, the former women’s Olympic team head coach also acknowledged room for improvement.
“It was a good, hard-fought battle,” Stone said. “Some kids really stepped up, but it takes sixty minutes to win a hockey game. There’s a lot to work on for Friday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming into the weekend riding four straight wins, the Harvard women’s volleyball team seemed to be running on all cylinders. Indeed, this weekend, in which the Crimson conference leaders were playing teams at the bottom of the Ivy League, looked on paper to be a reprieve from playing rival and perennial power Yale last weekend and co-conference leader Dartmouth next weekend.
Helped along by the strong play of senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, Harvard (9-8, 5-2 Ivy) managed to squeak by Cornell (4-13, 0-7) on Saturday after suffering their second conference loss of the season to Columbia (5-11, 3-4) on Friday.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 2
Down two sets to one and facing match point in the fourth set, the Crimson saw its hopes for a conference championship on the precipice. The squad was now second in the conference standings to Dartmouth after a loss the night before, and another defeat might have meant the end of the team’s quest for a second straight Ivy League title.
But the players responded to the pressure by rattling off the last three points of the set, eventually coming out on top with a close 26-24 fourth set victory.
Throughout the night, Harvard responded to pressure well after dropping the first two sets, winning the last three sets by a combined six points.
“For a moment there, we felt as though the season was slipping through our fingers,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “But what we learned from that is that we’re a resilient team that can take the pressure of the whole season laying down on us, and that we should really play for the next point—rather than for the Ivy title.”
One highlight of the night included the play of senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, who finished the night with a team-high 18 kills and also 14 digs. After suffering from injury the first half of the season, Wallace has not missed a beat since returning, scoring her second consecutive—and third career—double-double on Saturday.
“Kathleen has really stepped up during crucial times when we needed her, which is awesome to be able to rely on as a teammate,” sophomore outside hitter Paige Kebe said. “It’s really cool to see her transition into a senior leadership role and nice to have her back.”
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson faced its first conference road test of the season on Friday against Columbia, which had just pulled off an upset victory over Penn the weekend before. Columbia had similar plans in store for Harvard.
The Lions managed to pull off another upset this time around, led by Bailey Springer, who had 18 kills on the night. Springer gave Harvard trouble last season as well, landing a game-high 22 kills almost exactly one year ago.
Harvard came back and rattled off the third set, 25-16. The fourth set, though, again went the way of the Lions, who only trailed twice—both times early in the set by one point—in scoring a 25-20 victory.
The first set went back and forth for the first half, with the game tied at seven points in the game, ending at the 16-16 mark. But an ace from Jennifer Petrovich and kills from Springer and Luciana Del Valle gave the Lions a three-point lead that they would not concede, winning 25-20.
“We didn’t really put in every ounce of effort that we should have,” Holte said. “Now we know that every team is a fierce competitor. Moving forward, we’re going to treat each team like we treat Yale and make sure to respect them.”
The second set was all about runs. The Lions jumped out to a 13-4 lead, only to see that lead dwindle to one after the Crimson went on a 12-4 run behind four kills from Wallace and two from junior Corie Bain. But the Lions regained control, never letting the Crimson tie the game en route to a 25-19 win.
The Crimson now sits in a tie for second in the Ivy League with Yale, who both trail Dartmouth by a game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Though both days saw brisk and breezy autumn weather, Harvard Square was abuzz with activity this past weekend, as thousands of people from across the nation came out to watch various collegiate, alumni, international, and club boats compete in the 51st annual Head of the Charles regatta.
After last year’s performances, the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams had high expectations to live up to. Both teams’ boats looked to remain in the top three of the club eight and four races and succeeded in doing so after strong performances across the board.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The heavyweight team, which proved last year that it could compete with national teams, performed at its usual high level, even after having to deal with colder and windier weather on Sunday for the championship races.
The varsity eight boat, which featured a new lineup that had been decided on just a week before the event, stroked to a strong finish, especially against rival Yale, but ultimately fell short of the top spot. The eight finished in third place, three seconds behind the Elis and two seconds behind the University of California, with a 14:21.4 mark.
“We were really expecting competitive paces from Yale, Cal, Washington, Princeton, and Brown,” captain James Croxford said. “Yale [is] our main rival, so we were hoping to be competitive with them.”
Croxford and sophomore coxswain Cole Durbin led the boat to stay within six seconds of Yale’s time as it passed the Riverside and Weld bridges. Upon reaching the Cambridge BC bridge, the boat was just two seconds off the mark. Ultimately, the Crimson was unable to make up the difference.
The 2V, meanwhile, wasn’t far behind, as the boat–coxswained by sophomore Jacqueline Goodman–took home eighth place with a time of 14:41.9.
“I think as a crew we thought we rowed a solid pace, but obviously as the results show, there’s a little bit of room for improvement,” Croxford said. “ As a team I think we performed quite well over the weekend.”
The V4 boat, with freshman coxswain Jennifer Kunes, sophomores Benjamin Strathmore and Dominic Glover, and juniors Sean Vedrinelle and Chase Buchholz, finished 11th of the 14 boats that competed in the race with 17:00.2. The boat trailed Brown by 13 seconds and beat Penn by three seconds.
In the trials the day before, the Crimson had two boats in the men’s Club Eight race, and one in the Club Four race. Both varsity eight boats finished in the top 15. One boat, coxed by sophomore Maddie Zabriskie, finished fourth at 15:19.9, and the next came in just over half a minute later at 15:53.4, earning 14th place.
The varsity four boat was a young one with three sophomores and one freshman, in addition to a freshman coxswain. The boat came in 25th place with a time of 18:33.8, in the middle of the pack of 52 boats.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The lightweight crew team’s performance at the regatta hearkened back to last year’s Men’s Eights Collegiate race, where the team was edged out by Princeton in a tight contest that went down right to the finish line.
Like last year, the Lightweight Eights championship race came was a battle between Princeton, Harvard, and Yale.
“No one was really putting pressure on us to win,” junior Jack Kelly said. “It was really up to us to have the best race we could. It was just unfortunately we fell a little short.”
Upon passing Riverside, all three boats were within three seconds of each other. The Tigers began to pull away as the teams passed Weld and Cambridge, but the Crimson was not far behind, trailing by less than six seconds. Ultimately, Harvard, led by captain Sam Frum, fell by 8 seconds to Princeton to earn third place overall. The time of 15:05.8 was also good enough for second among collegiate boats.
Earlier in the club race, another Crimson eights boat coxed by freshman Mary Yeh finished the time trials in 17th place, just three seconds behind the heavyweights’ second boat, at 15:56.2. The varsity four boat, coxed by senior Chris Xu, took 11th place at 17:52.9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend marked a roller coaster performance for the Harvard women’s field hockey team. Despite strong play in its games against Cornell (8-4, 3-1 Ivy) on Saturday and New Hampshire (6-8, 2-2 American East) on Sunday, the Crimson (7-5, 2-2 Ivy) dropped both games, and slipped into a tie for fourth in the Ivy League standings.
Bouncing back a bit from its 1-0 loss to Cornell on the road and a slow first half against the Wildcats, the Crimson rallied back to play significantly more aggressively and more cohesively in the second half of the game on Sunday. The lone goal of the weekend came from junior forward Marissa Balleza off a turnover caused by senior Elizabeth Jacobson with only two minutes left on the clock, but it wasn’t enough to secure a comeback.
“It’s been a tough weekend for the whole entire team with the traveling,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “It’s about making the best of it, and I think yesterday the first half we played really well, and today we had moments where we played really well, so hopefully this sets up well for a good final weeks of the season.”
NEW HAMPSHIRE 3, HARVARD 1
After Balleza’s goal in the 68th minute, Harvard dominated the circle in a desperate scuffle to find the net. With only seconds left, co-captain midfield Caroline Code sliced the ball towards the net, but was ultimately thwarted by UNH goalie Kelsey Rudert.
The final minutes of play, however, were indicative of the energy that the Crimson maintained throughout the tight second half. Harvard ultimately came out with 10 shots on goal compared to the Wildcats’ seven, three from Balleza and two from Jacobson.
“It was obviously a disappointment losing, but I think we came back, and we came out hard,” Balleza said. “I don’t think the score really reflected how we played, because we played a lot better than we have been playing.”
The game started with a slow first half for Harvard, giving UNH four penalty corners. The Wildcats also scored all three of their goals in the first half
“Once we realized we were down three goals and they were three goals scored on corners, we could still be in it if we wanted to,” Balleza said. “Obviously it’d be a battle, but I think we were up for it.”
A strong midfield carried the team, creating opportunities for Harvard. A long pass from sophomore midfield Ellie Cookson allowed freshman forward Kathleen Young to drive the ball up the field early in the second half. With the ball in the possession of Crimson offense, Balleza and junior forward Sarah Finnemore fired two back to back shots on goal, but just could not convert.
“I think we had great intent, a great attitude,” van Herwaarden said. “We worked really hard and it’s unfortunate that in the moment that it needs to happen we were just coming up a little short.”
CORNELL 1, HARVARD 0
Aggressive offensive attacks marked the game against Cornell in Ithaca on Saturday, with a total of 88 fouls called—49 on Harvard and 39 on the Big Red. Despite solid defense from the Crimson, including five saves from senior keeper Issy Davies and a defensive save from Code, Cornell ultimately overpowered Harvard.
“It was a bit of a frustrating game,” Balleza said. “Especially the second half, because we came out really strong in the first half.”
The Big Red found the back of the net in the 47th minute. After a save from Davies, Cornell sophomore Krysten Mayers capitalized off a penalty corner and fired the ball to the far post. Mayers ended the game with four shots, all of which were on goal.
“The first half we really dominated, [with] good energy and good aggression on the ball,” van Herwaarden said. “In the second half, Cornell got a better grip on the game, they got a little stronger, they let in a goal and unfortunately we weren’t able to get one back.”
In the last 20 seconds of the game, the Crimson was awarded a penalty corner and had one last chance for an equalizer. Jacobson tried for the back of the net, but her shot was deflected by Cornell defender Sam McIlwrick.
“The outcomes are not fantastic, but I think the energy and the level of play that we showed definitely gave us a positive outlook for the next couple of weeks,” van Herwaarden said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a frigid, blustery weekend at the 51st Head of the Charles Regatta, the Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight boats were out in full force, looking to achieve success in the rowing world’s spotlight event.
Ultimately, the lightweight team demonstrated its competitive prowess, breaking the top-three in multiple races, while the heavyweight team was unable to live up to expectations, leaving much room for improvement.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
All eyes were on how the lightweight team would perform under first-year head coach Sarah Schwegman in her Radcliffe debut. Under Schwegman’s tutelage, the lightweights performed up to expectations, recording top-three finishes in both the Lightweight Eights and the Lightweight Fours events.
“I think that for the first race of our season, it really came together,” junior co-captain Ruby Emberling said. “We were all pulling for every Radcliffe boat that was out on the water.”
The conditions were not ideal for a team trying to come up with a top result, but the Black and White Lightweight Eight focused on the task at hand. Starting second in its race, Radcliffe attempted to pull away from bow number three, a BU boat, sitting right behind its stern. A little over 17 minutes later, Radcliffe accomplished that goal as it squeezed out a hard-fought second place finish, beating out BU by just half a second with a time of 17:15.308.
“Our best stretch was right in front of Weld,” co-captain Olivia Henry said. “We consider that our stretch. We do [some of our training there since] it’s right past our boathouse, and we can hear a lot of cheers.”
Not only is the Head of the Charles a tough race for the rowers, but it is also a difficult task for the coxswains. The stretch of the river that the course encompasses is notorious for its long winding turns and narrow bridge openings that can cause even the most experienced navigators to falter and hinder her team’s results as a result.
But the coxswains from Radcliffe, BU, and the Minerva Rowing Club from the Netherlands, who took first in the eights, steered tight lines and smart courses that helped earn them top-three finishes. Rookie Mckenzie Parks coxed the first boat for Radcliffe, while sophomore Electra Lang coxed the second, which finished seventh out of nine boats.
In the Championship Fours, Radcliffe finished third out of 16 competitors, recording a 19:43.386 time. Senior Gabriella Giugliano coxed the boat, bringing her side within two seconds of the second-place UMass contingent.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
In typical head race fashion, the Black and White aimed to hunt down the preceding crews, while putting as much water between its stern and the other eights behind it as possible.
The varsity eight, stroked by senior Frederika Archibald and coxed by sophomore Kaitlyn Felsheim, appeared to struggle with the weekend’s conditions, however, posting a time of 17:10.863.
“There was a headwind throughout the whole race, up and down in terms of wind speed, but that had nothing to do with [the result],” heavyweight crew coach Liz O’Leary said. “The varsity eight had a flat race, not for lack of commitment, not for lack of determination, but as a collective boat it didn’t race the way I know it can.”
The boat placed 19th in a field of 33 eights in an event in which the heavyweights finished eighth last year. O’Leary found a silver lining in the race, however, as Radcliffe’s second eight finished less than a minute behind, fighting its way to a 27th-place finish in the race.
“The second boat did a good job in an event that was probably a bit over their heads, but the first boat did not, and that was not what we had planned,” O’Leary said. “We’ll get back to work, make some changes, and see what we can do to build some more speed.”
In the Championship Fours race, the Black and White finished 13th in a field of 19 boats with a time of 19:14.219.

Five Things We Learned
Men’s basketball beat reporter David Freed reflects on three things to take away from the squad’s opening scrimmage.
1. It’s 2012 All Over Again — For the first time in three years, the Crimson are going to be young. As in, really young. The team has six freshmen and just three seniors—one of which, Patrick Steeves, is still out with injury. Among the seniors, Agunwa Okolie looks like a starter on the wing, but Evan Cummins—who fell out of favor with Amaker midway through last year after some erratic early performances—may start on the bench. Sophomores Chris Egi and Andre Chatfield look like possible starters, and freshmen Tommy McCarthy and Weisner Perez will be early options off the bench.
2. Siyani Will Be Missed In A Big Way — The return of senior Siyani Chambers, who is taking a year of leave due to a torn ACL, for the weekend only accentuated the team’s presumed hole at point guard. McCarthy and junior Matt Fraschilla handled the ball for the two teams, both flashing good vision and poor shooting. Fraschilla in particular was a revolving door at one end, letting McCarthy get by at will.
3. Same Old Zena — Not many changes at Crimson Madness. For the third straight year, junior Zena Edosomwan looked like a star against his scrimmage competition—dominating on offense and getting to the rim at will. He won the dunk contest by—once again—jumping over a player on his team (freshman Balsa Dragovic this year, Egi lsat year). Ultimately, however, he looked a lot like the freshman who put up 18.2 points per 40 minutes—his offense may be more effective, but his defense and passing remain suspect.

Grading Friday’s Crimson Madness Contests
Men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason gives out his report card for the dunk contest and three-point shooting contest. Junior Zena Edosomwan took home the dunk contest title, 110-107, over senior Agunwa Okolie, while sophomore Zach Yoshor won the three-point shootout. Note that all grades come on the Harvard grading scale. 
Dunk Contest
Okolie: While he was strong and safe to start the evening, with a reverse dunk, he saved his best for last in the third round, a strong, one-handed 180-degree dunk. The swingman took off, spun, and threw down with his right hand. It was the dunk of the night. B+
Edosomwan: The junior brought the crowd to its feet with a rim-rocking windmill dunk to start the day, sticking his left elbow through the rim on the second, and jumped over 6’10” teammate freshman Balsa Dragovic in his last one. Overall, a solid performance from the Crimson’s top returning big. A-
Three Point Shootout
Corbin Miller: The most accomplished shooter of the lot, Miller never got going except for a stretch where he made four at the top of the key. Disappointing effort by the junior. C+
Weisner Perez: Listed at 6’6”, Perez was the tallest person to compete and acquainted himself well. He looks to be capable of being a stretch four on bench units. B-
Tommy McCarthy: The guard couldn’t find his shot in the scrimmage that followed, but acquainted himself well in the contest, finishing just short of the final round. B
Corey Johnson: The freshman had a look at the win in an impressive shooting performance. Good start for the young guard, who had a contest high 14 in the first round. A-
Zach Yoshor: Slow and steady, Yoshor flashed the best part of his game. Of course, he nearly clanged his in-game three off the side of the backboard during the scrimmage. A
