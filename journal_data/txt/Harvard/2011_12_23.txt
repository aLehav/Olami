After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—Adam B. Wheeler, who pleaded guilty last year to faking his way into Harvard and cheating the University out of over $45,000, was sentenced to one year in prison on Friday, after he landed back in court last month for violating his probation.
After Wheeler pleaded guilty to the fraud and larceny counts against him in December 2010, Superior Court Justice Diane M. Kottmyer suspended his prison sentence, giving him a ten-year probation term instead. But Wheeler was taken into state custody again last month after he was charged with breaking one of the conditions of his probation agreement—a taboo on identifying himself as a Harvard student.
After that violation, Kottymer remanded Wheeler to Bridgewater State Hospital, a facility in southeastern Massachusetts, for a 40-day psychiatric evaluation.
“It does appear that Mr. Wheeler suffers from a mental illness,” Kottmyer said in November.
But a doctor at Bridgewater reported that in his opinion, Wheeler does not suffer from a mental illness.
Assistant District Attorney John C. Verner said that the hospital report reinforced the Commonwealth’s argument that Wheeler should serve the 2.5 year prison term that was suspended when he first pleaded guilty.
“Despite everything that has happened to Mr. Wheeler prior to being put on probation, he still continues to do what he has been doing: falsifying resumes, lying, and stealing,” Verner said. “Mr. Wheeler is not going to stop doing what he’s doing unless he’s sentenced. He has to be punished.”
Steven A. Sussman, Wheeler’s defense attorney, requested probation rather than prison time for his client, pointing out that Wheeler would lose his apartment and his volunteer position at a shelter if he were incarcerated.
Kottmyer indicated in court on Friday that she had been inclined to send Wheeler to psychiatric therapy sessions rather than prison before reading the report from Bridgewater. But in light of Wheeler’s clean bill of mental health, she ruled differently.
Rather than a mental illness, “the defendant simply has a character flaw that makes him dishonest,” Kottmyer said. “In effect, he was thumbing his nose at the system by performing exactly the same conduct as before.”
She continued, “Sending him to treatment which he doesn’t need and doesn’t perceive himself to need … is basically feeding his sense of himself as a person who can do these things and get away with them without repercussions.”
Wheeler has already served 37 days of his one-year sentence, having been incarcerated for a month following his arraignment in 2010 and for one week in November after the probation violation.
Wheeler was charged in May 2010 with using fabricated letters of recommendation, transcripts, and SAT scores to gain admission to Harvard as a transfer student. He spent more than two years as a Harvard student before his frauds came to light.
While at Harvard, the Kirkland House resident and English concentrator raked in $45,806 in financial aid, grants, and prizes, including a Hoopes Prize that he won in his junior year. Wheeler’s essay that won that prestigious award, usually conferred on senior theses, was later found to have been plagiarized from a graduate student’s dissertation.
During his senior year, he applied for Harvard’s nomination for the Fulbright and Rhodes Scholarships with a plagiarized personal statement. When a fellowship evaluator discovered this fraud, Wheeler left Harvard rather than face an Administrative Board hearing.
Wheeler then applied for transfer admission to several other top-tier universities, using similar fake documents. He gained admission to Stanford University and a program run by Williams College before the criminal investigation which had first been triggered by his plagiarized Fulbright and Rhodes essay led to his indictment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 8:19 to play in Thursday night’s matchup with Florida Atlantic and the score tied at 45-45, the No. 25 Harvard men’s basketball team was in danger of suffering its second defeat of the season.
The Crimson had just turned the ball over for the 17th time on the night, and a physical Owls squad seemed poised to upset a Harvard team fresh off a lengthy exam break.
But with the game in jeopardy, the Crimson (10-1) stepped up and Florida Atlantic (4-8) folded, as Harvard closed the contest on an 18-6 run over the final 7:18 of play for a 63-51 victory.
“We were in a position to win like we’ve been in many, many nights this year, and we just haven’t had the mental toughness to finish them off,” said Owls coach Mike Jarvis, whose squad shot one-of-seven and turned it over twice during the Crimson’s final run. “We’re not finishing what we started. It was another game I think we could have won.”
While Jarvis’ squad struggled shooting the ball down the stretch in particular, it was a problem that plagued the visitors the entire night. Florida Atlantic shot 38.5 percent from the field and an abysmal 3-of-17 from beyond the arc.
But the Crimson, which coughed the ball up 10 times in the first half alone, had its own struggles, finishing with 17 turnovers, matching a season-high. Besides its struggles holding onto the ball, Harvard’s offense was efficient, converting 55.3 percent of its attempts from the field and 50 percent from deep. The Crimson also got the job done on the glass, outrebounding the Owls, 34-20.
Co-captain Keith Wright led the way for Harvard on the boards, pulling down a game-high 11 rebounds to go along with 12 points, giving him his second double-double of the season. Junior point guard Brandyn Curry also added 12 points, while junior Christian Webster chipped in with eight.
Florida Atlantic, which was without its leading scorer Greg Gantt, was paced by Raymond Taylor, a speedy 5’6 point guard who posted 14 points and five assists, both team highs.
“I don’t think there is anybody else in the NCAA like him—that small with those handles, so quick, and such a good scorer and passer,” said Curry, who was charged with the primary task of defending Taylor. “He’s a tough guard. We knew going in he was going to be in attack mode.”
But excluding Taylor, the Owls starters combined for just 13 points on 5-of-24 shooting. Even so, Florida Atlantic grabbed a two-point lead, 45-43, with 10:03 to play after 6’8 forward Jordan McCoy pulled an offensive board and powered to the basket for two of his eight points on the evening.
But it would prove to be the Owls’  last advantage of the night, as the Crimson took over the game’s final minutes, scoring 18 points in the final 7:18 of play and surrendering just six.
“When we tied it up, you’ve got to seize the moment,” Jarvis said. “You’ve got to take advantage of the opportunity. You’ve got to make a couple baskets. If we had got ahead of these guys by two or three baskets, we would have won this game.”
“When you play a good team on their court, you can’t have mental lapses for periods and stretches of the game like we did tonight,” he added.
Harvard relied on strong play of Curry, Wright, and co-captain Oliver McNally down the stretch, as the trio combined for 17 of the Crimson’s final 18 points. Curry ignited the run with a pair of free throws, and McNally created separation one minute later by knocking down a triple from the left corner.
Following McNally’s three-pointer, Florida Atlantic’s Pablo Bertone missed a layup, and on the other end, Wright spun toward the basket and finished a two-handed dunk. On Harvard’s next possession, Wright tipped in a missed shot from Curry, putting the home team ahead by eight, 55-47, with 4:39 to go.
Curry put the Crimson up by 10 one minute later, and Harvard’s lead never fell into single digits the rest of the way.
“We were very pleased with the way we responded during critical situations,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad will get back on the court Dec. 29 at Boston College. “It was great to see our kids come through in those types of moments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New number, new team, new season.
A lot has changed over the past few months for former Harvard basketball star Jeremy Lin ’10.
But one thing has remained the same: Lin's fight to make it in the NBA continues to be an uphill battle.
Lin left Harvard as one of 11 finalists for the Bob Cousy Award for the nation’s best point guard and as the only player in Ivy League history to record 1,450 points, 450 rebounds, 400 assists, and 200 steals.
He went undrafted, but caught on with the Dallas Mavericks’ summer league team. One standout performance against No. 1 overall pick John Wall later, Lin had signed a three-year endorsement deal with Nike and had the ability to choose his NBA destination from a number of offers.
The Palo Alto, Calif. native picked the Golden State Warriors, his hometown squad and his favorite team growing up. In the blink of an eye, he had a two-year contract and was living the dream.
“It was unbelievable,” Lin recalls. “Everything happened so fast; looking back it’s like a blur. I just remember it was obviously really fun to play in the summer league and then to all of a sudden sign with the hometown team was definitely very exciting. I was thankful I got to do that.”
But from there, Lin’s rookie year was a roller coaster of highs and lows.
In his third career game, he played 16 minutes and had four steals while scoring his first NBA points against the defending champion Lakers. A fan favorite, Lin notched a career-high 13 points in 18 minutes against L.A. a month later. And he finished the year on a high note, registering 12 points, five rebounds, and five assists in the Warriors’ final game of the season against the Blazers.
But in between was a struggle for the rookie, who had a hard time finding playing time and was thrice sent down to the NBA Developmental League. Though he shined there for the Reno Bighorns—averaging over 20 points per game and being named to the All-NBA D-League Showcase First Team—the constant change was not easy on Lin.
“It was just a tough year,” he says. “Not knowing where I was going to be, going up and down to the D-League—it was tough. But in the end, I got better. I think that was the most important thing. It was a learning experience, and it showed me what I needed to work on and what the holes in my game and areas of improvement were.”
With the NBA lockout stretching into December, Lin had an extended amount of time to focus on those holes. That he did, while also taking the time to rest a knee injury he had suffered during the season. He thus calls the lockout “a blessing in disguise” because it gave him more time to recover.
But in addition to working hard, Lin also had some fun as well. He recorded a number of popular YouTube videos, such as “How to Get into Harvard” and “Jeremy Lin: A Day in the Life.” And though he couldn’t play in NBA games, Lin did partake in two charity exhibitions with some of the league's best players.
First, on Nov. 5, he joined Stephen Curry, David Lee, and the rest of his Warrior “Young Dubs” teammates at Oracle Arena to challenge the 2007 “We Believe” Warriors squad—featuring Baron Davis, Stephen Jackson, and Jason Richardson, among others—which famously knocked off the heavily favored No. 1-seeded Mavericks in the opening round of the NBA playoffs.
Two weeks later, Lin returned to Lavietes Pavilion to take part in the Boston Charity Classic along with Paul Pierce, Rudy Gay, Rajon Rondo, and a host of other NBA stars in his first game back on Harvard’s campus.
“Basically we were just playing for fun, and for supporting charities,” explains Lin, who entertained the Boston crowd by throwing down a number of dunks and scoring 11 points in a two-minute stretch in the third quarter.
One week later, the lockout had ended, and the guard was ready for year two with the Warriors. Yet the delayed start to the season brought about a brief offseason, forcing teams to make a flurry of roster moves in a short amount of time.
The Warriors needed a center, and after missing out on Tyson Chandler, they decided to pursue the Los Angeles Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan. But Jordan was a restricted free agent, meaning Golden State would have to scrap together every dollar it could find to make the biggest offer possible with the hope that LA would not be able to match.
The team thus looked to cut costs where it could, and after having selected guards Klay Thompson and Charles Jenkins in this past year’s draft, Lin—with a non-guaranteed contract—was expendable.
In a move he says he did not anticipate, Lin was waived by the Warriors on Dec. 11, ending his brief stint with the team. Two of the team’s stars were sad to see him go.
“To my man @jlin7…can't say it enough man your work ethic and skills  are gonna pick you right back up…keep the faith bro and keep ya head  up,” tweeted Curry.
“Tough day losing one of our teammates @jlin7.. JLin u are a great ball player and unbelievable teammate and person! We will miss u lil bro!” added Lee via Twitter.
Yet at the end of every tunnel is a light, and Lin found his in Houston, where the Rockets claimed him off waivers the next day.
Though Houston already has point guards Kyle Lowry, Johnny Flynn, and Goran Dragic on its roster, the squad was excited by Lin’s potential.
“We have evaluated Jeremy since his time in Harvard and have also tracked his progress with the Golden State Warriors,” Rockets Vice President of Player Personnel Gersson Rosas wrote in an e-mail. “We feel he is an intriguing player with a solid all around game and a high basketball IQ. He plays to his strengths well and is developing at a solid rate.”
Lin says the Rockets have already let him know what they expect from him.
“Just to be a point guard and a shooting guard here in Houston,” Lin explains. “To play both positions, to make plays, bring it on the defensive end, and to be creative on the offensive end. Just the same thing that I’ve been doing.”
Rosas echoed that sentiment.
“Jeremy is competing for the opportunity to make the Houston Rockets roster in the role of backup point guard,” he wrote. “Our objective would be to aid him in his basketball development in what ever manner possible throughout the season.”
One of the few Asian-Americans to play in the NBA, Lin now has the chance to make his name in the city where Yao Ming—who invited Lin to play with him in Taipei in the summer of 2010—starred for nine years.
For now, Lin says he does not feel there is any part of his game that could not use improvement. Barring a trade, he knows it will be an uphill climb to make the Rockets, who currently have one of the deepest rosters in the league.
But challenge is nothing new for Lin, who received no Division I scholarship offers coming out of high school and just one summer league offer coming out of college. The point guard made the best of his opportunities with Harvard and the Mavericks, and now he’s ready to do everything he can in Houston to prove he belongs once again.
“I’m just excited to go somewhere I’m wanted,” he says. “Right now I’m just trying to make the best of the situation. There’s an adjustment process getting comfortable with everything.”
“It’s really early in the whole situation,” he added. “Hopefully it turns out well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over a month after Penn State began its search to replace the legendary Joe Paterno, the post remains vacant.
One name that has continued to come up in rumors surrounding the position is Harvard coach Tim Murphy, mentioned as an ideal candidate because of on-field success and a clean track record. Murphy became the winningest coach in Harvard football history this season and earned his sixth Ivy title.
But with rumors continuing to circulate, Murphy has adamantly denied any contact with the search committee throughout the process, a claim corroborated by Russ Rose, the Penn State women’s volleyball coach and one of the six members of the search committee.
“I have not met with Mr. Murphy,” Rose said. “I don’t know if he’s talked with other people on the committee or if he has previous relationships with anybody, but I have not met or spoken with him.”
Dave Joyner—the acting Athletic Director who is leading the search committee—told the media before Penn State’s Nov. 19 game against Ohio State that he hoped to name a new head coach in a month’s time.
But that deadline has come and gone, and the committee is still in the process of interviewing candidates.
“My thought would be that [the hire] would happen after [Penn State’s Jan. 2] bowl game,” Rose said. “The university will be closed for a while. I don’t think there will be a decision made [before then].”
With the college football season coming to a close, recruiting is well underway. The Boston Herald and others have suggested that a failure to quickly name a new head coach will even further damage Penn State’s recruiting efforts, which took a major hit in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal. Already, two major recruits have backed out of verbal commitments.
“The search committee is aware of the recruiting calendar,” said assistant athletic director Jeff Nelson.
