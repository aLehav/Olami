After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Suddenly, it has been over a decade since many of us sat in front of our televisions and watched, enraptured, as the brilliant cartoon creations churned out by Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network flashed before our eyes. In that time, the societal climate has shifted dramatically, in terms of both values and purely artistic concerns. Arts Blog examines the lasting values and influence of iconic episodes and attempts to contextualize them “in a modern lens.” This week, we examine the classic “Rock A Bye Bi-Valve”
On March 29, 2002, Nickelodeon aired an episode of “SpongeBob Squarepants” that made its exuberant, yellow protagonist the subject of controversy and outrage for conservative and Christian groups. In this episode, SpongeBob and his best friend, a male starfish named Patrick, adopt a baby scallop and raise it together under one (pineapple) roof. Some critics interpreted the episode as a depiction of gay adoption and decried it as an attempt to normalize homosexuality to young audiences. It’s questionable to accuse a children’s cartoon series of an underhanded political agenda, especially since the series’ creator, Stephen Hillenburg, has stated that the spongy protagonist is asexual. However, some aesthetic and narrative aspects of “Rock a Bye Bi-Valve” point to both forward-thinking and frighteningly reactionary rhetoric.
Though the episode’s controversy stems from accusations of a pro-gay agenda, it is debatable how progressive “Rock a Bye Bi-Valve” actually is. When the episode originally aired in 2002, gay marriage was illegal in every American state. Patrick and SpongeBob’s decision to raise the scallop and respectively take the roles of mother and father is not only less shocking in 2014 but also appears regressive. Patrick and SpongeBob’s need to decide who shall be the scallop’s mother and father even though both are male illustrates the pair’s internalized notions of the nuclear family. Even though Patrick volunteers to be the mother, SpongeBob says that would not be possible since Patrick “never wears a shirt.” Extending SpongeBob’s gender-normative logic, Patrick admits, “If I was a mom, this would be kind of shocking,” as the camera zooms out to reveal his hairy chest and paunch.
Even if the episode truly depicted gay marriage, it would represent a gay marriage that implicitly follows heteronormative expectations by having both male individuals conform to a gender binary. When Patrick and SpongeBob are shown quickly adapting to their assigned roles in a parenting montage, their quaint attire—a bow tie and boater hat for Patrick and a polka-dotted dress and parasol for SpongeBob—underscores the societal gender norms they copy. The pair even sleeps in separate beds, with SpongeBob sleeping on top of two mattresses and Patrick sandwiched between them.  Though this could be a matter of preference since Patrick typically sleeps under a rock, this choice echoes old sitcoms in which married couples slept in separate beds in order to avoid the issue of sex. It’s even possible to view SpongeBob and Patrick as the aesthetic predecessors of fictional television couple Cam and Mitchell Pritchett from “Modern Family,” whose lack of physical intimacy has been noted by critics.
The episode, however, does show some progressive leanings in illustrating how this gendered parenting dynamic leads to strife in SpongeBob and Patrick’s relationship. When Patrick and SpongeBob wear their normal attire, their interactions with Junior are more positive and equal, suggesting that the familial unit can function without restrictive gender norms. However, since SpongeBob is the “mother” and Patrick is the “father,” SpongeBob is assigned the role of stay-at-home parent and Patrick is to be the breadwinner. Given that SpongeBob is employed at The Krusty Krab and Patrick’s career, if any, is unmentioned, this choice seems to be the result of gender-normativity rather than merit or context. This division of labor is quickly shown to be unequal since SpongeBob has to take care of the scallop—at this point formally christened as “Junior”—all day and Patrick neglects to help. Every evening after Patrick returns from work, he makes a beeline for the television, ignoring a frantic SpongeBob who is simultaneously beating a rug, washing a window, ironing a shirt, vacuuming, flipping pancakes, and holding a wailing Junior. When SpongeBob confronts Patrick, he calls him “Mr. Man” angrily, underscoring the inequity of a system where familial duties are delegated by gender rather than equality.
Eventually the tension between Patrick and SpongeBob reaches a critical point when SpongeBob confronts Patrick for pretending to work all day. While they argue, Junior jumps out of a window. Patrick and SpongeBob fail to catch him and wail that they’re “bad parents.” When it’s revealed that Junior has not fallen but rather flown to safety, the image is a reassuring one; Patrick and SpongeBob have managed to raise their child to be a self-sufficient individual regardless of their shenanigans. Though Junior is able to fly away, Patrick proposes to SpongeBob that they should have “another one,” suggesting that this parental strife will come to repeat itself and providing a parting cynical accent to a varied account of domestic pressures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After months of questions, guesses, and rumors, the Yardfest Committee was excited and proud to finally announce our selection of Janelle Monáe as the Yardfest 2014 headliner. This recent announcement was the result of considerable planning as part of a process about which much is speculated but little is known. It is our hope that this will provide a behind-the-scenes look into our process.
In the middle of October, six students gather in the Basement Conference Room of University Hall. Three represent the College Events Board, the student group responsible for planning many campus-wide events, from free movie screenings to the Welcome Back Event and the Harvard-Yale Pep Rally. Three others represent the Harvard College Concert Commission, a group formed specifically to plan and execute Yardfest. Joining them are two advisors who are staff members in the Office of Student Life.
After setting preliminary goals, the committee examines its projected timeline, which suggests that the headlining artist be selected by the Friday of Harvard-Yale weekend, and no later than the end of the fall semester’s reading week. With only a month or so to select the artist, the committee immediately gets to work through a conference call with the artist-booking agency that represents the university. The agency, a Boston-based firm that works with several colleges nationwide, serves as the intermediary for the committee, placing calls to artists’ agents.
In the week that follows, the committee, together with our representative from the agency, assembles an initial list of about 40 artists, divided by genre and evaluated based on criteria, including but not limited to popularity, rising star potential, and, importantly, price. In order to narrow this list down to our final list of 10, the committee then designs and distributes a campus-wide survey, which asks not only about the preferred genre of the artist but also about the number of artists, the atmosphere, and vibe that students are seeking at Yardfest. 
The survey is live for a week, generally garnering close to 2,000 responses. With data and voices from the community in hand, the committee narrows the set of 40 artists to a ranked list of seven to 10 options. Starting with our top choice and working down, our representative from the agency begins calling artists’ agents to discuss pricing and availability. After weeks of discussions, false alarms, and price changes, the committee ultimately agrees in principle with the headlining artist.
This year, it didn’t take many calls to discover strong mutual interest between the committee and Janelle. We reached an agreement with her in the middle of December, within our projected timeline, but were unable to announce the exciting news until her contract was finalized just prior to spring break. A lengthy development time for the contract is often necessary, as details as significant as event security and as minor as the type of soda in the green room are all discussed. Eventually, though, the dotted line is signed, allowing us to bring to you the winner of Billboard’s 2013 Rising Star Award, Janelle Monáe.
An artist in the true sense of the word, Janelle Monáe immediately captivates her audience with her energy, powerful vocals, and robust backing band that all mix pop, funk, electronic, and R&B sounds into a uniquely feel-good vibe. Drawing on a wide range of influences, from sci-fi novels to afrofuturism to Stevie Wonder, Janelle is “carving her own path in the industry,” according to Billboard Editorial Director Bill Werde.
Between her major albums, “Metropolis: The Chase Suite,” “The ArchAndroid,” and 2013’s “The Electric Lady,” which opened at number five on the Billboard 500, Janelle has collaborated with Prince, Miguel, Big Boi, and others, and has garnered six Grammy nominations, an MTV Video Music Award, and this year’s Rising Star awards from Billboard and Variety.
She’s performed on Saturday Night Live, at the NBA All-Star Game, and even at the White House, all since the end of October. 
A rapidly rising star on and off the stage, the Electric Lady is sure to electrify the Yardfest crowd. So wear your tanks, your sunglasses, and your dancing shoes. Or at least ones you won’t mind getting a little muddy. And don’t forget your Harvard College ID. 
We’ll see you there!

Pilar I. Fitzgerald ’15 is an English concentrator in Quincy House. Andrew W. Schutts ’16 is a government concentrator in Lowell House. Jeremy M. Tchack ’15 is a human development and regenerative biology concentrator in Quincy House. They are members of the Yardfest Committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Administrative Board statistics detailing the outcomes of cases heard by the disciplinary body in the last academic year show that, as expected, the number of students required to temporarily withdraw from the College for academic dishonesty was more than three times higher than the number in 2011-2012.
According to the statistics, released Friday on the Ad Board’s website after repeated requests from The Crimson, 97 students involved in academic integrity cases were required to withdraw in 2012-2013, the year that saw Harvard’s largest cheating investigation in recent memory.
Roughly 70 of those 97 students, according to previous statements from administrators, were implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal, in which about 125 students were accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on the course’s final take-home exam.
This would mean that about 27 students outside of the Gov 1310 case were required to withdraw for academic dishonesty last year, a number consistent with the previous academic year, in which 26 students were required to withdraw in academic dishonesty cases.
The number of students who were placed on disciplinary probation due to academic dishonesty also rose to 31 in 2012-2013, compared to only 16 students in 2011-2012. Administrators have previously said that about half of the students implicated in the Gov 1310 case who were not required to withdraw were placed on probation. In 2012-2013, the Ad Board took no action in 14 academic dishonesty cases, compared to just one in 2011-2012.
Administrators have said since 2010 that they plan to increase the Ad Board’s transparency through the release of more detailed case summaries, but have delayed the release of that database in the years since, leaving the five-year statistics as the most detailed public information available on the body’s proceedings.
Until Friday, however, the 2012-2013 statistics were not publicly available on the Ad Board’s website. Now, as released, the public statistics include a count of the outcomes of cases in several broad categories, from academic dishonesty and “social behavior - alcohol” disciplinary cases to petitions for advanced standing.
According to Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, the more detailed statistics that would be included in the database have been delayed by concerns over how to increase the Board’s transparency while still maintaining the privacy of students involved in its proceedings. He wrote in a statement that administrators have “not yet determined how to overcome this substantial hurdle.”
Pfister further wrote that with conversations regarding privacy concerns and the creation of a student-faculty honor board to hear academic integrity cases ongoing, he decided to release the 2012-2013 Ad Board statistics “in the same manner we had in the past.”
The 2012-2013 numbers are part of a document that includes Ad Board statistics from the past five academic years, since 2008-2009.
According to the statistics, the number of cases listed under the category of “social behavior - alcohol” decreased from 2011-2012. Last academic year, 52 cases under this category went before the Ad Board, while 69 such cases did in 2011-2012. The number of “House warnings” issued in disciplinary cases also decreased, to 74 last year from 109 in 2011-2012.
For cases of “academic review,” which involve students who receive unsatisfactory grades or fail to meet the College’s minimum academic requirements, the Ad Board voted to “take no action” in 87 of those cases in 2012-2013, more than double the number of votes in 2011-2012. According to the Ad Board website, the Board can vote to “take no action” and merely warn students in cases where an unsatisfactory student record results from “compelling and well-documented extenuating circumstances.”

Yardfest is just around the corner, and maybe you’ve re-listened to all your Janelle Monáe albums or at least gotten a feel for what to expect from her act. If you’ve done neither, Flyby has got you covered—here are five Monáe songs to know before you see her on Sunday.


 
1. “Tightrope”
 
As the first single from Monáe’s debut album “The ArchAndroid,” this song is the classic of all classic Janelle Monáe songs. Encompassing all that is powerful about Monáe’s songs, the song includes a beat that gets you dancing, profound lyrics like “This ain’t no acrobatics / You either follow or you lead” that anyone can feel, and even rap from Big Boi.
 
2. “Cold War”
 
Released one day after “Tightrope,” this song is also thoughtful and has the brilliant beat invested in all of Monáe’s song. “This is a cold war / You better know what you’re fighting for,” says the chorus. Dark? Maybe. But with such an upbeat melody backing up the vocals and the drive of the drums, the force is strong with this one.
 
3. “Q.U.E.E.N.” 
The song includes a powerful and inspiring about being yourself, served in a creative manner. “Am I a freak for dancing around? / Am I freak for getting down? / I’m cutting up, don’t cut me down / And yeah I wanna be, wanna be” is just one existential verse.
 
4. “Dance Apocalyptic”
 
Sometimes you just want to jam out to a rocking beat, and “Dance Apocalyptic” is one of those songs in Monáe’s repertoire. References to zombies and hitmen abound in this exhibition of Monáe’s quirkiness. There’s a distinct bubbly character to it that will make you hop out of that chair and start dancing, all the way to the apocalypse.
 
5. “Electric Lady” 
There’s something about this song that is just infectious. This song may not have its own official music video, and the beat isn’t too speedy, but its rhythm and lyrics combine to something that’ll keep you bopping your head and feeling electric.

UPDATED: April 12, 2014, at 5:46 p.m.
Flyby sat down to catch up with Hot Breakfast after their recent Battle of the Bands Victory.
We touched base with Mike Senter-Zapata ‘14, Paul Castrigano ‘14, Pranav Krishanan ‘16, and Sam Berman Cooper ‘14 about how they’re feeling about their Yardfest performance on Sunday. Not present for the interview was drummer Mateus Falci ‘14. 
 
Flyby: How are you guys feeling about Yardfest?PC: We’re really excited. We thought that winning the Battle for Yardfest was the culmination of the semester up to this point. Pranav?PK: Yes, Paul? We’re just really excited and grateful for the opportunity.SBC: I’m so excited to be opening for Janelle Monae, she’s one of my favorite artists.  The chance to play Yardfest my senior year really just represents everything I could have hoped for this spring.
Flyby: How many songs do you plan to play?MSZ: We’re aiming to hit seven or eight.
Flyby: So this is the first time you’ll be playing a venue as big as Yardfest, you guys nervous about that?PC: Before any show we get a little nervous. It will be no different this time around. But once we get into the groove after a song or two it’s usually fine and we don’t feel the nerves. Also, we’ll probably be a little buzzed.SBC: As will everybody else.
Flyby: Pre-show rituals?MSZ: Oh triceps!PC: We huddle, it’s pretty bro-y.SBC: We do push ups.PC: Sometimes we work out together to look better. We usually do a group huddle and focus up to get us in the zone.SBC: We beef a lot.
Flyby: Beef?PC: It’s like an inside joke. We don’t even know. It started with our drummer.MSZ: We don’t know what it means, we just say it.PC: We make fun of ourselves. Self-deprecation.MSZ: Deprecation? I think you meant self-defecation, Paul.PC: Pre-show ritual: we make sure that Sam is in the right state of mind sometimes.MSZ: The group huddle is as close as we have to a set ritual.
Flyby: Are you guys all seniors?PK: No, I’m a sophomore.PC, SBC, MS-Z: Softmoooree.PK: They’re all going to graduate and I’ll still be here all alone.MSZ: We’re trying to get Pranav to take time off from school and tour the world with us.
Flyby: Pranav, will you form a new Hot Breakfast?PK: I was thinking more like Cold Brunch. I don’t think I want to start a band though, I’ll definitely join one.
Flyby: What if you joined Semi-Serious and made it a Cold Semi-Serious Brunch?PK: That’s a possibility.
Flyby: How do you guys feel about Pranav moving on without you guys?PC: We’re all moving on without him.
Flyby: How do you feel, Pranav, about being the one left behind?PK: I’m in a dark place, guys. I’ll miss you guys though, we’ve only been together for one semester.
Flyby: How do you handle your groupies?PC: What groupies?SBC: They’re just dudes.PC: We don’t have girls throwing themselves at us.MSZ: We have guys taking off their shirts and throwing them at us.PK: Which is cool, until I cry at home at night.PC: We actually have a song about that, which we’re recording now. We’re going to play it at Yardfest.
 
Flyby: Half the people at Battle of the Bands left after you guys finished playing. You obviously have a huge following. What do you owe that to?PC: By this point, we’re seniors, so we have bigger networks and groups of friends. Our friends have been really good fans and they’re always bringing people and bringing excitement to our gigs. They make us feel popular and loved, which makes us play better and them enjoy it more.SBC: We’re so grateful for our fans because they come to everything. Some of our fans know our set better than we do.PC: They’re like “oh you messed up!” We owe our gratitude to blockmates of ours, a lot of the guys in the Fox, the Oak, the Opportunes, Eliot Cockpit, and people from the Co-Op.
Flyby: Will Janelle be invited back to the Fox after the show?PC: Is that a thing? Tyga left right after the show last year.SBC: I’m probably going to propose. I think I’m going to get a ring, not an expensive ring. You know, one of those plastic Burger King rings.
Flyby: You should get her a ring pop!SBC: Yeah, a ring pop, exactly. Who would turn that down?PC: Probably Janelle Monáe.
Flyby: Favorite hot breakfast item, it could be a person in the band or a food:MSZ: Sausage.PK: I don’t eat breakfast.SBC: Dude, dude, corn beef from Jim’s deli. Oh my god, that will knock you out.PC: Yeah sausage.
 
 
The day finally arrives. After months of waiting and years of preparation, you find out whether or not you got in to the school of your dreams. You then open the e-mail or letter only to find that your wait time has been further extended. You have been placed on the infamous waitlist, essentially telling you that the school likes you and wants to accept you, but perhaps there were better candidates or you were not a top priority.
 
Some would argue that this is better than rejection. There’s still a chance, still a hope that your dream could come true. Many, however, feel that this is a worse scenario. Accepting your spot on the waitlist is like accepting your place in purgatory. With all the painful waiting already done, it would almost be more humane to just reject students flat out. Put them out of their misery. But this defeatist attitude doesn't get you anywhere. There’s no harm in accepting your spot in the waitlist. Why close that door before you know for sure what’s on the other side? Keep your options open.
 
The waitlist does not have to be such a tragic fate, and there are many ways to improve your chances you’ve accepted your position. Here are some tips to living in limbo:

1. First of all, you did not get rejected. If they really did not want or like you, they would have had no qualms about rejecting you. You almost made it. Sometimes a silver medal is more bitter than the bronze, but it’s still a step above on the podium.
 
2. You’re now given a chance to reevaluate. How do you feel about being waitlisted? If your reaction is a shrug of the shoulders, chances are the school isn’t as important to you as you may have previously thought. Revisit the school to see if this is something you still want to actively pursue. If a spot opens up over the summer, you want to be ready to make an informed decision immediately. If you’re devastated by this news, don’t be. There’s still hope. However...
 
3. Do not plan your future on that hope. Yes, there is a chance you’ll still get in, but statistically speaking, this is a small chance. You may accept your position on the waitlist and develop a plan of action, but in the meantime, celebrate the schools you did get into. You’re going to college. That’s a huge achievement that many of us take for granted, and is something that not everyone gets to say.
 
Once you accept your spot on the waitlist, you need to act. My high school college counselors typically recommended the following plan of attack after college acceptances:
1. Write a letter to the admissions office, telling them that you remain hopeful and extremely interested in their school. Sell yourself again and include any updates on your life, academics, or extracurricular activities, since they last heard from you.
2. Make sure to keep your grades up. Strong academics never hurt anyone, and another positive point data point in your file will only help your case. 
3. Have another recommendation written. Try to get this letter to show you from a different angle. If you had an English teacher and a history teacher write your first two letters of recommendation, get a math or science teacher to write this one.
 
The waitlist can seem like the end of the world, but it’s not. It’s not even the end of the road, just the start of a different path.
