After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert Frost claims that nothing gold can stay. Nature’s first hue rusts green, and once tarnished, can never be scoured to gleam aureate again. Yet, like morning dew, both colors find their way to remain ever-present, clinging to the crops of Harvard students right before harvest. The shears snip and uproot the next lot, but with green eyes and gilded hands clutching our degrees we convince ourselves that this is the way to color our futures for success.
Isn’t this what we always wanted, to come from our respective backgrounds and become successful—to make our families proud? To be worthy of the chances that have been taken on us through the admissions process and prove to the collective rest that this opportunity of a lifetime was not lost on us?
We’ve communicated to ourselves that worthiness can only be understood through the hieroglyphics of dollar signs: A salary of X amount outputted equals a measurable amount of the capacity and capability of an individual that was inputted to garner this amount. As a fellow Ivy League student so “eloquently” put it, we are slated for socioeconomic mobility, expected to flow easily into a higher economic bracket than the one from which we came from given our green, ivied degrees. For me—and for many other students on elite campuses—this means that we should empathize with this kind of wealth, venerate it even, because of the privileges it brings and the status it demonstrates.
Attending these elite campuses have a tendency to ingrain this pattern of thought within students. Even before the moment we step on campus, the perception of attending a school like ours dominates how others expect us to fare in our post-graduate careers. Family members will remind us to take advantage of our education so that we can be “better off” than the previous generation. Once we’re here, we’re reminded that the names of our schools will provide us with the platform to springboard into the upper echelons of society. To maintain a sense of self-integrity once falling prey to these ideas (in endeavoring to keep their reflection glistening with goodness and efficacy when confronted with the idea that they’re selling out), many shirk away from the idea that seeing success as wealth is a false conflation. Whether, in the pursuit of wealth as success, their steps are lined with the hopes of bettering their family status, of making others proud, or as the only way they know how to climb to success, they are unfortunately misguided.
The blatant fetishization of this plausible wealth after attending an elite university is not only myopic, but outright unhealthy. We chuck ad hominem insults at it because we are afraid of having an honest, moral debate about capitalism. We support virtue-signaling and philanthrocapitalism from those bequeathed with wealth to soften their perception, to make their status more relatable and thereby more attainable. We revere wealth as a tool to prove ourselves, to safeguard our inability to conceptualize a definition of success that isn’t silhouetted in green and gold. In continuing to place wealth on a pedestal, leveling it on the same playing field upon which we place our happiness and self-worth, we render ourselves naked, susceptible to failure.
Using wealth as a metric for success is an unreachable expectation. Wealth has no ceiling, no marker for when one has reached it and can now be content with the hard work they’ve put into a specific task or goal. Wealth is not a cure-all: it does not promise to become a salvation from our woes nor a salve for our shortcomings. Wealth is not the means by which we can “transform all [our] incapacities into the contrary,” and we should not dress it up as such.
Accepting a Harvard or Ivy League education can lead to wealth. And this is not inherently a bad thing; it could be a reflection of hard work and the result of a passion pursued, dashed with luck, and resulting in a monetary profit. However, when fetishized as the only way to measure an individual’s worth or success, or when held in a higher regard than pursuing one’s passions, it becomes a tragedy of a Grecian order.  In using money as our feathers and good intentions our tar to fashion Icarian wings, with our sights set on the sun, we don’t fully realize our capacity to be blinded by these greens and golds until it’s too late.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1988, my twenty-six-year-old father jumped off a train in the middle of Hungary with nothing but the clothes on his back. For the next two years, he fled an oppressive Romanian Communist regime that would kill him if they ever laid hands on him again.
My father ran from a government that beat, tortured, and brainwashed its citizens. His childhood friend disappeared after scrawling an insult about the dictator on the school bathroom wall. His neighbors starved to death from food rations designed to combat “obesity.” As the population dwindled, women were sent to the hospital every month to make sure they were getting pregnant.
My father’s escape journey eventually led him to the United States. He moved to the Midwest and married a Romanian woman who had left for America the minute the regime collapsed. Today, my parents are doctors in quiet, suburban Kansas. Both of their daughters go to Harvard. They are the lucky ones.
Roughly 100 million people died at the hands of the ideology my parents escaped. They cannot tell their story. We owe it to them to recognize that this ideology is not a fad, and their deaths are not a joke.
Last month marked 100 years since the Bolshevik Revolution, though college culture would give you precisely the opposite impression. Depictions of communism on campus paint the ideology as revolutionary or idealistic, overlooking its authoritarian violence. Instead of deepening our understanding of the world, the college experience teaches us to reduce one of the most destructive ideologies in human history to a one-dimensional, sanitized narrative.
Walk around campus, and you’re likely to spot Ché Guevara on a few shirts and button pins. A sophomore jokes that he’s declared a secondary in “communist ideology and implementation.” The new Leftist Club on campus seeks “a modern perspective” on Marx and Lenin to “alleviate the stigma around the concept of Leftism.” An author laments in these pages that it’s too difficult to meet communists here. For many students, casually endorsing communism is a cool, edgy way to gripe about the world.
After spending four years on a campus saturated with Marxist memes and jokes about communist revolutions, my classmates will graduate with the impression that communism represents a light-hearted critique of the status quo, rather than an empirically violent philosophy that destroyed millions of lives.
Statistics show that young Americans are indeed oblivious to communism’s harrowing past. According to a YouGov poll, only half of millennials believe that communism was a problem, and about a third believe that President George W. Bush killed more people than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who killed 20 million. If you ask millennials how many people communism killed, 75 percent will undershoot.
Perhaps before joking about communist revolutions, we should remember that Stalin’s secret police tortured “traitors” in secret prisons by sticking needles under their fingernails or beating them until their bones were broken. Lenin seized food from the poor, causing a famine in the Soviet Union that induced desperate mothers to eat their own children and peasants to dig up corpses for food. In every country that communism was tried, it resulted in massacres, starvation, and terror.
Communism cannot be separated from oppression; in fact, it depends upon it. In the communist society, the collective is supreme. Personal autonomy is nonexistent. Human beings are simply cogs in a machine tasked with producing utopia; they have no value of their own.
Many in my generation have blurred the reality of communism with the illusion of utopia. I never had that luxury. Growing up, my understanding of communism was personalized; I could see its lasting impact in the faces of my family members telling stories of their past. My perspective toward the ideology is radically different because I know the people who survived it; my relatives continue to wonder about their friends who did not.
The stories of survivors paint a more vivid picture of communism than the textbooks my classmates have read. While we may never fully understand all of the atrocities that occurred under communist regimes, we can desperately try to ensure the world never repeats their mistakes. To that end, we must tell the accounts of survivors and fight the trivialization of communism’s bloody past.
My father left behind his parents, friends, and neighbors in the hope of finding freedom. I know his story because it is my heritage; you now know his story because I have a voice. One hundred million other people were silenced.
One hundred years later, let us not forget the history of the victims who do not have a voice because they did not survive the writing of their tales. Most importantly, let us not be tempted to repeat it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropic organization founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan ’07, is donating $12.1 million to make public service more accessible to low-income students at Harvard. We are thankful for the Initiative’s gift, which will fund the creation of two public service programs at Harvard. The Priscilla Chan Summer Service Award will cover the summer earning expectations for students working for the Center for Public Interested Careers, Institute of Politics, or Phillips Brooks House Association. The Priscilla Chan Stride Service Program will help PBHA create year-round service fellowship programs for low-income students. We hope this gift is just one of many steps in Harvard’s continuing commitment to public service.
Currently, a multitude of barriers preclude Harvard students from participating in public service. One major barrier is lack of infrastructure—while the Office of Career Services has robust resources for students looking for work in finance or consulting, there are fewer resources in terms of internships and career counseling for students who want to pursue careers in public service. Lack of awareness is another barrier, as opportunities in public service are not often talked about and thus often seen as less attractive and more invisible than corporate work. In a culture where profit rules, it can be hard to get students interested in public service, which has lower earning potential.
Financial barriers make pursuing public service especially difficult for low-income students, who often need to spend time working at a job instead of doing public service for little to no pay. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s gift addresses this barrier by providing funding for students from low-income students who would not have been able to do this work otherwise. This makes public service more democratic and accessible to students from all backgrounds.
Ultimately, our acceptance of the donation must come with an understanding of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s close ties to Facebook. The Initiative is a limited liability company, created in December 2015 with the pledge to invest up to $1 billion of the Zuckerbergs’ own Facebook shares in each of the next three years.
The Initiative’s donation to PBHA comes as residents from a Silicon Valley city protested the eviction of homeless families last week near the site of a planned school funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. This is especially relevant, as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has championed two political causes in particular—mass incarceration and affordable housing—committing $45 million in the past year. Part of these funds have been pledged to fight homelessness in the Bay Area communities that surround Facebook’s headquarters. This points to a larger problem with Facebook’s involvement in the Bay Area: the social and economic problems in these communities have often been partly the result of increasing housing costs from the technology industry’s own gentrification of the area.
As the role of philanthrocapitalism increases in the public service landscape, it is essential to note that while the public attention the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative brings to the causes it champions is important, the very corporate decisions that these same companies make often are the ones that affect the economic reality of their own surrounding communities.
Let this be a lesson to Harvard and our initiatives for public service. While we send our students out to do good in our community, we must be mindful of the ways that Harvard’s presence in Cambridge and Allston may negatively impact our neighbors, such as the gentrification of Harvard Square and surrounding areas.
Moving forward, we hope that Harvard’s commitment to public service is reflected in its choice of the next University president, and that the presidential search committee considers the need to create more public service opportunities for students in its decision. By extension, candidates with a strong background in public service who have the ability to solicit large contributions like this one for the University should be given especially serious consideration. The future University president should recognize the value that resources such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gift provide in nurturing the student body’s commitment to public service.

Derek G. Xiao ’19 will lead the newly elected 145th Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the organization’s President announced on Friday.
Xiao, a Government concentrator from San Ramon, Calif. and an Adams House resident, currently serves as one of The Crimson’s College Administration reporters. In that capacity, he has covered Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and the administration of Harvard College, Harvard’s social group penalties, and undergraduate affairs. He is also an Associate Multimedia Editor, responsible for the photos and videos in each day’s paper. Xiao will begin as President on January 1, 2018.
“I could not be more proud of—and excited for—the entire masthead of the 145th Guard, but in particular, the three individuals who will take the helm this coming year,” current Crimson president Derek K. Choi ’18 said.
News writer Hannah Natanson ’19 will serve as the guard’s Managing Editor, overseeing the production of the organization’s daily newspaper, magazine and arts sections, and blog. Natanson, an English concentrator and Adams House resident who hails from Washington, D.C., currently serves with Xiao as a College Administration reporter.
She has broken stories about the implementation of the College's social group policy, gender inequity in the Mathematics Department, and academic dishonesty in Computer Science 50: "Introduction to Computer Science I."
Next year’s Business Manager will be Nathan Y. Lee ’19, a Computer Science concentrator and resident of Pforzheimer House from South Pasadena, Calif. He will take the helm of The Crimson’s finances and operations after serving this year as an Advertising Manager, Associate Design Editor, and software engineer.
Founded in 1873, The Crimson is the student newspaper of Harvard University, the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper in the United States, and the only breakfast-table daily publication of Cambridge, Mass. It is proud to serve a wide range of Harvard affiliates, Cambridge residents, and national readers.
The Crimson selects its leaders through an election process called the Turkey Shoot, in which all outgoing members of the masthead are invited to participate. A candidate for a senior leadership position must receive at least 75 percent of the vote to be elected.
Joining Xiao, Natanson, and Lee on the masthead are:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust discussed educational inequality last week in Washington, D.C. in front of a crowd of 600 at a “Your Harvard” alumni event.
The event, which featured remarks from U.S. Representative John R. Lewis, took place at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture on the anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling that banned racial segregation on buses in 1956.
The evening was the latest in a series of “Your Harvard” appearances Faust has made around the country and world, including in Beijing, Mexico City, New York, and Boston. Tailored to alumni and Harvard supporters, the events have coincided with Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, which has raised more than $8 billion as of June 2017 and will end in June 2018.
Calling Lewis one of her heroes, Faust recalled the education efforts of 1,500 volunteers who registered voters and started “freedom schools” during the summer of 1964.
“What Freedom Summer volunteer could have imagined that we would still be discussing today, in this museum, the persisting gap in educational attainment in a nation where, after more than 50 years, access to education is still not equal?” Faust said.
Lewis talked about how civil rights leaders inspired him, adding that he commended Harvard graduates who challenge injustice.
“Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. and my teachers inspired me to get in the way, to get in trouble,” Lewis said, “what I call today ‘the good trouble.’ And I want to thank you, as graduates of Harvard University, as leaders, for getting in the way. Thank you for getting into trouble.”
Faust reflected on Harvard’s role in educational equity, calling for continued efforts to close the education gap.
“The pursuit of truth and the pursuit of education have defined Harvard’s purpose. And that purpose has led inexorably — even if far too gradually and sometimes haltingly — toward increasing access and inclusion, toward opening the gates of learning,” Faust said. “We must continue to advance the hope and the reality of what education can achieve.”
The event also included a faculty panel about inequity in education with Law School professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, economics professor Roland G. Fryer, and Dean of the Graduate School of Education James Ryan.
Fryer, who is the faculty director of the Education Innovation Laboratory, said that schools can be “accelerators” for students who attend them. But he added that students' backgrounds can influence how much they’re able to bring to their educations.
“Some of the best schools in the world can take kids who are in poverty and get them to ‘pass the test.’ But if we got them kids who just got more sleep or were ready to learn when they got there, they would be ready to excel more,” Fryer said. “I believe in parents having more choices. We need to decouple the relationship between exactly where you live and the quality of education.”
At past “Your Harvard” events, Faust has spoken about and hosted panels on the importance of the University’s global reach.

The committee tasked with selecting Harvard’s next president will begin “phase two” of the search—winnowing a list of nearly 700 unique nominations—by the end of December, according to William F. Lee '72, the Harvard Corporation's senior fellow.
In an interview Thursday, Lee said the search committee—which he chairs—is currently rounding out its “information-gathering phase.” During this phase, members of the Corporation and the three Overseers on the committee have joined the faculty, student, and staff advisory committees to solicit input from Harvard affiliates.
"It’s really unbelievable how many people we’ve touched,” Lee said. “Almost anybody who’s asked to meet with either someone on one of those committees or one of us, we’ve taken the time to sit down and talk with them."
The input will provide the search committee with a more holistic view of what those with ties to the University would like to see in a candidate, Lee said, adding that members of the committees have met with over 200 people for one-on-one conversations.
While Lee declined to discuss specific candidates, several prominent donors and professors at Harvard told The Crimson last month that there are four likely contenders from within the University: Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. The Crimson also reported last month time that the search committee had started narrowing its list. 
Lee spoke to the general values the committee is looking for. The traditional credentials—“qualifications, experience, [and] expertise”—are not foremost on his mind, he said.
"I’ve actually come to conclude that that’s the wrong way to think about it, because there’s no one person in the world that could have all the experience and expertise you’d like in a Harvard president,” Lee said. “And so it’s more a question of character—integrity, the ability to be trusted, the ability to communicate, emotional intelligence, the ability to grow, and of course intellectual curiosity."
Aside from raw skills and charisma, some have argued that a presidential candidate ought to come from a background in higher education, or, at the very least, hold a doctoral degree. Past contenders—including Supreme Court Justice and former Law School dean Elena Kagan—have seen their presidential hopes dashed due to the lack of a Ph.D.
Lee said there isn’t a cut-and-dry rule on the matter.
“I don’t think that it’s a binary yes-or-no, but it needs to be someone who understands and really believes with all of their heart in the benefit of higher education, and the power of higher education to be the great equalizer in our society,” he said.
Looking forward, the University will also need to grapple with changes in Washington and the Trump-era White House.
According to Lee, the ability to “articulate the case for higher education” on a national level remains a priority. Since the 2016 election, Faust has made several trips to Washington, D.C. to meet with lawmakers for that purpose; last month, she lobbied members of Congress to safeguard universities against cuts to federal research funding.
Instability in Washington isn’t the only challenge the next president will face. In planning for the long term, Lee and his committee are also planning for the unexpected, noting that Harvard will be “wholly different than it is today” in ten years time.
“It's impossible to predict just how, but it’ll be different,” Lee said. “And coming up with a person who can lead us when it’s that different is critically important too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Terrens Muradzikwa ’18 couldn’t fall asleep early Saturday morning.
Instead of studying, Muradzikwa was up reading reports of the events unfolding in Zimbabwe, his home country.
Zimbabwe was plunged into political crisis last week when the military seized power from Robert Mugabe, who has ruled the country for nearly 40 years. Military officers placed Mugabe, the country’s president, under house arrest and have occupied the capital, Harare, since Wednesday.
“My mom had to tell me to go to sleep,” Muradzikwa said. “I was awake until around 4 a.m. trying to keep up to date with the rally that was going on. And my mom was like, ‘no, you need to sleep.’”
Amidst the military takeover, which some observers are calling a coup, some Zimbabweans are hoping for a new political regime after decades of Mugabe’s rule. For Zimbabweans several time zones away at Harvard, this hope has kept them glued to news sites and social media at late hours of the night trying to follow the unfolding political change.
“My academic schedule and everything has been affected, because I spent the last week basically staying up all night. The only time I can dedicate to going through the news and catching up on everything that’s happened that day is during the night,” Rufaro Jarati ’20 said.
Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the end of white minority rule, is clinging to power amid pressure from the military and his political party to resign. Despite news reports that Mugabe had been ousted as leader of his political party, he appeared on television Sunday and refused to resign from power.
This uncertainty has left Zimbabweans across the world, and at Harvard, with a mix of hope and anxiety about the country’s future.
Jarati said he was thrilled when the military first took power last week.
“I was very happy. That’s the first thing, because when you have a 37-year-old problem, however you fix it, you kind of feel happy that it’s getting fixed,” Jarati said.
Sancharz R. Gore ’19 said she did not believe the headlines at first.
“I had already resigned myself to the fact that he was going to be president. In my mind, this man was just going to rule forever, and that’s what was going to happen,” she said.
But Jarati said many Zimbabweans now find themselves asking what will happen next.
“I get that there is a change that is long overdue. But we just don’t know where this is heading right now,” he said.
Concerns about economic stability and a distrust of the military have kept Zimbabweans’ optimism at bay.
“For me as an economics student, I am really concerned about the political instability that arises out of these events,” Muradzikwa said. “Because when most people look at this, they wouldn’t want to invest their money in a country that has political instability.”
Gore said that despite her excitement, she is trying to keep her expectations realistic.
“It’s going to take time, but what matters is that we are in the right direction,” she said. “It’s hard to restart and rebuild a viable economy from nothing. That’s just going to take time.”
On Saturday, roughly a dozen Zimbabwean expatriates rallied in Harvard Square, singing Zimbabwean liberation songs—this time calling on Mugabe to step aside to allow a for peaceful change of power.
Gore, who attended Saturday’s march, said the potential of a leadership change makes it more likely she will return home.
“I have always been thinking how I want to go back home after college. But the way things were, realistically, I could not go back home. So even the thought of going back home became more realistic. I was very ecstatic and jubilant,” Gore said.
Muradzikwa said he shares Gore’s hope.
“I think most students and most people in the diaspora are just hoping for a better Zimbabwe,” he said.  “Because I think most people’s ultimate goal is to go back home and help improve the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 20, 2017 at 12:28 p.m. 
Four American seniors at the College will receive the Rhodes Scholarship and continue their studies at the University of Oxford next October, the American secretary of the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.
Tania N. Fabo ’18, H. Harold X. “Xavier” Gonzalez ’18, Samarth Gupta ’18, and Alan Z. Yang’ 18 will join the ranks of Harvard’s over 350 previous Rhodes Scholars in the fellowship’s 115-year history. Harvard students make up four of the 32 total American Rhodes recipients of the 2018. The prestigious scholarship traditionally pays for two to three years of study at Oxford.
Jamie J. Beaton '17, a New Zealand native, was also named a Rhodes Scholar with the program's international cohort earlier this month. 
Every year, Rhodes Scholars are chosen through a rigorous process that requires applicants to seek endorsements from their college or university. According to the Trust, this year more than 2,500 students sought their institution’s endorsement—but only 866 eventually received endorsements from 299 different colleges and universities.
“Even getting the endorsement was no easy task and there was so much anticipation,” Gupta said. “It took a lot of introspection, but the process was great, win or lose, because it made me reflect on why I thought [the scholarship] would help me with my career.”
Gupta, an economics concentrator who interned with the White House Council of Economic Advisors and captained the Harvard College Running Club while an undergraduate, said he feels grateful and humbled by the award. Gupta said he plans to pursue a master’s degree in comparative social policy at Oxford.
Gonzalez, a mathematics concentrator, said the Rhodes application process was quite difficult.
“It was definitely a process, but I’m very grateful for the lessons I learned from it,” said Gonzalez, who will pursue a Master of Science by research in Mathematics at Oxford.
Gonzalez, who played for the men’s varsity tennis team and served as a Peer Advising Fellow for freshmen while maintaining a perfect grade point average during his time at Harvard, said he is looking forward to continuing his mathematical studies at Oxford. But he said he is just as excited to spend time on the school’s grass courts playing tennis.
“Graduate schools in England let their graduate students play on the tennis team,” he said. “It’s been a really valuable part of my life and I look forward to continuing it.”
Fabo, a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator, said she was “stunned” after learning she had won the Rhodes. Fabo plans to earn a Master of Science by research in oncology at Oxford.
Fabo said she pursued premedical studies at Harvard and that she initially planned to apply for a M.D.-Ph.D. Program after graduation. But Fabo said she decided to put that plan on hold in spring 2017.
“I made a decision to take some time off and really reflect on both the research that I wanted to do and the communities I wanted to serve,” Fabo said. “That’s when a couple people told me to look into Rhodes and here I am today.”
Fabo said she is excited to promote research intended to help marginalized populations during her time in England.
“I generally have a lot of intellectual questions that I’m grappling with,” Fabo said. “I’m really excited to take the next two years to engage with both Rhodes scholars and non-Rhodes scholars at Oxford.”
Yang, who is concentrating in Molecular and Cellular Biology with a secondary in Human Anthropology, will pursue a one-year Master of Science in integrated immunology and a one-year Master of Science in migration studies while studying at Oxford.
“I wanted to take these two different perspectives of immunology and migration studies to improve the way we track and treat infectious diseases,” Yang said.
Yang said he believes his interdisciplinary studies at Oxford will help him become a “physician-scientist” who both takes care of patients and does research that has a measurable impact.
Yang thanked his professors, mentors, peers, Quincy House tutors, and Harvard’s Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships for helping him go through the application process successfully.
“They really supported me through this process and made [it] a really enjoyable one,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meeting for the first time in their respective programs’ histories, the women’s hockey teams of Harvard and Holy Cross decided to go right ahead and play two, facing off in a home-and-home series this past weekend. Although the Crimson (4-2-1, 3-1-1 ECAC) outshot the Crusaders (6-4-1) in both contests, it only managed to capture one game, splitting the weekend slate.
“I think it was refreshing to play someone new,” junior forward Bradley Fusco said. “We sometimes get used to the teams that we’re always playing; we have an idea of what to expect from them. It was a good experience to go against a team we knew nothing about.”
Harvard 0, Holy Cross 2
Coming off a win at home on Friday night, the Crimson made the short drive over to Worcester, Mass. for the second game of its back-to-back. Harvard entered the contest hoping to carry over the momentum it gained from Friday’s comeback victory over the Crusaders.
Following a scoreless first period, Holy Cross scored both of the game’s goals in the second. With the support of the home crowd, the Crusaders tallied the game’s opening goal at the 2:23 mark of the second period. Then, in the waning moments of its five-minute power play, junior forward Julie Matthias took control of the puck off the board and flicked her shot over Crimson freshman goalkeeper Becky Dutton’s shoulder for the score.
Matthias wouldn’t have to wait long to see her name again on the score sheet. Following a great save by Dutton, Matthias collected the rebound at 4:10 and fired another shot into the back of the net to give Holy Cross a two-goal cushion.
In the third period, Harvard attempted to climb back into the contest by firing off a barrage of shots. In the frame, the Crimson outshot the Crusaders, 15-1, but none of the shots found their way past their senior goalie, Tessie Salatas. For the game, Harvard outshot Holy Cross 32-19, but only the Crusaders were able to take advantage of their opportunities.
Despite the loss, the Crimson skaters felt that they could take several positives from Saturday’s result.
“We have to come out knowing we can’t take anything lightly,” sophomore forward Kat Hughes said. If we’re playing a series against a team, the first game doesn’t matter. Every game is a new one and we need to be prepared to come out as strong as we ended in the first game.”
Harvard 8, Holy Cross 3
In the Crimson’s first game of the weekend, it played host to the Crusaders for a Friday evening contest. This meeting served as the first for these teams in their respective histories.
Harvard didn’t need to wait long to get on the scoreboard, as freshman forward Keely Moy collected a rebound and beat Salatas just two minutes into the first period.
“I think one of our main focuses for this season is making plays that get us scoring opportunities,” Fusco said. “We’re putting a lot of stress on testing the goalie early, and I think that our team in general wants to put ourselves in as good a position to win from the onset of the game.”
Holy Cross, however, was undeterred by the Crimson’s early strike. At the 10:49 mark of the period, the Crusaders tied up the game courtesy of junior forward Sam Girard. The visitors then went on to take the lead just before the end of the period, when junior forward Maeve Reilly finally beat Harvard sophomore goalkeeper Beth Larcom following a series of shots on goal.
The Crimson began the second period much like it began the first, scoring shortly after play resumed. Just over two minutes into the frame, freshman defender Sydney Sorkin played a pass to fellow freshman Becca Gilmore, whose top-shelf shot tied the game up once again at two goals apiece.
However, just as in the first period, Holy Cross answered back. Six minutes after Gilmore’s goal, the Crusaders took advantage of a power play, redirecting a missed shot past Larcom to retake a one-goal advantage. From that moment on, however, the Harvard offense took control.
Junior defender Kaitlin Tse and Gilmore helped the Crimson regain the lead before the end of the second period, setting up a final flurry in the third period when the team managed to net four goals within five minutes of play.
Just one minute into the period, Hughes collected the puck off of a turnover and sent her backhanded shot into the net to give Harvard a two goal advantage.
Less than a minute later, Moy redirected Gilmore’s shot into the net for her second goal of the contest. Hughes would go onto collect a second goal of her own just one minute later, scoring off a backhand shot. Two minutes later, Fusco slipped a shot under the goalkeeper’s legs for the Crimson’s eighth and final goal of the contest.
Neither team scored for the remainder of the period, and the game ended in a 8-3 victory for Harvard.
“We were down for the first half of the game, which was frustrating for us,” Hughes said. “Between the second and third, we managed to find a spark. As a result, we were able to come out and score four goals in the first six minutes. We just played as a much better team than we were in the first half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) continued its dominance in conference play, besting Columbia (4-1, 2-1), 192-107, at Uris Pool in New York, N.Y. and smashing five pool records along the way.
“Everyone was pumped up, especially our freshman class because this was their first travel meet to begin with, and they swam really well,” sophomore Raphael Marcoux said. “We got there late at night, slept in the hotel, and in the morning, everyone was really rested—unlike other meets, where we just come in straight from the bus to the pool.”
The Lions came strong out of the gate, edging out the Crimson in a tightly-contested 200-yard medley relay. Columbia’s cohort of sophomore Cole Stevens, senior Jace Ng, senior Kevin Frifeldt, and freshman anchor Albert Gwo finished with a time of 1:28.40, 10 hundredths of a second faster than Harvard’s relay lineup.
“They came up with really strong performances, especially in their relays,” Marcoux said. “We were a bit concerned because we had a couple of guys that were injured. It definitely was a tougher meet to swim than against Cornell or Dartmouth. They were definitely the second strongest team in the Ivy League in terms of dual meet season, so they definitely came together for that, and we did as well.”
However, the Crimson would quickly regain the momentum in the 1000-yard freestyle. Junior Logan Houck broke the pool record with a swift 9:02.30, including a 25.74 in his last 50. Houck won the 1000-yard last weekend against Cornell and Dartmouth with a time of 9:05.77.
“I had walked onto the pool deck for warm-up … and saw that the record was a 9:06, so I knew if I had a good race, had swam it like last weekend, that I could have gotten that record,” Houck said. “I negatively split the race, but came back faster than I really thought possible at this time of the season and with just how tired I’ve been.”
In the 200-yard freestyle, junior Brennan Novak set another new pool-best mark, finishing in 1:37.47. Novak also took the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:24.47.
Sophomore Dean Farris followed with two pool records of his own in the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard freestyle, touching the wall with times of 47.41 and 43.44, respectively. The Atlanta, Ga. native finished more than two seconds ahead of the second-place finisher in both events.
Harvard’s final pool record of the day came in the 200-yard freestyle relay, in which Farris and seniors Ed Kim, Steven Tan, and Paul O’Hara touched the wall in a time of 1:19.79, finishing almost three seconds in front of Columbia’s A squad.
In diving, Lions freshman Jonathan Suckow took both the one-meter and three-meter events, ending up with 422.78 and 357.45 points, respectively. Crimson diver and captain Bobby Ross finished second in both events.
“There are certainly some things that I can improve on, so there are a few good takeaways,” Ross said. “At this point in the season for diving, you’re really just looking to really get the start of your dives really right, really mastering those, and then putting the finishing touches by the end of the season.”
Senior Koya Osada also had several strong performances, capturing first in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:49.78 to edge out freshman Michael Zarian, who finished just under a second behind the senior. Osada would win the 200-yard backstroke as wall, touching the wall in 1:46.94. Overall, the Crimson took nine of 16 events in the meet.
The team’s freshmen played a crucial role in the win, and the first-years are showing signs of integrating themselves well into the program while performing at a high level in the pool. Their contributions have helped set high expectations for this season.
“One of the guys had previously said that this is a special team this year, and I couldn’t agree more,” Houck said. “We think that by the end of the season, not only will we be a force to be reckoned with at the Ivy League level, but at the national NCAA level.”

Another year, another edition of the Game… this time, Harvard and Yale got together for their 134th epic battle, in good ol’ New Haven, Connecticut. Unlike when Harvard-Yale is held at home, this year folks actually had an excuse to not get in on the tailgating fun. Who can blame you for skipping out? We kind of wish we hadn’t paid for the New Haven experience either. So, here’s what you missed at Harvard-Yale.
Crimson Comeback was not a go
All of last week, the College Events Board held Spirit Week celebrations here at Harvard to try and get us hype for the prospect of wading into a storm of Yalies. CEB billed Spirit Week as ‘Crimson Comeback’—a risky decision, because, well, there was always a possibility that the Crimson wouldn’t... come back from last year’s loss. And we didn’t! In fact, after jumping out to a 3-0 lead, Harvard didn’t score a single point for the rest of the game. Go sports!
You’re welcome, Yale
Last year, Harvard’s loss breaking a nine-year winning streak against the Bulldogs. This year, the Crimson’s loss handed Yale the Ivy League title. No one can say we’re not gracious losers.
Rakesh!
When all is lost and your team is down by a lot, you can at least see the Dean of the College hoisted up on the shoulders of two random students. Now that’s an experience you can never have outside of the Game. We are also happy to report that no injuries were sustained during that event.
We regret to inform you…
...members of Yale’s Saybrook College were at it again. And by ‘it,’ we mean they were stripping, as is their tradition when leading in the third quarter. Thankfully, a heavy security presence ensured that the Yalies didn’t go full-frontal like last year in Cambridge. (Although, we personally would’ve liked to see them thrown out of their own stadium too.) It seems the Yale penchant for exposing oneself extends further than just at the Game, because the fields surrounding the stadium were full of Yalies relieving themselves after pregaming too hard. That’s a sight we’ll pass on.
Harvard is still better

While we didn’t defeat the Bulldogs on the Football field, we still have plenty to roast them for.
Rory Gilmore
Despite its utter irrelevance, Yale surprisingly gets referenced by pop-culture (even if it’s usually as “the Harvard of central Connecticut”). Yale student Rory Gilmore, one of the main protagonists of the beloved 2000s series “Gilmore Girls,” is a notable example. And guess what—she’s as annoying as real Yale students, which is admittedly a feat of its own. She uses her nepotistic connections to get in, then drops out out of spite, has sex with a married ex, and steals a yacht. Yalies can sleep soundly at night knowing their school is well-represented by such a character (and that bizarre “Gossip Girl” episode about “Skull and Bones”).
Poopgate 
It’s no surprise Yale students might have trouble behaving like adults after spending four years inside a glorified daycare for well-connected “intellectuals.” However, the unidentified perpetrators of this messy scandal took it way too far by defecating and urinating into Saybrook College’s laundry machines. Although four years have passed since the “poopertrators” last struck the campus, we will never let Connecticut’s kindergarten live this down.
Toad’s Place
Not to be dramatic but Toad’s is the sketchiest place you will ever visit in your entire life. The dilapidated club’s floor is stickier than the Fly’s corner couch. Yalies can boast about their social lives but we’d rather stay at home than party with a bunch of townies in this fire-hazard of a shack. Sure, it used to host Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan gigs a long time ago, but the only things you’ll find at Toad’s now are broken dreams.
Yale’s Inferiority Complex
An institution well known for being one of the most prestigious safety schools in the world, Yale has long excelled at displaying it’s blatant insecurity. The pathetic institution’s Harvard-envy is so bad, it stole our motto, CS50 and even mumps. Have Yale people even heard of the Honor Code? Oh right, they don’t go to Harvard.
Butteries
A buttery is technically Yale’s equivalent of a House Grille, but much more pretentious and medieval-sounding. We’ll get our buns buttered elsewhere, thank you.
Although mocking Yale is fun and all, we know where to draw the line, so we’re not going to call Yale the community college of New Haven. That’s plain rude and disrespectful…to hard-working and dedicated community college students trying to get an education.
