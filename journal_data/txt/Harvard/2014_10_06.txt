After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When anyone asked me why I majored in English, I always gave the same response: “Mostly just because I want to be sure I don’t get a job after I graduate.”
It’s not that funny, but it’s ironic. I like irony. And up until now I didn’t think twice of it.
But there is one funny thing about this kind of irony, and I want to take a break from this column’s normally ironic programming of farting and awkward eye contact to discuss it seriously. The thing about this irony is that it serves as a mask, hiding a deep insecurity I harbored but never took up seriously until this semester.
Whenever I told my friends back home—who mostly are engineering and science majors at schools in California—that I concentrated in English, they rolled their eyes, called me “fuzzy,” or thought my head was in the clouds. They also asked what a “concentration” was. But all that wasn’t that bad. I could take the blatant teasing. It was fun.
But at Harvard, the challenges are not as blatant. Excepting a rogue Crimson editorial here and there, most of the pressure against the humanities is more implicit. It usually comes in the form of a joke from a fellow student, or even from authoritative figures in the University. For instance, Mankiw made a joke about humanities majors not being able to find jobs in the last lecture of Ec 10 last year, while giving general advice to freshman deciding between concentrations. Even in my own house, a tutor talked about quiet hours for the semester at a meeting, saying science and social science majors needed to work hard, study, and get sleep in the House. The humanities concentrators weren’t mentioned, implying (intentionally or not) that their major was easy, and everyone laughed.
I like jokes. And I didn’t think these ones really affected me. Eventually, I started participating in it, making self-deprecating jokes about my education. But somehow, as I jested about my major’s legitimacy, I actually began feeling that it wasn’t legitimate. It was a slow change, and I only realized it was occurring after I took Physics 15a my sophomore fall. I enrolled in the course because I missed physics from high school. It turned out that I did better in the class than I thought I would: better than I did in my humanities classes and better than some of the future physics concentrators did around me.
It was then, and only then, that I felt kind of smart or deserving to be here. The English classes somehow didn’t do that. Although they meant a lot to me, I joked about English classes. And soon, they became jokes themselves.
I thought about switching my concentration to physics or astrophysics. But as I took more classes, the novelty and self-legitimizing wore off, and I realized I missed the study of language. I figured out that, in addition to exploring a genuine interest, I decided to pursue physics for some of the wrong reasons as well—the respect of my peers among them.
Now I realize the harm in what’s meant to be a harmless joke. Jokes are fun and fleeting. Because of that, they don’t breed serious, productive discussions. But, over time, they add up. And they can breed an insecurity that challenges the merits and identities of humanities concentrators. What’s worse is that they can scare away potential concentrators, while avoiding a productive discussion that gets at the factual heart of the issues.
So if you have a problem with the humanities, please tell me. And tell me straight. I’d love to discuss why I may or may not agree.
But please don’t jest. Please don’t imply. Please don’t add to the ironic self-awareness surrounding the humanities that could bring its demise for the wrong reasons.
Of course, I was the biggest culprit of this ironic attitude. But it’s only by collectively shedding that attitude that we can dismantle stigmas bred by off-hand comments. There is a discussion to be had about the humanities in today’s world. And that conversation is best had outside the veil of irony.
Otherwise, the humanities could fall victim not to its merits, but to one of its great topics of study: the workings of irony. And that irony would be too devastating to handle.

To the editor:
As a Jew with a deep bond with the state of Israel, I was saddened and ashamed to watch as the Israeli army killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip this summer, and even more so to witness the reactions of many in the Harvard community as students publicly grieved these injustices.
In a letter to the editor Thursday, my classmate David F. Sackstein ’14 wrote that the Palestine Solidarity Committee’s use of the word “massacred” in its demonstration last Monday makes it “difficult to view the citizens of Israel as human beings that share with many Palestinians their yearning for a peaceful future.” I could not disagree more. We should not be afraid to call injustices committed against Palestinians what they are. Doing so does not demonize the Israeli people any more than admitting any injustice demonizes the people whose leaders committed it. Criticisms of Monday’s demonstration, like those in The Crimson’s dissenting staff editorial Friday, for its lack of nuance or “one-sidedness” miss the point. The PSC did represent one side—the side of Palestinian people—and it’s a side every bit as true as an Israeli’s. Rather than shut down conversation we should be listening closely and affirming Palestinians’ experiences.
I experienced a great deal of doubt before deciding to write this letter for fear of offending members of the Jewish community. It shouldn't have to be this way. I am not among a minority but a silent majority of progressive Jews growing increasingly uneasy with Israel's administration. I am like my peers invested deeply in the future of Israel, my second home and the home of my family members. Criticism of Israeli policy does not pose an existential threat to the Jewish people or to Israel. To the contrary, silencing Palestinian suffering does.

In California this week, “no means no” became “yes means yes.”
The distinction between the two might seem elusive, but the idea of “affirmative consent”—a concept which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law for the state's college campuses last week—can make a huge difference in the adjudication of cases of sexual assault.
The California bill describes affirmative consent as “affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement” from both partners to sexual activity. This means that an individual must openly express, verbally or non-verbally, his or her desire to take part in a sexual act just before the act takes place. According to the law, those who are unconscious or intoxicated cannot consent, and consent to one type of contact (kissing, for example) does not imply consent to another type (such as sexual intercourse). The law is the first in the nation to officially embrace an affirmative consent policy, and we hope others are soon to come.
Legal affirmative consent policies bring clarity to a tough juridical matter. Before, sexual assault prosecutions and defenses alike ran into trouble in the courtroom because policies were too vague—it was difficult for those on the bench to understand what constituted assault, and what constituted bad communication. Affirmative consent policies help to clear up that question: Without a clearly expressed intention from all parties to engage in sexual activity, that activity is legally impermissible. A more transparent policy should prove a boon to the accuser and the accused alike.
Of course, no policy will neatly resolve all confusion, but affirmative consent is certainly a step in the right direction. The policy does not only aid in the courtroom, but it may also keep some assaults from occurring in the first place. With proper education in affirmative consent, perpetrators who may have previously waited for a “no” perhaps now will wait for a “yes” instead.
What’s more, centralized policies help individuals understand what consent means and how to go about obtaining it, no matter where they are. The more states that tread the trail California has grazed, the better.
In the past, we have expressed our wish for Harvard to adopt an affirmative consent policy of its own. This summer, the University updated its policies, but failed to establish such a policy on the grounds that “there is no standard definition of affirmative consent.” California has provided such a standard, and we hope to see states and schools—including Harvard—across the nation follow suit.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden visited the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Thursday and had a bitch of a time. And if you read the way most media outlets do, you’d stop here, only retain that choice quote with the choice word, and congratulate yourself on a job well done.
In what were billed as “remarks on foreign policy,” the vice president gave a far-reaching and remarkably candid accounting of the various crises du jour: Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, the sudden emergence of the ISIL in Iraq and Syria, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
Despite the maelstrom that global events had become, Biden reassured Americans that “we face no existential threat to our way of life or security,” that the U.S. economy would ensure continued relevance in the 21st century, and this stirring peroration: “Americans will never ever stand down; we endure, we overcome, we own the finish line, so do not take out of proportion this threat.”
But in answering unscripted questions from students—no small matter for an official of his standing—Biden couldn’t pass up the chance to commiserate with Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 on the plight of being second-in-command.
“Isn’t it a bitch?” the vice president said.
And all the rest went by the wayside. Politico devoted 145 words of its 243-word write-up of the event to the five-letter utterance—the other hundred recapitulated other popular Biden bloopers. Of course, that’s from an organization that recently ran a piece asking astrologers to predict the future of Chelsea Clinton’s new daughter. But the same went for NBC News, the Washington Post, the Huffington Post, and USA Today, all of which ran summaries of the single-second quip with no meaningful mention of the hour-length speech preceding it.
I’d even take the usual insipid fare of 2016 presidential race navel-gazing proffered as real news over this less appetizing arrangement of giggles, simpers, and snickers.
That the vice presidency has not been the most beloved office is not new news—it was “the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived,” per John Adams, “not worth a bucket of warm piss” to John Nance Garner, and “about as useful as a cow’s fifth teat” to Harry Truman.
But swearing will always be salacious, and salacity will always sell news—I wouldn’t try to break a linkage so robust. But when salaciousness and selling become the end-all-be-alls of news, the crucial function of media—to inform—becomes irredeemably lost to an endless crescendo of vapidity, conspiracy, and inanity.
Biden gave some immensely enlightening answers to his audience: his affirmation that Turkey’s allowance of foreign fighters to cross into Syria led to the formation of ISIL (a fact suspected, but never confirmed, and for which the vice president later had to officially apologize), that our Arab allies’ zeal to oust Assad led to the arming of the very radical fighters we are now targeting, and that our continuing tolerance for some of Saudi Arabia’s most barbaric practices comes from America’s self-interest, which despite being disturbing had the virtue of being the truth.
But instead, the laziest reporting reigns supreme—and what could be easier than selective quotation to fit a preexisting trope instead of faithful recreation of a speech’s purpose and context. It’s a trend that probably applies elsewhere: My own fondness for Bushisms nearly evaporated after the Biden boondoggle.
When I listen to most politicians answer questions, preprogrammed recordings are so clearly replayed that the click is nearly audible. Biden doesn’t fit that description, but his fondness for goofiness doesn’t serve him well in the era of sound bites and ratings-bitten media. Biden is both knowledgeable and humorous—and if a single person can hold those two thoughts simultaneously, there’s no reason the media can’t either.
So the vice president used a naughty word? To quote Biden himself: “BFD.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having just completed the fourth week of my sophomore year, I’m finding myself up at night contemplating the daunting concept of declaring a concentration before Thanksgiving, in conjunction with three problem set classes. Last year, it was totally fine to respond to the standard concentration question with, “Well, I’m still deciding between stats, econ, history, gov, sociology, and computer science.” I told that to my sophomore advisor last week and he looked at me like I was crazy. What gives?
From the moment we entered high school, and perhaps even earlier, we were told to build a resume as well rounded and diverse as possible. I was on the drumline, but also ran track; studied German literature, but took AP math classes. Ahh, what an “excellent sheep” I was. Although this habit of intellectual heterogeneity is exactly what got us here in the first place, it also ensures that the upcoming decision will prove a difficult one.
The biggest problem for me has been disentangling what I want to study from what I think I want to study. Did I enroll in Ec 10 last year to discover my enthusiasm for the fundamentals of micro- and macroeconomic theory, or simply because 763 other students did the same? How about CS50 this year?
Hundreds, if not thousands, of articles have been written to help students like me arrive at their own concentration resolutions. Unfortunately, the cruxes of most these essays hinge on the same cliché: Follow your passion. But what if I don’t know what my true passion is? Or I do, but Harvard doesn’t offer a degree in eating Nutella out of a jar while watching “Parks and Rec.”
I thought I found the answer to all my questions last week when I clicked on a video from The Atlantic, titled “What Do You Wish You Had Learned In College?” When the page loaded and Drew Faust’s face materialized on the screen, I could barely contain my excitement. The President of Harvard is about to tell me what to concentrate in.
But it was not to be. The video, recorded at this past summer’s Aspen Ideas Festival, asked several panelists, including Harvard President Drew Faust and Professor Elisa New, skills or concepts they wished they had acquired while undergraduates. Responses ranged from particular classes they lamented avoiding to universal life skills like living for the moment and accepting failure in stride, but Professor New most accurately summed up the question, saying, “all the things I wish I learned in college, I couldn’t have learned in college.” $&!*.
Like so many other things in my life, I was hoping to be able to simply check “choose concentration” off my ever-expanding to-do list. I wanted there to be a right answer and a wrong one, a clear choice that I could run with. But the reality is, I should be grateful for the opportunity to, after all these years, finally craft my own curriculum.
In a few short weeks I’m going to have to make a declaration whether I’m ready to or not.
I can ask for as much advice as people will give me, but ultimately the decision regarding my field of study is mine alone. Am I going to look back in thirty years at this decision with regret? I doubt it. My learning will not end with my commencement in May of 2017 (fingers crossed!). Education is a lifelong commitment, and an integral part of the college experience is learning to make difficult decisions and deal with the mistakes that will inevitably arise. I don’t know right now how to answer the “what do I wish I had learned in college” question. None of us do. But if I had to guess, my biggest regret is not going to be remotely tied to my field of study. Rather, I might regret spending so much time worrying about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 5, 2014, at 11:40 p.m.
Two members of the punk rock protest group Pussy Riot penned an open letter to University President Drew G. Faust on Saturday criticizing a ban from University property issued by the Harvard University Police Department against alumnus and activist Roman J. Torgovitsky.
“It is disconcerting that Harvard University has a policy of banning some of Harvard alums engaged in [nonviolent] civil disobedience and political protest on campus without any due process, consideration by the Harvard community or even possibility to appeal such a decision to a special committee,” Masha Alekhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova wrote in the letter.
Torgovitsky, a graduate of the School of Public Health and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, was arrested in May when he went on stage during a musical performance by violinist Vladimir T. Spivakov. After giving the musician a Harvard hat, Torgovitsky tried to engage in a conversation regarding Spivakov’s alleged support for the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.
Torgovitsky was arrested by HUPD while on stage, and later that day was charged with disorderly conduct. The next day, a Cambridge judge dismissed the case against him.
Torgovitsky was arrested again last month for violating the resulting ban when he attended an event at the Institute of Politics featuring Alekhina and Tolokonnikova. At the event, Torgovitsky stood and identified himself before asking a question of the band members as they sat on stage.
According to the letter posted to the Pussy Riot Facebook page, Alekhina and Tolokonnikova invited a number of event participants, as well as Torgovitsky, to eat dinner with them after the forum concluded. Torgovitsky was arrested as the group was leaving campus, according to the letter.
The relevent HUPD police log states that the arrest was made at the Kennedy School of Government, “after [the group] attempted enter to a private event after the panel discussion.”
Following the arrest, Alekhina and Tolokonnikova followed Torgovitsky and HUPD officers to the Cambridge Police Department, where he was held briefly before being released.
In their letter, Alekhina and Tolokonnikova ask that the University lift the ban placed on Torgovitsky for “the non-violent, peaceful expression of his opinion.”
They also argue that “it would be a great benefit for the Harvard community” if the University established a due process for campus trespassing orders placed on alumni and an appeals process that involves members of the University community.
“We call on the Harvard administration to enter into a [dialogue] with civil-society activists, and in particular with Roman Torgovitsky,” they wrote. “After all, they and Harvard are pursuing the same goals: respect for human rights, peace, and education without borders.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal did not comment directly on the letter, but said that the University has notified the District Attorney that it does not wish to pursue further criminal prosecution.
"Our only interest is preventing the disruption of events at Harvard," Neal wrote in an email.

Students, faculty members, and visitors dug in Harvard Yard and took a three-dimensional virtual reality tour of famous monuments in Giza, Egypt, among other activities, at the Amazing Archaeology Fair on Sunday.
The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Harvard Semitic Museum hosted the event, which aimed to better engage the community with archaeology. According to Peabody Museum education manager Polly R. Hubbard, the fair fulfilled multiple goals.
“First, in October in Massachusetts it’s archaeology month, so all archaeology folk are seeking to promote their discipline,” she said. “Second, it’s nice to have the public come in and meet with students and professors to talk about what is going on in the field.”
Along Divinity Ave., where both museums sit, students and volunteers staffed booths filled with 17th century relics from Harvard, with presenters explaining the construction and purpose of various artifacts to visitors.
Fair visitors also had the opportunity to watch and play the Mesoamerican ballgame, considered to be the first team sport in history, in front of the Peabody Museum.
“It’s a recreation, and because the game was played for thousands of years and there were many iterations and versions, we creatively interpreted the game’s rules,” Hubbard said of the ballgame.
In the Yard, in front of Matthews Hall, visitors unearthed buried items where Harvard’s Indian College, the Yard’s first brick building, once stood. Diana Loren, the Peabody Museum’s director of academic partnerships and a co-instructor of Anthropology 1130: “Archaeology of Harvard Yard," administered the dig and explained its purpose.
“We recover artifacts from each period of history in different layers,” Loren said. “Approximately four and a half feet below the surface, we find artifacts from the 17th century. The paths that people walked on in the Yard are pretty consistent throughout history, so we find trash everywhere along the paths.”
On the dig site, bottle fragments and smoking pipes were some of the most commonly uncovered artifacts.
“There was a fair bit of breaking the rules because College laws were pretty restrictive about social behavior like smoking and drinking in the 17th and 18th centuries,” Loren said. “With archaeology, you get a different sense of the day-to-day life of students.”
Jenni Acosta, a volunteer at the Peabody Museum, joked about the comparison between smoking during Harvard’s early years and the recently implemented ban on smoking in Harvard Yard.
“Smoking was against the rules back then for religious reasons instead of health ones, but I hope students today break the rule less than we know students in the 17th century did,” Acosta said.

UPDATED: October 6, 2014, at 5:40 p.m.
Harvard can take steps to reverse the growing separation between people and the farms that produce their food, panelists said at the Food Better Symposium on Friday.
“We have lost sight of nature. We have literally lost sight of things that fundamentally determine our health,” said moderator Aaron S. Bernstein, an associate and program director at the Harvard Center for Health and the Global Environment. “We have a system that brings this essential thing to us, and we don’t really understand how it gets there.”
The Food Better campaign—a partnership between Harvard University Dining Services, the Harvard Office for Sustainability, and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic—aims to bridge this disconnect over the course of the year by fostering conversations about food literacy. The campaign launched Monday with a presentation at the Harvard Community Garden.
Friday’s panel, which was held in a packed Tsai Auditorium in CGIS South, brought academics, agriculturists, and activists together to discuss their visions for the future of the food system.
Panelist Jim Ward, owner of Ward’s Berry Farm, said that society’s evolution away from small-scale agriculture has deepened the disconnect between farmers and shoppers.
Some activists are trying to bring producers and consumers back together. Panelist Mary Alice Reilly, for example, is a coordinator at World PEAS Food Hub, an organization that supports small farmers and provides locally grown produce to low-income citizens.
Panelists said that Harvard also takes steps to bring food to low-income residents of Boston. According to Sasha Purpura, another panelist and operations director of the nonprofit Food for Free, 40 percent of food produced in America goes uneaten. Food for Free works to bring leftover food from university dining halls to food pantries, shelters, and meal programs, and in the last week alone, the organization donated 3,100 pounds of food from Harvard’s dining halls.
“In this wealthy city of Cambridge, 42 percent of schoolchildren—almost half of the schoolchildren in Cambridge—qualify for free and reduced meals. I don’t know if everybody recognizes how much hunger and poverty exists in this city,” Worrall said.
For the next stage of the Food Better campaign, teams from across the University will compete in the Deans’ Food System Challenge, which begins on Oct. 27. The Challenge, hosted by the Harvard Innovation Lab, asks its participants to find creative solutions to food justice problems in four topic areas, including food waste reduction and food distribution.
“Food is perhaps the most powerful vehicle we can use to bridge our disconnect with food,” Bernstein said. “Everyone ate today. And through that experience, we are confronted with all the things that Food Better is dealing with. We’re confronted with the waste; we’re confronted with the production issue; we’re confronted with the nutrition issue; we’re confronted with the distribution issue. All of that becomes a part of our conversation.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 6, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the operations director of the nonprofit Food for Free, who spoke on Friday's panel. In fact, Sasha Purpura directs the nonprofit.

Structural flaws in the international political system contributed to the crisis in Ukraine, former Latvian president Vaira Vike-Freiberga said Friday at the Kennedy School of Government. Vike-Freiberga, who oversaw Latvia’s entrance into the European Union during her eight-year presidency, also discussed the future of Russia’s Baltic neighbors.
The political interests of individual nations sometimes prevail over international consensus, she said, leaving the international community “paralyzed” when facing emergent conflicts like Russian military actions in Ukraine.
Drawing on her personal experience in international politics, Vike-Freiberga pointed to the pressure faced by Ukraine and other countries that neighbor Russia as an example of the structural problems in international politics.
“I remember talking to the Ukrainian president, and he told me frankly that he had to run a balancing act between Russia and the West,” she said.
In the question-and-answer session that followed the talk, the discussion shifted to the implications of the crisis in Ukraine for both large and small countries. When asked by an audience member what Baltic states should do to prevent Russian encroachment, Vike-Freiberga said that countries like Latvia should “strengthen their economy, strengthen their legal system, and strengthen their political parties as functioning entities that are responsive as well as responsible.”
In an interview after the event, she added that she would like to see Latvia align itself with West. Unlike Ukraine, she said, “Latvia does not care what Russia is thinking about.”
After the event, several audience members praised Vike-Freiberga’s insights.
Rita Peters, a political science lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston and an associate at Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, said that she agreed with many of Vike-Freiberga’s points, especially the conversation about small Baltic states and “how small states were always sacrificed for the large nation’s interests.”
Cambridge resident Daiga Lorena, who was born in Latvia when it was still part of Soviet Union, described Vike-Freiberga’s speech as “intellectually inspiring.”
“I think she is the best spokeswoman for Latvia,” Lorena said. “She is the best person to present Latvia in the international community. This speech is an example.”

More than one hundred people celebrated Nigerian Independence Day at a colorful gala on Saturday night at Wasserstein Hall, where they dined on traditional meat dishes, showcased African garb, and listened to gospel tunes inspired by the culture of the West African nation.
“We plan these celebrations because it’s an opportunity to come together and celebrate, celebrate being alive, celebrate the triumphs of the past,” said Sheldon K. X. Reid '96, director of the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, a choir that sang at the event. “Just to be in someone else’s space, culture, music, food, and to see the things that are important to them provides a larger lens for us to see ourselves.”
Event organizers said that they celebrated the holiday not only to encourage people to be proud of their own culture and traditions, but also to welcome and celebrate cultural similarities and differences.
The celebration, which was hosted by the Nigerian Students Association, included food from Nigeria and other African countries, such as jollof rice—a mix of rice, spices, tomatoes, onions, and meat—and suya—grilled meat covered in chili pepper.
Eden H. Girma ’18, who attended the event, said that she was excited to eat African food and engage in conversations with others about their backgrounds.
“It’s very cool for me to see the progression of Africa out of colonialism and the significance it had on people,” Girma said. “Being able to take pride in your heritage is awesome.”
Kuumba President Haven M. Jones ’15 added that “it’s also very neat to see the different ways that countries in Africa have shaped specific foods.”
“Being able to taste that and be a part of that in some way is very cool," she said.
Kuumba, which was founded by Harvard students to celebrate African American culture, performed two songs for the gala. The group has performed at the event for several years, according to Jones.
“The event is a chance for students of all backgrounds and throughout the African diaspora to come together and celebrate,” Jones said.
Kuumba performed one song, entitled “Be Like Him,” which follows the gospel tradition, according to Reid. The other song, “Spirit of the Lord,” is an energetic piece that comes from another Bible story.

The Kennedy School of Government has submitted preliminary plans to the City of Cambridge for a dramatic remodeling of its physical campus, including the addition of 77,000 square feet of new building space, that school leaders hope will complement ongoing changes to pedagogy and interdisciplinary research.
The plans are set to go before the city’s planning board during a hearing on Tuesday. If approved, construction on the more than $100 million dollar project would likely begin following Commencement and aims to be completed by Jan. 2018, according to the Kennedy School’s executive dean, John Haigh.
Including three new buildings and the elevation of the school’s current courtyard, the project looks to be one of the largest capital expansions on Harvard’s Cambridge campus in recent history and will increase the school’s current square footage by more than 30 percent.
The school is currently is comprised of two main structures: the Belfer, Littauer, and Rubenstein buildings, which are all adjoined, and date from the 1970s and 1980s; and the separate Taubman building, which was completed in 1990. Under the current plans, the two structures would be adjoined, as a new “Gateway” building would connect Taubman to Belfer, a “West” building on the site of the school’s current parking lot would connect Rubenstein to Taubman, and a “South” building would connect Littauer to the new “West” building.
Among other additions, there will be six new classrooms, a student lounge and study area, a new dining area and event space, a conference room above the dining room, a winter garden atrium, and a flexible common space that HKS officials refer to as “skunk works.”
The building plans are a major component of the Kennedy School’s $500 million capital campaign, which made “creating a campus that amplifies our mission,” one of its four priorities. As of late August, the school has raised $355 million in gifts and pledges, according to Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel.
“We need to have a campus that amplifies, magnifies, and supports our mission and strategy,” Haigh said in an interview on Friday.
HKS Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 told The Crimson in September that the school’s current classroom setup is designed for lecturing and discourages group discussion and collaboration. The remodeled campus will aim to remedy that.
“If we want to get to a place where we do teaching and really help people change the world, if we want to fundamentally reshape the future of ideas and the like, we have to do more,” Ellwood said. “And we also have to have flexible space where people can do things, create new innovative ideas, and do the sorts of social entrepreneurship that people are doing, and the like.”
Haigh said that a “large percentage” of the total cost of expansion has already been secured.
“Even though we’ve got a significant percentage already covered in philanthropy, there are still a few pieces that are to be named or to be supported. We’re having conversations about those with donors now,” Haigh said.
In addition to the three new buildings, the current courtyard will be elevated by one story to the level of Eliot St., which will enable functions like service delivery and safe dignitary arrival to occur under the courtyard.
Thomas J. Lucey, director of University relations with the city, said the aesthetics and practicality of a raised courtyard benefit the community beyond just Kennedy School students.
“Raising the courtyard is a huge win for the community,” Lucey said. “The height, the scale, the density, the design approach, really fits right in with both the existing campus and the surrounding neighborhood.”
The school will use space in the One Brattle Square building as temporary swing classrooms and offices during the construction period.
Robert A.M. Stern Architects—who designed Harvard Business School’s Spangler Center—and Michael Van Valkenburgh are working as the architect and landscape architect for the construction project.
Despite the significant expansion in campus size, Haigh emphasized that HKS will not be expanding its student population and all faculty hiring can be attributed to separate capital campaign goals, not directly a result of new space.
University President Drew G. Faust commended the plans in an emailed statement.
“I am excited about the development of a modern learning environment that will enable the School to enhance and strengthen teaching and research, and I am confident that the transformation set out in the proposed design will be nothing short of extraordinary,” Faust wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department arrested an unidentified youth after an unarmed robbery Sunday afternoon outside Leverett House, following a chase.
The incident began around 4 p.m., when a young male approached Daedalus employee Alfred R. Tetreault and allegedly asked if he could borrow Tetreault’s cell phone to call home. Tetreault, who was on a break at the time, said he lent the phone to the young male, who quickly took off running.
Tetreault said that he chased the individual down past Leverett House and immediately notified a Harvard University Police Department officer, who was already on the scene because of a fire alarm at Leverett House. Tetreault lost track of the alleged thief, who he said took off on a bike with another youth.
Soon about a dozen cops, from both HUPD and CPD, and at least five squad cars were on the scene. Around 4:50 p.m., a CPD vehicle drove off with an individual inside, though Tetreault said the individual was not the one who allegedly stole his phone but a member of a group accompanying him. CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said that an arrest was made but that more details will not be available until a police report is released Monday.
Tetreault, who described his Samsung Galaxy S II as a “p.o.s.” that was a “very old model” with a cracked screen that shuts itself off about once an hour and won’t turn back on unless plugged in, said he was not too rattled by the event.
“I still don't have my phone, but the responding officer seems pretty confident the kid’s gonna roll on the guy who actually snatched the phone,” Tetreault said. “If not, I'm in the market for a new phone anyway. I’m looking at the S5 [series]. They seem real nice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 6, 2014, at 4:44 p.m.
Undergraduate Council representatives approved their budget for the 2015 fiscal year and filled executive board positions of secretary, parliamentarian, and Rules Committee chair in their general meeting Sunday.
The Council held internal elections for the secretary position following Stephen A. Turban’s '17 resignation last week.
Yasmin Z. Sachee '18, of Elm Yard, won the election, which included three other UC representatives. Sachee pointed to her past experience on student government during high school and advocated for greater use of technology on the Council during her 30-second campaign pitch. Mayopoulos also announced at the meeting that William Oh ’18 had been elected as parliamentarian by the Council’s executive committee, and Brett M. Biebelberg '16 had been appointed Rules Committee chair. Riya N. Patel ’17 will serve as the new Freshman Class Committee chair.
UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy '16 also introduced the Council’s budget for the 2015 fiscal year. Few changes were made to this year’s budget, but the Council did debate how to allocate additional funds it will receive in revenue, up $10,000 from last year, from the UC Student Activities Fee.
The UC grants fund, which comprises the majority of the Council’s budget, will see a 3.5 percent increase in revenue.
The Student Relations Committee’s budget will be augmented by more than 150 percent. Of that increase, $300 will be directed toward each House’s representatives to perform specific outreach efforts, according to Kanuparthy.
The Council initially debated an amendment introduced by Oh, which would would have reduced that number to $275 and earmarked the remaining sum for a gender and racial diversity fund on the UC’s Student Relations Committee.
The Council ultimately tabled Oh’s proposal and approved the budget as originally formulated. In the meantime, Student Relations Committee chair Ava Nasrollahzadeh '16 said the committee would release a more detailed budget and evaluate how to best address diversity of representation on the Council.
The UC also welcomed three representatives from the Harvard College Women’s Center to present a Gender 101 workshop for the second year in a row, according to Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15.
Matthew E. Stolz ’15 led the majority of the presentation and described the ways in which gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation interact and how Council members can use and ask for preferred gender pronouns to make individuals of different identities feel more comfortable.
Stolz also fielded questions by several UC representatives about the ways the Council might best encourage individuals of diverse gender identities to run for and secure UC positions. This year’s Council is about one-third female. Stolz emphasized that the UC should think of the “little things” that can create a comfortable and respectful culture for all who serve on the UC.
“[It] is super important for us as a Council to...get this perspective,” UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 said directly after the presentation.
The Council also tabled a vote on a freshman town hall event and approved another wave of grants amounting to about $7,000.

President Barack Obama will award Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, according to a press release issued Friday by the White House.
Murray, who is one of the eight recipients of the medal for 2014, will receive the award during a ceremony at the White House later this year. According to the press release, the honor, which was established in 1980, “recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America’s competitiveness and quality of life and helped strengthen the Nation’s technological workforce.”
According to an email from SEAS Assistant Dean for Communications Paul Karoff, Murray said that she was “truly honored and humbled” to receive the award. Murray’s specific citation has yet to be released.
“[Murray] has played a real leadership role in engineering and science for many many years,” Physics professor David A. Weitz said. “We need people like that—we need people who can lead the country and make engineering and science an important part of the country.”
Murray, who was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1999 and formerly served as an executive at Bell Laboratories, drew attention for her research on the use of light-scattering and her work on condensed-matter physics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the email addresses at the center of an ongoing investigation into the source of a racially charged, emailed death threat sent Friday had for several months contacted dozens of Harvard affiliates with requests for donations and Facebook followers.
A person who self-identified as Huy Dinh has repeatedly emailed College students at least as early as April from the same Google Mail address that sent a violent death threat to several hundred people Friday afternoon, prompting an investigation that remains ongoing.
According to copies of several messages shared with The Crimson, the sender who identified as Dinh claimed to live in Hamburg, Germany. On Aug. 9, the sender wrote almost 150 people, many of whom are Harvard affiliates, a message that linked to a Facebook profile and requested followers. The profile—which the sender called “my Facebook page” in the message—is still active online and lists Huy Dinh as its user.
A Vietnamese sophomore who received several emails from the Google Mail address and was granted anonymity by The Crimson out of concerns for her safety, said the user of that Facebook profile also repeatedly contacted her via Facebook message, and an individual named Huy Dinh requested to connect with her on LinkedIn. The sophomore said she does not personally know anyone with that name.
Like Friday’s death threat, which targeted many women of Asian descent, the email messages previously sent from the Google Mail address are consistently agrammatical and written in broken English.
“I need to follow me on my facebook profile 200,000 facebook users,” the Aug. 9 email reads. “Please help me.”
A July 2 email addressed to “all Harvard students” from the same Google Mail account had similarly linked to the Facebook profile and called on recipients for “help.”
“I am seriously ill and there is no remedy for that I will die in single pair months,” the July 2 email reads. “I like please click on my beautiful Facebook page.” A link to the profile follows.
In another email from the Google Mail address, dated Aug. 19, the sender asked recipients to help “collect money for people in Africa” by donating through the same Facebook page.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment Sunday on whether Harvard police were aware of the previous emails sent from the Google Mail address.
Those emails took on new significance Friday, when several hundred affiliates received identical threatening messages from both a “hotmail.de” address and the Google Mail address that allegedly belongs to Huy Dinh. The body of both emails, however, identified their author as a person called Stephanie Nguyen.
The “hotmail.de” address later issued an apologetic message to Harvard affiliates, claiming that the original threat was a mistake.
The Crimson emailed the address that allegedly belongs to Huy Dinh seeking comment this weekend and received a message in response on Sunday at 12:02 p.m. The sender, who did not self-identify in the body of the email, requested that The Crimson delete its online story about the death threat.
The violent messages disrupted life on Harvard’s campus this past weekend and prompted local law enforcement and the FBI to join Harvard police in their search for the person or people who authored them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s soccer team faced Yale at home, it took until the 95th minute for the Crimson to score. In the 94th minute of this contest, Harvard looked like it might repeat history. Sophomore forward Midge Purce delivered a cross into the box that found junior forward Brooke Dickens’ head. But the Bulldogs’ senior goalkeeper Elise Wilcox had other plans.
In its second consecutive double-overtime game, the Crimson drew the same result, a scoreless tie. Harvard (6-2-2, 1-0-1 Ivy) battled with Yale (5-3-1, 0-1-1) for 110 minutes in the rain, with both sides unable to convert any of its respective 14 shots.
“I thought that we gave 100 percent effort,” senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba said. “We might not have been connecting and putting together things the way that we wanted to, but the heart was there, and we laid it all out on the field.”
The Crimson started off slow, letting the Bulldogs dictate the pace of the game in the first half.
“We just seemed to be a step off in the first half,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “Even though there were no goals in the first half, it seemed like we were trying to catch up.”
Midway through the first half, Yale threatened with a string of three corner kicks in a three-minute time frame. Two of the three corners off the foot of senior forward Melissa Gavin found the head of senior defender Muriel Battaglia, but neither got past the Harvard defense.
Although Yale took seven shots in the first half, the Bulldogs failed to put any of them on goal. Strong pressure from the Crimson defense kept Yale’s offense from capitalizing on its possession advantage early in the game.
For Harvard’s defense, this stellar performance was nothing new. Anchored by sophomore Bailey Gary and junior Alika Keene, the Crimson’s back line has recorded seven shutouts in ten games this season.
“The back line’s been incredible,” Emba said. “They have just been working on communication and covering each other and not giving up any easy balls. When they do give up unfortunate plays, they grind it out and get the ball back on our attacking side of the field.”
The Bulldogs came out strong in the second half. Yale’s Battaglia was again central to the action. After her header shot was blocked in the first minute of the half, Battaglia followed up three minutes later with a shot from the left side that was cleared away just inches from the goal line.
As the rain started to pick up, the pace of the game picked up with it.
Harvard put together one of its best scoring opportunities midway through the second half when senior midfielder Bethany Kanten delivered a ball into the box. Teammate Laura Aguilar got her head on it, but her shot missed wide.
Battaglia threatened again near the end of regulation time. With just under seven minutes left in the game, she got her head on a corner, but her shot deflected off the top crossbar. Sophomore goalkeeper Lizzie Durack went down with an injury during the play, forcing Emba to enter the game in its final minutes.
“I was trying to just calm down and get ready,” Emba said. “I was thinking about Lizzie and hoping she was fine, but also trying to hold myself accountable so I could be ready to serve my team in the way that they needed in the last few minutes of the game.”
Emba did just that. She recorded a pair of diving saves in overtime that kept the Bulldogs off the scoreboard and brought her season total to 19.
The Crimson offense turned it on in the second overtime. Junior midfielder Haley Washburn and freshman defender Mia Bladin each had a pair of shots in the final ten-minute period, but none found the back of the net.
“It was about as fairly fought as an archrival game could be,” Leone said. “It could’ve gone either way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Carrying a 1-0 lead into the final three minutes of play at Soldiers Field, the Harvard men’s soccer team (6-3-0, 1-0-0 Ivy) looked to be well on its way to a victory over Yale in its conference opener on Saturday night.
But the Crimson had been down this road before. Just a season ago, Harvard found itself in the exact same position against the Bulldogs, but the wheels fell off.
Despite taking the lead on a goal by then-senior A.J. Agha midway through the second half, the Crimson let a win slip through its fingers, conceding two goals in the final 2:15. The loss would prove costly, as Harvard fell short of an Ivy title by just half a game.
This season, however, history would not repeat itself, as the Crimson prevented Yale (0-7-2, 0-1-0) from recording a single shot in the final three minutes to earn the 1-0 win.
“Getting the shutout and making sure that we held on to our lead at the end showed great fight from the team,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “Everyone worked really hard, and I was really impressed.”
Ashby was certainly the difference maker, anchoring the back line throughout the contest and providing a spark to the offense in the 66th minute.
After receiving a cross from sophomore midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi began the attack. The veteran put together a string of moves to elude a Bulldog defender along the left sideline before feeding freshman midfielder Christian Sady with a pass.
Watching Kobayashi dart towards the edge of the box, Sady sent the ball right back to the forward, who crossed the ball into the midst of a crowded penalty area. Nonetheless, only one foot made its way onto the ball—Ashby’s.
“[Ashby has] talked a lot about converting those moments when he gets his chances, and he’s been working on it in training,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said.
The goal is Ashby’s third of the season, tying him with fellow co-captain Kyle Henderson and sophomore defender Dan Smith for most on the team.
With Saturday’s victory, the Crimson extends its winning streak to six games. Harvard scored three or more goals in each of its first five contests, but it was the defense that propelled the Crimson to a win against the Bulldogs. Yale mustered just four shots on the night, only one of which was on target.
The back line had to execute without one of its starting center backs for most of the contest as well, as Smith left the game with an ankle injury following a collision with a Yale attacker. However, senior defender Tyler Evans stepped in and picked up right where Smith left off.
“It’s great that we have so many players that we can substitute in and have a very seamless change,” Ashby said. “We have a very concrete philosophy defensively, so it’s not hard for someone like Evans to come in and do a great job. He played wonderfully.”
On the opposite end of the pitch, Harvard launched 14 shots, with eight different players recording at least one attempt. Among those players was Henderson, who came on as a substitute after missing the last three games.
“The minutes Kyle [played] were very valuable to the team,” Ashby said. “He has a unique talent of getting pressure on the ball in all areas of the field…[and] forcing guys to make decisions that they don’t want to make.”
Lehrer acknowledged that plenty of preparation had been put in place for this game following last year’s result, and he was pleased with the team’s execution.
“This is a game where there’s a lot of emotion, and [we] came out and just worked hard,” Lehrer said. “[The guys] put in work, and their talent is starting to rise up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Harvard women’s volleyball team pulled off a stunning upset over Yale that had players and coaches alike in tears, ending the Bulldogs’ 25-match unbeaten streak in the Ancient Eight.
This year, Harvard proved it wasn’t a fluke.
A tone-setting win against rival Yale (6-6, 2-1 Ivy) highlighted a weekend split, as the Crimson (8-4, 1-2) dropped Saturday’s game against Brown in straight sets (6-9, 1-2).
“It’s hard to put [it] all together—we played very well [on Friday] and we knew we had to come out strong against Brown,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We didn’t attain our [desired level of] gameplay.”
BROWN 3, HARVARD 0
Down two sets entering the third period, the Crimson fought off two game points to try to extend the match to a fourth frame. But the third game point proved to be too much for Harvard, which ultimately fell to Brown in the third and final set, 27-25.
Errors highlighted the Crimson’s Saturday matchup at the Malkin Athletic Center. The team combined for 22 service errors and attack errors, averaging more than seven per set.
“They’re a very defensive team [and] they played great defense,” Weiss said. “We didn’t serve them out of system, and that was our goal.”
Following Friday’s matchup that went down to the wire, Harvard came out of the gates flat on Saturday. After dropping the first six points, the Crimson was unable to respond, ultimately losing the last five points of the match as well.
Faltering late in frames was the theme of the match on Saturday. Needing just one point to secure the second set, the Crimson dropped the last four points of the frame to fall two frames behind.
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
Up two sets to one and leading, 20-14, in the fourth frame, the game was seemingly in the bag for Harvard. But a stunning 11-1 run by the Bulldogs, aided by two aces and five Crimson errors, knotted the contest at two sets apiece and sucked all of the energy out of the MAC.
In the decisive fifth set, the two teams battled back and forth, with the Crimson holding a tenuous 10-9 lead. After a kill from co-captain Caroline Walters extended the lead to two, the Crimson regained service rights with sophomore star Corie Bain next in the rotation. A block by sophomore Grace Weghorst and an attack error from Yale had the Crimson within two points of taking down the Bulldogs in consecutive years. Then Bain took over. Two straight aces from last season’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year ended Yale’s hope of redemption and brought the home crowd to its feet.
“We’ve always been focused on working hard…for every point,” Weiss said. “We got ourselves back to believing that every point matters.”
Bain was a force to be reckoned with and recorded yet another triple-double with 11 kills, 32 assists, and 12 digs. Weghorst led the team with 14 kills on the night, while junior libero Sindhu Vegesena led the team with 25 digs, her second-highest total of the year, quelling the Yale attack.
The Crimson came off strong off the blocks, surging to a 20-14 advantage in the first set. But unlike the fourth set, in which the team coughed up the same lead, Harvard weathered a 6-1 run by the Bulldogs to capture the first set, 25-19.
After Yale took the second frame handily, 25-18, behind a handful of Mollie Rogers’ team-leading 14 kills, the Bulldogs seemed to have momentum in hand, jumping out to a 16-12 advantage in the third. Four straight points behind kills from juniors Caroline Holte and Kathleen Wallace, however, reversed the luck of Harvard, which would end the set on a 13-7 run to take a 2-1 lead into the fourth frame.
“Our game against Yale was definitely our best play in the Ivy League this year,” Weghorst said. “We worked together and kept our efforts focused on winning the game.”

Fresh off of two Ivy League victories, the Harvard women’s rugby team traveled to Princeton intending to continue its streak. But the Tigers (2-1, 2-1 Ivy) outscored the Crimson (2-2, 2-2 Ivy) 19-5 in the second half to overcome an early deficit and take the game, 26-15.
For Harvard, the loss bore many similarities to last year’s away game at Dartmouth. On that day, the Crimson failed to find its rhythm or generate its offense and suffered a 10-5 loss to the Big Green.
“Both games exposed the weakness that emerges when we don’t play to our full capacity,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “Both demonstrated that we have to be on our game at all times.”
Princeton put Harvard on its heels in the first half, scoring a try and conversion to jump out to an early 7-0 lead.
The Crimson responded. Senior full-back Aniebiet Abasi dodged five defenders on a 60 meter sprint up the sidelines to bring Harvard within two points. After a penalty was called against the Tigers, sophomore center Claire Collins scored a try to give the Crimson a 10-7 advantage going into halftime.
Last season, Harvard rallied for 21 points in the second half to shutout Princeton 36-0 and solidify its spot in the Ivy semifinal. In the second half of this game, that explosive offense never arrived.
“We didn’t play to our level, which was simply disappointing,” Kantor said. “We got frazzled and we didn’t play our game plan.”
The Tigers came out and scored two tries and two conversions early in the second half to take the lead, 21-7.
Although Abasi added a diving try to bring the score to 21-15, Princeton won the ball off a Crimson scrum and scored its third try of the half to pull away, 26-15.
Harvard has its work cut out next weekend when the team returns home to face Dartmouth in its most anticipated game of the season. The Big Green defeated the Tigers 63-3 earlier this fall and is seeking revenge for last year’s loss to the Crimson in the Ivy League Championship.
Kantor insists that the team needs to remember what is listed in the International Rugby Board rule book—the goal of rugby is to score as many points as possible.
“It doesn’t matter what the score is, it doesn’t matter what the standings are, our goal in that very moment is to score as many points as we can and to work as hard as we can to do that,” Kantor said. “So despite the external pressures that might be there from the standings, I think that we have to approach [Dartmouth] as an isolated game, ten minutes at a time, with our goal just to score as much as we can.”

Despite rain-shortened play, the Harvard men’s golf team finished second out of 11 teams at the Macdonald Cup in New Haven, Conn. The Crimson ended the tournament one stroke behind host team Yale.
“We were pleased with our performance this weekend and ability to withstand the conditions,” captain Akash Mirchandani said. “That said, losing by one stroke leaves a bitter taste in our mouths.”
All the golfers that counted towards Harvard’s score shot within a six-stroke range. Junior Rohan Ramnath and sophomore Robert Deng paced the team with two-day scores of one-over-par (141). While Ramnath shot a 71 in the first round and an even par in the second, Deng had a more varied showing. After scoring four-over-par on the first day, he rebounded with a team-low of 67 on Sunday. Mirchandani finished third on the team with a total score of four-over-par.
“It’s a very motivated group, very ambitious,” head coach Kevin Rhoads said. “They’re hungry, and they want to do well.”
Teams had planned to play 36 holes on Saturday and 18 on Sunday, but torrential rain on the first day of the tournament caused golfers to take shelter in the middle of the first round. At the time, Harvard golfers had played between 11 and 14 holes. Mirchandi noted that there were sizable puddles on the green when he left the course.
“It’s something that we do talk about quite a bit—about things that we can’t control versus things that we can,” Rhoads said. “I think the team had a very healthy mindset going into Sunday.”
After the postponement of play on Saturday, officials elected to shorten the cup from 54 holes to 36. On Sunday, teams finished the round from the day before and played another 18 holes.
In addition to canceling one round of golf, the wet course affected play throughout the weekend. For the first holes of the tournament, the team had to deal with soaked greens and low visibility.
“Weather is always a fun variable because it is completely variable,” Rhoads said. “Even if there’s a forecast, it may mean that you start out and have a delay. It might be five minutes, or it might be three hours.”
Eleven teams filled out the Macdonald Cup field, including Ancient Eight rivals Brown, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton, and Yale. A notable absence from the group was the University of Illinois, which came in first last year.
The second-place showing in New Haven came one weekend after the first place finish at the Queechee Club Invitational. In that event, the Crimson benefited from the hot play of freshmen Greg Royston and Hale Furey to capture first. As individuals, Royston and Furey finished second and fourth respectively.   This week, Royston also put in a strong performance with a score of five-over-par, which placed him tied for fourth on the team with sophomore Daniel De La Garza.
“Whenever you’re being successful, it’s not necessarily something that you’ve done recently,” Rhoads said. “Success is a product of work that [the team has] been doing for a while. It’s just showing more and more.”
The Crimson struggled to find its footing early in the season with middle-of-the-pack finishes at the Doc Gimmler and Wolverine Intercollegiate tournaments. Yet Rhoads and others insisted that with the recent victories, the team has turned a corner.
“The last handful of weeks has been a better representation of where we are as a program,” Rhoads said. “People have gotten back in track within the team structure.”
The Crimson will have an opportunity to avenge its second place finish to Yale in two weeks time, when the two teams meet for a dual meet.
“The guys very much believe in what we’re doing and how we’re going about it,” Rhoads said. “[This weekend] is reaffirming—it lets them know that they’re very much on the right track.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team (12-4, 3-2 CWPA) dominated the pool this weekend, winning all five of its west-coast games over the course of three days. The team competed in the Gary Troyer Memorial Invitational on Friday and Saturday, then competed against Whittier College on Sunday.
Coming off of a split of last weekend’s games, head coach Ted Minnis made some adjustments to step this weekend’s play up to a new level. After ending the weekend on a low note last weekend with a loss to Brown, the team looked to improve its energy and stamina.
“The first change we did was I gave them an extra day off. That was a big thing this week,” Minnis said. “It was a really light week physically on them and I feel like that helped us. We really just talked up the X’s and O’s and what was needed for us to be better and not worrying about what others were doing.”
Minnis’ strategy definitely paid off, with the Crimson taking its first weekend sweep since the first weekend of the 2014 campaign in which Harvard had three victories during the preseason Princeton Invitational.
HARVARD 15, CONCORDIA 7
The Crimson was able to get off to a hot start in its first game on Friday, getting an early lead it did not relinquish. At halftime, Harvard was up by six goals, and the lead would only grow in the second half.
Sophomores Joey Colton and Viktor Wrobel and junior Ben Zepfel lead the offensive charge as trio scored 10 of the team’s 15 goals.
HARVARD 7, PAMONA-PITZER 3
All season, the Crimson has been focused on improving defense, and that showed in the game against Pamona-Pitzer on Friday afternoon, as defense was key to victory against the Sagehens. Leading the charge was junior goalie Colin Woolway, who maintained a shutout throughout the entire second half.
We were really on top of working together as a unit on defense and not letting them get any easy goals,” co-captain Max Murphy said. “Very rarely [all weekend] did any team actually score in a 6 on 6. The only times they would score was when we got ejected, which is something we were trying to work on.”
HARVARD 14, CAL-LUTHERAN 9
Continuing the strong offensive trend, the Crimson once again led from start to finish with the trio of Zepfel, Colton, and Wrobel attacking the goal, scoring eight of the team’s 14 goals.
The defensive unit kept the shots on Woolway limited, as Harvard recorded 14 steals in the match.
HARVARD 12, REDLANDS 10
The Crimson’s final game of the Gary Troyer Memorial Invitational was a much harder fight, with the Redlands staying close the entire game. The contest was neck and neck up until the fourth quarter.Going into the final frame, Harvard held a slim one-goal lead. The victory was up for grabs until the very end, as the two teams combined for seven goals in the final quarter.
HARVARD 11, WHITTIER 10
The Crimson offense came out strong, putting up a three goal advantage early in the first quarter, while the defense kept the Whittier offense at bay.
The defense struggled more so when it was a man down, as ejections allowed the Poets to forge a comeback. However, Harvard were able to maintain a four goal lead for most of the game when it was at full strength.
“It got a little chippy towards to end,” co-captain Max Murphy said. “They are a really talented team, really good west coast team and they were not happy losing in their own pool so they put up a fight in the fourth quarter.”
The team returns to division play next weekend as they face Brown and Connecticut College. The Crimson lost to the Bears last time the two teams met, with a final score of 13-8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Highlighted by sophomore Anne Cheng’s fifth place finish and a strong Sunday team effort, the Harvard women’s golf team placed third at the 2014 Nittany Lion Invitational this past weekend. As a team, the Crimson shot a 33-over-par 897, three strokes behind Columbia and two strokes behind Yale, after finishing five strokes behind the Bulldogs at last weekend’s Yale Invitational.
The 14-team, three-day tournament took place at Penn State’s Blue Course in State College and also featured Ivy League opponent Princeton, which placed fifth at 47-over-par. Kelsey Murphy of Eastern Michigan captured the individual title by shooting a 218, including a four-under 68 on Sunday. The Lions took the overall team trophy with a three-day total of 894 and also had four players in the top-20.
Entering the final round, Harvard trailed both the Bulldogs and Columbia, having posted rounds of 302 on Friday and 300 on Saturday. However, three Harvard golfers managed to play their best round on championship Sunday to key the Crimson to a 295, the second-best round of any team for the tournament. Junior Christine Lin led the charge with an even-par 72, senior Brenna Nelson carded a two-over-par 74, and junior Courtney Hooton wrapped up her weekend with a six-over 78.
“It was probably our best scoring round just because we knew the course better after two days of playing on it," captain Tiffany Lim said. "Coach lectured us, telling us all our games looked really good [on the first two days and] all we had to do was keep doing that and the scores would eventually keep falling for us.”
However, the effort was not quite enough, as the Lions and Yale each posted sub-300 scores on the final day to edge Harvard on the scoreboard. The Crimson’s top three golfers placed in the top-20 of the tournament, with Cheng leading the way with a five-over 221, freshman Lita Guo placing 16th at 11-over in her first collegiate tournament, and Lim rounding out the trio with a three round total of 228, good enough for 19th place in her first action of the season.
“[Guo] did a really good job of staying positive on the course despite a couple weird holes every now and then," Lim said. "Cheng played amazing as usual, [as] slow and steady wins the race. Brenna put up solid rounds all three days and was a really solid anchor for us, and the juniors [Lin] and [Hooton] played their hearts out.”
Cheng posted another strong performance this weekend after finishing tied for 10th in New Haven. Along with Akron's Frida Fougberg, the sophomore was one of two to post a 75 or better in each of the three rounds.
“Emotionally, I didn’t have any ups or downs,” Cheng said. “I just played my game, [and] concentrated on what I needed to concentrate on.”
Cheng’s posted a 75 in the first round, carding five bogeys. But the Torrance, CA native bounced back in a big way on Saturday with an even-par 72, highlighted by three birdies on the front nine. To round out her weekend, she carded a 74 with two more birdies.
“In the second tournament [of the season], I thought we played a lot better than last week…but we have lots of room for improvement,” Cheng said.“I think we’re just going to keep practicing and keep trying our best to be where we want to be.”
In two weekends, the Crimson will travel to Palo Alto for the Stanford Intercollegiate Tournament. The weekend will be a homecoming for Harvard, as five of the eight Crimson golfers hail from the Golden State.
“We’re not going to be preparing any differently,” Lim said. “We’re just going to keep on practicing, keep on getting rested and trusting that getting those extra reps will help us score better at Stanford.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after duking it out with some of the top teams in the nation at the Battle for Beantown, the Harvard men and women’s cross country teams traveled to Lehigh University to participate in the Paul Short Invitational.
The race gave many Crimson runners who are outside the top seven the chance to run and compete against teams from around the nation as well as Ivy League foes, while many of the previous week’s competitors got a much deserved rest.
Harvard highlighted its depth as the women finished 13th for the 6k race in a field of 38 led by senior captain Jen Guidera while the men took 32nd in a 42 team 8k race behind senior Nephat Maritim.
“This was a little bit of a mixed lineup for us,” head coach Jason Saretsky said. “Most of our top kids were competing the weekend before. This was a great opportunity for some of our other student athletes to get out there and get real, high level competition.”
The women provided a strong showing as Guidera clocked in with a time of 21:13, good enough for a 55th place finish. She was followed by sophomore Sarah Gillespie, who joined her in the top 100 with a 21:20, giving her a 64th place finish.
Gillespie was followed by classmates Rachel Hampton and Stephanie Deccy who joined their teammates at the finish with times of 21:45 and 21:49, finishing in 98th and 110th place. Freshman Elianna Shwayder completed the scoring with an 139th place finish and a time of 22:05, assuring all five runners finished in the top half of the 325 women field.
“I thought we performed really well [and] everyone put it out there,” Guidera said. “We had some people take a risk in the first mile and it didn’t pay off for some and it paid off for others, but overall we ran a pretty tough race.”
On the men’s side, the Crimson were led by Maritin, who crossed the line with a time of 24:31 finishing in 32nd place. It would be more than two minutes before Harvard would see another runner cross the line, as junior Johnny Marvin joined his teammate with a time of 25:41, finishing in 158th.
The rest of the scoring contingency for the men crossed the line soon after Marvin, as he was followed by senior Ryan Meehan, sophomore Evan Grandfield and senior Carl Ward. The three clocked in with times of 25:52, 26:00 and 26:06 respectively, earning 191st, 205th and 225th places finishes in a field of 358 runners.
With many of the team’s top performers resting during the weekend, the race demonstrated the depth of the team, as Harvard continues to improve.
Though the invitational proved to be a faster race then the Battle of Beantown, the times and average pace achieved by runners such as Maritim, Guidera and Gillespie still compare favorably to those posted by their teammates the prior week.
“It’s a good push for everyone on the team,” Guidera said. “It’s definitely going to inspire and excite the people who are running faster so it was a good race in that sense.”
Having a deep team allows runners to push each other, helping improve team and individual performance by emulating a competitive environment. With only seven runners making it to NCAA regionals, having a deep team is vital for the Crimson to enter with the strongest team possible.
“I’ve always felt for a long time that if you’re going to have a national caliber team you have to have at least 8 [runners] that are vying for those top seven spots,” Saretsky said. “I think on [both] sides we have more than that, so it’s exciting for our program [and] it speaks for our depth.”
Harvard will take a weekend off before the squad splits into two teams to compete at the prestigious Wisconsin Adidas Invitational and the Princeton Invite on October 17th and 18th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite adding two losses to its record, the Crimson field hockey team (6-4, 1-2 Ivy) emerged from the weekend’s games undeterred as it enters the second half of season play.
Saturday afternoon Harvard faced Brown (5-2, 2-1 Ivy) and played extended minutes in a hard-fought match, losing in double overtime to the Bears. The next day, exhausted from the battle against the Bears, the Crimson faced nationally-ranked Boston University but ultimately lost, 3-1.
“We knew going into the game that BU was a top team, and they were going to be one of the strongest competitors we had seen,” said junior Elizabeth Jacobson, who scored the Crimson’s lone goal. “We came off the field knowing we had played well and held our own, so we weren’t as down after [Sunday’s] loss.”
HARVARD 1, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 3
Despite physical exhaustion after over 90 minutes of play the previous afternoon, Harvard showed up ready to compete on Sunday.
“After Saturday’s game, we knew we had to learn from our mistakes,” Jacobson said. “We all agree that we need to fight for 70 minutes; we have to come out with everything we have. It’s okay to make mistakes, but we can’t repeat them.”
BU reminded the Crimson of the skill and intensity the match would require shortly after the first whistle blew, scoring off a corner at 7:44. The Crimson responded just 10 minutes later.
Wellington provided her third assist of the weekend, dribbling through defenders up the right line to send the ball to Jacobson in the air. Jacobson ran into open space, sending the equalizer past the goalie with a reverse-stick.
“It set BU back on its heels when we scored,” Jacobson said of her fifth goal of the season. “We did well at getting the ball back to the circle, Hannah had the great pass, it was a perfect set up, and they were not prepared. They didn’t think we could come out that hard.”
The Terriers took the lead again with less than five minutes in the half, and finished the game at 57:03 with a third goal. The Crimson was disappointed but felt it had competed well against the more heralded team across the Charles.
“We did a really good job of putting pressure on [BU],” Jacobson said. “We definitely held our own, and showed them that we were a competitive team. I know the score was 3-1, but it was 1-1 for a long time. It was nice seeing the other team get frustrated; they were a little stunned, and frantic for a few minutes.”
Harvard looked to the weekend’s losses as learning opportunities, and discussed a few goals as it prepares to face top Ivy squads in the remainder of the season.
“If we can keep our work rate up going forward it will help,” Jacobson said. “We need to focus on working as a unit, and playing for each other and I think that’s our main goal.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 4
After falling behind 2-0 in the first half against Brown, senior Noel Painter scored two goals within ten minutes to tie the game before halftime.
“Starting the second half 2-2 was like a new game,” Painter said. “We were starting at 0-0. We needed to come out hard and just get ahead.”
The senior scored her third goal of the game at 57:44 off freshman Hannah Wellington’s second assist of the evening, giving the Crimson its first lead of the game.
Harvard looked to maintain control for the remaining ten minutes, hoping to keep its opponents from scoring. The Crimson nearly accomplished this task, but with just 30 seconds left, the Bears responded and tied the game 3-3, sending it into overtime.
“It was just a simple mistake at the end,” Jacobson said. “We thought we had it. Instead of being controlled, we let up a little too much.”
While Crimson goalie Issy Davies kept the back of the net empty during the first overtime, blocking five shots on goal, Brown ended the second overtime with a shot by Jaclyn Torres to win the game.
Due to the quick turnaround, Harvard did not have much time to dwell on Saturday’s loss. The team’s thoughts went quickly to preparing for BU.
“Everyone had to visualize and focus on what they had done wrong and what they needed to work on [after Saturday’s loss],” Jacobson said. “This weekend was a lot about fixing the individual and coming together as a team.”

UPDATED: October 8, 2014, at 1:45 a.m.
Even though that shiny piece of plastic can get you almost anywhere at Harvard, there are several spots on campus notorious for their stinginess, even to those holding HUIDs.
Loomis-Michael Observatory
Unfortunately, you can’t access this observatory, located on the tenth floor of the Science Center, with the simple swipe of an ID card. However, the Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe (STAHR) offer a series of telescope training classes every week for those who want to use it recreationally. All Harvard ID holders who complete STAHR’s course are allowed to use the observatory at their disposal if they complete three classes and pass a test.
Worth it? Definitely. You only have to go through a few hours of training to access the telescope room for the rest of your time at Harvard. Also, the observatory is a super romantic place to take your Tinder date.
Houghton Library Reading Room
Even though a Harvard ID is technically all you need to access this room in the Houghton Library all wishing to gain access must register with a Special Collections Request Account. Once you fill apply via their online form, you can visit the Reading Room, which is said to include parts of the Theodore Roosevelt collection (read Teddy’s diary!), as well as drawings and bookbindings dating back to the 15th century. All reading room patrons must be 18 or older, and you cannot take items such as cell phones and pens into the room with you.
Filling out Houghton’s online form doesn’t take too long, and unlike Anthropology 1130, you can experience ancient history sans jumping into a five foot pit.
Harvard Fatigue Laboratory Records
Why do possessors of HUID need advance notice to simply access lab records? These files at the Medical School library are from the now defunct Harvard Fatigue Laboratory, which conducted studies from 1927-1947 on the physiological and psychological effects that extreme stress has on humans. The study used treadmills, a climate room, an altitude chamber, and an animal room to measure the effects that extreme elevation and extreme temperature had on the human psyche.  The lab closed down shortly after World War II, but not before moving some experiments to 17,500 feet up in the Himalayas. The study made a significant contribution to the military regarding soldiers’ clothing, nutrition, and survival gear.
Unfortunately no level of swipe access can allow you to feel the sensation of running on a treadmill alongside a horse in fabricated Amazonian weather.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 8, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the requirements to gain HUID swipe access to the Loomis-Michael Observatory. In fact, the Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe require interested observers take three classes and a test before granting access.
