After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the sound of a million papers falling—
My parents had just moved the cabinet in the computer room for the first time in years. I sat a literal breath behind them, my chair back a thin wall. Still focused on my unfinished college application essay, the leafy shattering hit with the force of a cloud.
“What the—” I heard my parents puzzle in Chinese. Part of me could imagine them standing ankle deep in the papers, clueless. The vividness triggered sudden urgency. And turning my neck as nonchalantly as possible, I looked back on the scene I imagined. Yellowing worksheets of childish pencil and red pen everywhere. My biggest secret.
My dad bent down and picked up a paper. “Oh my god, where did all of this come from! Does this house have a ghost?” Even in this moment, he found it easier to take a supernatural explanation. Not liking this somewhat creepy direction of thought, I staged a dramatic moment of realization, pretending to have forgotten all about the worksheets of Cs and Ds from as recent as 8th grade. Still in shock, my parents slowly comprehended the broken scheme, laughing with belated bemusement.

“Juku?” This was my third time repeating the reason my host mom couldn’t let me into the house on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. “Ano, Jugyou?” Class. They had class after school? Judo?
Finally google translate came out. When I saw the words “cram school,” I had to fight to hide my surprise. I’ve always known vaguely about the “test prep factories” in China, and South Korea’s amusing need to enforce a curfew for studying was a vivid read. My conversation with my host mom made things a little too real, however. My host siblings are only six and eight. On top of their regular elementary school day, which requires a backpack heavier than mine, it seems almost ridiculous that they have the energy to attend two hour juku classes twice a week, piano lessons, swimming lessons, and finish all the outside work in between.
Of course, they also watched cartoons, made random crafts, and visited friends. But my time home was often defined by their protests. The younger one would turn into a glaring zombie, taking almost two hours to eat her dinner. The older one would wait until my host dad returned too to cry about how frustrating the Bach Invention was. In between all the my-god-please-learn-how-to-suck-it-up fits, there were more than enough moments where I couldn’t help thinking bitterly that the expectations being put onto them were unreasonably high.
In some kind of subtle way, I tried to explain to my host mom that yes, I studied hard to get good test scores, and yes, I did more extracurriculars than I really should have. But none of that started before 9th grade. Fourth grade was the age of Harry Potter and middle school was the absolute boredom of two hour walks every single summer day.
She listened to this life story with the same level of emotion as she did for anything else—punctuating the narratives with exclamations of "sugoi" and somewhat admiring "eeehhs." That was all. None of it seemed remotely relevant to the lives of her two daughters. There was no “maybe they should spend more time playing” or “perhaps age six is too early for cram school.” And the next day they were sent once again to lesson after lesson, markers of a path of life that was so extraordinarily commonplace.
Since those conversations, almost two months have passed. By now the hectic schedule of my host siblings seems natural, and the relative quiet of their dampened energy is somewhat helpful for letting me focus on my own readings. When I came home the other day, I was almost bewildered from not hearing the sound of Bach.
Three screaming kids ran up to me—a friend that I had seen before had come to play. With barely enough time to throw my bags in my room, I was pulled into the living room, where the  friend’s mother took my disheveledness by surprise. Apologizing and introducing myself at the same time, I answered the requisite questions and recounted the final exam I had just finished. “Sugoi!” the friend’s mother commented. “In Japan, we don’t usually have three hour tests.” As my host mom replied with more comments about my study habits, the woman’s quick eyes paused for a moment on the heated game of Life the three kids were battling. And with a slightly envious smile she asked: “But in America, you don’t have to study in Elementary school, right?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Take a look around: It seems patently obvious that men and women are different. Men prefer to drink beer and watch football, while women prefer to drink vodka cranberries and paint their nails. Men enjoy earning promotions at work, while women enjoy staying at home and taking care of the children. Given the vast disparity in the choices that men and women make in their  hobbies, occupations, and even alcoholic drinks, it sometimes seems like we come from two entirely different planets.
But what if I told you that many of our choices weren’t actually ours to make? Instead, they were made for us from the moment we are born and the doctor examined our genitals and announced either “It’s a boy!” or “It’s a girl!”
Children who are proclaimed boys will be dressed in blue onesies, grow up in rooms adorned with football wallpaper, shop in the boy’s section of the toy store, build battleships with Legos and play baseball with their father, and watch television shows and see men as scientists, as businessmen, as leaders, as United States presidents.
On the other hand, children who are proclaimed girls will be dressed in pink onesies, grow up in rooms adorned with princess wallpaper, shop in the girl’s section of the toy store, bake cookies with toy ovens, push little baby dolls in strollers, experiment with makeup with their mother, and watch television shows and see women as nurses, as models, as mothers, as housewives.
In this way, our preferences are constructed for us the moment we are born. And even as we grow up, gender roles continue to dictate the choices we make. For example, 10 percent of women in the United Kingdom stay at home to raise a family, whereas just over one percent of men are stay-at-home fathers. Men represent less than 10 percent of the nursing workforce; women make up only 21 percent of computer programmers. These statistics are often referenced as evidence of individual preferences, of the idea that this disparity in numbers can be attributed simply to men’s preference for STEM and pursuing high-powered careers and women’s preference for nurturing babies and staying at home.
But that’s simply not true. Despite what people like the author of “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus” would like us to believe, research has actually shown that men’s and women’s brain aren’t that different. There is, in fact, no such thing as a “male” or “female” brain. Men do not have brains that predispose them toward aggression and logic, and women do not have brains that predispose them toward nurturing and creativity.
The differences that we observe between men and women are a result of nothing more than gender roles—the societal norms that dictate what types of behaviors are acceptable for a person based on their perceived sex. There is nothing about playing football that is inherently masculine, and there is nothing about wearing makeup that is inherently feminine. Gender is nothing more than a social construct.
We learn gender roles from society even at an early age. As we grow up, we adopt behaviors that are rewarded with praise and hide those that are punished with ridicule. Boys who play with Barbies are derided as effeminate; girls who play with Nerf guns are mocked as unladylike. According to Planned Parenthood, by the age of three, "children have usually learned to prefer toys and clothes that are “appropriate” to their gender"—boys stop playing with dolls and girls stop shooting Nerf guns.
The problem isn’t simply that gender roles are often inaccurate; rather, they are also actively harmful and oppressive. Consider the stereotype that women are less competent in STEM. Research has actually shown that code written by female computer programmers is more likely to be approved by their peers—but only if their gender is concealed.
Yet, the prevailing belief that women are incompetent coders discourages women from pursuing a career in STEM, simply because they get the message early in life that they don’t belong in that field. As a result, women are still vastly underrepresented in STEM fields. This has disastrous consequences: not only are women shuttered away from high-paying jobs, we as a society are not reaching our full potential for innovation by systematically excluding half the population from STEM.
Furthermore, gender roles systematically devalue women’s work. There is a reason why activities such as teaching, childcare, and even housework are paid very little or not at all—they are predominantly performed by women. And the argument that those occupations are paid less only because they are easier and require less skill completely collapses upon closer scrutiny. For example, doctors in the United States are paid very well and held in high esteem. But in Russia, where the majority of doctors are women, and medical practice is stereotyped as a caring vocation “naturally suited” to women, being a doctor is one of the lowest paying and poorly-respected professions. In short, it’s not the skill level or effort required of a job that matters; work that is done by women is systematically devalued, underpaid, and disrespected.
Feminism, therefore, is about empowering people to make their own choices, rather than the choices that society has already made for them. It’s about liberating people from stifling gender roles. It’s about destroying the notion that men are from Mars and women are from Venus. At the end of the day, we are all from the planet Earth. We are more alike than we are different.
What would a world without gender roles look like? It would be a world where people can make their own choices, independent of societal expectations. It would be a world where activities, careers, and hobbies are not designated “feminine” or “masculine.” It would be a world where people could do whatever they want, regardless of their gender identity. I don’t know about the rest of you, but that sounds like the kind of world I’m ready to live in.
