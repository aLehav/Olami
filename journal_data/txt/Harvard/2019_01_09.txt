After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Can’t hear, can’t speak, can’t see: Susanne Bier’s “Bird Box” builds on the sensory deprivation horror trope that “Hush” and “A Quiet Place” capitalized on months earlier. (The narrative similarity is so apparent, it spawned a whole new meme.) In an era of increasing paranoia of our collective helplessness in the political sphere, little is more horrifying than restricted agency. (In that way, it feels tonally in sync with another Netflix release: “Bandersnatch,” the latest “Black Mirror” installment.)
Disappointingly, “Bird Box” feels less like a film — you know, that art form with its own muscle and verve — and more like a computer-generated amalgamation of societal anxieties and action blockbuster tropes. It’s the kind of genre flick that seems cobbled together from grab-bag thriller motifs drawn out of a hat. A resilient mother figure? Check. A desperate last-ditch journey to a (logically unfeasible) safe haven? Check. An apocalyptic global catastrophe as a vague topical allegory? Check, check, and check.
With a plot this formulaic, it’s unlikely that a full synopsis is necessary after five minutes of watching, but here goes anyway: First, a cryptic shot of a river portends disaster. Flashback to five years before: Malorie (Sandra Bullock), heavily pregnant but still a tough and no-nonsense gal, is accompanied by her horse breeder sister (a criminally underused Sarah Paulson) to an OB-GYN appointment. Suddenly, aforementioned disaster implodes their inoffensively pleasant existence. A mysterious force causes anyone who looks at it to go starry-eyed and kill themselves. Chaos abounds, and Malorie seeks shelter in a confusingly decked-out mansion with a motley crew that includes John Malkovich, Jacki Weaver, Trevante Rhodes, Lil Rel Howery, BD Wong, and for some reason, Machine Gun Kelly. (Yes, you read that correctly.)
The usual archetypes abound. Malkovich’s character Douglas is an alcoholic grump whose main tic is cocking a shotgun and swilling whiskey. Rhodes’s Tom is a kind-hearted Iraq vet who insists on opening the door every damn time someone knocks. Machine Gun Kelly is a scrawny, bleach-blonde drug dealer who peddles pills even in the midst of catastrophe. Do any of these details matter? Intermittent flash-forwards show Malorie hauling two children across a river via rowboat, so it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to predict the fates of her companions in the bunker. It’s only a matter of time before Eric Heisserer’s screenplay cuts each lifespan short in a newly gruesome way, unnaturally dark blood pooling on the floor. The deaths are made all the more senseless by their increasing frequency, and by the third or fourth, we’ve stopped caring.
Being a genre movie is a forgivable transgression if done well. Admittedly, “Bird Box” begins with an interesting conceit. Yet it’s quickly clear that the film can’t even sketch the contours of its own worldbuilding. What, exactly, is the entity that’s killing people? Bier establishes the relevant facts: Looking at it means death. Occluded vision, usually via blindfold, is the only way to survive. It whispers something meaningful to each listener, in the voice of a long-gone loved one. Also, “psychos” (to borrow the film’s terms) who escaped from the asylum can look at it without turning to suicide themselves, and evilly force others to witness its “beauty.” (Because people with mental illnesses are… trying to infect other people? The film’s take is murky and offensive.)
As for the specifics, even the characters themselves are unsure. Douglas concludes that the force “has a classic bio-warfare signature,” while Lil Rel Howery’s Charlie hypothesizes that it’s a religious reckoning of some kind. Thematically, it seems to be an allegory for … something. Climate change? Mental illness? Contagion? Nuclear war? Some other societal silent killer? Little else is clear, beyond the fact that it spells the end of the world as we know it. Here, ambiguity is neither generative, nor artistically purposeful. It’s just confusing.
But “Bird Box” isn’t merely qualitatively mediocre. At times, it is even problematically reductive, in its shoddy treatment of the mentally ill, gay people, people of color, and women, in rapid succession. Genre films like “Get Out” open the door for subversive representation, but “Bird Box” carelessly dispenses of its characters of color with disappointing ease. A minor (yet inconsequential) spoiler: Wong’s character, a gay Asian man, meets a grisly and all-too-soon end. Charlie meets a similar fate. Admittedly, Tom goes on to sustain a slightly longer arc, albeit mainly in service of Malorie’s character development. And Malorie herself is archetypal, in turns shallowly resilient, then shallowly emotional, as if this binary represents the sum total of female experience. In that vein, Bullock’s performance is mostly heavy breathing, crying, and tense yelling. On top of this, her character only achieves maturation by embracing motherhood (while not unbelievable per se, a narrative decision that feels emblematic of a hasty impulse by a male screenwriter).
Ultimately, “Bird Box” offers up a story that “The Quiet Place” already did better. Maybe it was mimetic that watching the film felt akin to witnessing a spiraling disaster, over the course of two painful hours. Seeing, it seems, is not always believing.

Chipotle Mexican Grill will no longer be an option for students seeking to satisfy their burrito cravings. The fast casual Mexican restaurant closed down its Harvard Square location earlier this month.
Chipotle, known for its burritos and burrito bowls, has occupied a place at One Brattle Square for over a decade. Declining popularity and intense competition from rival Mexican restaurants like El Jefe’s Taqueria and Felipe’s Mexican Taqueria were driving forces behind Chipotle’s departure, according to Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson.
“We knew for a while they were struggling to keep open. They just weren’t getting the kind of business that they needed in order to stay an active and viable business in Harvard Square,” Jillson said.
Chipotle is the latest in a string of Harvard Square businesses to close its doors, following the closings of Crema Cafe and Tealuxe in December.
The restaurant was met by an enthusiastic welcome when it first moved into Harvard Square in early 2008. Its grand opening saw long lines of hungry diners, eager to support the chain’s arrival in the Square – and to grab a celebratory free burrito. But its popularity has waned in recent years.
Jillson said Chipotle has failed to match its rivals in the Square in attracting customers. Other Mexican restaurants in the Square have retained loyal consumer bases that have given them the upper hand, according to Jillson.
“When a business fails or leaves the Square, there’s always more than one reason and, many times, in almost all cases, it’s consumer driven,” she said.
Jillson also cited the negative publicity surrounding recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses as a potential cause of the business’s waning success. In 2015, 80 Boston College students fell ill with norovirus after eating at a local Chipotle. The chain’s reputation suffered another blow in the summer of 2018 after an outbreak of the clostridium perfringens bacteria in an Ohio restaurant.
Chipotle National Headquarters did not respond to a request for comment.
It is unclear who will fill the space left by Chipotle. Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc., the real estate investment firm that owns the property at One Brattle Square, did not respond to a request for comment.
Several students said they valued Chipotle’s convenience, quality, and affordability, and will miss the restaurant.
“I always liked Chipotle,” Clay E. Oxford ’22 said. “It was a good, reliable option, and I always knew what I was getting.”
Lauren A. Sierra ’19 said she was saddened and disappointed by the news of Chipotle closing. She said she will now have to go to El Jefe’s and Felipe’s for her burrito bowls.
“I just don’t understand why we can't have nice things,” Sierra, a former Crimson editor, said.
Though it will now be harder for Harvard students to dine at Chipotle, Cambridge residents still have access to four other Chipotle locations across the city. The nearest Chipotle to Harvard Square will now be be on Massachusetts Ave. in Cambridge’s Central Square.
Diab “Dody” T. Eid ’20 wrote in an email that Chipotle’s closure has left him shocked and dismayed.
“This is the worst thing to happen to Cambridge, maybe ever,” Eid wrote. “Every time I walk by the Harvard University Employees Credit Union—as one so often does—I’ll look across the street, only to be reminded of what was once there, but is now lost forever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard undergraduate who sued the University alleging it had wrongfully opened an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him has voluntarily dismissed his suit, according to documents filed in federal court Friday.
The unnamed male student, first dubbed “John Doe” and later “Jack Doe” in court filings, sued the University last November in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts for opening an investigation into allegations that he raped a non-Harvard student in an apartment building located hundreds of miles from campus in July 2017.
Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution — which handles formal complaints of gender and sexual-based harassment — opened its investigation in October 2018, according to the complaint. Doe contended ODR did not have the jurisdiction to investigate an alleged incident that did not involve another Harvard student and did not take place on University property.
In arguing that ODR overreached, Doe pointed to University sexual harassment policies that apply only to misconduct perpetrated by Harvard affiliates while on campus or in connection with University-related activities. The policy also covers harassment that may create a “hostile environment” for other Harvard affiliates.
Doe, however, is likely also subject to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ policies due to his status as a College student. FAS policies and procedures are broader in scope and hold students to the expectation that they behave in a “in a mature and responsible manner” no matter where they are.
“It is the expectation of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that all students, whether or not they are on campus or are currently enrolled in a degree program, will behave in a mature and responsible manner,” the policy reads. “Consistent with this principle, sexual and gender-based misconduct are not tolerated by the FAS even when, because they do not have the effect of creating a hostile environment for a member of the University community, they fall outside the jurisdiction of the University Policy.”
The University policies do not preclude schools within Harvard from creating and enforcing their own policies, which may be more expansive than the University’s — as is the case with the FAS policies.
Doe alleged in his complaint that Harvard had created a reasonable expectation that Doe would earn a degree from the university by allowing him to take classes in exchange for “substantial amounts of money.” The ODR investigation constituted a breach of contract and a breach of covenant of faith and fair dealing, according to the complaint. One possible outcome of an ODR investigation is expulsion.
Doe demanded that Harvard halt the investigation, pay him $75,000 in damages, and compensate him for the costs of litigation.
On Dec. 19, Harvard moved to dismiss Doe’s complaint on the grounds that Doe’s claim of breach of contract is “directly contradicted by the plain language of the Harvard policies” at question in the suit.
The FAS policies state that College's Administrative Board “may” refer cases involving misconduct that falls outside the jurisdiction of the University Policy to the University’s Office for Dispute Resolution.
In a joint status report Harvard and Doe filed on Dec. 14th, 2018, Harvard stated that, in a December 2018 hearing, the court “indicated Harvard may investigate and, if appropriate, discipline students who engage in off-campus misconduct.” The status report also states that, at the hearing, the court “expressed concerns” about whether the language of the FAS policies supported the referral of Doe’s case to ODR for an investigation.
Though Harvard stood by the validity of the referral to ODR in the report, it conceded that the language of the FAS policy is “permissive” and did not “mandate” that Doe’s case be referred to ODR.
Two days after the hearing, Harvard informed Doe that the Ad Board was “prepared to conduct its own investigation into the alleged sexual misconduct at issue,” according to the report.
“Harvard has asked Plaintiff to notify Harvard by December 21, 2018, whether he would prefer that the investigation into the alleged misconduct be conducted by the Ad Board or whether he will instead consent to a referral to ODR for that investigation,” the report states.
In the same report, Doe stated he “continues to believe that Harvard lacks the authority to impose its campus disciplinary process on him for alleged conduct that did not involve another Harvard student, did not occur during any Harvard-sponsored activity or event, and that took place hundreds of miles from campus.”
Doe agreed to notify Harvard of his position and proposed both parties be required to submit another joint status report by December 21. In the status report filed on Dec. 21, the two parties wrote that they continued to “meet and confer regarding a potential resolution” and proposed to submit another update by Jan. 4.
On Jan. 4, in place of a joint status report, Doe filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit.
“The parties indicated in a joint status report on December 20, 2018, that they were discussing a resolution of this matter outside of court and would submit an additional status report on the status of those discussions on or before January 4, 2018,” the motion reads. “The parties have reached such a resolution.”
The lawsuit was terminated Monday, court records state.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the position on the suit represented in the Dec. 14th report is Harvard’s current position.
“There was no concession or change, Harvard moved to dismiss this case, and instead of responding, the Plaintiff unilaterally decided to voluntarily dismiss himself, rather than respond to our motion,” Dane wrote.
Doe is still the defendant of a separate civil lawsuit. The woman who alleges Doe raped her — named Jane Roe in court documents — filed a civil personal injury suit against Doe in March 2018, according to the original November complaint. That lawsuit is currently ongoing.
