After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, several artists will challenge the expectation that art belongs in galleries by presenting their outdoor work, created with funding from the Office for the Arts, all over the Yard. Four pieces of artwork will be displayed in public spaces Friday through Sunday in an effort to explore the possibilities of public art and as part of the Arts First festival. The pieces, which were contributed by Harvard graduate and undergraduate students, were funded by grants from the Office for the Arts.
The pieces are “59801,” by Antonio César Méndez, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; “The Churning Mind,” by Ashleigh Cote ’15; “Exquisite Portraits: A Drawing Game in the Yard,” by Graduate School of Education students Shawn M. Lavoie and Wilhelmina Peragine; and “Hashtag,” a project that displays 50 different “hashtags” throughout the Yard. This last project was created by the Harvard Generalist, a recently founded student-driven arts collective. According to scupltor Nancy Selvage, who advised the student artists, there were originally two other projects planned for the Yard, but one was cancelled due to the events at the marathon and the other was deemed so ambitious that it required a Cambridge building permit.
Submitting entries and applying for OFA funding—a grant that can range from $100 to $500—is a yearlong process. After leading a class to develop a collaborative art project for last year’s festival, Selvage, who is also the former director of the OFA Ceramics Program, now advises on installation logistics for each project. According to Selvage, the artists brainstorm options to integrate their artistic concepts with realistic and feasible strategies to create a structurally sound installation. For some of these artists, the task of creating an art piece that engages with its surroundings is an emotional journey. Méndez, who drew his inspiration for “59801” from the death of his father, aspired to bridge the gap between his response to that life event and the collective human experience. According to Méndez, the project is an attempt to create an architectural representation of his emotional state.“59801” consists of a series of three doors and four pedestals that structure an imaginary room.
Within the room, different types of destroyed wood are presented on pedestals. According to Méndez, these elements are all a play on the impermanence of wood, since the doors and pedestals of the artwork and the surrounding trees in the Yard are all of the same material. “I wanted to explore certain concepts of memory architecturally as opposed to a linguistic system or with words. I chose the format of the room because I thought of myself moving through that space and interacting with different objects,” he says.Méndez says he was inspired by the writings of Svetlana Boym, a professor of Slavic and comparative literature, after taking one of her classes, Comparative Literature 256: “Archeology of Modernity and Visual Culture.” In particular, he was influenced by Boym’s writings on exile, estrangement, and nostalgia.
Méndez ultimately gathered photographs taken and poems read by the students of the class to provide visual and auditory components to his project. “[The photographs] will be used to make a number of comments in the sense that they stand apart [from] the domestic themes of doors and pedestals. Since they are very urban-themed, I wanted to represent the tension between these two realms of social lives, the domestic sphere and the public urban sphere,” he says.
While Méndez drew upon inner experiences to inspire his public art, Lavoie and Peragine interpreted the public space of the Yard to create a project that forces its viewer to physically interact with the piece itself. “Exquisite Portraits: A Drawing Game in the Yard” is essentially a three-sided drawing kiosk on which three people can create “exquisite portraits” of themselves at the same time.
“We imagine that some people would take this [in] a literal way, and others an absurd way. When I was a little kid, we imagined monsters this way,” Peragine says. Believing that play and imagination continue to be important parts of adulthood, Lavoie and Peragine were inspired by the Surrealist technique “the Exquisite Corpse” where participants each add on parts of a drawing in succession to create a composite work.
“We’re trying to figure out ways to make new art. Where does newness come from? It comes from the deep, dark imaginary,” Lavoie says.

“At last / My love has come along / My lonely days are over / And life is like a song.”
You’ve heard the lyrics before, but never like this. The love song made famous by Etta James serves as the frame for “At Last,” a theatrical dance show that will run in the Loeb Ex from May 2-4. The production is the result of a unique collaboration between choreographer and director Hazel A. Lever ’13 and composer Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14.
Dance is at the forefront in “At Last,” but the production is lent an additional layer of complexity by its plot. The dances in the production chronicle the evolving relationships of four different couples. In between dances, vocalist Page Axelson, a junior at Reading Memorial High School, sings differing versions of “At Last” that speak to the particular nature of the couples’ stories.
“The show tries to grapple with all of the different forms of intimacy,” Lever says.
“I think it’s a really cool way to use dance, that I’m not sure a lot of people have seen before,” dancer Talia M. Fox ’13 says. “The content is easy to relate to…. It deals with emotions and things that people have to confront every day in their relationships.”
Indeed, audience members will have to confront the dancers, as the attendees are invited to move throughout the theater and view the dances from a variety of angles. Fox hopes that this will allow audience members to create their own experience of the show.
Producer Alexandra M. Kiley ’15 believes one of the production’s strong points is its confluence of multiple art forms.
“It does a very good job of connecting the theater and dance communities,” Kiley says.
Rabinowitz echoes Kiley’s sentiment. “It’s a marriage of all things awesome.”

“We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.” So goes the famous St. Crispin’s Day speech, delivered by King Henry V at the climax of the eponymous Shakespeare play. In a departure from more popular Shakespeare comedies or dramas, director Matthew G. Warner ’13 says, the decision to perform “Henry V,” an English historyplay, illuminates a different, lesser-known aspect of Shakespeare’s work. Presented by the Hyperion Shakespeare Company, “Henry V” will open at the Agassiz Theatre on May 3.
“Henry V” continues the story of Prince Harry, an unruly young boy previously seen in “Henry IV, Part 1” and “Henry IV, Part 2” as the new king of England. The play depicts Henry V’s newfound maturity as he embarks on a military conquest of France. Central to the play’s development is not Henry V’s military difficulties, but rather his lack thereof.
“What appealed to me about [this lack] is the way that this image of Henry is constructed and what the play does to show you that he’s supposed to be perfect,” Warner says. Warner has also decided to use period costumes to capture a layer of authenticity that some modern Shakespeare productions deliberately forgo.
Eli E. Kahn ’13, who plays Henry, adds that Henry’s character demonstrates significant development.
“There are parts of the play especially…where he’s humbled or confronted with the falsehood of some of his assumptions. There are definitely places to find nuance and evolution in the character,” Kahn says.
According to stage manager Matthew B. Barrieau ’16, the internal struggles that Henry faces resonate across eras, from Shakespearean England to modern-day Harvard. “In the course of our rehearsals, we’ve really worked to impact some of the psychological depth of Harry that necessarily explores…what it means to be in power, what it means to be an ideal figure that people look up to,” Barrieau says.

Around this time four years ago, I was committing to go to Harvard to study film. I was a typical high school film snob, which is to say, the worst kind. I was the kind of kid who thought that because I was the only one in school to have seen Renoir’s “Grand Illusion,” I knew everything there was to know about the world of film. If it was popular, it wasn’t for me. That summer, in 2009, a month before I showed up for freshman orientation, I saw Michael Bay’s “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” mostly so I could laugh at it. It was awful, to be sure, but I had already unfairly decided that before I had even purchased my ticket.
But I’ve learned a lot in my four years at Harvard. Perhaps most importantly, I’ve learned that being a film snob is terrible. It’s a generic, arrogant, and, perhaps most injuriously, narrow frame of mind that leads to prejudice as well as boring, predictable criticism. There is no shame in embracing kitsch.
So it is fitting, then, in the last review I will ever write for The Crimson, that I get to happily and wholeheartedly tell you that Michael Bay’s newest film “Pain & Gain” is so, so good. It’s a decent comedy and some sort of incredible, inadvertent self-parody of the Michael Bay mode of film.
“Pain & Gain” is a true crime film about Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg), a bodybuilder who recruits two coworkers (Anthony Mackie and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) to kidnap a Miami business mogul and force him to sign over his entire fortune. It is essentially a slapstick comedy about specimens of both incredible physical fitness and remarkable stupidity.
Connotatively, to call someone an auteur is a high compliment. But denotatively, auteur theory simply asserts that the director is the primary creative force behind a film, that the overall aesthetic, pacing, and intangible “feel” of a film can be attributed to a single person. Michael Bay is the most cogent example of an auteur today, having cultivated an aesthetic that is equal parts explosions, bombast, crude humor, and oversaturated color palette. Regardless of the quality of his films, it is tough to argue that he does not have a singular, cohesive style of filmmaking.
This is the essence of what makes “Pain & Gain” so interesting. Bay has described the film as a small character piece, made on the cheap ($25 million as opposed to $200 million), and yet it still feels remarkably like a Michael Bay film.
There are still dramatic proclamations set to stirring music that mean almost nothing. In addition, there is still all of the requisite humor aimed squarely at the teenage boy set. Mackie’s character, Adrian, refers to his steroid-shriveled testicles as “raisinettes” and at another point, a character misconstrues dialing *69 (the film is set in 1995) as a sex act. There are still all of the cinematic tactics in the Bay arsenal. Practically every other shot in the film is a low-angle shot that tracks around these muscle-bound characters, who look ready to burst out of their tight tank tops and possibly out of the film screen.
In fact, even with what is supposed to be a small character piece, Bay still manages to throw in one exploding car. And yes, the trio manages to walk away from it in slow motion as it erupts behind them.
Wahlberg and Mackie do serviceable jobs as the bumbling criminals. In particular, Wahlberg’s constantly amped-up persona and line delivery grows increasingly comical as the films goes on. Following a particularly fatal turn of events, Lugo stops to “get a pump,” lifting weights in the same room as his victim. One notable sight gag involves him walking out of a bank with a briefcase full of money, clutching it to his chest with both hands and grinning like a small child.
While Wahlberg, Mackie, and their comedy-ringer supporting cast (Tony Shalhoub, Rebel Wilson, Rob Corddry, and Ken Jeong) are decent, the film’s standout is The Rock, who in the past two years has truly grown into his niche as a film star. His character, a reformed criminal who has since found religion and wears one-size-too-small shirts that say things like “I am on Team Jesus,” gets some of the best lines. This includes the proclamation, “Jesus Christ has blessed me with many gifts. One of them is knocking someone the fuck out!” The Rock has arrived, folks. Don’t try to resist.
“Pain & Gain” is, in the end, a charming paradox. It is the least Michael-Bay film Bay has ever made, containing nearly none of the reckless destruction for which he is known. Yet somehow, it is also the most Michael-Bay a film can get, distilling all of his cinematic techniques down to their essence and deconstructing the aspects that fall into the Bay aesthetic. Despite never feeling schizophrenic, it is an example of a director falling into his worst habits and simultaneously a tragically fascinating attempt at restraint.
If you love Michael Bay, you will like “Pain & Gain.” If you hate Michael Bay, but love to make fun of his style, you will love “Pain & Gain.” There is nothing else quite like it. Don’t be a snob. Go see it.

While few may know it exists, Harvard does have a recording studio in the Quad for students' use. Unfortunately, it's filled with equipment from the '80s. Michael Jackson and Prince are great, but some students want to record more current music on more current equipment. And so they've launched Quad Sound Studios, which seeks to raise $20,000 in funding to create a "full-service recording studio," staffed with engineers to help musicians with recording, according to Matt P. Sheets '15, president of Quad Sound.
The studio, located under Holmes Hall in Pforzheimer House, is set to open next semester, Sheets said. While the group does already have a space for their studio, Dylan F. Perese '16, the business manager of Quad Sound, said that it is not operational yet.
 Quad Sound has already raised around $2,500, and the student leaders of the venture have discussed funding with the music department, Dean Hammonds, and alumni. Last week, the studio launched a new campaign to build student support by asking their peers to add their name to a form on its website.
 Sheets said that the main purpose of Quad Sound is to "build a community through a studio." The organization will not only be open to musicians among Harvard undergrads and graduate students, but it will also provide free recording to street musicians in Boston so that they can sell CDs of their music.
 On campus, the studio will help artists connect and learn from each other. "Harvard has way too many talented musicians for this not to exist," said Perese.

New York officials announced Monday Mayor Bloomberg’s proposal to raise the legal limit for buying all tobacco products from 18 to 21. It would not, however, prohibit adults under 21 from smoking cigarettes. In other words, cool older brothers across the New York metropolitan area just became a lot more popular.
So how does Mayor Bloomberg decide to introduce this surely overwhelmingly popular proposal? Well, given the “success” of his large soda ban, he hides of course. Instead of boldly announcing this healthy dose of paternalism himself, Bloomberg grants the honor to Christine C. Quinn, New York’s City Council speaker, Mayoral candidate, and soon-to-be human ashtray.
According to Ms. Quinn, there was, in fact, some thought behind the proposal; “With this legislation, we’ll be targeting the age group at which the overwhelming majority of smokers start.” Or, put in other words, “we wanted this legislation to piss off a majority of smokers. Besides, since clearly everyone respects the legal age limit for alcohol consumption, it’s a surefire win. Nobel prize please.”
To clarify, the legislation would punish shop owners who sold tobacco products to adults under 21 rather than the consumers.  This really just adds insult to injury. Not only are young adults too immature to decide for themselves whether or not to smoke, but even too young to bear responsibility for their choices. Clearly the malicious owners of convenience stores are wealthy enough to bear the burden.
To recap, an American 18-year-old may determine the future of this nation by voting, kill and die for this country by enlisting, and raise another human being by adopting. All of this is as legal as a Norman Rockwell painting of a boy scout saluting the flag. But, if a college student decides to take a cigarette break with a rum and 16 oz coke, all hell breaks loose in New York.
Of course Mayor Gloomberg is trying to repair his image after the local courts struck down his beloved ban on large soda. Let’s make this clear, Mayor Bloomberg is about as fun as a dozen hard candies wrapped in a wet rag.
Oh but the fun does not stop there. Bloomberg has also announced concurrent legislation forcing retailers to actually conceal their tobacco products. Obviously, the only reason people buy cigarettes anyway is because of the brightly colored packaging. In the end, this legislation will lead to something akin to a tobacco Easter egg hunt.
But wait, there’s more! Bloomberg also introduced more legislation in March that ensures the cost of a cigarette pack never dips below $10.50. This puts a single cigarette at about 50 cents or, in other words, five cents a puff. Pretty soon, you might find it a better bargain to get your fix by snorting gold dust.
Fortunately for Mayor Bloomberg, there is substantial precedent for banning certain groups from smoking in New York. At the turn of the century, New York banned women from smoking in public. It’s nice to watch history come full circle, if by "full circle” you count politicians turning 360 degrees in the name of progress.
The proposal, aside from harboring a condescending outlook on the rational faculty of young adults, is fighting a battle already won. Fourteen to 22-year-olds already overestimate the health risks of smoking. Maybe, just maybe, it’s because of the images of deformed fetuses, gangrened limbs, and gory autopsies plastered as “warning labels” on cigarette packs.
Here are some extra proposals for Mayor Bloomberg to consider. The Clinton Ordinance would allow the purchase of cigarettes but makes inhaling a capital offense. The Sisyphus Proposal forces smokers to reassemble their cigarettes after use. Then there’s the Public Shame edict that would allow smokers under 21 to be tarred and feathered and allows officers to tell any smoker they were adopted.
To be clear — I don’t smoke. Nor do I live in New York. But you don’t have to be a dolphin to support dolphin-free tuna. However, I am a friend to many Tobaccan-Americans at Harvard and I see them face ever-increasing restrictions. Even at Harvard, home to the brightest minds, smokers cannot smoke within 25 feet of any Harvard building or anywhere on the Longwood campus, the Business School, or the Kennedy School of Government (of all places that could use a cigarette).  If Cambridge adopts its proposed outdoor smoking ban, there may not be a safe place to light up for seven square miles.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that these laws arise from merely an aesthetic and personal repugnance, without regard for self-determination.

I frankly don’t have the energy or desire to try to draw conclusions from last week’s events in Boston. My own hunch is that there is little we could have done to prevent them from happening (though I defer to others for more researched conclusions). Instead I just want to leave an honest account on my own reactions to it all.
Terrorism has always felt very distant to me. Growing up in the Midwest, I knew no one remotely near Manhattan on 9/11. Terrorism was something that happened on my television screen. To have what appears to have been terrorism pierce that mental cushion and come to the town you live in is a strange thing. The collision of the normal and the bizarre is jarring.
Last week reminded me of a time when I was in high school. A teenage boy with a rifle shot and killed eight Omahans doing their Christmas shopping in a mall minutes away from my house. He killed himself near the customer service desk that wraps my presents for free each year. Right by the place I stand to pick out wrapping paper. That still seems so odd to me.
I felt the same way last week, as place after innocuous place that has been a part of my life in Boston took on a darker significance. I street viewed the location of the bombings on Google and saw a strip of sidewalk I walked down once with my father, he giving me unintentionally humorous girl advice. Maybe he knows more than I give him credit for; I took a girl out to dinner two weeks ago.  She works with a woman who lost both of her legs at the finish line and whose daughter suffered severe shrapnel injuries.
The bombing suspects lived near Inman Square, past which I bike to get costume supplies from the Garment District each Halloween. Dzhokhar attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where a few weeks ago I watched CityStep, a Harvard student-run dance program for Boston youth. I spent last Thursday night (and Friday morning) glued to the police scanner as dozens of police, SWAT, and FBI cars zoomed past my house on Massachusetts Avenue with sirens blaring as they pursued the Tsarnaev brothers.
The brothers killed a cop at MIT, where we have all vainly searched for a good party as freshmen. They shot at other cops from their getaway car, blocks away from the Quad, where I play football on nice days. They engaged in a massive gunfight with police in Watertown, near the Arsenal Mall, where I shop at the beginning of each school year.
I’ve never been to the marathon and was not there this year due to Harvard being among the only universities in town to have classes on Patriots’ Day (unsure whether to still be upset at Harvard for this or not). But I had friends, some with their families, who attended or ran the race. All were fine.
It was all so…weird. The self-ordained Facebook preachers raking in likes with stilted expressions of grief and canned reminders of how this tragedy had shown us “both the worst and the best of humanity.” Harvard’s emergency alert system maintaining that there was “No impact on Harvard” even hours after mid-chase gunshots rang out a few blocks from the Quad on Garden Street. The raucous post-capture celebration at Boston Common, even as a cop and three bombing victims lay dead and hundreds of others remained injured, some horribly. The consistency with which people who knew Dzhokhar described him as a nice, normal American teenager. His Twitter feed that could have been one of my friends’. That he was radicalized in one of the most tolerant cities in the country.
Also strange was the unwelcome excitement I felt during most of it. There’s a guilty high that comes with living through a noteworthy emergency. A feeling of having been there when history happened.
But I would have felt no excitement if I had been close to someone injured or killed. It is remarkable how easily we harden our hearts to traumas that befall strangers. I suppose we have to. No one heart is big enough to contain all of the sadness in the world. After last week, though, too many in Boston are filled to the brim.
Despite last week’s invasion of the bizarre, we will move on. Life will return more or less to normal, as it fortunately seems to always do in America.  But from now on I’ll have more than Halloween on my mind when I ride by Inman Square on my way to the Garment District.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The White House yesterday reported that the Syrian government used sarin gas, a chemical weapon, in its ongoing civil war that has already cost 70,000 deaths. President Obama had previously warned that the use of chemical weapons was a “red line” for President Bashar Al-Assad’s morally bankrupt regime. To stop the bloodshed, America and its NATO partners must intervene in Syria and not shy away from their duty.
The Obama administration is rightly proceeding with caution, waiting for inarguable corroboration of intelligence reports received from Britain, France and Israel. Soil, urine, and hair samples from Syrian villages have conclusively tested positive for chemical weapons. America once spent a decade and trillions of dollars in Iraq over nonexistent weapons. Surely more should be done for confirmed chemical weapons.
It is clear that intervention will be difficult and complicated. After the complicated interventions of the last two decades, including Russian intervention in the North Caucuses, the Balkans War, and the Afghanistan and the Iraq Wars, it is clear that intervention is not just a matter of invading a country and attempting to deal with the aftermath. Regardless of what path the international community decides to embark on, it must be one that garners international support and cooperation.
But the situation is Syria is dire, and there is no sign that the danger posed to civilians will ameliorate in the near future. The civil war is at a stalemate, with rebel forces controlling several major cities and the government putting on a strong resistance. There is a severe refugee problem, with 100,000 Syrian refugees in overcrowded refugee camps located along the Syrian-Turkish border. Nearly 70,000 people have already passed away during the three-year-long conflict. It is clear that without intervention, many Syrian civilians will continue to perish while the stalemate between the government and the rebels shows no signs of subsiding.
Previous UN action on the Syrian humanitarian crisis has been stymied by Russia and China, but these troubling developments should prompt America to crystalize international opposition to President Assad’s widely perceived illegitimate regime. Intervention in the face of the impending humanitarian crisis can be done through various mechanisms, whether it be via NATO just as it was in the Balkans and in Libya in a successful, lightweight military operation that ousted longtime dictators, or through a coalition of willing Arab nations such as Qatar and Turkey, who wish to end the regional disturbance caused by the civil war.
Regardless of what method of intervention the world decides to choose, one thing is obvious. Al-Assad has crossed a line by using chemical weapons on innocents and dissidents. President Obama must keep his word—it is time for action in Syria.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 10:25 p.m. on Thursday, April 18, gunshots were reported on the MIT campus near Kendall Square, approximately 1.5 miles from Harvard Yard, tragically taking the life of 26-year-old MIT Patrol Officer Sean Collier. A postdoctoral student called in the incident. At 10:31 p.m., another officer found the fallen Collier. By 10:55 p.m., MIT had officially alerted its students. At 11:33 p.m., over an hour after the officer had been confirmed shot, Harvard’s text message-based alert system reported the incident: “At 10:48 PM today,” it read, missing the correct time by over twenty minutes, “gunshots were reported at MIT. The area is cordoned off. Please stay clear of area until further notice.” A second alert followed with the same timestamp, explaining that the shooters were still at large.
This kind of lackadaisical response time poses an unacceptable security threat on an urban college campus, especially in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings earlier in the week. Harvard should investigate its failure to keep students apprised of the shooting at MIT, and revamp its alert system. The University’s first responsibility should be to keep students safe; its second should be to guarantee the accuracy of its emergency messages.
“I would say that because of the speed of communication on student email lists, very many students were aware of shooting within five or ten minutes,” said Danny Ben-David, an MIT sophomore, who heard the shots from his dorm room. My own informal surveys of Harvard undergraduates have found that the same was true on this campus, where most heard of the shooting first from friends rather than the Harvard alert. I myself first heard at 11:20 p.m., from a friend who had heard from a friend at MIT. By the time my phone buzzed with Harvard’s message, I had already confirmed that all five of my friends at MIT were safe, and I was on the phone with my mother.
Are Harvard and MIT’s emergency alert systems in active communication? It would appear not enough so. Does a shooting at MIT, separate from the use of explosives that followed this particular incident, pose a sufficient danger to the Harvard community to merit an emergency alert? Evidently yes, or else Harvard would not have sent a text alert warning affiliates to “please stay clear of area” in the first place.
To consider how truly outrageous this tardy response was, consider this counterfactual. Suppose that one evening, while all students are still awake, shots are reported fired somewhere on Harvard’s campus, just moments from MIT. Unfortunately, this is far from an implausible scenario. Within seconds, a Harvard affiliate calls in a report. Now suppose a Harvard University Police Department officer is hit, and that HUPD confirms the shooting within six minutes. Then suppose that the victim is a student.
How many minutes’ delay is it reasonable to expect before you receive an emergency alert? How long should it take from the first confirmation of gunfire to the pressing of the button to inform the community? Furthermore, what is the point of an emergency alert if you have heard about the situation from hearsay before you receive it?
As the clock ticked toward midnight and the shooter remained at large, Reddit, Twitter, and the local news were abuzz with rumors and tall tales. Within minutes, a rumor spread over social media of bombs and grenades on campus in the Quad and on Garden Street. Harvard students responded admirably, sharing a Google Doc where Quad House residents offered up couches and futons to stranded classmates. In my dorm room in Canaday, and I am sure in many others as well, we gathered around a group of computers and tried to establish what was going on. Someone was listening to a police scanner; someone else was refreshing Reddit over and over; someone else was on the phone, reassuring his parents. A cacophony of sirens on Mass. Ave. deafened Wigg residents, who heard rumors that the shooters were throwing live grenades from a moving car.
Harvard’s response? Silence from an alert at 11:45 p.m. until 12:43 p.m., when my phone buzzed again with “12:35 PM. MIT shooter remains active; avoid area” and a link to Harvard’s emergency website, but no comment or confirmation regarding circulating rumors of threats to Harvard’s campus.
I don’t want to point fingers at individuals, least of all at HUPD officers, who offered up nothing less than admirable and courageous service. But as a means of communication unto itself, Harvard’s emergency alert system failed miserably. If the tragic events of last weekend had gone differently, there might well have been truth to the circulating rumors. Harvard should have informed us about the shooting at the exact same time that MIT informed its own community. Instead, it offered too little, too late.
I learned this past Thursday evening not only that my Harvard peers are resilient and can band together in truly inspiring ways in times of crisis. But also—and perhaps I speak only for myself, but I doubt it—that in a time of emergency, I would prefer not to have to trust their unsubstantiated reports when I call my mother to tell her I am safe.
Harvard’s first job is to keep us safe, and its second it to keep us informed. Let us hope that an event like this does not come again. But if it does, let us be prepared.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This piece is part of a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from The Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues.
Why Our Country is Great
When I first learned that the suspects of the Boston Marathon bombings were young, white men, I was secretly happy. With images of bearded, dark-skinned Arab men often associated with terrorism, the captured paler faces were a breath of fresh air amid a very tense week.
However, when news surfaced that federal officials did not read the 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a naturalized American citizen, his Miranda rights before interrogation, I was disconcerted.
What is the difference between Tsarnaev and Adam Lanza, the 20-year old American citizen responsible for the Newtown shooting a few months ago? What is the difference between Tsarnaev and Seung-Hui Cho, the permanent U.S. resident responsible for the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007?
Beyond their respective weapons of choice, reported religious views, and mental health statuses, with the first being the only truly known fact in the case of Tsarnaev—not much.
Neither Lanza's or Cho's shooting sprees were ever labeled "terrorist attacks," yet the bombings that Tsarnaev and his brother are suspected of have been labeled by officials in all levels of the U.S. government, including even the president.
Yes, Tsarnaev and his brother are guilty of the bombings, and yes, they probably intended to inject terror into the national pulse. However, when the deeply American ideal of "innocent until proven guilty" is quickly swapped out for precarious reasons such as the possibility of an affiliation with fundamental religious views, I wonder whether we really are living out the spirit of what we were patriotically chanting at the first Bruins game after last Monday's tragic events: "U.S.A."
By refusing to read Tsarnaev's Miranda rights, the federal government not only risks the possibility that Tsarnaev's pre-Miranda confession may not be permissible in court, but it also further perpetuates the inconsistent use of the term "terrorist" by both the government and the media.
In the midst of sporadic MessageMe notifications and discontent with the Harvard administration, we should also critically examine the actions of our federal government throughout the affairs of last week. Just as the critique of Harvard's conduct was not wholly negative, we can still praise the efforts of the first responders and service men and women while criticizing other decisions by the government. And just as we Harvard students rose to fill in the gaps of our school's response, we too can also fill in the gaps of our nation's discourse about last week's events by engaging and challenging each other in conversation and actively fighting against negative stereotypes and for American rights.
This is more than a politically correct correction of terms. This is a defense of what makes this land so great. America became #BostonStrong to stand in solidarity for its country and countrymen. Let us also stand as one for its values.

Terror Through My Lens 
“Explosions at the Marathon. Boylston. You okay?”
With that short text message, my Monday afternoon took a dramatic turn. From over 3,000 miles across the continent, my father was the first to fill me in on the horrific events that were disrupting the 117th Boston Marathon. I replied quickly, letting him know that I was safe, and then immediately drove a Zipcar toward Copley Square.
I have been taking photographs for a long time and have been a photographer for The Harvard Crimson for nearly two years. The familiar grid of my viewfinder lends order to my surroundings. Photography helps me relax. But on Monday, April 15, what I saw through my camera didn’t feel the same.
As I got out of my car, I saw shock on the faces around me. I scanned the crowd, and my lens focused on a pile of bloodstained clothes, the gaunt face of an older runner, the empty gaze of a young child. I soon reached the police line, and my camera caught the glance of a state policeman, a carbine rifle held close to his breast. As I held down the shutter, under the stiff brim of his hat, I caught a glimpse of fear in his eyes.
I continued to take photographs as the events of the week unfolded. When Governor Patrick announced the capture of those responsible, I was at the press conference. Later, when drunken college students descended upon Boston Common to celebrate the capture, I was in the middle of the crowd. But even then, as Celtics flags rippled in the wind and chants of “U.S.A.!” rose and fell, the view through my camera was not quite as ordered as before.
I am lucky to not count any friends among the injured or deceased, but I did not come out of last week unchanged. For me, the memory of an extraordinarily emotional week returns each time I bring my camera to my face. Though his image is fading, I still see the fearful eyes of the state police officer in Copley Square, and I understand the meaning of terrorism.

A Necessary Response
I was a witness to the hunt for the Tsarnaev brothers as both a potential victim and a horrified onlooker. I had originally planned to leave Boston to go to a conference in Chicago with Harvard's Intercollegiate Model United Nations team before the attacks, but weather delays resulted in my departure being rescheduled to 3 a.m. the night of the attacks. As I walked through a silent campus to the taxis in Harvard Square, I was incredibly grateful for the police presence I saw. The knowledge that someone nearby has both the motivation and means to kill you is a horrifying thought, and the presence of law enforcement was reassuring as I traveled to the airport.
Once I arrived in Chicago, I was greeted by an incredible display of concern and sympathy for the people of Boston. But I was also greeted by online op-eds and articles, notably by Harvard’s Stephen Walt. He argued that the response was too heavy-handed. Walt noted that the cost could be “about $1 billion” (although he later reported estimates of about $300 million) and lamented that a “19 year-old amateur could paralyze an entire American metropolis.”
I agree with his characterization of American counter-terror operations. When we set out to punish terrorism, we go the whole way, regardless of location— Boston, Afghanistan, Yemen, or Somalia. I would not want it any other way. It is precisely because we are such a great nation that terror impacts us so much. The security and peace American citizens enjoy is so great that an extremely zealous response is the only acceptable option to infringement upon them. Were we to punish terror less, it would imply that the freedom, peace, and lives destroyed in an attack on America are less valuable. The response that I saw the night of the manhunt was made precisely because Americans value security and peace so highly. To attack them is a terrible crime, and to protect them is an affirmation of their value.

The Bubble
We live in a bubble – one much larger than this campus, and even all of Boston. It is a pretense of safety that extends across the country, and one we manage to convince ourselves of each day. Each time we hear of conflict abroad that conveniently disappears or read reports of casualties 10,000 miles away, the bubble seems to spread its reach a bit further. We continuously and subconsciously make the assumption that we are safe and getting safer every day.
Now, however, that safety is shattered, our trust is torn apart. I’ve just begun to realize how much my wellbeing depends on the goodwill of those around me. Entering a crowded lecture hall or stepping into Harvard Yard is, in a way, becoming a target. It only takes one to kill, causing such chaos and tumult as we’re only just recovering from. And to make that bet—to chance the odds that everyone around you means no harm—is truly terrifying.
We make that bet all the time, though, and for the most part we come out okay. Last week was a terrible one for humanity, and one that we should never forget. But as we now reflect, this week can be a heartening one. This city has banded together beyond all expectation, and the nation has been ceaseless in its support. We give each other daffodils and share each other’s prayers. We cry and laugh and love, together. We help each other heal.
So thank you, policemen and protectors—you’ve done an incredible job, and we in Boston can’t praise you enough. But we all should thank each other, too. Boston is strong, but so is the rest of this beautiful country, and everyone in it. We protect each other—that’s what truly makes us safe.

Bring Out the Best in Boston
Shivering uncontrollably, the woman standing next to me trembled before collapsing onto the asphalt of Commonwealth Avenue.  All around me, runners violently shuddered and fell deliriously onto one another.  Screams of "medic" punctuated the endless stream of sirens on their way to Copley Square that were passing the crowd of thousands of dehydrated and exhausted marathoners that were trapped behind police barriers in the underpass underneath Massachusetts Avenue.  And then there were those crying.  Tears of terror for their families at the finish line just 8 blocks away, and tears of defeat as the word spread through the crowd that we would not be able to finish our first marathon.
Shock set in.  People began to jump barriers, some to seek out family members, others convinced that the thousand-strong crowd was the next target of a bomb.  Cell phones passed between runners along with nervous whispers of what was happening.  We were handed garbage bags to wear to attempt to keep warm.  Finally people began to walk through offering water out of pitchers into Dixie cups they had hastily grabbed from their bathrooms.  After an hour, we saw the crowd begin to move, with calls for those unable to walk to come to the side for bus assistance.  The crowd thinned by more than half as we walked over a mile to the buses with our bags, and to the area where we stood meekly by name, looking for our relatives.
Monday brought out the absolute best in every single person in Boston in many ways.  Standing in the crowd behind the police barriers, people from the nearby houses came down to offer us warmth, clothing, food and water.  Some even offered to take people inside who needed to make phone calls, while others with Verizon service moved through the crowd offering their phones to those who needed them.  Several runners themselves pulled off their outer layers to wrap the woman who had collapsed and huddled around her to keep her warm.  And on Berkeley Street, volunteers stayed behind to take care of the thousands of runners who began to pass through, dazed from the day's events, emotions running raw through their damaged muscles.  I will never forget the tears and terror that have since become a part of my everyday life, but I will also never forget the strength and resolve that the city of Boston has shown to overcome.  In the words of David Ortiz, "This is our f-----g city, and nobody is going to dictate our freedom."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By rejecting Amherst College’s participation in edX, professors at the liberal arts school expressed doubt in the benefits of Massive Open Online Courses for its faculty, students, and reputation. For the more than 60 percent of Amherst professors who voted against partnering with edX, reaching hundreds of thousands of students around the world does not align with the college’s mission to be “a purposefully small residential community.”
“Ultimately, we’re trying to help our residential students, and [it] wasn’t clear exactly what the MOOCs would allow us to do which we couldn’t do in other ways,” said Stephen A. George, a professor of life sciences at Amherst who introduced the motion against participating in edX. “It was really the massive, synchronous MOOC that did not seem to fit with our goals and values.”
Amherst Chair of Classics Rebecca H. Sinos, who is currently taking Harvard professor Gregory Nagy’s CB22x: “The Ancient Greek Hero” on the edX platform, said she does not believe that teaching online courses would provide her with the opportunity to reconfigure the curriculum for the benefit of her students.
Faculty members said that participating in edX would not only be ineffective in improving the classroom experience, but it would also disrupt the institution of higher education.
“Any MOOC course that I have seen so far is a poor substitute for a real academic course,” said Thomas L. Dumm, an Amherst political science professor. “But if we go the route of having these standardized courses by academic superstars, such as your own Michael Sandel, what’s going to happen to the rest of the professoriate?”
David W. Wills, an American studies professor at Amherst, said that the excitement about online education and MOOCs and the zeal with which they are being promoted makes it harder for schools and professors to refuse jumping on board.
“I think my colleagues...were trying to resist the hype and stay true to their deepest commitments as educators. Our hope is that we can make our way in the world of online education without abandoning those commitments,” Wills said. “If that proves impossible for us, that’s not just bad news for Amherst. It’s bad news for higher education.”
A 21-page unofficial memo written by an ad hoc group of concerned faculty in December 2012 lays out 10 questions about edX participation, questioning whether edX would enhance Amherst teaching.
“If our relation to EdX is an experiment, what is our hypothesis, and why are we testing this rather than another hypothesis?” the memo asked.
“Will Amherst’s voice be influential when confronted with the massive weight and reputations of Harvard, MIT, Yale, Berkeley, and the University of Texas, not to mention the influence of funders like The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which works closely with EdX?)”
In lieu of joining edX, Amherst faculty members voted to move more courses and class materials online and to find additional ways to incorporate technology in the classroom.
George said that there are other ways to increase the virtual visibility of the college, and that Amherst pursuing online education on its own would allow more freedom to its professors.
The decision was far from unanimous, with approximately 70 out of 110 faculty members voting against creating AmherstX. Political science professor Austin D. Sarat, who presented the pro-edX motion, declined to comment for this story.
Amherst administrators and professors praised edX’s goals to increase access to education, and emphasized that the decision to reject AmherstX was not indicative of a general disapproval of the interface.
“We are disappointed that Amherst College will not be joining edX,” edX said in a statement. “Amherst is a wonderful institution and we would have been delighted to have them join. We acknowledge that online educational platforms are not the appropriate solution for all courses or all faculty.”
As edX approaches its one-year anniversary, it has expanded to include 12 institutional partners in its X Consortium. Only one of those institutions, Wellesley College, is comparable in size and mission to Amherst’s small, private liberal arts focus that prides itself on faculty-student engagement.
“My best guess is that because Wellesley is geographically closer to Harvard and MIT, they’ve got the advantage of a larger number of faculty collaborating with people who are participating in edX and are perhaps more certain about what they’re getting into,” said Amherst computer science professor Scott F. H. Kaplan.
“I think edX is being very selective, maybe too selective. One of the points that was made in the discussion was that edX seems quite proud to turn down a lot of institutions that might like to join,” said George. “They seem to be looking more towards the prestige of the name of the institution than really looking at which would be the best courses in many different institutions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a conversation that steered clear of much of the controversy surrounding his arrival at the Harvard Kennedy School, former President of Mexico Felipe Calderon reflected on his term in office.
Calderón, who after leaving office in December began his year-long tenure as a fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, came to Cambridge amid fierce criticism of his efforts to combat drug cartels in Mexico.
Thursday’s discussion at the JFK Jr. Forum, however, shied away from much of the contention and instead focused on Calderón’s successes in reacting to both the 2008 financial crisis and the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
Ellwood began the Forum by asking attendees to refrain from disrupting the proceeding of the conversation. Prior to the event, increased security surrounded the Kennedy School, and guests were not permitted to enter with water bottles or backpacks.
“The level of security provided for tonight’s event is consistent with that provided for Forum events featuring a head of state,” wrote Esten Perez, the Institute of Politics’ director of communications, in an email.
The event passed without interruption, and when the floor was opened for audience questions, no speaker inquired about the so-called “war on drugs” that Calderón launched during his presidency.
The only mention of this term was in a question Ellwood asked Calderón. Although Calderón did send troops to fight drug violence in Mexico, he criticized the terminology others have applied to his efforts.
“‘War on Drugs’ is an expression coined by President Nixon in the ’70s here in the States. And I didn’t declare a war on drugs,” Calderón said.
Throughout his term, Calderón took a variety of other measures to quell drug crime, including decriminalizing personal possession of drugs.
His administration also adopted a three-pronged anti-drug strategy, he said.
The first tactic was to “[face] criminals with the full force of the state,” Calderón said. Then, the administration utilized the Mexican Armed Forces to combat drug-related crime, alongside the federal police force. Last, Calderón said that he sought to revitalize Mexico’s “social fabric” by providing new opportunities for the Mexican youth, including the elimination of tuition at some public universities and high schools.
These reforms were combined with steps toward universal health care and a demonstrated commitment to reducing Mexico’s budget deficit.

In honor of her efforts to expand educational opportunities, the Harvard Graduate School of Education announced yesterday that journalist and television anchor Soledad O’Brien ’88-’00 will be a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the school for the 2013-2014 academic year.
“It is an honor to join the esteemed scholars of the Harvard Graduate School of Education community next year,” O’Brien said in a press release.
Administrators at the Ed School said that O’Brien will bring valuable experience and perspective.
“We are very excited to have her join our community,” said Michael Rodman, the assistant dean for communications and marketing at the School of Education. According to Rodman, O’Brien was chosen because “she’s been out there in the field, working on educational equality.”
Along with her husband, Brad Raymond, O’Brien oversees the Soledad O’Brien and Brad Raymond Foundation, which encourages young women to work toward a college education through mentoring, financial support, and advising. O’Brien also serves as the chair of the board of directors of The After-School Corporation, a non-profit which seeks to expand educational opportunities for urban students.
“We are tremendously excited to welcome Soledad to the Harvard Graduate School of Education community and look forward to working with her to ensure that all children have access to a high quality education,” Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney said in a press release Wednesday.
An accomplished broadcast journalist, O’Brien worked at CNN from 2003 until 2012, during which time she co-anchored the show “American Morning” and covered breaking news stories. After leaving CNN in 2012, O’Brien continued working in the media industry with her production company, StarFish Media.
While the specific ways Soledad will be involved at the Ed School are still unclear, Rodman commented that there will definitely be “interactions with students and faculty.”
According to Rodman, O’Brien is excited to interact with undergraduate as well as graduate students at the School of Education.
“She’s very excited about being part of the Harvard community as a whole,” Rodman said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: May 6, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that broadcast journalist Soledad M. O’Brien's graduating class year is 2000. To clarify, O'Brien took time off during her senior year in 1988 and then completed her bachelor's degree in 2000.

A group of Undergraduate Council members drafted a memorandum on Harvard’s undergraduate email privacy policy that clarifies the policy, identifies potential ambiguity, and makes recommendations for changes.
In the memo, the authors directly quote the Student Handbook which states that “systems administrators...may gain access to users’ data...when it is necessary to maintain or prevent damage to systems or to ensure compliance with other University rules.”
However, UC representatives wrote in the memo that, in general, students are unaware of this policy and that many of those who are aware of the policy find it confusing.
In particular, the memo points to the phrase “compliance with other University rules” as a vague clause open to many different interpretations.
The memo, which was presented to the Committee on Student Life last week, recommends strengthening the current privacy policy in four areas.
First, the representatives called for the policy to be more specific as to which “rules” can trigger email searches, along with who can recommend a search and the procedures by which students are notified.
The authors also called for the policy to be included in the First Year Guide and presented on a frequented web page like my.harvard.edu. Third, citing the recent decision by Brown University to release information on email searches, the memo calls for the College to divulge the number of times student emails have been searched and for what purpose.
The memo ended with a request that students be allowed to “formally review the policy” and assist in drafting any new policies.
Florence Y. Chen ’15, the primary author of the memo, said these changes would make people “more comfortable and...more understanding of the administration’s policies.”
The memo was commissioned by the UC in late March following the discovery that Harvard administrators had accessed the email accounts of resident deans.
The memo took on an added significance a few days after it was commissioned when administrators admitted to a second email search that was more invasive than previously revealed  and that broke the Faculty of Arts and Sciences email privacy policy. Both incidents were mentioned in the memo.
According to an email from UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, the public release of the memo—which was expected  a couple of weeks ago—was delayed due to last week’s bombings at the Boston Marathon and the subsequent manhunt for the suspects.
The UC intends to officially release the memo to the general student body in the coming days and to present it to the newly created faculty task force charged with drafting a new University-wide email privacy policy.
“We don’t need every single policy recommendation to be check-listed,” Chen said. “We just want students to have more clarification; we just want students to be able to have a voice.”

When asked by an audience member during a talk Thursday at the John F. Kennedy School of Government which country in the world has “the best internet,” Google’s Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt gave a facetious answer: Iran.
Schmidt voiced concern about the Iranian government’s announcement this month that it plans to create a rival version of his company’s Google Earth tool, alluding to speculation that the forthcoming map, which the government of Iran calls the “Islamic Google Earth,” may not list Israel as a country.
Islamic Google Earth, he said, could ultimately become an example of what he termed a grave threat facing the digital sphere—the intervention of governments online.
“We’re in great danger of governments deciding to filter, delete, or otherwise alter the shared resources of the internet,” Schmidt said.
At several points during the talk, which was held to promote his book “The New Digital Age,” Schmidt spoke to the way Google has navigated the changing relationship between technology and government.
When asked by an attendee why Google decided to leave China, Schmidt said that the decision was due to oppressive censorship by the Chinese government.
“Engagement is better than estrangement,” Schmidt said. But, he continued, “there’s a point in which engagement violates too many of your own principles.”
Schmidt also called on governments to put more information online to keep their citizens informed. Schmidt, who sits on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, recalled an instance in which the Council was delivered a report that was never put on the internet.
“If that’s what government is about, then no one’s going to get anything done,” he said.
With much official data offline, he said, citizens must turn to another source in search of information. Schmidt said that in this environment, Google functions as a tool to help people sift through facts of varying reliability.
“We see ourselves as ranking facts,” Schmidt said.
By way of a solution, Schmidt emphasized the importance of openness between the government and its citizens.
“Transparency is usually the right answer,” he said. “People have to know what’s really going on.”
Attendees at the talk said that they were impressed and suprised by Schmidt’s message.
“I didn’t expect [the talk] to have so much insight into foreign policy as it relates to Google,” said Erin L. Patten, a student enrolled at the Kennedy School and the Business School.

The Committee on Academic Integrity is soliciting feedback from undergraduates, faculty, and teaching fellows on a proposal to establish Harvard’s first-ever honor code.
In an email sent to the student body on Friday morning, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote that students are invited to “post [their] thoughts on the committee’s recommendations” on an online discussion board.
The product of two and a half years of discussions, the proposed five-point “modified” honor code would establish a Student/Faculty Judicial Board populated by students and faculty to hear exclusively cases of academic dishonesty. Among other points, it also calls for students to write a “declaration of integrity” on major assignments and exams. Harris presented the Committee’s preliminary report at a faculty meeting earlier this month.
The College has looked to students for their opinions and ideas on academic integrity issues before. In 2011, the Office of Undergraduate Education opened up an assessment on academic integrity to students, but it received too few responses to provide enough data to be useful for administrators. Only about 27 percent of students participated in that survey.
The survey comes in the midst of discussions within Houses about the potential honor code and academic integrity more broadly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 28, 2013, at 8:54 p.m.
Three Harvard University Police Department officers were among those honored for their heroic efforts by the Boston Celtics Friday night at the TD Garden as part of the Celtics’ “Heroes Among Us” community outreach program.
HUPD officers Michael Rea, Ryan Stanton, and Christopher Riccardi were recognized for administering crucial first aid to Richard H. Donohue Jr., a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police officer, during last week’s manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.
“You are true heroes,” Edward Palladino, the Celtics public address announcer, told the officers as the crowd of over 18,000 stood and cheered.
Donohue was wounded early in the morning on April 19 in a firefight between law enforcement authorities and the two men believed to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings, Cambridge residents and brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev. Tamerlan died after the shootout, and Dzhokhar has been charged in the bombings.
Donohue was rushed to Mount Auburn Hospital on Friday and is still recovering. His injuries were so serious that law enforcement officials said that he might not have lived had Rea, Stanton, Riccardi, and others not provided immediate first aid.
“It’s a great honor,” Riccardi said of being recognized by the Celtics. “We usually don’t get anything like this.”
Still, Riccardi said that he was ready for things to settle down after what has been a chaotic week and a half in the area.
“I think everybody is ready to get back to business as usual,” he said.
It was an emotional evening at the Garden, where the Celtics were taking on the New York Knicks in the third game of a best-of-seven playoff series. Throughout the first half, television timeouts were filled with standing ovations and loud cheers as law enforcement officers from numerous local departments were celebrated. Honored along with Rea, Riccardi, and Stanton were Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, the Watertown Police Department, representatives of numerous local hospitals, and other regional police officers. These included James “Matt” Brown and Carlos Aquino, two officers from the Cambridge Police Department.
“The crowd was beautiful,” Celtics center Kevin Garnett told the Crimson after the evening’s loss. “I know the result isn’t what we wanted, but in the stands I think people...were having fun, so it was good. A good two-and-a-half hour diversion, if you will.”
Celtics forward Paul Pierce said that his team desperately wanted to give Boston a win after what has been a chaotic and tragic ten days for the area.
“You know when you want it so bad you rush and you get real anxious, and I thought that’s what we did for most of tonight,” he told the Crimson. The loss dropped the Celtics to a 3-0 hole in the series. After winning at home on Sunday, the Celtics are now down 3-1.
Noting the special atmosphere of the evening, Knicks center Tyson Chandler expressed some solidarity with Boston after the game.
“If anybody understands what Boston’s going through right now it’s the city of New York,” Chandler told the Crimson, alluding to New York’s experience after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  “We understand that the team is going to get behind the emotion of the city and they did, they played hard tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s basketball team has not yet announced its schedule for the 2013-14 season, Boston College has announced that it will be visiting Lavietes Pavilion next year during the nonconference season.
Boston College announced that it will also play at USC, Auburn, and Providence, as well as tentative arrangements to play Virginia Commonwealth at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
Harvard has beaten Boston College in five straight seasons and won in December 2012 by 16 points. Freshman Siyani Chambers had 21 points, and sophomore Wesley Saunders had 18 points in a 79-63 win. Leading by only two points after a sluggish 31-29 first half, the Crimson outscored the Eagles by 14 points in the second half.
The last big conference team to visit Lavietes was the Michigan Wolverines on December 1, 2007. On that day, Harvard defeated Tommy Amaker’s previous team, 62-51, to score its best win in a season in which it would finish with only eight.
The last time that Boston College came to Lavietes Pavilion, it was to take on the women’s basketball team in 2009. It was the first game of the 2009-10 season, and the Crimson escaped with a narrow one-point win, 82-81, in a season in which they won all but one of the thirteen contests held at Lavietes. Emma Markley and Victoria Lippert had a combined 37 points for the Crimson, as Harvard held the Eagles to only 28.6 percent shooting from behind the arc in the contest.

As the saying goes, revenge is a dish best served cold, and it was a dish the Harvard men’s volleyball team whipped up Thursday night, fighting back from a late deficit to take down George Mason, 3-2, in the EIVA semifinals.
The Crimson (18-8, 11-4 EIVA) had its back against the wall after dropping the second set in overtime, 28-26, and the third set in unconvincing fashion, 25-17. But unlike 2012, when the Patriots topped Harvard in the same semifinals matchup, Harvard rallied in the fourth set before outlasting George Mason (15-12, 11-3) in overtime of the fifth set, 19-17. The win marks the program’s first playoff victory, as the squad heads to its first-ever EIVA championship game against No. 14 Penn State on Saturday.
“We went on streaks, and they went on streaks,” junior co-captain and outside hitter Nick Madden said. “But as it came down to the wire, they started making errors and we stepped up, and we hit big swings and big serves. I think it came down to us playing clutch towards the end of that game.”
The Crimson clinched the match on a service ace from sophomore middle hitter Caleb Zimmick, who was one of Harvard’s best performers on both sides of the ball. Zimmick posted a .579 kill percentage with 13 kills, including two crucial hits in overtime of the fifth set, while leading the team with seven blocks.
“[Zimmick] swung real well out of the middle and they literally could not stop him,” Madden said. “He blocked phenomenally and made them make a lot of errors they wouldn’t have made if there was not a 6’9” blocker in front of them.”
The Crimson dropped both regular season meetings with the Patriots, including a loss at the Malkin Athletic Center three weeks ago, as Harvard struggled to adapt to George Mason’s strong service and blocking.
“George Mason is a big team with a lot of powerful players,” junior libero Chris Gibbons said. “We knew a lot of their tendencies in terms of what kind of set they were setting and how to defend against that.”
But the Crimson jumped out of the blocks quickly, winning the first set, 25-23, behind a balanced attack, with Zimmick and outside hitters Madden and DJ White all registering three kills. Madden registered a team-high 16 kills in the match, with White just behind him at 15.
The Patriots responded in the second set, using a six-point run to take a 20-16 lead. But Harvard coach Brian Baise called a timeout, and the Crimson began a run of their own, pushing the set to a 25-25 tie to force overtime. But two kills from Patriot outside hitter Mark Jones leveled the match.
George Mason had the better response after the trying second set, hitting another run midway through the third set and establishing a lead the Crimson did not recover from, going down, 2-1, after dropping the third set.
In a must-win situation, the Crimson took an early lead in the fourth set, firing out to a 12-6 lead. And though the Patriots rallied late, Madden’s five kills guided his squad to a fourth set victory, 25-22, to send the match to a decisive fifth set.
But with the season on the line, it seemed George Mason was going to streak towards the championship, as the Patriots came out swinging to gain an 11-6 lead, needing only four points to win the match.
But kills from White and co-captain Rob Lothman closed the gap, and the teams battled to a 15-15 tie to force overtime. With the pressure on, Zimmick turned up the heat, notching two kills and his decisive ace to give Harvard a place in the EIVA championship game.
The Nittany Lions, which topped Princeton in the other semifinal, is a perennial powerhouse in the EIVA. After forcing many five-set games, the Crimson notched its first win against Penn State at the Malkin Athletic Center in February, which gives Harvard confidence going into its first-ever EIVA championship. The task will not be any easier, as the EIVA tournament is hosted in University Park this year.
“We know they are a beatable team, but at the same time we know they are a pretty tough opponent,” Madden said. “They’ll have the crowd on their side… [but] we match up well and we’ll be ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With one out in the first inning, junior third baseman Kasey Lange stepped to the plate and made history.
After senior left fielder Stephanie Regan got on base with a leadoff single, Lange opened her evening with a two-run shot to right field. Lange’s 28th home run in a Crimson uniform—and 11th of the season—tied her with Tiffany Whitton ’03 for the all-time school record.
With regular season games left to play and another full season with the Harvard softball team, Lange is poised to become the program’s leading long ball hitter.
“It was exciting, but honestly I would have rather come out with a win today,” said Lange, who didn’t find out that she had tied the record until a teammate texted her later. “It’s cool to be in the record books, but we have a bigger task ahead of us this weekend.”
Despite Lange’s early offensive effort, the Crimson (21-19, 11-5 Ivy) was unable to hold on to its two-run lead and fell to Boston College (13-30, 2-13 ACC), 6-4, in its last non-conference game of the season.
With the division-deciding, four-game series with Dartmouth coming up this weekend and sophomore shortstop Emily Gusse out with an illness, Harvard sported an unusual lineup against the Eagles.
Freshman Haley Davis, who took over for Gusse at shortstop, hit seventh, and sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz moved into the cleanup spot. Freshman Alyssa Siegmann got the start at designated hitter.
“We’re confident that anyone at anytime can step up and get the job done,” Lange said. “A job is  a job, and if someone’s on base ahead of you, you want to hit them in.”
After Lange’s home run put the Crimson up two, Boston College came back with a run of its own in the bottom of the inning. Harvard extended its lead to two again in the top of the third when Lantz scored Regan on a sacrifice fly to right field.
Although Harvard outhit the Eagles, 7-6, Boston College did its damage at the plate and on the base paths with a four-run third inning.
“We didn’t do a good job of isolating their hits,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “They stole some bases, which put runners in scoring position, and then they had a few walks and a timely home run that really hurt us.”
Freshman starting pitcher Morgan Groom struck out the first batter of the third inning before giving up a one-out double to freshman right fielder Megan Cooley. Freshman second baseman Jessie Daulton walked and stole second before junior shortstop Alana DiMaso drove in a run with a sacrifice fly to center field.
Down a run with two outs, the Eagles weren’t done. Senior centerfielder Maria Pandolfo—who went two for three—hit a towering home run to centerfield, putting Boston College on top for good.
“The ball was really breaking, but Morgan needs to do better hitting her spots,” Allard said. “She was facing too many batters because every time she walked someone she brought up another to face.”
Harvard started to mount a comeback in the top of the seventh when sophomore first baseman Adrienne Hume doubled to left center. Freshman centerfielder Zoe Galindo flied out to right, but with two outs, Regan doubled to center. Regan’s third hit of the night brought home sophomore pinch runner Andrea Del Conte, narrowing the Eagles’ lead to two runs.
But the rally would not last, as junior captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson lined out to second base to end the game. Allard said she was not concerned with the result of Thursday’s game going into the final weekend.
“We always play with a little more emotion and motivation at our weekend conference games,” Allard said. “But we played a good game, except for a couple mistakes on the mound. If we hadn’t given up that three-run home run, that’s a 4-3 win.”
Boston College lefty Stephanie Lord pitched the complete game and allowed four runs—all earned—on seven hits and a walk.
“It was good preparation for Dartmouth,” Lange said. “They had a lefty pitcher, which is what we’re pretty sure we’re going to be facing this weekend. There were a couple of things that we could have done better, but we’re feeling prepped for the weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lose and stay home. Win and play another day.
The Ivy League playoff scenario is that simple for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-7, 2-3 Ivy) as it prepares for Saturday’s regular season finale against No. 15 Yale (8-4, 3-2) at Harvard Stadium.  With a loss, the Crimson would finish fifth in the conference, just outside the top four that will vie for the Ivy League title in Ithaca, N.Y., next weekend. With a win, Harvard would leapfrog Penn and Yale to secure the tournament’s third seed.
The situation is a familiar one for the Crimson, which will conclude its regular season against the Bulldogs for the fourth straight year. Last season, Harvard traveled to New Haven, Conn. needing a victory to extend its season, but Yale edged the Crimson, 10-8. In 2011, Harvard beat Yale at Soldier’s Field, 9-5, to clinch the third seed.
“Ultimately, I just want to play the best game that Harvard lacrosse has done yet,” said Crimson captain Jason Gonos, who will suit up for his last game at Soldier’s Field alongside nine other Harvard seniors. “I think that we still have yet to put together our perfect game, and I’m confident that we can do that Saturday.”
To achieve that elusive game Saturday, Harvard will have to avoid the slow start that doomed the Crimson to a 14-6 loss at Princeton last week. If Gonos and his squad beat Yale, they will be guaranteed another crack at the Tigers.
Midfielder Alex White promises to factor heavily in the Crimson attack, as he enters his Senior Day with a team-high 20 goals on the season. White has yet to record a point against Yale in his four-year varsity career, but that may change tomorrow.
Freshman attackman Devin Dwyer has been Harvard’s top playmaker this season and leads all Crimson scorers with 26 assists and 40 points. Junior attackman Peter Schwartz and sophomore Murphy Vandervelde have also stepped up their game on the offensive end, filling the void left by injured All-Ivy attackman Danny Eipp.
On the defensive end, Gonos will be joined by Robert Duvnjak, who entered the season as the country’s top-rated defensive recruit. The freshman has recorded a team-high 16 caused turnovers this year. In the crease, goalkeeper Harry Krieger will start his last game at Harvard as he looks to build on his .544 season save percentage.
“As a defenseman, it’s so comforting to know that you have a goalie behind you who is going to make stops,” Gonos said. “[Krieger] really gives us the confidence to play aggressively against their offense.”
Gonos is trying to stay in the moment as he prepares to play his final home game.
“It’s definitely sad if you think about it, but I’m really not even letting it get in the way, really not drawing on it too much just because I know this team has a lot of lacrosse left to be played,” Gonos said. “I understand it wouldn’t be at home, but this season isn’t over, and I just want to get the win on Saturday and continue it.”
Yale is coming off a controversial 8-7 loss to No. 3/2 Maryland last Saturday. Officials ruled that a last-second shot from Bulldog sophomore Harry Kucharczyk ricocheted low off the Maryland goal post as time expired. After the game, Yale coach Andy Shay told reporters that the ball had bounced in and out off the flat iron of the goal.
Regardless of the outcome, the Bulldogs put up an impressive showing, forcing Maryland junior Niko Amato to make 24 saves—the most by a Terrapin goaltender since 2005.
“[Yale] appeared in control of a lot of the play and were really kind of right in it, neck and neck to the end,” Wojcik said. “They’ve shown that they can go toe-to-toe with top teams, and we’ve been in that spot as well, certainly against Duke and Cornell.”
Junior attackman Brandon Mangan leads the Bulldog offense with 30 goals and 52 points in 12 games this year. Sophomore Conrad Oberbeck and senior Kirby Zdrill have also reached the 20-goal plateau for Yale this year. At midfield, junior faceoff specialist Dylan Levings will challenge Harvard senior Rick Molé.
The Bulldogs have plenty to play for tomorrow as well. With a win, Yale would secure the tournament’s second or third seed and a first-round game with Princeton. With a loss, the Bulldogs would meet No. 6/4 Cornell next Friday.
But Wojcik doubts that either team will need any extra motivation come Saturday afternoon.
“It’s Harvard-Yale, so you can really throw everything out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team hasn’t had a player drafted into the NFL since the St. Louis Rams took Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 eight years ago. But that may change this weekend as senior Kyle Juszczyk steps into the public eye after weeks of speculation, press, and weighty expectations.
After transitioning from a high school quarterback to an All-American and All-Ivy H-back, Juszczyk might see his role shift once again when he enters the professional scene. He could become a hybrid fullback—a fusion of his former role on the Harvard squad and the position that fits his physical profile, fullback.
“[H-back] is a position that very few athletes have the skill set for,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Kyle is being developed as a fullback in the NFL, but it’s really a hybrid fullback, it’s not just a guy who’s going to lead block, which would be the technical definition of what a fullback does. He’s a guy who can do a lot of different things...because of his ability to perform at a high level at all of those positions. I think that’s what generated so much NFL interest.”
Juszczyk was a quarterback at Cloverleaf High School and a two-time All-Suburban League and All-Medina County player, but it was apparent to Murphy that his role would have to change to fit the Crimson’s offense.
“A lot of times, the best athlete in the high school program is going to end up playing quarterback, and in Kyle’s case, it was the case,” Murphy said. “It was also pretty clear that he wasn’t going to fit into our type of offense as a real quarterback, so we saw him as an H-back or a defensive end or a middle linebacker right away.”
Juszczyk’s aspirations to professional football have been long-standing. Despite having had to change positions over his career thus far, he has always hoped to suit up for a full 53-man NFL roster.
“He’s always wanted to play [in the NFL], ever since he was a kid,” senior quarterback Colton Chapple said. “That was his dream goal and for him to be able to provide for his family playing a sport, playing the game that he loves.”
While many kids dream of playing in the big leagues someday, Juszczyk’s dream began to inch toward reality during his junior season, when his performance started to meet those expectations. The Ohio native tallied a team-high 37 receptions that year and was awarded a second-team All-American honor.
Juszczyk’s success only grew the next year when he became Chapple’s primary target, connecting with the quarterback for over 700 yards on 52 catches. While the team was not able to repeat its Ivy League Championship run, Juszczyk’s performance garnered him an invitation to the Senior Bowl, where he saw playing time at fullback and H-back for the North team.
“I think that the people who are most serious about drafting him have a realistic expectation of what his skillset is, and that is a guy that is smart, dependable, extremely versatile, and a competitive football player,” Murphy said. “He can play fullback, he can play tight end if necessary, he can play H-back, and he can be an outstanding special teams player, and when you have such small rosters in the NFL, the versatile guys become the guys that become very, very valuable, especially on the second day of the draft.”
Murphy sees Juszczyk as likely to be drafted in the fifth round, which will be announced on Saturday and will be broadcast on ESPN. The senior, who is currently taking the semester off, has spent much of 2013 being flown out to various NFL franchises.
According to Murphy, the Baltimore Ravens, from which Matt Birk ’98 recently retired and where several coaches have ties with Murphy, have expressed an interest in signing Juszczyk.
“I know he’s been flown out by something like 17 of the NFL teams, [and] we’ve had many teams call us,” Murphy said. “A lot of the people on the Ravens, [coach John] Harbaugh, who coached with me at the University of Cincinnati, as did Craig Ver Steeg, and their special teams coach and one of their secondary coaches were all with us at Cincinnati. They’ve called several times—they have a particularly strong interest.”
Chapple notes that while Juszczyk’s dream would be to be drafted by his hometown Cleveland Browns or his childhood favorite team, the New York Jets, he admits a certain level of pragmatism that the fullback has with regard to the draft. Juszczyk could not be reached for comment.
“If the Browns or Jets called [to draft him], I’m sure it’d be a pretty unbelievable feeling for him, but he doesn’t have a lot of control over it,” Chapple said. “He’ll be excited wherever he goes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four days after notching its biggest victory of the season, the Harvard women’s tennis team continued its winning ways with a 7-0 victory over Brown in Providence, R.I., Thursday. The team lost only two sets combined in singles and doubles play and put the match away early, taking the doubles point and then running through three singles matches before taking the remaining three matches.
“I’m really proud of our team and the way that it competed today,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “I feel that we are peaking right now, which is great.”
The team had its match—previously scheduled for last weekend—delayed due to the MIT shooting which had area residents waiting indoors until law enforcement was able to apprehend the suspects. The postponement forced the team into an unusual weekday match, but Green said that the team was flexible and moved its weekly plans accordingly, completing all assignments early and making the necessary mental adjustments.
“I really commend the way that our players handled the difficult schedule this week,” Green said.
The squad’s chance at the Ivy League title was eliminated Sunday when Columbia defeated Princeton, meaning co-captains Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton lost their last shot at a league title—a goal the team had set throughout the season.
After Thursday’s victory, the team now sits one game behind Yale for second place in the league, though it holds the tiebreak after its 5-2 victory over the No. 35 Bulldogs on Sunday.  With a win Saturday and a Yale loss, Harvard will clinch second in the league.
Despite the impossibility of a title, Tachibana continued fighting. She fought off four match points while coming back from a 9-5 deficit in the final set tiebreak to defeat Brown’s Misia Krasowski, 7-5, 3-6, 11-9.
“[When I get down match point], I focus on not focusing on anything,” Tachibana said. “It is really easy to let the pressure get to you and I like to clear my head and let it be automatic.”
Tachibana said that matches are much different from practice, in which players can swing freely—even in practice points and matches—without as much fear of losing. In Ivy League play, where only seven matches decide the league title, players do not have the same luxury, according to the co-captain.
“A match is completely different from practice because the points count and matter,” Tachibana said. “There is a lot more tension in the match and especially in the Ivy League everyone knows that every point they play really matters and there’s a lot more pressure. Depending on the player, it might be a motivator or a driver to help you win and I think most players on the team are like that and have to step it up when it matters.”
In doubles, the new pairing of freshman Amanda Lin and Tachibana at the top spot suffered an 8-2 setback against Brown after debuting last Sunday. Prior to that match, Green decided to replace Norton with Lin at the top spot with Tachibana. Playing with new partner sophomore Sylvia Li, Norton won with two breaks, 8-4, over the duo’s opponents and freshman Hai-Li Kong and junior Hannah Morrill sealed the doubles point with an 8-1 victory.
In singles, the team’s three freshmen continued their strong play. Lin scored a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Brown’s Olivia Hsu. The win was Lin’s 15th straight for the team and her 10th playing on line six for the Crimson. Freshman Amy He defeated Brown’s Hannah Camhi at the second position, 6-4, 6-3, and Kong maintained strong play after an easy 6-1 first set to take out Sarah Kandath, 7-6 (7-5), in the second set. Norton ceded only two games to her opponent in a pair of 6-1 set victories at line three and Li got late breaks in both sets to defeat Ammu Mandalap, 7-5, 6-4.
Green said that the two co-captains have been the driving force behind the team’s recent three-game winning streak, which includes a victory over its archrival, Yale.
“Our two seniors are the heart and soul of our team,” Green said. “Where they go the team goes. We are peaking right now and our team peaking has a lot to do with the experience that we have…. When we are healthy and confident, we know that nothing can stop us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team, which had won 12 straight matches, was rolling to its second consecutive Ivy League title, dominating every opponent it faced. On Thursday, its momentum ground to a screeching halt after a 4-3 loss to Brown (14-9, 3-3 Ivy) at the Murr Center.
The No. 21 Crimson (17-5, 5-1) could not deliver in its final home match of the season, ending its hopes of its first perfect Ivy League season since 2008 and its desire to send out co-captain Andy Nguyen with a win in his final home contest.
Harvard, which has already clinched at least a share of the Ancient Eight title, can still earn an outright victory with a win at Dartmouth on Saturday, but that does not make this loss any easier to take.
“It’s a bitter pill to swallow,” head coach Dave Fish said. “Especially when you’ve had such a wonderful year, it’s tough. Tonight, we were human and weren’t firing on all six cylinders.”
The Bears came in with just a 2-3 conference record and sat at sixth place in the Ancient Eight but put up a strong fight against Harvard. Although the Crimson had defeated Brown in eight of their past nine meetings, the Bears ensured that mark would not extend to nine out of ten.
The match was supposed to be played last Friday before it was postponed due to the citywide manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers. And just as Harvard’s schedule was thrown off, so was its tennis game on Thursday night.
The first sign that the Crimson might be in for a long day came when Brown came out firing and challenged the team in an area in which it had been dominant: doubles play.
Harvard had won the crucial doubles point in each match during its 12-match winning streak, but the streak came to an end at the hands of the Bears, even though Brown had lost the doubles point in every one of its past four contests.
Although each match was tightly contested, the Crimson could not do enough to pull out a victory in two of the three matches.
At No. 2, Andy Nguyen and freshman Nicky Hu saved a match point at 6-7 before prevailing, 10-8. But the other two matches swung in the Bears’ favor. On the third court, sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kelvin Lam went down, 9-7, leaving the doubles point up to the first team of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster.
The duo, ranked 71st in the country, came into the match boasting an 11-1 record in dual play, but found itself down 6-2 early. The pair came back to tie it at 6-6, but Brown’s Brandon Burke and William Spector outlasted Nguyen and MacMaster for a 13-11 win.
For the first time in 13 matches, Harvard found itself in a 1-0 hole and needing to win four out of the six singles matches in order to preserve its perfect Ivy League record.
“Losing the doubles point was really hard,” Fish said. “We’re not substantially better than people. We’re good enough to win the doubles point and then get three singles matches to pull out the win.”
On Thursday, the Crimson was not good enough to pull out the win. In singles, Steinroeder tied the match at 1-1 after cruising to a 6-1, 6-2 victory in the fourth slot, and Hu put Harvard ahead with a 6-4, 7-5 win at No. 5.
But the Bears quickly tied it back up, 2-2, when Lam fell at No. 6, 3-6, 4-6. Andy Nguyen fought hard on the third court but lost in a three-setter, 5-7, 7-5, 2-6, to lower his record on the season to 15-4 in dual play. The losses meant that the match would be decided on the final two courts.
On the first court, Denis Nguyen easily won the first set, 6-1, but found himself in a dogfight soon after. He served for the match in the second, but lost the tiebreaker, 9-7. He then was broken twice in the third set and lost, clinching the match for Brown. Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, who was leading in the third set, won by default for the final 4-3 margin.
Despite the tough loss, the team believes that the defeat will renew its focus for the matchup against the Big Green and the upcoming NCAA tournament.
“This is kind of a hidden gem for the team,” Hu said. “It’s easy to take matches like this for granted, but now this gives us motivation going forward. Tonight brought us back down to reality, but it will also fuel our fire.”

Shake Shack, the New York City institution whose made-to-order burgers and shakes draw long lines of hungry diners year round, is scouting out possible restaurant space in Harvard Square, according to a spokesperson with the company.
Though the company has not made a public announcement, a public hearing notice appeared in the window of 57 J.F.K. Street this week indicating that the restaurant chain is applying for a special food service permit.  57 J.F.K. Street, immediately adjacent to Winthrop Square, is the current location of Om Restaurant and Lounge.
"At this point we have submitted an application to the city for a special permit, and we will not be in a position to make a formal announcement until the board has reviewed and approved our application," the company's senior manager for marketing and communications Greg Waters wrote in an email to The Crimson.
According to the public notice, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal will consider the permit application at a May 9 meeting.
Shake Shack opened its first location in the Boston area in Chestnut Hill last month. The fast-growing chain opened its first location in Manhattan's Madison Square Park nearly a decade ago. In recent years it has opened several other locations around the United States and in the Middle East.

You can pat yourself on the back each morning as you make the trek from Thayer to Sever Hall. With each step you take, you're doing your part to help make Harvard a little greener.
In The Princeton Review's recently released Guide to 322 Green Colleges, Harvard once again received a score of 99 out of a possible 100, earning it a place among the 21 "greenest" schools (those that received the coveted 99) among the hundreds of colleges for which they tallied green scores.
Where did that very solid score (even when adjusted for grade inflation) come from? Well, partially you. According to the Guide, "Not all changes are coming from the top. Of all students on campus, 97 percent take an alternative means of transportation to class each day."
So this is just a PSA from Flyby to say that when you walk to class, you are taking one for the team that is Harvard's public image, and also just generally helping make the world a better place. Even the polar bears thank you.
No need to park the car in Harvard Yard; but the electric-powered fuel cell car is probably fine.

April 24, 1940: Anti-War Chest Drive Announced by Student Union
Announced by the Harvard Student Union after its executive meeting last night is a new drive to raise funds for a national Anti-War Chest to be used in the cause of peace.
G. Robert Stange '41 of Lowell House is in charge of the Harvard drive which will consist of the sale of "peace bonds" intended to supplant the Liberty Bonds of the last war.
Stange said, "Instead of spending money for continuing a senseless war, the investors in the peace bonds will be contributing to making an allied front of inside information on the futility of a new one."
April 25, 1947: Count 'em—Forty Beautiful Girls Cavort in College Pool
"Alumnus Aquaticus," anonymous donor whose check for $350,000 hastened construction of the Indoor Athletic Building Pool in 1930, probably never anticipated what goes on there now every Monday night. Monday night is "ladies' night" at the natatorium.
From 7:30 to 9:30 o'clock girls connected in practically any way with the University can splash around in the pool's 225,000 gallons of chlorinated water, whip out a bottle of Gaby, close their eyes and make believe they're back at that favorite beach or lake—all for four bits.
Designed in 1934 as a November-to-May form of recreation for wives and daughters of University officials, the Monday night program now embraces students' wives and employees of the University as well. Last year, with wives dominating attendance, the program rolled right on through June and July.
April 26, 1955: Verbal Vigor
Student interest, at Harvard, often determines the educational bill-of-fare. But if the Faculty responded to student apathy in elementary languages, required German, French, or Spanish courses would long have gone the way of compulsory Rhetoric, Logic, and Semantics. Yet the language requirements remain to blight the freshman year, because the Faculty rates highly the value of language well-taught—although the College has consistently failed to take steps to bring good language teaching to Harvard. The apathy of student and teacher alike spoils the value of the courses. Since the course seem sure to remain, the apathy deserves attention.
April 25, 1975: Cloudy Discourses
There's a myth at Harvard that undergraduates are ignored by departments and faculty members because graduate students are getting all the attention. In the Philosophy Department though, even the graduate students are ignored. Philosophy grad students are very low on faculty members' list of priorities: research, writing, coordinating national philosophy clubs, organizing conferences, editing journals—all come before students. One can imagine where undergraduates stand, then.
April 23, 1977: Soviets Deny Wald Entrance to Conference
Soviet authorities barred George Wald, Higgins Professor of Biology, from attending a scientific symposium on Moscow on Thursday.
The symposium was organized by dissident Jewish scientists seeking to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
Participants at the gathering included ten American and Canadian scientists that Soviet officials warned not, to attend, but did not attempt to stop. The officials turned back Wald and Robert Goldberg, a scientist from the National Institutes of Health, when they tried to leave Leningrad for the conference.

It's more than just a repeated consonant sound or the first half of a high-end athletic store. It's a smartphone app that allows women to anonymously rate past hookups, boyfriends and crushes, so that other women can see these rankings while men cannot. According to its website, "Lulu is a smart girls' app for private recommendations and reviews on guys," and according to my friends' reactions, Lulu is "WHAAAT?"
But now that we have already downloaded Lulu—and downloaded a dozen other apps so that no will notice it's on our phones—what do we do with it? It turns out that it takes more than just a bitter attitude and a willingness to objectify men to use Lulu correctly; it also takes some finesse. So here are some tips.
1. Use the Hashtags
Lulu does not give you the option to write your own comment, but instead offers a variety of hashtags through which you can express everything. Since it is hard to write scathing reviews about how self-centered a boy is using #HasADog, you will have to get creative and string lists of hashtags together to say something of meaning.
For example, #PlaysDidgeridoo #HotCar #OwnsCrocs clearly conveys the message that he has an STD.
2. Beware of Family Friends
If you are like me, then you have a couple older friends on your Facebook account—your dentist or second cousins, people whom you've known all your life and who now occasionally comment on drunk photos of you.
These friends might show up on Lulu. Whatever you do, do not look at their profiles or read their reviews. There could be nothing, but there could also not be nothing. No one should take that risk.
3. Revenge
Don't do it. It has nothing to do with ethical issues, quite obviously (if we had these, we wouldn't be using the app). It has to do with the technical issues. It doesn't work. I tried. I said that one boy had a nonexistent sense of humor and openly burps in public, yet he still ended up with relatively high marks: a 6.5 on the scale and a #DoesHisOwnLaundry.
4. Sell Your Services
It's not often that we women have this kind of power, so capitalize on it!
Offer to write up a flattering review for your guy friends in return for something substantial. Sure, allowing men to see their profiles might defeat the whole purpose of Lulu, but then again the whole purpose of Lulu is objectifying the men with these horrendous profiles. This purpose deserves to be defeated. So rate your friends #GreatSmile in return for a great big latte or a blank check.
