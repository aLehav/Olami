After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services fell short of a goal it set last year to increase the undergraduate flu vaccination rate by 20 percent, according to HUHS Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi.
The total number of Harvard affiliates who got flu shots from HUHS increased from 13,227 in 2018 to 13,783 in 2019. The total number of vaccinated undergraduates increased from 2,391 to 2,762, according to data provided by Francesconi.
Francesconi said that, while HUHS did not ultimately meet their 20 percent goal, her team was pleased to come close.
The initiative was a part of this year’s iteration of the HUHS flu vaccine campaign. In a September interview, Francesconi said roughly half of Harvard College students are vaccinated against the flu every year.
“[We’ve] held steady for about the last five years where we're getting about half the undergraduates,” she said in September. “The Harvard community itself had a slightly higher rate of influenza-like illness last year than what we saw in the rest of the country.”
HUHS employed several strategies to boost vaccination rates this year with the help of undergraduate HealthPALs, Francesconi said. Her team provided stuffed animals to calm nervous patients ahead of receiving their shot and communicated with administrative offices — including the Dean of Students Office — to promote the clinics over email and social media.
“We had Dean [of the College Rakesh] Khurana come and get a flu shot at one of our clinics so we could, you know, encourage students to do it,” she said.
HUHS also targeted the Harvard Athletics Department by holding vaccination clinics specifically aimed at student-athletes.
“We did an extra clinic at the MAC this year,” Francesconi said. “We also changed our hours at the field house to try to reach more athletes.”
HUHS also delayed the clinics this year in response to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led research that showed vaccines given later in the year cover people for longer.
“Certainly for some of the older folks — some of the employees — it certainly could make a difference if you give them a flu shot in August,” HUHS Infection Control Surveillance Officer Donna Campbell said in a September interview. “It’s pretty well worn off by April.”
Francesconi said she hopes the increased number of vaccinated Harvard affiliates will reduce the number of influenza-like cases at HUHS this year.
"We’re hoping to see a decreased number of that across the community,” she said. “The vaccine isn’t 100 percent effective, but we do know that if people get the vaccine, they tend to have less severity in their illness.”
She added that HUHS will continue to offer flu shots in January, but that she encourages Harvard affiliates to get vaccinated at home while on break.
“Our worst flu season tends to come right around February—when you guys are coming back for the spring semester—for many reasons,” Francesconi said. “But February [and] March tend to be our worst time of year for illness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing their final papers and exams in frosty Cambridge, members of Harvard Women’s Basketball flew down to Boca Raton to play in Florida Atlantic University’s Holiday Classic this past weekend. In addition to the Crimson, the tournament featured host FAU, Saint Joseph’s University, and Furman University. Taking the court for the first time in 13 days, Harvard had one of its worst performances of the season against Saint Joseph’s, losing by more than twenty points. The squad bounced back the following day in dramatic fashion, easing by FAU on its home court in the second half. The game served as an uplifting coda to the decade for the Crimson (8-4), who will now enter highly-anticipated Ivy League play in January.
HARVARD 65 , FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY 51
Leading by a point at halftime, Harvard bested FAU (6-5) thanks to the Crimson’s ferocity on defense and patience on offense in the second frame.
FAU outmaneuvered Harvard’s woman-to-woman defense in the first half. FAU ball handlers made precise entry passes to their forwards fronting in the post and dished back-door bounce passes to guards who finished at the rim.
Harvard adjusted to FAU’s cutting-heavy offense in the third quarter by jumping in passing lanes. Repeatedly, FAU players passed the ball directly into Crimson players’ hands. Once Harvard foiled the bread and butter of FAU’s offense, the host team had few other options. FAU scored only 8 points in the third quarter, six of which came from consecutive three-pointers from sophomore forward Juliette Gauthier, and coughed up the ball five times in the period.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith noticed her team’s hard work on defense in Saturday’s game. She said defensive effort is her team’s greatest asset.
“I think their work ethic is especially deep in the defensive end, game in and game out,” Delaney-Smith said. “That's where they're at their best.”
Sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy led the Crimson’s defense against FAU. McCarthy displayed grit in an action-packed 35 minutes of play. She repeatedly sacrificed her body, diving on the floor for loose balls and colliding with opponents while fighting over a rebound.
A player whose greatest contributions to her team often reside in intangibles like hustle and leadership, McCarthy’s statistics in Saturday afternoon’s game truly reflected her impressive performance. She ended 2019 in personal-record-setting style, tallying a career-high seven steals, a career-high 15 points, and a personal-record-tying 11 rebounds.
McCarthy also set the tone for Harvard’s offense in the second half by slowing down her teammates and orchestrating the team’s motion.
Moving the ball around the court quickly, though in control, Harvard’s guards found openings to lob the ball into senior forward Jeannie Boehm, who was being fronted in the post. Boehm’s formidable presence in the paint opened up her teammates from behind the arc, enabling Harvard to take smart shots.
“It was fun to get it in and out and just play really selfless basketball like we do,” Boehm said. “When we move the ball like that, it seems like just good things happen.”
Boehm also finished 2019 with a personal-record performance, grabbing a career-high 16 rebounds. She completed the double-double with 12 points while also dishing out four assists.
Though Harvard played some of its best basketball in the second half, its first half proved rather lackluster. Despite leading FAU at halftime, Harvard responded to its opponents’ unremitting full court defensive pressure by rushing. Consequently, the Crimson failed to find a rhythm on offense and turned the ball over nine times.
Careless free throw shooting compounded Harvard’s poor offense in the first half. By going 0 for 4 from the line in the neck-and-neck first half, Harvard allowed FAU to hang around.
Harvard led at the end of the first frame thanks to senior guard and co-captain Mackenzie Barta’s shooting. Barta was shamelessly confident from the perimeter; showing off a scary quick release, the co-captain knocked down three-point shots with defenders in her face. Barta hit three triples in the first quarter alone and finished the game with 14 points.
Saturday’s game served as a barometer of progress for Barta, a player who started her senior season by only shooting uncontested three-pointers.
For Delaney-Smith, Barta’s development is gratifying and not a total surprise.
“She's playing like we want her to play, like a shooter,” she said. “I've been trying to get her to do that forever.”
HARVARD 39, SAINT JOSEPH’S 63
Sometimes it takes the Crimson a quarter or two to find its rhythm on offense. In Friday’s game, that rhythm never came.
“It's not unusual for Harvard kids after exams,” Delaney-Smith explained.
For whatever the reason, Harvard did not show up on offense. The team went 3 for 22 from three point range and 2 for 6 from the free throw line.
Only one Harvard player scored in double digits, as junior forward Rachel Levy tallied 10 points off the bench. The Boca Raton, Florida, native looked at home playing in her hometown. The following day, she scored six points in the fourth quarter against FAU to build on Harvard’s lead.
Saint Joseph’s went on to drop its next matchup to Furman in the championship game Saturday afternoon. En route to its 63-48 victory, Furman’s senior guard Le’Jzae Davidson led both teams in scoring with 24 points, including seven three pointers.
