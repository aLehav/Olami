“Aspirations in the Arts and Humanities are not an indulgent form of free play for the benevolent or indulgent imagination,” Director of the Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha said in his opening remarks for “Witness,” an event organized by the Center, featuring Toni Morrison and Yo-Yo Ma. “Rather [artistic] interpretation is an act of empathetic intersession, a way of giving voice to another place, person, or period, and setting the stage in their interest.”Co-sponsored by the Office of the President and Provost, the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, the American Repertory Theatre, and the Office for the Arts at Harvard, “Witness” was held on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “[The event is] an opportunity for us to come together as a community in celebration, commemoration, and meditation, not a performance” A.R.T. director Gideon Lester said, “Our intention is to invite representation across the arts and humanities... and stimulate the visual landscape of your imagination.” Aided by world-class artists like Ma, Morrison, and dancer Damian Woetzel, “Witness” aimed to verify the powerful outcome of a union between the realities of the human condition and the creative, artistic manifestations of a living, aspiring soul, in addition to the potential of art to transform human relations.Woetzel, introduced by Bhabha as “one of America’s premier dancers, and the only one with a degree from the Kennedy School,” was perhaps the manifestation of the spirit behind the ambitious evening. A beloved former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, upon retiring he pursued both public and artistic administration. Woetzel lightheartedly led the gathered congregation in the famous opening passage of George Balanchine’s ballet “Serenade.” Woetzel explained Balanchine had set the ballet, accompanied by Tchaikovsky’s glorious “Serenade in C Major,” on 17 novice ballet students.The program called Woetzel’s segment a “balletic invocation of Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” which states that “everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in... its benefits.” The audience was amused and moved as they participated in the “rehearsal” and “performance,” evoking Bhabha’s remarks on the value of participation in communitarian artistic and humanistic pedagogy. Each participant stood with one arm raised as though he were blocking the moonlight, brought his hand to the heart, and opened his arms to the heavens. In the ballet, this passage invokes the birth of the ballerina; here, the cello accompaniment of Yo-Yo Ma and flickering candles invoked the birth of an almost holy union of artistic commitment among individuals with different predispositions and brought fortitude to the power of art to coalesce.President Drew Gilpin Faust was meant to read an excerpt from her book, “This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War,” but, according to welcoming remarks, was indisposed. A substitute read Faust’s writings on the reality of war and the effect it has on American soldiers, transforming them into “different men... men required to deny, to numb basic human feelings at costs they may have paid for decades after the war ended.” As Yo-Yo Ma and Charlie Albright ’11 on the piano played an excerpt from “Quartet for the End of Time” by Olivier Messiaen, who composed the piece while held as a prisoner of war by the German army during World War II, the powerful expressiveness of the words and music were each individually amplified, demonstrating the ideal unification of literature, music, and the vivid imagery of first-hand human testimony and suffering.Reverend Peter J. Gomes recited a passage from T.S. Eliot’s “Four Quartets,” quoting, “We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time,” a nod to artistic exploration of human sentiment. Following Gomes, an array of speakers took the stage to read excerpts from various national outcries against injury and injustice, reading first in their native tongue and then the English translation. Readings varied from “Nunca Más: The Report of the Argentine National Commission on the Disappeared” to excerpts from a student declaration distributed at Tiananmen Square to a selection from W.E.B. Du Bois’ “Human Rights for All Minorities”; countries from Iran to Hungary to Africa were represented, and all were accompanied by an appropriate musical interlude.Lastly, the honored guest of the evening was introduced: Toni Morrison, the Nobel and Pulitzer prize-winning author who “refuses to tell the story simply in black and white” Bhaba said and who “offers this country the opportunity for truth and reconciliation.” In a soft and almost timid voice, Morrison read from her most recent novel “A Mercy,” which explores the condition of slavery set in the 1680s and powerfully raises some of the most profound questions about human rights in our own time; thus, it was the appropriate closer for the evening.Quietly chilling evocations and depictions of women were painfully authentic and for all their beauty, threatened to deprive all present of any glimpse of hope had it not been followed with Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky’s “Night Music: Voice in the Leaves.” A piece of chamber music at times dark but mostly exuberant, it was commissioned in 2000 for the Silk Road Ensemble, who performed it here.Bhabha recalled his inspiration for “Witness”: a Somalian exile who, upon landing in prison, remarked “I have all the time in the world to remember every book I ever read and spend as long as I like exploring it from every angle in my imagination.” This in turn “strengthened [his] resolve and ability to stand resolutely against the dictatorship and to keep [himself] alive.” To represent in the world of arts and humanities the lives of others who are “hidden from history” is to recognize the ephemeral power of the imagination.

The United States currently faces an approximately 20 percent probability of entering into an economic depression, according to a Wednesday Wall Street Journal opinion piece penned by Harvard Economics professor Robert J. Barro.Drawing upon the financial statistics of 251 previous stock-market crashes and 97 depressions, Barro wrote that “the odds are roughly one-in-five that the current recession will snowball into the macroeconomic decline of 10% or more that is the hallmark of a depression.”Barro also wrote that he was skeptical about the effectiveness of the current federal stimulus package. “I wish I could be confident that the array of U.S. policies already in place and those likely forthcoming will be helpful,” he wrote. “But I think it more likely that the economy will eventually recover despite these policies, rather than because of them.”Fellow Harvard economics professor Kenneth S. Rogoff wrote in an e-mail yesterday that he found Barro’s analysis “highly informative” and “certainly more credible” than quantitative economic forecasts circulated by the Federal Reserve.   “I would guess that the risk of the US having a Japan-style lost decade, where the economy goes in and out of recession for years on end, is more likely than the risk of a catastrophic double-digit output collapse,” Rogoff wrote.Rogoff also expressed the need for a speedy response by the Obama administration if the economic situation is to be rescued.“The longer the Obama administration dithers over a decisiveand comprehensive fix to the banking system, the greater the risks,” Rogoff wrote.According to Barro, America has  been plagued by only two depressions since 1870—the post-World War I depression and the Great Depression.The Harvard economist’s current piece came in the midst of an economic downturn that has seen the stock market fall to its lowest levels since 1997.  Barro said he could not give further comment on his piece yesterday.

A group of researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital have published findings on a new, more accurate method to predict stroke risk through a statistical model that screens for thousands of potentially stroke-causing genes.The model—called a Bayesian network—differs from existing methods that examine only the effect of a single factor, instead allowing researchers to study the interaction of multiple genes.The study, released last month, found the formula could predict a person’s risk for the most common stroke in the U.S. with 86 percent accuracy—which the researchers said was a significant improvement over previous models, which only predicted risk with 50 percent accuracy.Originally used for artificial intelligence, the Bayesian network was used to screen 1,313 genes in 569 individuals and turned up 37 that worked collectively to forecast a cardioembolic stroke.Lead author and Medical School Associate Professor Marco F. Ramoni said he first explored predicting stroke risk after observing a high rate of strokes in a 2005 sickle-cell anemia study he conducted.That began a collaboration with Karen L. Furie, Mass. General’s director of stroke service, who was instrumental in providing the raw data needed to construct the Bayesian model.“We’re fortunate Karen had been collecting this data,” said Rachel L. Ramoni, an instructor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine who worked on the study. “She had an ongoing study to collect blood and other information from people affected with a stroke and those not affected by a stroke.”Both the Ramonis (the two researchers are married) said using the Bayesian model was particularly important for predicting strokes because the disease is so complex and often results from interactions of many different factors.Marco Ramoni said his next step will be to analyze even more genes, hopefully one million by next year.“The more you see the more accurate the predictions will be,” Ramoni said, adding that he hoped to get enough data to build models for different ethnic groups.Deputy Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke Walter J. Koroshetz said the findings were interesting, but more studies would need to be conducted to test whether they were applicable to the general population, which would indicate whether the interactions identified are universal or only pertain to the 569 individuals in the study.“If this pattern is predictive and you see the same thing then that’s very robust,” Koroshetz said. “The model works no matter where you go.”

A recent study conducted by researchers at Harvard-affiliated hospitals and the University of Colorado found that people with low levels of vitamin D are 40 percent more likely to report respiratory infections such as colds and flu. The study analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which 19,000 participants were tested for their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D—a precursor of the vitamin that is considered the best measure of its concentration. Study participants with the lowest vitamin D blood levels were found to be much more likely to report having a recent respiratory infection. This result was even more pronounced in those with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Jonathan M. Mansbach—one of the co-authors of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard-affiliated Children’s Hospital in Boston—said that although vitamin D is commonly associated only with the development and maintenance of strong bones, it should be seen as a compound that human immune systems need in order to function properly. Mansbach said that this study is by no means conclusive and said that further research will be necessary to confirm the finding. “We have found a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory infection,” he said. “However, association does not imply causation. vitamin D does not cure all colds and flu.”Vitamin D is produced in the skin when it is exposed to the sun, particularly UVB rays. It can also be acquired through certain foods such as fortified milk and dietary supplements. Lona Sandon, national spokesperson of the American Dietetic Association, says that she believes this study is just one piece of the puzzle in determining the role of vitamin D. “So far we’ve only had observational data,” said Sandon, who is also an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “I also would love to see more clinical trials done for this study to test the effectiveness of vitamin D to boost immunity and fight respiratory infection.” Sandon, a registered dietician, said she has always recommended that her patients spend at least 15 minutes a day in the sun and consume foods rich in vitamin D.

A group of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND) have discovered that the plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease may affect a type of nervous system cell called an astrocyte, providing new insight into the far-reaching effects of the disease as well as possible therapeutic targets. Astrocytes are star-shaped cells that make up almost half the volume of the brain, and were traditionally thought to be support cells. It is now known that they can transmit signals through transient increases in calcium levels.  “Astrocytes are often thought to play second fiddle to neurons but they play an ever increasing role in maintenance of the brain,” said Brian J. Bacskai, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and one of the authors of the study.  The researchers used a mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease in the study to develop some of the pathology found in humans, including senile plaques. They selectively labeled astrocytes with a marker that was bright when the cell was active and dimmer when it was inactive, said Kishore V.G.S. Kuchibhotla, a graduate student at Harvard and one of the authors. Using state of the art optical microscopy that allowed them to image the mouse’s brain while the animal was still alive, the researchers found that the senile plaques modulated the activity of the astrocytes. They discovered that the astrocytes in the mouse model for Alzheimer’s fired spontaneously more often than in a normal mouse and had increased levels of resting calcium. “The astrocytes are connected over time and space and can send waves of calcium signals from one spot to the other,” said Bacskai, who added that these results were independent of neuronal activity. Kuchibhotla said the researchers think that the plaque deposition may be seen as a traumatic event that is causing these intercellular calcium waves, providing a new line for Alzheimer’s therapy. “Modulating the activity of astrocytes might be an interesting therapeutic target slightly different than the neurocentric view,” said Kuchibhotla. Since this research can be applicable to other diseases—including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Lou Gehrig’s disease—Bacskai and researchers at MIND are in the process of using these imaging techniques to study other neurodegenerative diseases. “The point of MIND is to have all the researchers in an open lab environment,” said Anne B. Young, the chief of neurology at MGH and the director of MGH-MIND. “When somebody like Brian finds a new way of looking at something like Alzheimer’s disease we can then go quickly to looking at the same issues in other diseases.” —Staff writer Alissa M.

That cup of coffee you picked up before your 9 a.m. class may prevent more than just sleep during lecture.A team of researchers—led by Paul Nghiem ’86 of the University of Washington Department of Dermatology—released a study last week that determined that the topical application of caffeine may prevent the some types of skin cancer. The research—published in the Journal for Investigative Dermatology— provides a biological explanation for recent clinical studies that have shown a negative correlation between caffeine intake and the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer.According to the study, caffeine appears to reduce the risk of some skin cancers by interrupting the ATR pathway, causing apoptosis or cell suicide of these damaged and potentially cancerous cells.  ATR is a protein kinase that is responsible for facilitating the replication of DNA, especially in damaged and dividing cells.While ATR plays a minimal role in normal cells, recently damaged and precancerous cells need the function of ATR, Nghiem explained.  The researchers determined that low levels of caffeine have no effect on normal cells. The study specifically addressed the preventative effects of caffeine for cases of Squamous Cell Carcinoma—the second most common type of skin cancer in the United States. It has not been proven to have a similar effect in reducing the risk of melanoma or other varieties of skin cancer, said Rachael A. Clark of the Harvard Skin Disease Research Center.In addition to the oral intake of caffeine, the topical application of caffeine may also help to reduce the risk of skin cancer. One possible application Nghiem and his team are considering is its addition to sunscreen. Even though caffeine is not opaque, it absorbs UV radiation, and as an additive, would increase the efficacy of a sunscreen. In addition, once UV damage has been done, putting topical caffeine on mouse skin and in human cells has the effect of increasing the rate of cell suicide by 100 percent, thus decreasing the risk of cancer, Nghiem said. “From a skin cancer perspective, I think it is a great idea,” Clark said, though she added that she believes that more research needs to be done concerning the topical application.This research has only been conducted in mice and human keratinocytes, and any human application is still years away, according to Nghiem.“By no means are we suggesting that people change their drinking habits, but if you drink coffee, this is a another reason to feel good about it,” he said.

Only a few years ago, former University President Lawrence H. Summers told alumni in Washington that Harvard could soon resemble Renaissance Florence. The key, he said, would be development of the life sciences. But an unprecedented financial downturn has forced the University to reexamine its ambitious plans in recent months. Far-flung optimism has given way to greater fiscal pragmatism, and that has meant trade-offs, even in the life sciences. “When life sciences research at Harvard was expanding, and money was plentiful, one could say that Harvard could have it all—vibrant basic research and targeted initiatives that might capitalize on specific new opportunities,” said one Molecular and Cellular Biology professor who asked that he not be named to protect his relationship with the University. “But now, unfortunately, since we cannot grow, the situation involves making choices.”The delay has compelled the University to plan to relocate stem cell researchers originally bound for Allston to a Cambridge facility currently occupied by faculty members in the MCB department—a move that has triggered backlash from professors who object to the administration’s apparent prioritization of stem cell research at the expense of their own discipline.‘NETHERLAND’Harvard’s stem cell researchers, who are dispersed across Boston, have long envisioned a unified research space in Allston, a dream that University Provost Steven E. Hyman has sought to turn into a reality. But that effort has come at a cost. Some researchers in the MCB department have come to view the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department (SCRB) as the administration’s favorite child—a pet project initiated by Summers and loyally continued into the present by Hyman, according to one MCB professor.“They will go to extremes to make Stem Cell happy,” said the unnamed MCB Professor, citing the plan to move the laboratories of several MCB faculty out of the Sherman-Fairchild Building in order to make room for incoming SCRB faculty.“I think it sends a message. It’s one thing to build a big stem cell institution in Allston, where you’re launching a whole special project,” said Jim Henle, an MCB lab administrator in Fairchild. “It’s another thing to displace a whole department and send them to who-knows-what netherland.”Some MCB professors say that the displacement of their department indicates a “corporatization” of science—evidence that the administration has been seduced by the financial potential of stem cell research.“Why else would somebody do that in a time when there’s no money available?” said MCB professor Guido Guidotti about the eviction of the MCB professors. “The idea is, stem cell is going to provide fame and fortune.”But the administration has continued to state that no areas of the life sciences—or any departments for that matter—are being prioritized.“The administration has no favorite departments,” wrote Harvard’s science spokesman B.D. Colen in an e-mailed statement.  Within days of recognizing the likelihood of a slowdown, the administration began consulting with deans and department chairs of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School to find alternative space for groups that had planned on moving into Allston, Colen wrote.“In this case the University had very limited choices under significant time pressure,” he wrote.AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PIONEERMany of the interdisciplinary science initiatives existing at the University today—including SCRB—are the brainchild of a faculty committee convened during the Summers presidency to examine potential shortcomings in Harvard’s research efforts. The group proposed the establishment of cross-school departments to facilitate interdisciplinary science research in areas such as stem cell biology. “SCRB was the first one to be established, which was logical given that the Harvard Stem Cell Institute had been an incredible success,” Colen said in an interview. “And it continues to be, in establishing collaboration among researchers across the University and its affiliated hospitals.”The Stem Cell Institute, which has collected tens of millions of dollars in funding over the past five years, was founded in 2004 at the urging of prominent researchers including Professors Douglas A. Melton and David T. Scadden. Neither scientist responded to repeated requests for comment this week.  Their Institute—which has served in recent years as a reliable fountain of important discoveries in stem cell biology—provides seed grants for researchers.With the Bush administration restricting government funding to only experiments performed on pre-existing stem cell lines, researchers saw an opportunity for Harvard to become a pioneer in stem cell biology and quickly pressed administrators to aid the newly-emerging field. “Harvard and some other institutions at the time suggested that we needed to do what we could do to further this promising field and simultaneously work to try to resolve federal restrictions,” said Harvard’s chief lobbyist Kevin Casey. “There was a sense of urgency in that period that...private parties had to come and step in where the federal government had vacated the field.” PREMEDITATED PRIORITIZATION?Researchers quickly found themselves enjoying the support of both Summers and Hyman, a neurobiologist who led the University’s Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program. Hyman, a reliable proponent for stem cell research to this day, said in 2006 that he took the job of provost with the intention of revamping interdisciplinary research at the University. Among his goals was the centralization of research efforts scattered across the University.“The degree of fragmentation across the schools and hospitals is such that sometimes we’re not even the sum of our parts,” Hyman said. But there appears to be some skepticism that Hyman’s focus today is on the practical benefits of University unification, and not on the lucrative nature of the disciplines involved.“The current leadership—at least at the level of the Provost—is yielding to that political influence of fundraisers,” said MCB professor Markus Meister. Still, Meister suggested, the University’s handling of SCRB had less to do with premeditated prioritization, and more the department’s ability to be resilient despite the current economic situation.“SCRB has raised a lot of funds for its own operations,” he said, “at a time when the University doesn’t have a lot of funds.”—Staff writer Esther I.

Over 150 workers, union activists, students, and faculty members gathered outside the Holyoke center yesterday to protest potential layoffs due to University budget cuts.
The two rallies—held at 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.—were comprised by members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the Services Employees International Union, the Student Labor Action Movement, and the Cambridge political group Socialist Alternative.
Carrying signs reading, “Layoffs are not the new Crimson,” “Harvard is more than just students,” and “Solidarity is Hot,” protestors picketed outside of the offices of Harvard’s Labor and Employee Relations Department.
“The problem is that I have worked  many years here, since 1993. I want my kids to have enough money to go to college. I’m not an American, but they are. They have the American dream,” said custodial worker Juan Miguel Iscayau, in an interview conducted in Spanish.
The second rally—held later in the evening to accommodate custodial staff and student schedules—ended with a march around the Holyoke Center and into Harvard Yard, where protestors gathered outside University President Drew G. Faust’s office in Massachusetts Hall.
“As students at Harvard, we are very privileged,” said Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09. “We [students] are ready to sacrifice if Harvard is ready to sacrifice too.”
University-wide budget cuts, due to a predicted drop-off in endowment value, have prompted the creation of early retirement packages, and 1600 workers are currently eligible. Administrators estimate a 30 percent fall in endowment value by the end of the fiscal year. 
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, who did not attend the rally, said that there have been no layoffs or guarantee of layoffs thus far for the 4,800 members of HUCTW. 
“My life depends on my job at the law school,” said Ashley R. Pollock, a faculty assistant at the Law School. “I’ve been told that I could be on the chopping block. It’s difficult not knowing if I’m going to be employed in a few months.”
Leading the crowd in chants of “they say lay off we say back off” and “hey Harvard, you’ve got cash, why do you treat your workers like trash,” library worker and HUCTW member Geoff Carens said he thought the event was a success. 
“This is just the beginning—we will give Harvard a big headache over this,” he said. “We believe in no layoffs for Harvard workers. If cuts need to happen, they should be at the top.”
Despite the diversity of interests represented at the rally, Director of SEIU Local 615 Daniel Brasil Becker said he believed their goal was unified.
“We are fighting for justice. We are making history. We can only rise together,” said Becker, who is not Harvard-affiliated.
Students from the College, Medical School, and the Law School turned out in support for the workers. 
“A lot of us know the staff, and they sought out our support,” said Medical School student Benjamin J. Oldfield. “As students we have the power to meet with administrators and impact change.”

The new College Fellows Program—which will recruit at least 20 recent Ph.D.s for one-year teaching appointments as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ cost-cutting efforts—is drawing mixed reactions from members of the Faculty.Although the possibility of the program has been floated for some time, FAS began to seriously consider implementing it around November, when it became clear that the financial crisis was going to hit the University hard, said Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith.Since Smith has slashed the number of visiting professorships for next year and the hiring slowdown will limit the number of new lecturers FAS will be able to hire, the new program provides an economical alternative to fill teaching vacancies.While professors acknowledged that FAS needs to cut costs, some said the program may detract from the ladder faculty system. Others also voiced concern that the program may not be entirely beneficial for Fellows.“It’s a fine program in economically straitened times,” said Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas. “But one wouldn’t want to see a substitute in any way for legitimate ladder appointments.”“The maintenance of a system of ladder faculty is central for the health and vitality of this university and universities throughout the country,” he added.English Professor Louis Menand said that he is worried the program may not be a service to Fellows in the long term, since it may leave postdocs jobless after their one-year stint.“It’s really a way to get inexpensive teaching,” he said. “We need to make sure it’s good for them and we’re not just using them.”The position—which History of Science Department Chair Anne Harrington described as “three quarters teaching and one quarter research”—places a much larger emphasis on teaching than ladder-faculty positions do. Since the Fellows would be teaching “almost full time,” they may not have enough time to write and do research, said Gennaro Chierchia, chair of the Linguistics department.Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis said that he is optimistic about the fact that the position places such a large emphasis on teaching, since it may signal a shift in the qualities sought in future professors.“Just as the general competition goes up, so the bad news is that it’s harder to get a job at all in academia,” the computer science professor said. “The good news is that the supply is large relative to the demand, so the quality ought to increase in all good dimensions.”At present, it is unclear whether or not the program will be temporary, but if the program does stay, some professors voiced worry that it may grow too large.“What you don’t want is a program that gets bigger and bigger and shifts away from faculty,” said Sociology Department Chair Robert J. Sampson. “You want to maintain face in the classroom.”Fourteen departments are now looking to appoint College Fellows to teach three classes over the course of their one-year stint. The College Fellows program is already providing an alternative to replacing retiring professors with new ladder faculty. The Psychology, Anthropology, Government, History of Science, Sociology, and Economics departments are also currently looking for College Fellows to teach sophomore and junior tutorials.Economics Department Chair James H. Stock said that there was “no question that [the program] would help” fill teaching demands, especially for tutorials, as the department depends heavily on visiting faculty. —Noah S. Rayman and Elyssa A. Spitzer contributed to the reporting of this story.—Staff writer Bonnie J. Kavoussi can be reached at kavoussi@fas.harvard.edu.

Many of the traits that humans have accumulated over their evolutionary history clash with their modern environments, according to Professor of Anthropology Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, who gave a speech at the Geological Lecture Hall last night.Audience members lined up along the hall’s back wall as Lieberman took the stage and began his lecture, “Survival of the Swiftest, Smartest or Fattest? Human Evolution 150 Years After Darwin.” “What happened in human evolution? Are humans now evolving? What will happen in human evolution?” Lieberman asked his captive audience.“Our bodies are not entirely designed for the world that we live in, and we run into a lot of problems. They run from the minor discomfort of fallen arches and having to wear glasses to really serious problems like diabetes and obesity,” he said.He noted that humans tend to address the symptoms of their physiological problems as opposed to their root causes, a phenomenon that he discouraged. “Our society has taken the small approach to thinking about these problems. We engage in what I’m calling ‘dysevolution,’” said Lieberman. He suggested that society combat obesity by creating a more pro-exercise culture and expanding health education as opposed to adopting symptom-based approaches such as liposuction.“In order to actually start something, the first step is to talk about it, to dream it. If you can’t dream it, you can’t do it,” John F. Ruggiero, a member of the audience, said of Lieberman’s suggestions.Lieberman also discouraged the consumption of corn-fed beef on campus because cows are not evolutionarily designed to eat corn. Cows fall ill when they do eat corn on a regular basis.“I didn’t know that they put the cows through all that semi-torture to obtain it,” said audience member David J. Cordeiro.The professor also presented a number of discoveries that he said would have pleased, surprised, and perhaps even disturbed Darwin. He gave as an example the genetic evidence which indicates that humans and chimpanzees are more related than are apes and chimpanzees.Lieberman also said he is considering writing a book on dysevolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just four days after Harvard Medical School professor Jim Yong Kim was selected as the 17th president of Dartmouth College, a popular Dartmouth daily e-mail update sent a message to approximately 1,000 students about Kim’s appointment that was laden with derogatory racial slurs.The “Generic Good Morning Message” (GGMM)—a list-serve administered by six students that is not affiliated with the college—sent an e-mail about Kim that directly attacked his Asian origins.“Yesterday came the announcement that President of the College James Wright will be replaced by Chinaman Kim Jim Yong...It was a complete supplies,” the e-mail began.  The e-mail repeatedly attacks Kim, who is actually of South Korean heritage.“Unless ‘Jim Yong Kim’ means ‘I love Freedom’ in Chinese, I don’t want anything to do with him,” the e-mail stated. “Dartmouth is America, not Panda Garden Rice Village Restaurant.”The e-mail generated an immediate backlash from both students and faculty at Harvard and Dartmouth.Kisuh Jung, a sophomore in Dartmouth’s Asian Christian fellowship, said that students were outraged when the e-mail went out.“I think everyone acknowledges that this is a very serious offense,” Jung said. “It is an embarrassment; it is not indicative of the student body’s opinion towards our new president in any way.”Kim expressed understanding in an e-mail addressing the incident sent out yesterday morning to all students at Dartmouth.“I want to ensure that the student who wrote the e-mail understands the enriching role that people of diverse backgrounds will play in his life,” Kim wrote. “But I also don’t want this lapse in judgment to limit his prospects for the future. Dartmouth students are very talented, but we all make mistakes—especially when we are young,” Kim added. Allen Yang ’11, an officer in the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Student Association, applauded the choice of Kim and the response by the Dartmouth community. “I think the message was written in poor taste,” he said. “But I have faith that the Dartmouth community knows that this sort of joke is just not as effective in this age of diversity.” On the day the e-mail was sent out, interns from Dartmouth’s Pan Asian Council and representatives from the Inter-Community Council, Diversity Peer Advisor interns, and a member of the GGMM held an emergency meeting to discuss the fallout from the e-mail.While the GGMM writer who sent out the controversial e-mail remains anonymous, GGMM writer Courtney A. Davis apologized for the incident. “The students of the Generic Good Morning Message list-serve take full responsibility and apologize for the inappropriate and insulting nature,” she said.Jung said that he hopes that this incident will be resolved by the time that Kim formally takes office this summer. “We will do our best to welcome him in light of this incident, and I think he will come to understand,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dashing hopes, crushing dreams, quashing expectations, are a few words that come to mind when Harvard fans think of the Yale women’s basketball team. Two years ago the Bulldogs handed the Crimson (17-8, 9-2 Ivy) their only loss, upsetting a perfect season. Then, to add stale icing to an already unsavory cake, around this time last year, Yale devastated Crimson optimism by ripping sole possession of the top spot in the Ivy standings out of its grasp.“I think this is a very emotionally charged weekend,” co-captain Niki Finelli said.” The feeling of last year really motivates us.”This weekend, the squad has a shot at redemption, as it welcomes both Brown (3-23, 1-11) and Yale (11-15, 4-8) to Lavietes Pavilion.“We have a huge history with Yale”, co-captain Emily Tay said. “They are always the team that beats us, so we always treat them like one of top teams.”With the second best record in the Ivy League, Harvard is not only looking for redemption but a solid conclusion to their final home games. The Crimson controls its own desinty, and the team can move into the top spot with three wins in its next three games. In the last two weeks, Harvard has looked to diversify its offensive attack by strengthening its presence in the paint. With notoriously strong perimeter play, the Crimson has shifted some of the scoring responsibilities from its guards to its forwards. “It all depends on how they decide to play us,” Finelli said. “If they try to guard our post players during the game, we’ll kick it up top but we’re always able to change up play during the game.”Over the past three games, forward Emma Markley has spearheaded the Crimson offense posting 23 points against Penn, 13 points against Columbia and 13 points against Cornell. Harvard looks to surprise both teams, by debuting a different style of play than displayed in the teams’ previous meetings. Although plagued by an 11-game losing streak, Brown—with its deep bench and tenacious drive—could still be a threat to Crimson hopes. Ten different players have led the Bears in scoring this season. The Bears won their first league game at Yale, but have dropped every game since. The squad comes into Lavietes dying for a win before season’s end, and a painful overtime loss to Penn last weekend only added fuel to the fire. Last time the two squads met, four Harvard players posted double figures. Freshman Brogan Berry tallied 17 points on 5-for-6 shooting, while Finelli led the team with seven boards. In the end the Crimson defeated the Bears 71-46.The Bulldogs are coming off a flip flop weekend. The team ended a three-game losing streak last Friday against Penn, but then lost to Princeton the next day. “Despite their record, Yale is always a threat”, Tay said. “Even though their record isn’t that good this year, they have always been a problem, so we always look out for them.”Yale is the best free throw shooting team in the Ivy League, posting 72.7 percent from the charity stripe. The Bulldogs have also built a wall around three point land, holding its opponents to 28 percent from beyond the arch. In its last meeting with Yale, the Crimson didn’t score a single three pointer. The game should break down as a typical offense vs. defense matchup, as Harvard possesses the best perimeter shooting in the Ivy League and Yale, the best perimeter defense in the league.In the last meeting, Tay led the squad with a game-high 19 points and five assists, while Berry tallied 18 points. Sophomore Jackie Alemany wasn’t far behind, scoring a career-high 13 points, collecting six steals and grabbing a team-high seven rebounds to help defeat the Bulldogs 70-63.Despite high hopes, the Crimson goes into the weekend with Finelli on the injured list with a torn ACL. The senior, who has been a leader on the court since freshman year, will complete her Harvard career cheering on her teammates. “Her injury just gives us extra motivation,” Tay said. “We are going to play for her.”—Staff writer Evan Kendall can be reached at kendall@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HARVARD 59, BROWN 61In a cruel reversal of fate, the home team pulls out a second-half comeback, but this time it's the Bears that win out.00.0 - On what must have been his 12th shot attempt (and the toughest), much maligned no. 31 sinks the game-winning three at the buzzer, after Housman misses a tough floater. Yet another tough last-second loss for the Crimson. Brown fans rush the court.40 seconds - Harvard holding ball. Mullery made a layup to cut Harvard lead to one. Lin takes it.1:00 - McNally misses the front end of a 1 and 1. Big. 1:32 - Harvard can't get the defensive rebound, and Brown finally sinks an open three. Harvard 59, Brown 56.1:56 - McNally almost with the steal, but it's called a foul. "Big Country" is at the line.3:00 - McNally's got a good stroke from outside. Brown's open shots just aren't falling. Harvard 59, Brown 53.3:36 - No. 31 comes through, scoring a layup. Brown is still in it. Harvard 56, Brown 53.4:44 - Although he isn't scoring as much tonight, Lin is still making an impact through steals and assists. He also is forcing a few fouls. Harvard 55, Brown 50.5:25 - Brown taps a loose ball to streaking McNally, who knows how to finish. Bears then pressured into taking a timeout; they have none left, while Harvard has three remaining. Harvard 53, Brown 50.5:55 - Housman pulls up for a three. Harvard 51, Brown 50.6:46 - Wright with a nice block by his fingertips.7:18 - Crimson turnover, instead. After a Brown three, Lin gets fouled, making both. Harvard 48, Brown 50.8:11 - Housman takes a key charge. Clutch senior move. Harvard with a chance to take the lead.9:17 - Missing again (1-10???), Brown's no. 31 is not having a good game. Pusar is, tying it up at 46 with a three. That deficit was erased quickly.9:55 - Lin with a layup. This is more like it. Skrelja throws it somewhere, just not to a teammate. Harvard 43, Brown 46.11:00 - Lin's back in and announces his arrival with a soft jumper inside the line.11:18 - Shots are not falling for Harvard, and Brown is getting to the line. Boehm is, in a word, incensed. The Crimson have scored four points in almost nine minutes.12:31 - Ball movement gets nowhere. Crimson can't finish. And by the way, Brown makes a three. Harvard 39, Brown 45.13:12 - Lin's on the bench. Housman doesn't get the foul call. Crimson don't have much of an offense right now. At least the Bears are still putting up bricks.13:46 - Actually, no, it won't. But Mullery is there to clean up the trash. He's at the line. Skrelja calls him "Big Country," ostensibly trying to encourage him. The foul shot barely makes it to the rim. Connection?14:35 - Bear Sullivan makes another long two. Perhaps the outside shot will start falling for the hosts. Harvard 39, Brown 42.15:16 - Brown scores a long two. Not a good sign for the Crimson. Harvard 39, Brown 40.15:20 - Brown cheerleaders highly under-appreciated by sedate home audience.15:35 - Wright with the nice move inside to take it back. Harvard 39, Brown 38.16:03 - Uh oh. Skrelja gives Brown the one point lead.16:38 - Interior scoring is one of Brown's strong points, however. A layup cuts the lead to one, as the Crimson need to pick it up on defense. 8-2 Bears run. Harvard 37, Brown 36.17:11 - The Bears do some things well. Three-point shooting is not one of them. They've made one out of about fourteen attempts.17:32 - Crowd's getting into it a little. Sign of the night: "Skrelja > Shaq."17:55 - Bears comes out on a 7-1 run, punctuated by Mullery. Harvard 36, Brown 34.HALFTIME - Mullery free throw cuts the deficit as Harvard leads comfortably 35-28. Now, time for more young children playing basketball. Mr. Howell is highly entertained.Notes- Lin had three points in the first half. Mullery was a perfect 5-5 from the field.41.9 seconds - Kenyi has spent the majority of the last couple minutes airborne --contesting shots, tipping passes, and a layup attempt. His foul shot makes it 35-27.1:27 - Wright says "shoot it," and Housman listens. Jumper makes it 34-27.2:32 - Brown misses yet another open three. Neither team is shooting very well, but the Crimson is doing just enough.2:45 - Kenyi lands a block with so much momentum that he lands on his rear. Harvard up 32-25.3:37 - Just for fun, Mullery throws up a three, sinks it. Kenyi does the same, just prettier.4:45 - Harvard up 29-20.5:10 - Harris and Mullery with back to back blocks. McNally whiffs on his own try.9:08 - Finally a good finish on the fast break. Lin's no-look pass to driving Pusar extends lead to 8. Crimson leading 22-14.10:05 - Junior vs. freshman, Mullery vs. Wright. That's the show right now, as they trade layups. Harvard up 20-14.10:34 - Neither team is finishing well, blowing multiple fast breaks. Post play is doing well though. Wright puts visitors up 18-12.11:48 - Lin finds Wright with a good pass. The big freshman gets hacked and makes both. Harvard is up 16-12. Lots of missed shots from both teams tonight.12:35 - Amaker's yelling is the loudest thing in the gym. Unimpressive showing by the home crowd.12:59 - Harvard turns up the defensive pressure, and it pays off with a Bear turnover.13:23 - 83.3% of Bear cheerleaders are Asian. Good ratio.13:57 - Housman continues to make it look easy. Layup makes it 13-10 Crimson.14:19 - Boehm tickles the twine from behind the arc, but Brown cuts the lead back to one. Harvard up 11-10. Brown coach is an angry little man.15:00 - After fruitless series of pushing the ball up the court, sweet Bear give and go ties it at 8.16:25 - Wright finds Housman for the soft three. 8-4 Crimson.17:28 - Harris soars like an eagle to pin a layup against the glass.18:19 - Pusar drains a triple. Harvard up 5-2.18:47 - Tip by Wright goes in. 2-2.19:17 - After a Chris Taylor layin inside and a Mullery block, Bears up 2-0.20:00 - Brown controls the tip.T-8:00 - Coming to you live from Pizzitola Sports Center in Providence, R.I.

For the athletically-inclined, we have a slate of early spring season home games across the river this weekend. Whatever your preference -- ice, hard court, or grass -- Crimson teams will be putting on a display, as men’s and women’s hockey and lacrosse, as well as women’s basketball and men’s volleyball, will all be playing in Cambridge. Find out more after the jump.
The biggest event of the weekend will take place when the Harvard women’s hockey team hosts the ECAC finals against RPI for a chance to go to the NCAA tournament. After beginning the season unremarkably, the Crimson women have hit their stride and will look to ride the strong play of tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt to another Frozen Four birth. The puck drops Saturday at 1:00 p.m., while other semifinalists Dartmouth and St. Lawrence will battle at 4:00 p.m. The champion will be crowned after Sunday’s 2:00 p.m. matchup between the winners of Saturday’s contest.
As for Lavietes Pavilion, the basketball court will see two nights of Ivy League action, with Harvard facing Brown on Friday at 7:00 p.m. and Yale on Saturday at 6:00 p.m.
Another highly-touted matchup will take place at Cumnock Turf at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, when No. 12 men’s lacrosse takes on No. 19 UMass. The Crimson have already knocked off perennial powerhouse Duke and Stony Brook this year, setting the stage for an exciting contest.
Immediately following the men’s game, women’s lacrosse will take on Quinnipiac at 4:00 p.m., hoping to put last weekend’s 13-12 loss against UMass behind them.
Men’s volleyball looks to return to .500 with contests against Rutgers-Newark and NJIT at the MAC. Harvard sits at 3-5, but all three wins have come at home, giving the Crimson confidence going into the weekend. The matches will take place Friday at 7:00 p.m. and Saturday at 4:00 p.m.
No. 66 Men’s tennis will also see action at home, playing Marquette in a Sunday matinee match at 2:00 p.m.

As you stumble downstairs cursing that hangover tomorrow morning, you might notice something different. Instead of the standard Saturday fare of taco meat and refried beans, Harvard University Dining Services is setting out a veritable smorgasbord, including Chicken Florentine, Penne Primavera Salad, and Focaccia.
Why? Might have something to do with junior parents descending on Harvard. Wouldn't want to serve them hot dogs.
Definitely wake up in time for this, though. Likely the best food since that brunch in January. Full menu after the jump.

Our fair president takes to the pages of The New Republic this week  to review a new book by James M. McPherson, the "dean of Civil War historians," she says. (A reassuring description. If she is going to take her hand off the the University's helm to pick up a pen, at least we know she can't do it without thinking about deans.)
Faust is gentle in the pages where former TNR contributor and fellow Harvard prof James Wood was once known for his ferocity.
In her review, she describes an Abraham Lincoln who entered office facing immense challenges.
"The bottom is out of the tub," Lincoln apparently said. "What shall I do?"
Faust hints that Lincoln's ability to keep the tub from sinking should gives us hope even with the current state of the union. But I wonder, as our endowment leaks and our army retreats from Allston, could Faust's reading of Lincoln could have ramifications closer to home?
Forget about that other power-hungry executive who preceded her, might we be witnessing the dawning of Harvard's war-time presidency?

Buried in a Junior Parents' Weekend Q&A with administrators this afternoon was the revelation that Harvard may not allow some or perhaps even most of its students to stay on campus next January.
In response to a parent's question on the subject, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that due to budgetary constraints, the University may only offer housing to special groups, such as athletes in season or international students.
"It may be the case, depending on how financial projections turn out, that they will be the only ones who can be there," he said.
Harris didn't seem particularly thrilled about the query either. His initial response was "I was very much hoping we wouldn't get that question," though he did manage to elicit chuckles from the parents with this wry bit of humor.
"I can understand why one might be concerned about the idea of a student being home for four weeks."
Particularly if that student has a thesis due.

According to a study released by HMS this week, watching television does not make babies smarter. Duh. But what about videos like “Baby Einstein?” Still no, say the researchers. While it won’t necessarily hurt to let your little one watch educational programs, there are better things you can do to set your baby on the road to a perfect SAT score.
“But,” you say, “I’m 20 years old. How does this pertain to my life?” Obviously we have an answer for you.
If you’re like most of your fellow students, ten or fifteen years from now you’ll probably have a kid. And, if you’re like most of your fellow students, you’re going to want your kid to be a legacy. As application rates continue to rise, your child is going to need more than just legacy status to make the cut.
What should you do to make sure your child gets admitted to the Harvard College Class of 2040? Find out the secret after the jump.
Instead of watching hours of Barney, the study’s author suggests reading, singing, and stacking blocks with your child, all of which help brain development. Once they get older, you can move them up to Jenga (Okay, Jenga is not actually part of the study).
But honestly, how much could a few hours of Mr. Rogers really hurt anyone? We loved that show. Especially the cardigans.
