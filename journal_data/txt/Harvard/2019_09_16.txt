After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hear the phrase “I’m not worried about my data” all the time. I’m sure most of you have heard it, or one of its many siblings (“I have nothing to hide,” “Who cares if Facebook has my dog pictures,” etc.) at some point in the last year. Many of you have probably said something to this effect as well. It’s a difficult position to discredit, and one that invites rebuttals into the silly realm of fear-mongering and futurism. But it’s also a dangerous position.
Most fears in everyday discussion about internet privacy focus on one of three things: cybersecurity risks, like compromised social security numbers, special-case hypotheticals like celebrity blackmail, or, most recently, election tampering. Each to a varying degree is a problem in its own right. Centering the data privacy discussion around them, however, also distracts from the greater risks of not having internet privacy, which go beyond compromised passwords and even election tampering because they affect everybody at an individual level.
These risks originate from two realities that statements like “I’m not worried about my data” dismiss. First, we broadcast infinitely more of ourselves to the internet than we are willing to acknowledge. The internet has stopped being a product we consume but a space we inhabit. A modern town square, the internet today is a hub of human activity, a new ecosystem for life.
Picture yourself embarking on a routine visit to check your mail in this square. On the way you’re hailed by a friend on Snapchat and stop to chat. Continuing along, you window shop for a while on Amazon. Later a New York Times headline catches your eye and you take a moment to skim it. Finally you make it to your mailbox and go through your mail.
Physically you have not entered a new space, but in every other respect you have. Aspects of yourself are transmitted at every turn — data like your reading interests, your attention span, and the things you say, but also metadata, like your openness, your IQ, your conscientiousness, your extroversion, your neuroticism. These last five categories aren’t made up or futuristic, but just a sampling of the data we discovered Cambridge Analytica was collecting from unsuspecting Facebook users almost two years ago.
Advances in data processing will only make this information more readily accessible. To see the internet as a space in this way is critical to understanding and reforging our relationship with it. We should have as much of a problem with being spied on when we inhabit the web as we should if we were to walk into a restaurant that had cameras all around tracking us — with the same compelling reasons we sense, intuitively, as to why this is wrong.
Which brings me to my second point: The potential for misuse of this information is vast and imminently actionable. Forget about the embarrassing and uncomfortable things we keep private, and think about how often we require privacy in the simplest sense of wanting to be able to choose what side of ourselves to present to the world. The employer you don’t want to know about your procrastination habits because you might not get the job if they did. The bougie bar you don’t want to know about your stinginess because they might not let you in if they did. The dating app you don’t want to know your relationship faults because it might screen you from other users if it did. The loan writer you don’t want to know your IQ.
To some extent I’ve cherry picked examples that allow me to point out how easily the web can figure these things out about us from the data we provide it. On the other hand, I’ll just say that it was pretty easy to find these, and I could have chosen 100 different ones and still not have covered all my bases. It’s dangerous to lose control over facts about yourself the moment it becomes expedient for someone else to know those facts, at your loss.
The more intimately we intertwine ourselves with the internet world, combined with the more insightful our algorithms become, the more control we cede over these sorts of facts. You may think greater intensification of these two developments is needed for these facts to become important. Or you may be like me, and think that too much of who we are has already been lost to the memoryless web. At the very least, acknowledge that you do have something to hide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard University Police Department officers assisted Cambridge police officers in responding to a protest against United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement at Amazon’s Kendall Square office. The protest, organized by Jewish activist group Never Again Action, started at the Boston Holocaust Memorial and ended at the lobby of the Amazon office, where Cambridge police arrested 12 people on charges of trespassing.
We have staunchly supported the legal and human rights of immigrants, commended protesters who stood up for these vulnerable individuals in our communities, and urged the University to support students who are threatened by the federal government’s anti-immigration policies. We remain committed to these values that define our community and maintain our support for these protesters — both in their cause and their right to protest.
At the same time, we have also repeatedly called for Harvard to support the Cambridge community, from sharing its educational resources to increasing its financial contribution to local economies. HUPD should not be exempted from Harvard’s commitment to supporting the broader Cambridge area. In doing so, they need to recognize the extreme sensitivity of the task they are charged with. HUPD has the opportunity to demonstrate that supporting the law enforcement needs of the Cambridge community need not conflict with Harvard’s values of supporting the right to protest, including this instance of anti-ICE activism.
In its mission, HUPD vows to “maintain a safe and secure campus by providing quality policing in partnership with the community […] within the University context of free expression, rigorous inquiry, vast diversity, and pursuit of distinction.” By supporting other police departments in times of need, the HUPD has fulfilled the first part of its mission. And we believe that partnering with police forces in the community does not, in principle, contradict the latter part — its obligation to respect protesters’ free expression.
To be sure, American police departments have demonstrated the ability to be particularly brutal toward protesters, especially when protestors seek to address systemic law enforcement violence. As a result, among young people and communities of color, trust in law enforcement has continued to decline.
HUPD should continue to be conscious of its capacity to contribute to that nexus of violence both on and off Harvard’s campus. Especially given that its primary responsibility is to protect and serve college students on a campus that ostensibly values civil discourse and the safety of its communities of color, HUPD has a particular responsibility to seek the trust of these communities. To that end, HUPD should always place emphasis on supporting the rights of protesters and students as well as the Cambridge residents who they are so often called to serve.
Just as Harvard often calls its students and faculty to lead by example, to exemplify the values of the University as they journey out into the world beyond, Harvard should hold its police force to the same standard. HUPD should always seek to demonstrate principles of responsible law enforcement both to uphold its own mission and to send a message about what policing can and should be in the 21st century.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard should consider acquiring the property on which the eight final clubs reside and repurpose these social spaces as senior houses for the 12 undergraduate Houses.
The Houses have always been our first line of defense against the final clubs. An important aspect of former University President A. Lawrence Lowell Class of 1877’s push to finance the House system in the 1930s was unequal access to the final clubs, which predate the residential houses by roughly three decades. At the center of Lowell’s vision was the hope that the Houses would provide to every student the public goods once reserved for members of clubs: dining rooms, private libraries, pool halls, and places for study, work, and community.
As Lowell described in a 1907 lecture in New Haven: “Any system of societies or clubs, is incapable of supplying an opportunity for the best kind of social life to the great mass of students.” If “we allowed the boy to select his group on first coming to the university,” he continued, “the students would mainly be segregated on the basis of origin, of geographical sections, of preparatory schools, of home surroundings; and thus we should have — as people have said — a college for western men, a college for southern men, a college for millionaires. Now this is the very worst scheme of division that could possibly be devised.”
Acquiring these properties seems a natural extension of Lowell’s vision for “a system of grouping that will bring into each group men from different parts of the country, men with different experience, and as far as possible social condition,” which he contended was “one of the chief advantages of the great university.” It may help to circumvent the continued debate over the morality and legality of the current administration’s sanctions against single-gender social organizations. It is consistent with a positive and creative spirit — to lead by example, not proscription — that aims to recycle and preserve the spaces for future generations of Harvard students (of all genders).
Repurposing the clubs could also help to serve a separate purpose: making the random allocation of students to Houses fairer. Harvard could allocate the highest-quality spaces in inverse proportion to the distribution of quality across houses. For example, the three Quad Houses — Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer — might have the most centrally located spaces, with the rest ordered by reverse date of renovation or distance from Harvard Yard.
Regardless of the allocation, introducing accessible spaces for Quad Houses closer to most meetings of student organizations, office hours, and social gatherings will help to remedy the inequity between the Houses on the river and those in the Quad. This is especially important given that the new campus in Allston is likely to diminish the relative position of inhabitants of the Quad. The unprecedented distance it creates between Quadlings and new classroom locations may discourage concentration in the School for Engineering and Applied Sciences and related fields for these students.
No doubt this proposal would be — perhaps prohibitively — costly at market prices. It may be impossible for the College to make the necessary compromises to respect the history of the spaces and their former inhabitants without relinquishing the principles Harvard hopes to embody. Whether such deals would improve upon the status quo is an open question. At market rates — $35.1 million using 2019 assessed tax values from the City of Cambridge — the cost would fall below 4.1 percent of the $873.9 million that the Harvard Management Corporation has allocated to House renewal.
A more radical form of this proposal is one that also includes the Signet Society, the Harvard Advocate, the Hasty Pudding, and the Harvard Lampoon. Each organization has prominent real estate and valuable alumni networks. These organizations could continue to use their original spaces to hold events. Most satisfyingly, arithmetically, this arrives at 12 properties — one for each house — though the moral grounds for collectivization of this extent may be weaker.
In 1902, then-University President Charles William Eliot, Class of 1853, was asked by a group of alumni whether or not he would help them to acquire land along the river for the founding of Lowell House. He declined, citing concerns over tax obligations to the City of Cambridge. As one alumnus recounts: “I do not know at what stage I approached the Corporation but I did write to President Eliot and asked if he would join us. In any case I remember well that he sent a courteous reply saying, ‘No.”’
The alumni went ahead without him. Led by Edward Waldo Forbes Class of 1895, the grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson, they founded a trust, the Harvard Riverside Associates Trust, to acquire the land with the intent to transfer the property to Harvard, which they did in 1912 after Lowell became president.
Will we ever see any similar such lasting transformations of Harvard College again? The final clubs occupy a small corner of Harvard’s social life — one that contracts each year as the student body becomes ever-more talented and diverse. If these buildings can be made to serve a greater purpose by drawing Harvard's students closer together, as the land along the river once did, they will fade less swiftly from Harvard's memory than they might otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 10 students protested a Harvard Lampoon comp open house Friday night, interrogating the organization’s leadership about its internal culture and a controversial image of Holocaust victim Anne Frank printed last semester.
The protest follows heated criticisms levied at the Lampoon in May for its decision to publish a cut-out of Frank’s face superimposed over an image of a woman in a bikini. Shortly after the publication of the image, more than 900 people signed a petition demanding “public accountability” of the Lampoon.
Friday's protest fell on the last night of the Lampoon’s comp open houses, which gave prospective members an opportunity to learn more about the organization and its member selection process.
“We just wanted to make it aware to freshmen especially, who were thinking of comping, of the controversies surrounding the organization — specifically the controversy back in the spring with the Anne Frank publication,” said Abraham E. Rebollo ’20, a protester at the meeting.
Protestors also questioned Lampoon members regarding the organization’s response to prior allegations about broader issues with the organization’s culture. Some students have previously criticized the Lampoon for an internal culture they say is hostile and an opaque selection process for new members.
“I think we all agree that things need to change, or at least, there is a lot more understanding that needs to happen. I think the main problem is the Lampoon's lack of transparency,” said Danu A. K. Mudannayake ’20, a protester and a Crimson design editor.
Lampoon Co-President Jack G. Stovitz ’20 wrote in an emailed statement that the Lampoon is committed to “accessibility” and that the magazine has detailed efforts to improve the comp process on its website.
“Accessibility is at the core of our comp, because if you’re funny (or good at business), no matter who you are, we want you,” Stovitz wrote.
New initiatives listed on the website include mandatory Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response training for new members, anonymous feedback forms compers can submit, and the introduction of “digital office hours” for compers seeking feedback.
The Lampoon has also created two new positions — scribes to their Accessibility Council – to lead staff meetings in which members will share “collective responsibility” for the magazine’s comp and general operations.
At the comp meeting, Stovitz said the Lampoon should not have published the image of Anne Frank and referenced an earlier public statement the organization had released in May.
“We as individuals and we as an organization would like to apologize for our negligence in allowing this piece to be created for and printed in our latest issue. We are sorry for any harm we have caused. Furthermore, we want to both affirm and emphasize that the Lampoon condemns any and all forms of anti-Semitism,” part of the May statement reads.
Several protestors said they are unsure if the Lampoon will take action to address the concerns they raised during the meeting.
“It sounds to me like they are making an effort to look like they care about the issue. I don't know if they genuinely do,” protestor Miriam Alphonsus ’21 said.
“When they're as opaque as they are, it's difficult to assess it from the outside,” protestor Jarod R. Stone ’21 said. “I think there was a mix of people who are trying to change it from the inside. But I think there's a need for external pressure to just guide things along.”
Stone said that the protest group’s issues with the Lampoon focus on the history of the organization.
“I just think so many of the problems of perception can be resolved by a… willingness to move away from the rarefied castle,” Stone said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventy-three students declared their candidacy for 47 available seats on Harvard’s Undergraduate Council last week, according to the UC Election Committee Chair Perry M. Arrasmith ’20.
This marks a slight decrease from last year’s 75 candidates, a much smaller decline in interest compared to the 28-person decrease seen from 2017 to 2018.
Consistent with past election cycles, significantly more freshmen are running for seats on the council than students in any other class year. Roughly half of the candidates are freshmen, with 34 students running for 12 seats, on the council.
Historically, elections for freshman seats on the council have been more competitive than upperclassman races. Freshmen also have the highest voter turnout at UC elections.
This year, however, Elm Yard elections are non-competitive, with only three students running for three available seats.
Elections will not be competitive in six of the 13 upperclassman houses: Cabot House, Dunster House, Eliot House, Kirkland House, Mather House, Winthrop House, and Dudley Community.
After elections take place, there will still be vacancies in Cabot House, Dudley Community, Eliot House, Kirkland House, Mather House, and Winthrop House because they have fewer candidates than available seats.
The most competitive election for upperclassmen will be Currier House, with six representatives running for three seats.
Twenty upperclassman representatives, a majority of the 37 upperclassman representatives eligible for re-election, chose not to declare candidacies for an additional term on the council.
Lowell House Representative Samyra C. Miller ’21, like many of her fellow representatives, chose not to run for re-election despite only joining the council in January after an unsuccessful bid for UC vice president last fall.
“I've decided that that is not a space that I want to contribute my energy to right now,” she said.
Eliot House Representative Maxwell A. Gillmer ’21, the council’s first director for belonging and inclusion, also decided not to run for re-election.
In some houses, fewer than the 3 allotted seats per house are open during this year’s election. Junior or senior returning members of the council who serve as a committee chair, secretary, or treasurer do not have to run for re-election. This year, this rule applies to four UC representatives: Ajay V. Singh ’21, Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, Cade S. Palmer ’20, and Phiroze K. Parasnis ’21.
The campaign period for fall elections began Sunday at noon and will conclude at 11:59 p.m. on Thursday. Elections will be held from 12 p.m. on Tuesday to 11:59 p.m. Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 50 students and faculty members gathered in the Kirkland Junior Common Room Thursday evening to inaugurate the Undergraduate Council’s First-Generation Faculty Mentorship program.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 established the mentorship program over the summer to support students who identify as first-generation college students in connecting with faculty, according to Palaniappan.
The duo plans to collaborate with Primus, a student organization representing first-generation and low-income students, as well as new pre-orientation program First-Year Retreat and Experience, to support students with diverse backgrounds.
Throughout the event, faculty and students participating in the mentorship program mingled while dining on finger foods and refreshments. Many students also met one-on-one with their faculty mentors during the event.
Several students in attendance lauded the faculty mentorship program, saying they appreciate the guidance their mentors provided them.
“I think it’s a great way to connect first-gen students with people who actually work here,” Lara van Rooyen ’23 said. “I feel like first-gen students might not know how to form relationships with their professors. Now, I already have someone who’s trying to help support me.”
Palaniappan and Huesa said former UC representative Mai-Lin Ton ’19 inspired them to support first-generation students more actively, as Ton was a great supporter of first-generation students.
During Ton’s time on the council’s education committee, she compiled a list of faculty members who were themselves first-generation or allied with that community. Many of the faculty, including Stephen N. Chong, co-director of Undergraduate Studies for the Department of Computer Science, joined the mentorship program this year.
Palaniappan said that many of her and Huesa’s conversations with first-generation students on campus specifically identified a difficulty in connecting with faculty members.
“A lot of them had noted to us the challenges that the community particularly faces in being able to connect with these upper-level faculty members and having more personal, meaningful conversations with them when it often seems that the only space in which you’re able to connect is through office hours,” she said.
While recruiting faculty mentors, the duo said they contacted faculty members who identify as first-generation or as allies of the first-generation community.
“We know that that was something that is also really important especially at a place like Harvard where a lot of people might not always see themselves reflected in the different institutional aspects that have remained here for quite so many years,” Palaniappan said.

Harvard College’s oldest historically all-female a capella group, the Radcliffe Pitches, inducted its first male member this week, more than four decades after the ensemble’s founding.
The Pitches welcomed tenor Mason G. Meyer ’20 to their ranks after he sang in the group’s second year of gender-neutral auditions last weekend. Pitches President Sophie C. Webster ’21 said Sunday that they made their auditions co-ed more than a year ago.
“The Pitches have always been meant to be a very inclusive space in that it was created for marginalized voices which were, at that time in Harvard's history, women,” Webster said. “We all came to the conclusion that it was really important that we open it up to anybody who wants to sing.”
The Pitches follow several of Harvard’s musical groups that have broadened their membership, including the formerly all-male Din and Tonics.
The all-male Krokodiloes, Harvard’s oldest a cappella group, have previously invited a female singer for callbacks but have not accepted non-male members into their ranks. The Glee Club and Radcliffe Choral Society eliminated gender requirements from their bylaws in 2018 under pressure from administrators.
Pitches music director Rena A. Cohen ’22 said the group wanted to balance their treble music-heavy repertoire — which traditionally requires singers with higher vocal ranges — and their desire to go gender-neutral.
Cohen said Meyer’s voice will “strengthen” the group’s ability to keep their standard repertoire without needing to write new parts.
“We were really excited about Mason because he could really sing the parts that were already written, but added a wonderful element of power and strength behind lines that are sometimes very low in the female range so they come out a little bit softer,” Cohen said. “We think he’ll be a great fit.”
Webster said her predecessor, Hannah N. Johnston ’19, first suggested to the group’s graduate board in May that the Pitches open up its membership. Though the Pitches did audition several men in the spring, Webster said Meyer was the first male candidate they felt fit the group’s needs.
“We did speak to our graduate board and fortunately it seemed to be that there was really minimal pushback,” Webster said. “It really was just one conversation with Hannah very eloquently laying out why this was critical for our group in this day and age, and also just to her personally, and I think that they were like, ‘Alright, sounds good.’”

Harvard’s reputation and University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s direct involvement likely played an essential role in getting Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23 to campus, experts and several people involved in the case said.
United States Customs and Border Protection denied Ajjawi, a Palestinian resident of Lebanon, entrance to the United States last month after questioning him and searching through his phone and computer. After finding allegedly anti-American social media posts made by friends on Ajjawi’s feed, an official informed him they were canceling his visa and refused him entry to the country.
Ajjawi, who said he did not personally make any political posts, returned to Lebanon Aug. 23 and waited with his family as the College’s start date approached. Meanwhile, his lawyer Albert Mohkiber; AMIDEAST President, CEO, and a former U.S. ambassador Theodore H. Kattouf; and Harvard International Office Director of Immigration Services Maureen Martin worked to advocate on his behalf.
Several organizations including AMIDEAST, a non-profit organization sponsoring Ajjawi’s study in the United States, released statements in support of Ajjawi following the incident.
Mokhiber and Kattouf both said Bacow became personally involved in the case and that his support aided Ajjawi’s eventual arrival ten days later on Sept. 3.
“I'm grateful to your president at Harvard,” Kattouf said. “He was very much a stand-up guy on this issue and it's very much appreciated.”
“This was a very, very unique case with a very unique student, very sympathetic factors, a wonderful president of Harvard, a wonderful CEO of AMIDEAST,” Mokhiber said. “It was a dream team. Everybody came together.”
Mokhiber also said having help from Bacow, Kattouf, and others helped Ajjawi overcome the challenges most international students turned away at the U.S. border face.
“We were successful on this one, but there’s going to be many, many more. They’re not going to have a president of Harvard or their own university or former ambassador or even a lawyer perhaps available to them,” he said. “We have to look to the underlying issue, which is much greater.”
Mokhiber was one of several immigration lawyers who said Ajjawi’s case came amid an increasingly difficult environment for foreign students seeking to study in the U.S.
Some Harvard students also encountered visa issues in 2017, when four graduate students faced challenges arriving on campus as a result of the Trump administration’s travel ban. Three of the students were able to return to campus after three weeks, but one waited eight months to return.
Several factors distinguished Ajjawi’s case, including the Harvard name and CBP’s alleged rationale for sending Ajjawi back to Lebanon, according to immigration lawyer Leon Fresco and Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr. Ajjawi told The Crimson last month that officers denied him entry based on political posts on his Facebook friends’ accounts rather than his own posts.
Fresco said denials of entry are not uncommon, but that Ajjawi’s situation was different from most because of his affiliation with the University.
“Student visa turnbacks have always been a part of what CBP does, but a turnback from a school like Harvard is incredibly rare,” Fresco wrote in an email.
Ajjawi’s case is unusual as many people who are turned away at the border have difficulty challenging the denial, according to Yale-Loehr.
“I think the publicity was a large factor in shaming CBP into letting him reapply for a visa. But in general, if someone is denied a visa overseas or is turned away at the border, there's not a lot they can do,” Yale-Loehr said. “They don't have full due process rights to challenge a denial, because they haven't technically entered the United States yet.”
Yale-Loehr and Fresco both said CBP’s use of social media to bar Ajjawi reflects a growing trend in immigration enforcement.
In June, the State Department announced it would require some applicants to submit social media data as part of visa applications if immigration officials deemed it necessary.
Still, both Fresco and Yale-Loehr said that regardless of whether the State Department already pored over Ajjawi’s online presence, CBP officials have the right to second guess their original assessment. Yale-Loehr added that border officials’ rationale, not their methods, made the case unusual.
“I think it was particularly outrageous, if I have the facts correct, that it wasn't even his social media postings that supposedly caused the problem. It was simply that he had friends who had posted things that he happened to view or have on his phone,” he said.
Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson Michael S. McCarthy wrote in August that Ajjawi was “deemed inadmissible” upon his first attempt to enter the U.S., though he did not specify on what grounds.
“Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming ALL grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds,” McCarthy wrote.
Ajjawi returned to campus as his classmates participated in their Convocation, a situation Fresco, Mokhiber, and Kattouf termed remarkable.
“This requires expert advocacy and diplomacy in order to navigate the very tricky legal and regulatory framework that governs these issues,” Fresco wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s soccer’s season-opening three game home winning streak was snapped Friday afternoon, as a fantastic individual performance from San Francisco’s Miciah Madison stole the show at Ohiri Field and a slow start doomed the Crimson to a 3-1 defeat.
Madison, a dynamic senior forward who had entered Friday’s game with three goals and two assists in the Dons’ first six games, added two more goals and another helper, each in impressive fashion.
In the first half, Harvard (3-2), playing its third game in five days, appeared physically overmatched. The bigger and more experienced San Francisco (5-2) was coming off of a humiliating 9-0 defeat to Stanford on its home turf, and it showed. The Dons came out fired up, winning contested headers, pressing the Crimson into mistakes, and holding Harvard to a single shot — which came just two minutes into the game and was blocked — in the first half.
“I think we knew San Francisco was going to be an athletic team and they were going to put us under a lot of pressure,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “I think we — as a team overall — hid a little bit more than we should have done. I think we weren’t as comfortable on the ball and we were not showing up and they took advantage of that and they scored some chances.”
The payoff came in the 11th minute, when Madison cut in from the left wing and fired away from 25 yards out. Almost before the Crimson players even knew the shot was coming, the ball had nestled into the top right corner. Harvard’s goalie, senior Kat Hess, had no chance to save it.
Madison was also the catalyst for San Francisco’s second goal, which came a shade under 20 minutes later. After a wayward dribble sent the ball careening toward the goal line, she showcased her speed by running it down and then lofted the ball towards the far post, where 5’9” redshirt senior forward Samantha Jehnings — with whom Madison clearly has terrific chemistry — was waiting. All Jehnings had to do was head the ball into an open net, and the Dons had some breathing room.
The Crimson grew into the game after that second goal, allowing just one total shot in the final hour of the game after conceding six, including three on frame, in the first half hour. But the one shot they did allow in the second half was a damaging one.
Those who had watched the first hour of the game were unsurprised when 63 minutes in Madison, whose driving run had seemingly been stopped by Harvard’s defense and whose back was to goal, somehow managed to buy herself a half-yard of space and quickly fired a shot from the edge of the 18 yard box into the lower left corner.
“[Madison is] just a very dynamic player and one thing I found covering her is just I have to always be within arm’s length to make sure she doesn’t turn,” sophomore defender Jillian Wachira, who was often tasked with following Madison, said. “Just being annoying the whole game and just trying to be in her face a little bit, because once she sees that pocket she goes, and she’s quick, so you give her those five yards and she’s ahead of you just like that.”
The Crimson dominated the rest of the game, starting with a quick response to the third goal by sophomore Sophie Hirst, who directed an excellent cross from first-year midfielder Gabby DelPico into the net for her second goal of the season. But while Harvard continued to pile on the pressure, finishing with eight second half shots (six on goal) to San Francisco’s one (the goal by Madison) and creating multiple scoring chances, the three goal deficit was too much to overcome, and the Dons held on for a 3-1 victory.
“In the second half we showed up, we competed, and we wanted the ball under pressure,” Hamblin said. “I think it’s a really good lesson for our young team to understand that you can’t hide, you can’t be afraid, you have to attack each game and although the game can be a game of two halves, often times if you put yourself in a hole, it can be too difficult to get out.”
In the loss, the Crimson also suffered what might have been a damaging injury. Near the end of the first half, junior forward Murphy Agnew, the catalyst for much of Harvard’s offense so far this season and a key connector between the team’s midfield and first-year striker Angela Caloia, limped off the field and did not return to the game. Agnew’s status for Sunday’s game at Connecticut is uncertain, but any time she misses will be damaging to the Crimson going forward.
Harvard will travel to Storrs to face Connecticut before it returns home for matchups with UMass Lowell and LIU next week, the Crimson’s final two games before Ivy League play starts in two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 12 Harvard men’s water polo (5-0, 0-0 NWPC) took home three wins this weekend in Princeton, N.J., at the annual Princeton Invite.
The Crimson toppled No. 9 UC San Diego (6-3, 1-0 WWPA), 12-11, in its first game of the weekend on Saturday.
It then knocked off Navy (5-4, 1-0 CWPA) in the early game on Sunday by a score of 17-10 and handled Fordham (5-2, 0-0 CWPA) , 11-8, in the afternoon.
Harvard came into the weekend riding high from a strong showing at the Bruno Classic in Providence, R.I., on September 8.
Captain Charlie Owens and junior Jackson Enright paced the Crimson in the first match with three goals each, and sophomore Alex Tsotadze had two goals and four assists.
Michael Sonsini added two more goals to set his career high.
Harvard’s defense held strong in the close victory, and sophomore goalie Noah Hodge, who was named NWPC Defensive Player of the Week last week, recorded an assist to go along with ten saves against the Tritons.
“Overall, I thought we had a pretty good weekend, said Hodge. “We played well as a cohesive unit and are very excited to get back to training this week for more big games next weekend.”
He was happy to have received recognition for his success in the season so far.
“I’m honored and excited to be named Defensive Player of the Week for the first week of play,” he said. “I hope to continue my high level of play throughout the season.”
The second contest of the weekend took place at eight o’clock in the morning, but the Crimson attack appeared unfazed by the early start time. Junior Dennis Blyashov and Tsotadze both tallied four goals, and Sonsini again poured in a pair while Hodge had eight saves and two assists.
The score was knotted at six at the end of the first half, but Harvard pulled away from the Midshipmen in the second half as senior Bennie Seybold kicked off the scoring. He had two goals in the match.
In the third game, Enright led the team with three goals, his second hat-trick on the weekend. Owens and fellow captain Austin Sechrest scored two goals apiece, and Blyashov took care of two penalties (drawn by Seybold) to help the squad on the way to double digits.
Hodge was solid once again, holding the Rams to just eight goals as he racked up fourteen saves and two assists to push his total at the Princeton Invite to 32 saves.
Blyashov was the team’s offensive leader on Sunday, with six goals overall.
Owens praised the team’s overall performance in the three-game set and its late-game prowess.
“We took a big step forward as a team this weekend,” he said. “Our depth showed in our ability to wear teams down and execute in the fourth quarter. We’re looking forward to getting back to work this week and preparing for our games next weekend.”
Harvard will head to Lewisburg, Pa., for another early-season test next weekend at the Bucknell Invite. It will square off against No. 15 George Washington, John Hopkins, Mercyhurst, and Salem International as it looks to continue its undefeated season.

Welcome to the start of a new school year! Whether you are a freshman just becoming acquainted with all of the facets of campus life, a sophomore adjusting to your new house community, or an old and wise upperclassman, we can bet that one aspect of school you forgot about (or purposefully blocked out) was school mailing lists. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the volume of communication flooding your inbox and wondering where you fit in amongst the messages, we have the answer.
1. How much time do you spend in the dining hall?
a. Exactly as much time as it takes to consume my food and clean up. With a schedule as full as mine, I don’t have time to sit around and chat (happy recruitment season!).
b. Either five minutes or two hours — it totally depends on whether I’m running off to rehearsal or hunkering down at a table.
c. However long it takes to have a five minute conversation with every person in the dining hall.
d. I go to my dining hall once a day to pick up food, but I eat in my room.
2. How many classes are you taking this semester?
a. Six. I’m actually on my way to a meeting with my academic advisor right now to see if I can add a seventh.
b. Only three, actually. I’m serving as president of a few different organizations, so I thought I would take time to focus on those this semester.
c. Four, and I spend the rest of my time lounging in my house’s common space.
d. Five, but I might drop one if the professor doesn’t get their act together. I know I deserved at least an A- on that paper.
3. What time do you go to bed every night?
a. I don’t sleep.
b. Like 3 a.m.? Really depends how late practice goes.
c. 11 p.m. at the latest!
d. I’m in my bed by 9 p.m., but I usually stay up until 1 or 2 writing bad Yelp reviews for restaurants in the square.
Mostly A’s: Weirdly specific buying/selling ads
You are always on the grind, and you couldn’t possibly squeeze out 15 minutes to stop at the nearest CVS or Target to pick up the mini carpet that you absolutely need but for which you are under no circumstances willing to pay more than $10. All we can say is good luck with your endeavors.
Mostly B’s: Pubbing email sent out by 5 people in within one minute
More than anything, you love what you do when you’re not in class, and so do your blockmates who comped with you freshman year — that’s actually how you met them! But maybe, in the heat of the moment, you get a little hasty with the email sending. As far as you are concerned, there’s nothing wrong with spreading some love and sharing your passions — you trust that your community will support your work and maybe even join.
Mostly C’s: Wholesome community building emails
Can you say intramurals? You L-O-V-E where you live, and there’s nothing like a little study break/stein/sports game to help everyone see what you already see in your house or dorm. Plus, you really need at least three more players to compete in the game this weekend, so you’re hoping for some responses.
Mostly D’s: Passive-aggressive call outs
Look, you’re not saying someone took your detergent, and it’s totally possible that the cooking spray you left in the community kitchen grew legs and walked away last night. But on the off chance that someone took your stuff, it’s important that everyone in your house knows you are absolutely not someone to be trifled with, unless they want very targeted emails in their inbox, too.
