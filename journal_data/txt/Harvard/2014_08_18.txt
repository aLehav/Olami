After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As human rights in Thailand deteriorate under a military junta, Harvard is collaborating with key supporters of the recent coup to create a permanent Thai Studies program at the university. These individuals, most prominently former Foreign Ministers Surin Pitsuwan and Surakiart Satirathai, have spearheaded a campaign to raise $6 million for the program, which they have characterized as a means of promoting Thailand’s monarchy and national interests. Professor Michael Herzfeld, who is leading the initiative, wrote in an emailed statement to me that the program would not be tied to specific political interests and Harvard conducts due diligence on its donors. However, by lending credibility to allies of a totalitarian regime and allowing them to use Harvard as a platform, the university is doing Thailand and itself a disservice.
In a Bangkok Post editorial calling on Thailand’s “foreign friends” to support the coup, Surakiart characterized the military takeover—which saw a democratically elected government overthrown and hundreds of activists, academics, and journalists arbitrarily detained—as a benign “reform process.” At a fundraising event I attended in Bangkok last August, Surakiart declared that the Thai Studies at Harvard was intended as “a program to honor the King.” King Bhumibol was born in Cambridge in 1927 when his father was studying public health at Harvard, but he did not bring the city’s progressive values back to Thailand. During his reign, he has supported military dictatorships, endorsed successive coups, and presided over a cult of personality enforced with more than half a century of indoctrination, propaganda, censorship and occasional violence. Criticism of the monarchy is illegal in Thailand, and hundreds have been jailed or prosecuted in recent years for violating the country’s lèse-majesté laws, which are the world’s harshest.
In its eagerness to secure money for the permanent program, which would include a tenured professorship and expand on lectures and courses introduced in 2012 with Foreign Ministry funding, Harvard has played along with Thai royalists. The Harvard Asia Center in 2012 named Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the daughter of King Bhumibol and his possible successor, as a Distinguished Non-Resident Fellow. It is difficult to assess her qualifications because information about the royal family is tightly controlled. Her achievements in academics, languages, music and art have been touted for decades by the monarchy’s PR apparatus, but are little-documented by independent sources. Her fellowship followed the announcement of a recurring annual donation to Harvard from Thailand’s Foreign Ministry, which promotes the monarchy overseas. Since the coup on May 22, neither the princess nor any other members of the royal family have publicly expressed concern over the suspension of Thai citizens' political rights, or the military’s harassment of academics, the media and others who have criticized its abuses.
Most of the Harvard program’s Thai backers are members of a conservative elite—which includes the aristocracy, generals, and wealthy families—that has dominated the country since the 1950s and rolled back reforms enacted after the absolute monarchy was overthrown in 1932. This group views growing political participation as a threat to its privileges, and has undermined successive elected governments through its influence over courts, appointed bodies and the armed forces. Most recently, the conservative establishment supported militant street protests that provided a pretext for last month’s coup, and subsequently threw its weight behind the royally-endorsed junta now ruling Thailand. Surin was a prominent public voice rationalizing the actions of mobs (led by stalwarts of his ironically named Democrat Party) that stormed government offices, physically obstructed elections, and agitated for a coup. Surakiart and Surin have been mentioned as potential Prime Ministers in an upcoming military-appointed administration.
While the junta claims its goal is to restore order, its main agenda has been purging allies of elected former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and promoting the interests of the monarchy and its elite associates. The military government has suppressed critical discussion of the monarchy (even targeting people’s Facebook activity), intensified propaganda glorifying the king and his family, and initiated changes to the education system to further promote royalism and nationalism. The Foreign Ministry, a conservative and aristocratic stronghold, has even attempted to stifle criticism of the coup at foreign universities.
At the Harvard fundraiser I attended in Bangkok last August, Surin used the word “beachhead” to describe the envisioned role of the Thai Studies program. His choice of a word with military and strategic connotations is significant. Having overthrown a series of elected governments and facing growing criticism from cold-war allies, the conservative establishment is working hard to rebuild its legitimacy abroad, and setting up a program at Harvard would be an important victory. Surin announced donations from several tycoons, and said he was seeking funding for the program from the King’s Crown Property Bureau, which manages the monarch’s wealth of more than $30 billion.
The Thai Studies program’s proponents at Harvard include well-intentioned and politically astute individuals who are aware that the some of the money being raised comes with an agenda. Michael Herzfeld in particular has a strong record of standing up for academic freedom. Harvard must ensure that the program is funded and run transparently, and that it is not co-opted by coup apologists or used to legitimize the monarchy. In the meantime, Harvard could burnish its credentials on Thailand by providing support for Thai academics forced into hiding or exile for criticizing the coup and its backers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So-called “blended” courses offered during the spring semester received lower student ratings than earlier, traditional offerings of those courses, according to a recent internal report, which analyzed student feedback for courses in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences integrating traditional and online education.
The report, released in late July by Harvard’s Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, also made recommendations for how to improve the blended format.
Overall course evaluation scores for three of the four courses analyzed were lower than those of previous offerings. However, Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX and the Bok Center, cautioned that students almost always take time to adjust to major changes.
“We’re seeing right now a remarkable degree of experimentation in new modes of learning,” Lue said. “It takes time to get these things right.”
The report analyzed four courses experimenting with a mix of online and classroom learning. The courses, which included Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking,” Culture and Belief 22: “The Ancient Greek Hero,” History of Science 121: “The Einstein Revolution,” and Societies of the World 12: “China,” were evaluated using a combination of surveys and student focus groups.
The four classes, which were taught to undergraduates last academic year, combine traditional teaching methods with materials from HarvardX, Harvard’s portion of edX, an online education venture it launched with MIT in 2012.
In the report, analysts made several recommendations for improvement, including increased transparency in the grading process, timely feedback for students, and and an earlier start to course planning. The report also recommends experimenting with new ways to physically use classroom space.
Though the report noted the positive aspects of blended learning, it also considered reasons for the lower Q scores, noting in particular the possibility of a higher workload for students and the loss of small discussion sections.
Professors of the blended courses said that they are taking steps to address those concerns raised in the report.
Michael P. Brenner, who co-teaches “ Science and Cooking,” said that next year he is planning to reduce students’ workload by eliminating many of the online requirements for “Science and Cooking. For his part, “China” professor Peter K. Bol said that he will reintroduce discussion sections for the course.
The survey also found a split between underclassmen and upperclassmen in their course evaluations. Underclassman students gave much more positive reviews for the blended model than upperclassmen. According to Bol, this split might illustrate a “cultural issue” in adjusting to new workload expectations.
Despite the room for improvement, both Bol and Brenner said that they feel moving more course material online has been advantageous for their courses.
“It gave students a chance to see the lecture content...in their own time, in a format that made it much easier to follow,” said Bol, who also serves as the University’s vice provost for advances in learning. “[The] model of chunk and test with more visual explanation allows for much greater comprehension, so class time wasn’t for lecture, it was for discussion and interaction.”
Brenner, a Physics professor, agreed that moving lectures online allowed for more efficient and convenient way to communicate course material.
“We have a set of material now because of HarvardX that is of much higher quality than what we had before,” he said. “The flip side is that we are really very much learning ways to use these materials in a way that is effective in a Harvard classroom.”
Along with the report, the Bok Center has created an eight-person “Blended Learning Support Team,” in order to help faculty members adapt their courses for blended learning.
“It’s really left in the hands of the faculty, our hope is that all of this material...will benefit Harvard students,” Lue said. “We want to make it easier for faculty to use these things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen students sat around tables arranged in a circle, covered in papers, notebooks, coffee cups, and copies of Alexis de Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America.” To the outsider’s eye, they looked just like students in any other Harvard seminar. Only these students shared a differnt kind of connection—all were either former or current members of the U.S. military.
The veterans were on campus for the inaugural year of the Warrior-Scholar Project, a one-week intensive pilot program—next year’s program will likely be two weeks—designed to help military veterans transition from the battlefield to the classroom and beyond.
The program, which began at Yale in 2010 but has since expanded to Harvard and the University of Michigan, is funded by donations and grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and other organizations. With the funding and significant help from Harvard Law School, participants, who are all veterans, shoulder only the cost of transportation to and from the program. The program is not limited to Harvard-affiliated students.
Through studying the works of Tocqueville and Thucydides, attending writing workshops, and interacting with top professors, the program aims to help veterans transition to and excel in college and beyond said Logan Leslie ’16, program director of the Warrior-Scholar Project at Harvard and a former Green Beret.
A NEW TYPE OF EDUCATION
The military portrays education as “vocational training,” but, Leslie said, this mindset can prevent many veterans from getting the most out of college after leaving the military.
Aside from learning the critical thinking and writing skills necessary to perform well in college, the veterans also are taught to make the most of university resources and professors so that they can become a part of the college communities they enter.
“A lot of vets might graduate and they might resume block, but they may not contribute to the community or get out of school what they could have,” Leslie said. “We need to get them past this idea that ‘because I’m not getting a job directly related to this, I shouldn’t put time into this.’”
During the program, which ran from July 7 to 12, Harvard professors helped the veterans dissect the classic works of Tocqueville and Thucydides around the theme of “democracy and citizenship.”
With about 150 applicants and only 15 spots, competition for a place at the conference was tough, but the selection process was “need-based” not “merit-based,” according to Leslie. The selection committee picked veterans who would gain the most from the program.
“My number one takeaway was about the value of the classics,” said Jared Smith, 23, who served four tours of duty in Afghanistan during his five years in the Army. “It wasn’t until I read Pericles that I realized that this was incredibly applicable to real life.”
Smith, who enlisted after high school was discharged from the Army this month, will enter the University of Oregon this fall. After his week at the Warrior-Scholar Project, Smith is considering studying French or Greek in college.
Sang Bumra, another attendee, is currently stationed at Ft. Myer, Virginia, but will be enrolling in Columbia’s School of General Studies this fall. Bumra, 27, had previously enrolled at Santa Monica Community College and Northern Virginia Community College for classes. For Sang, the program will help prepare him for the rigor of an Ivy League education.
Bumra called the course a “short course with long days” and said that the program helped him with his “reading, writing and reasoning skills.”
A STAR-STUDDED TEAM
The Warrior-Scholar Project seems not to have had any problem recruiting well-known professors to guest lecture and mentor students. During the week, University President Drew G. Faust, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53, and Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen all made appearances, among others..
“It’s too easy,” to get professors to help out, said Leslie, who noted that professors were willing to fly in just to speak to veterans.
Faust, who reinstated Harvard’s ROTC program in 2010, has made an effort to strengthen ties between Harvard and the military. In a speech to participants in the Warrior-Scholar program, she urged them to pursue education while holding onto their experiences from the military.
“You have such important messages and lessons to bring to our communities in your role as warrior-scholars,” Faust said in her prepared remarks to the program. “I hope that as you become scholars, you don’t entirely abandon your role and your experiences as warriors, but that you bring the richness of that experience to the communities which you will be entering.”
Mansfield, an Army veteran, dissected Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America” with the students and noted that the veterans brought a different perspective and “proven character” to the table.
“These students have an advantage compared to Harvard students,” Mansfield said. “They are willing to sacrifice their lives—they have been serious about something.”
Indeed, many professors found the veterans to bring different, real-world perspectives into the classroom. interesting insights and unique perspectives. Government professor Eric M. Nelson ’99, who led a seminar on “the concept of democracy,” called the veterans “remarkably clever.”
“It’s very rare that we get the opportunity to offer thanks and provide help to our veterans,” Nelson said. “It was really an honor to find myself in their company.”
Gergen, a Navy veteran, spoke with participants about their potential for leadership within academic settings, and changes in the role of veterans within greater society. He also praised the program as an important means of helping veterans reintegrate into academic settings.
“This country desperately needs a new generation of leadership and they have all the makings of what it takes, but they do need to finish college,” Gergen said. “It is very very important...to produce bridges for people coming out of the military.”
