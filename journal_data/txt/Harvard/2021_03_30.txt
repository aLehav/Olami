South African musician Alice Phoebe Lou defies expectations in both her songs and career. She rejected all the record deals that labels offered her after a 2014 TEDx performance, instead choosing to self-fund her work through independent concerts and street performances. “I don’t need security, any conventional form of success,” Lou said in a 2015 interview with European magazine Cafébabel. “It is a difficult route in some sense but it’s completely liberating in another.”
Lou released her third record “Glow” on March 19, marking her first foray into writing songs about love, a topic she had previously avoided. In doing so, she has created her most honest and emotive work — a spellbinding record that beautifully depicts love in all its complexities.
“Only When I,” the album’s haunting opener, begins with a striking assertion: “You didn’t teach me, I taught myself through you.” Although the self-assured statement initially appears to proclaim independence from a past relationship, it soon becomes clear that the reality of healing from a former flame isn’t so straightforward. “Sometimes it feels like I could give it all up to be held by you / But that's not all the time,” Lou croons over a tender electric piano. “Only when I can't breathe / Only when I wanna believe / Only when it's late at night / Only when I don't feel right.” As Lou acknowledges this, a steady drum beat and a cascading electronic harp (courtesy of a vintage 1981 Suzuki Omnichord) join in, intensifying her raw confessions. Several tracks touch on the inevitable pain of love, such as the strikingly intimate “How to Get out Of Love.” “I think I need your words to feel like daggers in this love / For only then could I give up the hope in my heart,” she sings softly, an eerie contrast with the sweet guitar hovering below her voice. But she folds these darker lines in with more hopeful ones devoted to the potential for personal development arising from this pain. “Mother’s Eyes” delves into this growth: “I catch my eye in the mirror and smile back at myself / Openеd up some boxes that are fillеd with pieces of me / All of those years trying to squeeze into boxes that didn't fit all of me.”
These juxtapositions of confident declarations of growth with vulnerable admissions of pain demonstrate Lou’s recognition of the double-edged nature of love. In divulging both the beautiful and the painful aspects of her experiences, Lou lays her heart bare, opening herself up to the listener and allowing them to connect with the music on a deeper level.
The album’s many contradictions become evident from just a glance at the tracklist, which includes a song called “Heavy / / Light As Air.” “I want nothing / I want it all now,” Lou sings on the second single “Dirty Mouth,” a punk-inspired song that drives forward with incredible energy. “Glow,” the delightfully upbeat title track, includes another apparent paradox: “I am smiling, I am screaming.” She acknowledges even more conflicting elements of love in “Mother’s Eyes”: “I want you, but I don't want you to be mine / Feels like the paradox of my life.” By juxtaposing so many clashing feelings and ideas in her lyrics, Lou demonstrates her appreciation of love and all the heartache that accompanies it, as a multifaceted experience that cannot be boiled down to positive or negative descriptions.
Although Lou’s lush lyricism portrays her central theme of love as complex, one thing is crystal clear: Her sound has never felt so confident. “My love affair with recording to tape & the analogue process started this year,” she wrote on her website. “I couldn't wait to create an analogue album.” Her use of this technique has created a gorgeous amalgamation, merging themes of the present with sounds of the past. By using “all the oldest mics, amps & gear,” she has crafted a vastly different record from her mesmerizing second album “Paper Castles.” Befitting its recording process, “Glow” sounds vintage and distinctly nocturnal, like a warm blanket late at night. One listen to the first single “Dusk” demonstrates this, with smooth saxes playing a catchy motif over electric keys comping a steady rhythm. Although Lou employs similar jazz chords and songwriting techniques on both records, the sound of “Glow” couldn’t be more distinct. This suits Lou’s development as a songwriter, as she has allowed herself to open up and pour her “most personal feelings, experiences & realisations into it.” Just as the album art suggests, “Glow” represents an artist at her most vulnerable. A gorgeous and introspective exploration of the complexities of love, “Glow” leaves one thing clear: Alice Phoebe Lou is a force to be reckoned with.

Are you telling me a shrimp fried this…Cinnamon Toast Crunch? On March 22, Jensen Karp tweeted this picture with the caption “why are there shrimp tails in my cereal? (This is not a bit),” and within hours, whe Twitter-verse exploded. Karp is a producer, writer, actor, and podcaster who enjoyed a moderate amount of fame until this tweet went viral, sending him and his potentially problematic past into the public eye. He continued to document and publicly share his interactions with General Mills, the parent company of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
As the situation began to spiral into massive popularity, the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Twitter account eventually responded, arguing that what was depicted was just “an accumulation of the cinnamon sugar” and ensuring there was “no possibility of cross contamination with shrimp.” But by that point, Twitter had escalated into a frenzy, spurred on by a salvo of memes created by random Twitter users and comedians alike, including Karp himself.
As if things couldn’t get weirder, later in the day (yes, that same day) Karp shared a close-up picture of a few pieces of the cereal which had questionable black fragments baked into them. And even later, he shared a picture of a second but unopened bag of Cinnamon Toast Crunch in his house which seemed to contain dental floss.
This craze took over social media for the day, occupying the #1 trending spot on Twitter as more people became invested in both the situation, as well as the man behind it. It came as a surprise to some to learn that Karp is married to Danielle Fishel, an actress well-known for her role as Topanga Lawrence on the ‘90s sitcom “Boy Meets World.” Even weirder, almost exactly one year ago, Fishel tweeted out a sponsored ad for CoffeeMate’s Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavored creamer.
The abundance of jokes and memes were clever, but Shrimp Gate took a dark and unexpected turn when multiple women came out against Karp with allegations of emotional and sexual abuse. Melissa Stetten, a writer and model — who, incidentally, plays for a women’s recreational basketball team in LA called ‘Pistol Shrimps’ — was one of these women. In a Twitter thread on March 24, she called Karp a “manipulative gaslighting narcissistic ex-boyfriend” who aimed to “control and demean women.” Jumping off of Stetten’s tweet, Stephanie Mickus, a screenwriter, shared that she was told by Karp to “be careful or I would never work in this town again.” Such strong and horrific descriptions of abuse stunned most people following the situation — but Karp has not publicly acknowledged these accusations.
Cinnamon Toast Crunch put out a general public statement to say that they are still working with Karp to discern what exactly was in that box of cereal. In true viral fashion, the craze seems to have since died down; Indeed, the absurdity of this situation calls to mind some relevant discourse about whether we should retire the phrase “going viral,” especially with the connotation that word carries in the midst of a very real virus-driven pandemic.
In any case, the situation with Karp is a lot to unpack and full of strange twists and turns. One Twitter user put it perfectly: “A man named Karp married to a woman named Fishel found shrimp tails in a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The cereal was purchased from the Costco on Topanga Canyon Blvd, and his wife played Topanga in Boy Meets World. Meanwhile, Karp used to be a guest on Pistol Shrimp Podcast.” Good luck to future students trying to understand this from their history books.

Internet comedian Chris Fleming’s latest live show, “Through the Baleen,” begins with a 30-second still shot of the strange, car wash-like maw of a baleen whale, backed by cheerful synth organ and what sounds like an autotuned groan tube. This would be an unfavorable starting point for any other performer, but for Fleming, it’s just another day.
“Through the Baleen” is magnificently devoid of any context, much like most of Fleming’s work. At the beginning of the online show, he informs the audience he is in the belly of a whale, which seems to be a purple room with several fish skeletons tacked up in a decorative manner. Off to the side, there is a small raised platform on which an audience of realistic life-sized krill sculptures sit in beach chairs, ready for use in the BuzzFeed quiz-style segment “Which Krill Are You?”
Buckle up. It only gets stranger.
Fleming spends the first half of this one-hour show telling stories about things too odd to happen in the real world and talking with inanimate objects, most notably the camera-shy groundfish Rory and the eminently bitchy octopus Jennifer, a recovering addict. The former is played by a bumpy black dome with wooden balls for eyes, the latter by a surprisingly versatile head made from pink Styrofoam, a blonde wig, eyelashes out of Trixie Mattel’s nightmares, and one moving tentacle. Both are voiced by Fleming; Jennifer exclusively makes low burbling sounds but is subtitled for the audience’s convenience. That both of them seem to almost come to life under Fleming’s ministrations is a testament to his comedic virtuosity.
Fleming has a wonderfully malleable face, remarkable in its ability to twist into different characters. His awkwardness is so intense that it twists back around into confidence. And his assortment of giraffe-like limbs might be the funniest thing about him. Physical comedy is Fleming’s game: He effortlessly transforms into Fupi, a fedora-wearing robot from the conspicuously uncool city of Albany, for a bit that deserves every second of its three-minute airtime.
The second half of “Through the Baleen” is equally strange and just as charming. As the host of “Which Krill Are You?”, Fleming joins a Zoom call with individual audience members and chats with them for a few minutes before assigning them a krill counterpart from his more crustaceous audience. A personal favorite is the Blazer With Jeans Krill. Fleming elaborates: “The universal uniform of a man trying and failing to have an affair. You stay at a lot of Marriotts and would have many more successful affairs if you didn’t go to Supercuts every single day.”
But it’s during the short chats themselves when a different side of Fleming peeks through: a personable, almost ‘normal’ side. One of the great dangers –– and also the great benefits –– of audience participation is that sometimes the audience member is funnier than the comedian. Though Fleming is never really shown up, there’s a noticeable shift into a much more comfortable, laid-back style of comedy, which serves the participating audience member just as much as, if not more than, it does him. It’s a simple truth: Most of us are at our best with other people. Realizing this as you watch, you will probably start to feel quite lonely. Embrace that. We’re almost through.
For those familiar with Fleming’s web series “Gayle,” in which he plays the titular suburban house-master Gayle Waters-Waters, don’t expect his live show to hit quite the same notes of New England absurdity. For those unfamiliar with “Gayle,” watch it –– it’s one of the best things on the Internet. His songs, also posted to YouTube, warrant similar praise. Standouts include “W.U.G.,” a discursive meditation on Wildly Unlikeable Guys, and the strangely tuneful “Sick Jan,” starring Fleming’s H&R Block tax preparer. Fleming’s live persona, uncondensed by his typical fast-paced editing, can at times seem like a much more bizarre, extreme version of his YouTube persona.
That said, “Through the Baleen” is very much worth watching, especially if you’re looking for a specific sense of pleasant bafflement not unlike the feeling of being gifted a macaroni necklace by an adult coworker. Be ready to pay total attention and still feel like you’ve missed the first 10 seconds of every bit. Remember: It’s Chris Fleming. The confusion is half of the fun.

The formal and vaguely impersonal title of “The Father” — adapted from Florian Zeller’s French play of the same name “Le Père” — evokes a certain sense of cold detachment. Yet the poignant story that unfolds in Zeller’s directorial debut could not be further removed from this initial impression. With strikingly immersive storytelling, “The Father” forces its audience to assume the perspective of its protagonist, ensuring that they will feel anything but detached from his deeply emotive story.
The titular character Anthony, played by the inimitable Anthony Hopkins, is an aging father suffering from dementia. His doting daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) is determined to get him the care he needs even as he staunchly maintains that he can manage on his own. Dementia has been explored in film before — think of ”Still Alice” or “The Notebook” — but “The Father” distinguishes itself from these titles by foregoing an objective perspective and telling its story completely from the point of view of Anthony, who serves as an unreliable narrator. The audience is just as confused, shocked, or frustrated as Anthony is at any given moment, unable to separate the real from the imagined. This disorienting but powerful method of storytelling, coupled with Hopkins’s heart-wrenching performance, delivers a riveting and devastating portrait of loss — loss of memory, of reality, and of identity.
It’s difficult to establish anything that happens in the hour and a half runtime of “The Father” as definitively factual. In the beginning of the film, for example, Anne tells her father she needs to find a new full time caretaker for him because she’s moving to Paris with her boyfriend. When Anthony brings this up later in the film, she says, “No, Dad, why do you keep going on about Paris?” Contradictions like these are plentiful, and the viewer never knows which version of the truth to trust. The most jarring contradiction is when Anne suddenly appears as a new actress (Olivia Williams) not long into the film. This surprise is more than a little confusing, and that is exactly what makes it so effective; when Anthony doesn’t recognize his own daughter, the utter dismay he feels is shared by the audience. In moments like this, Hopkins leans into his character’s sorrow and bewilderment with staggering emotional weight.
Actors do switch in and out for certain characters, but for the most part, Olivia Colman remains in the film as Anne. Colman is tasked with portraying the myriad of conflicting emotions felt by someone whose loved one suffers from dementia. She is resistant to the idea of putting him in a nursing home, even though caring for him herself is an enormous undertaking. Especially in her character’s private moments, Colman lets the immense grief she feels rise to the surface, quiet tears and trembling hands reflecting her interiority. Most of all though, Colman’s portrayal of Anne is a touching testament to unconditional love — even when Anthony lashes out at her, her unbowing loyalty to him is palpable. Subtle gestures, like the way she smiles when he compliments her hair, or the way she reaches out to hold his hand after a doctor’s appointment, are enough to reveal how much she cares for her father.
“The Father” is also an affecting meditation on the importance of place and space. Simple and yet quietly haunting shots of Anthony’s apartment — which may or may not actually be his daughter’s apartment — are frequently shown throughout the film. Beautiful but empty rooms and hallways are framed with startling symmetry; we’re forced to closely observe everything, from the color of the walls to the placement of the furniture. The question of where this story actually takes place is never truly answered — Anthony is shown in one bedroom, then another, but he seems to have the same view outside his window in both rooms. His daughter says that he has moved in with her, but Anthony always believes he is in his own home. Even if one pays attention to his constantly shifting surroundings, the film’s setting remains ambiguous, another reminder of the way that dementia can alter perceptions of reality.
Rather than relying on physical space, the quotidian details of life seem to ground Anthony, and by proxy the audience, in a tangible reality. He frequently gazes out the window at a quaint street corner, where at one point a young boy plays alone with a plastic bag; he smiles at this. He often listens to opera CDs with headphones on, a reprieve from the overwhelming confusion of conversing with others. The French aria “Je Crois Entendre Encore,” is played multiple times throughout the film. The song includes the repetition of the lyrics “charmant souvenir,” which translates to “lovely memory,” a subtle reminder of the very thing Anthony is losing his grasp on. These understated yet powerful moments are some of the most poignant in the film.
“The Father” rarely strays outside the walls of an elegantly decorated London apartment. Yet without much action or many characters, the film commands its audience’s full attention, and it’s unsurprising that it’s been nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The touching and realistic father-daughter relationship between Anthony and Anne is showcased with careful nuance; it’s difficult not to overflow with empathy watching them together. At one point, in what seems like a brief period of lucidity, Anthony suddenly says to his daughter, “Thank you for everything.” The moment brims with tenderness, and then it’s over, all too quickly becoming a memory — a lovely memory.

Why am I crying to “The Climb“ right now? Who thought listening to this soundtrack while writing this elegy was a good idea?
“Hannah Montana” first aired on March 24, 2006, and this past week marked its 15th anniversary. The show aired in the wake of the success of “High School Musical”, and followed Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus) as she struggled to balance her life as a regular tween (and later, teen) with her popstar life as Hannah Montana. Jan. 16 was also the 10-year anniversary of the show’s finale, so 2021 has been quite the year for Hannah feels.
The “Hannah Montana” franchise included four TV seasons in five years, with 98 episodes, four soundtrack albums (including a special live concert movie), and “Hannah Montana: The Movie” (2009) — not to mention endless releases of clothes, video games, jewelry, and dolls. The show’s first episode was Disney’s highest-rated premiere at the time, with 5.4 million viewers. The most-watched episode, which featured the Jonas Brothers, garnered 10.7 million viewers.
I will admit to anyone who asks that I am not a dancer, but I watched “Hannah Montana: The Movie” so many times that I memorized the “Hoedown Throwdown“ choreography and then proudly showed it off at sleepaway camp the following summer. “Hoedown Throwdown” was also my alarm ringtone every morning for a year. I literally just listened to the song for the first time in years while writing this article, and I can still do the dance. This movie was everything to me.
Other bops that I used to finish my finals during our surprise-Zoom semester last spring include: ”Rock Star,” “Best of Both Worlds,“ “Nobody’s Perfect“ (those essays definitely were not), “Life’s What You Make It,” and “He Could Be The One,” which I sang dramatically as a kid despite not having a crush.
Although a comedy, at the heart of “Hannah Montanta” were resonant themes: the importance of friendship, staying true to yourself, and following your dreams. These themes may seem cheesy or trite now, but growing up, I really looked up to Miley and her friends.
As someone who struggled with bullying, seeing Miley and Lilly (Emily Osment) stand up to people at school and witnessing the strength of their friendship made a significant impact on me, even as an elementary schooler. I couldn’t put it into words then, but their friendship (as well as their friendship with Oliver, played by Mitchel Musso) helped my baby brain know what kinds of behaviors I should look for to determine if someone was really my friend. As someone who loved performing, I secretly wanted to be Hannah (who didn’t?). Now, I’m pursuing a career in the performing arts, which seems kind of inevitable now thinking about how attached I was to this show.
Hannah herself made an appearance on Twitter on March 24 for her 15-year anniversary, where she was showered with love by “Aunt” Dolly Parton, Selena Gomez, and of course, Miley Cyrus. Miley’s handwritten letter to Hannah received over 770,000 likes, so suffice it to say we were all missing Hannah.
What’s a better time than during a pandemic to return to our roots? Even though we’re stuck inside and isolated, life’s what you make it, so let’s make it rock.

Last week, Kylie Jenner sparked outrage after a simple post on her Instagram story asking her fans to donate to the GoFundMe of Samuel Rauda, a makeup artist Jenner has worked with in the past. She captioned the post with “May God watch over you and protect you… swipe up to visit his families’ GoFundMe.” Rauda was involved in a vehicle accident that resulted in serious head injuries and the GoFundMe was set up to pay for the surgeries he urgently needed.
At the time of Jenner’s posting, the campaign had a target of $60,000, and before sharing the link, Jenner donated $5,000. Considering Jenner’s wealth, the limited contribution was the subject of much controversy on Twitter.
There is some debate about the particulars of Jenner’s wealth: Forbes called her the youngest self-made billionaire ever in 2019 before retracting in 2020 and saying she was no longer a billionaire. Jenner contested this on Twitter however, slamming them by saying “I thought this was a reputable site.” Forbes has since put Jenner’s wealth at just under $900 million. Still, regardless of what level of uber-wealthy Jenner is, she has more money than nearly everyone will ever see in their lives.
But not only is Kylie Jenner impossibly wealthy — her entire brand is built on appearance and beauty. So for her makeup artist to be unable to afford emergency healthcare — given how much of Jenner’s livelihood relies on his skills — is shocking. Some have pointed out that Rauda is not Jenner’s regular makeup artist and that he actually only worked with her twice in 2015. Yet this criticism falls a little flat when someone of Jenner’s wealth publicly shared Rauda’s financial need and used their implied relationship to ask her fans to donate their money as well.
It is at least a sign of poor judgement that Jenner saw that someone she used to know was in need and responded by giving him what, to her, can be considered pocket change, before doubling-down by asking her significantly less well-off fans to deal with the rest.
Jenner has since responded to criticisms, explaining that she donated the $5,000 in order to get Rauda to his goal of $10,000, as $6,000 had already been raised. Unfortunately, this defense would only work if hadn’t publicized GoFundMe through a post she made on her own social media. If she had wanted to help out someone she used to know, then there was no need for her to share the story to her Instagram — where she asked her 223 million followers to donate too.
This course of action seems to be part of a greater trend of celebrities partaking in performative charity work, where they publicly give what may be a life-changing amount of money to a worthy cause and urge their fans to do the same, even though the money these celebrities so generously donated is nothing in relation to their income or is for their own benefit — like when Caitlin Jenner and Harry Redknapp were paid to promote an environmental charity. Charities do need awareness, and this is not a jab at celebrities genuinely trying to do some good. But when celebrities make a sponsored post or a cheap retweet urging their fans to donate to some worthy cause when they can’t be bothered to make a meaningful contribution themselves, the whole gesture rings hollow.
Debate about what Jenner should or shouldn’t have done is impossibly tied to the fact that this situation should never have happened. No one should have to rely on the generosity of strangers to avoid dying from completely treatable injuries or diseases. That makes it hard to evaluate the correct course of action in an awful situation that no one should have to deal with — though whatever that correct course of action would’ve been, it certainly isn’t what Jenner did.
Is Jenner personally responsible for the life of Rauda, a man she worked with a few times several years ago? Of course not. But whether her intentions were to show off publicly how great she was for sharing $5,000 or to pass the buck and asking her followers to give money because she couldn’t be bothered, Jenner involved herself in the situation and took on a level of responsibility. Her explanation that her original donation did reach the GoFundMe’s original goal keeps her actions from being completely hollow, but the whole situation is slimy nonetheless. As Rauda’s goal has now been raised to $120,000 and Jenner has not made any further contributions, it’s a reminder to the influencer that if you aren’t going to contribute a meaningful portion of your own wealth to this cause, maybe don’t tell everyone on the internet to do so.

When she took up the baton for “Waitress” in 2016, the then 24-year-old Madeline A. Smith ’14 became the youngest female conductor on Broadway. Today, Smith wears many hats in the musical theater world, from directing and conducting “Ragtime on Ellis Island” to adapting, arranging, and orchestrating a stage adaptation of Disney Channel’s “Descendants” for high school productions. Located in New York City, the music director, arranger, and conductor has taken advantage of a slower-paced arts industry during Covid-19 to reflect and try new things. “I recorded an album of a show that I worked on in 2019 and I finally learned how to cook,” she said with excitement. “I’m also doing a lot of yoga and keeping plants.” But just two years before carving her name into Broadway history, Smith was at Harvard, working on a joint Music and Classics senior thesis.
Prior to college, Smith trained as a classical pianist before falling in love with musical theater during high school. “When people say they’ve been bit by the theater bug, what they really found was a sense of unconditional community,” Smith said. Although she entered Harvard with a bit of an identity crisis over the worry she was “not really an actress,” she quickly realized that her music skills, especially her piano abilities, were in high demand in the on-campus theater community.
For her joint senior thesis, Smith developed an original musical translation of an ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides. Smith admitted to feeling like a “black sheep” at times: While her classmates were writing critical senior theses to launch careers in academia, she was preparing for her musical’s tech week. Nonetheless, she appreciated the support from both the Music and Classics departments while she developed this unique project. Asked whether the senior thesis had ever been performed, Smith said with a laugh, “No, oh my god. To this day, in my mind, I put it in a cabinet. But that could be fun one day, with my Broadway pals, to read the Greek tragedy.” Even so, Smith credits Harvard for her artistic development.
In particular, Smith appreciated that Harvard allowed her to explore her identity as both student and creative. She has remained plugged into the Harvard happenings, hoping to help current students find their own pathways into the arts. For two years after graduating, she served as the assistant director of the First-Year Arts Program, the pre-orientation program that she proctored as an undergraduate. She has continued to connect with students through the Office for the Arts, which frequently hosts events featuring her as a guest artist. As a recent graduate who has found her footing in Broadway, she wants to show students the realities of working in theater today. “I hope that whatever story or experience I have can be a little bit more accessible to students,” Smith said. “The theater industry is always changing, so it's sometimes better to listen to someone who is less fancy but more close to it.”
For Smith, a career in theater came via a snowball effect — from one freelance job to the next, then to a production, and eventually to the stages of Broadway. Over the years, Smith’s work has taken her all around the musical theater world: Broadway, off-Broadway, regional productions, adaptations, readings, concerts, and more.
Among all of her experiences, one memory of the night she conducted “Ragtime on Ellis Island” stays with her. Left alone on the island after accidentally missing the ferry to Manhattan, she remembers plopping down in the middle of the hall overcome with emotions. Up until even the day before, Smith and her colleagues, who were mostly young women, thought this performance was not going to happen due to prohibitive red tape and other obstacles. But this one-time, site-specific experiment had gone ahead against all odds. “I really think there was some magic in that night,” Smith said. “To sit in the team’s achievement was really formative, a real moment of ‘I might have a life in this. We did it and maybe we’ll do it again.’”
Smith was especially excited about “Ragtime” because it elevated many young women working on Broadway, where they have been chronically underrepresented. “What’s tricky about representation of all kinds in musical theater is that the most visible portion of the company is the cast, and so sometimes it seems like Broadway is more diverse across all dimensions,” she said. “I think that can be bad for female representation because there’s almost always female stars — all of the legends of Broadway are women — but that doesn’t always mean there’s representation in leadership, definitely not in where the money is coming from.” In fact, while there has been a much-needed push to increase racial and gender diversity among casts, white men still dominate behind the scenes.
Though musical theater is nowhere near gender equity yet, Smith believes progress is being made everyday, thanks to the foundational work of the first wave of female conductors, directors, and writers. “There were women before me who had it a lot worse,” Smith said. “There are ways that me and my generation will break down walls and glass ceilings but we’re not reinventing the wheel.” Smith wants to continue paving the path for future generations, just as the previous generation paved a path for her. “My role is to make [being a woman on a production team] a little more normal, a little more respectable, so hopefully for the next generation it won’t even be a thought,” she said.
Reflecting on her role in musical theater after the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic, Smith is even more committed to her efforts to invest in the future of Broadway: encouraging Harvard students to explore the arts, paving the way for the next generation of female directors and conductors, and now focusing her attention on new projects. Smith believes that story and music are crucial mechanisms to help people really see and hear each other, especially in such a divided time. Although she has already made her mark on Broadway, she wants to continue using her skills to invite people into conversations and build towards the future. Smith said with enthusiasm, “I’m ready to commit to the next generation of storytelling.”

As the recipient of the upcoming Cultural Rhythms Artist of the Year Award, presented by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, actress Taraji P. Henson (“Hidden Figures,” “Empire”) embodies this year’s Cultural Rhythms theme: “Acts of Healing: Speaking Truth and Sparking Joy.”
Henson hails proudly from southeast Washington D.C., which she describes as “the hood.” Henson grew up watching her parents work blue-collar jobs and having, herself, to fight for the means to get by. This, she said, is where she gets her hustle and drive.
“I just knew I wanted to build an empire, pun-intended,” Henson said in a phone conversation with The Crimson on March 26. “I watched my mom struggle — and my dad. I just didn’t want to do that. So I put myself through college. I was just a kid who was driven and had a mission.”
In 2018, Henson founded the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation whose mission is to eradicate the stigma surrounding mental health issues in the African-American community. Recognizing that African-Americans are the least likely group to seek mental health treatment in the United States, the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation — named after Henson’s father — works to open up dialogues on mental health and provide accessible mental health services to the Black community. In 2020, the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation began providing free virtual therapy groups to youth and young adults to help offset the stress and anxiety of navigating the Covid-19 pandemic.
The decision to start the foundation was born out of personal necessity: While struggling to find a therapist for her and her son — despite having the means to afford the best mental health care — Henson came to the realization that if she could not find a therapist, others must be having an even harder time.
“If I can't [find therapy], imagine the millions of people who can’t afford it or can’t find it! Where are they going to find it? Where are they going to go? That was when I was like ‘OK, I have to do something to help. I have to take this and run with it’,” said Henson. Recognizing her position as a trusted celebrity in the Black community, Henson hoped that if she shared her own struggles with mental health, it would open up conversations about the topic.
“I said, ‘I bet, if I share that I suffer, I hope that it rips the lid off and people feel comfortable’,” said Henson.
As an actress, producer, entrepreneur, mental health activist, mother, and much more, Henson has found her purpose(s) in the world. Asked about advice that she has for the young Black men and women who find her inspirational, Henson turned to the advice she received from her own father growing up: Pay attention to the people you are around.
“He would always say ‘get away from the people with your same problems and get to those with your solutions,’” she said.
“If I wanted to be an actress, I wasn’t going to find it at North Carolina A&T studying math or science,” said Henson, referring to her short time studying engineering. She’d been inspired by her close friend who was doing the same, but eventually transferred to Howard University, where she completed her BFA in Drama. “That’s not my solution. I’m not a scientist. I had to get around those who had my solution.”
Despite failing precalculus, Henson went on to act as a mathematician in “Hidden Figures” — an irony she recognizes and appreciates.
“They had a math coach come on. And he tried to teach me, and I said, ‘No, sweetie, no no I’ve been down that road before. My brain, no. When you start talking, you sound like the Peanuts teacher,’” said Henson, laughing the whole time.
Laughter is incredibly important to Henson. To her, mental health care is just one of the many important aspects of healing; finding laughter every day is another one. It’s how Henson makes sure she sparks joy — one of the themes of Cultural Rhythms this year — in her life.
“Every day, I laugh — even if it’s at myself,” said Henson. “You better find the humor in everything. You have to! And I’m an undercover comedian. I have great comedic timing. I could probably do comedy, but I was so good at the acting thing.”
Beyond laughter, the most important element of healing to Henson is the truth. “If you are living your truth, at every corner and at every waking, breathing moment, you are healing,” she said.
The word “truth” is tattooed on her left arm, and Henson fights for that truth every day. Knowing that she cannot act every day in her real life and at work, Henson makes sure to wake up every day and live her truth.
“If you are living your truth, you know you need therapy,” she said, laughing again. “If you are living your truth, and you’re real about it, then you are doing the work to heal yourself.”
Henson’s work at the intersection of mental health, social justice, and cultivating joy directly inspired this year’s Cultural Rhythms theme. The actress, activist, mother, and “undercover comedian” will be accepting The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ Artist of the Year Award, in partnership with the Office for the Arts at Harvard, on Thursday April 1. The Artist of the Year Ceremony and all other Cultural Rhythms events are open to all Harvard affiliates.

The Harvard Dance Center’s mission is to advance dance education in the Harvard arts community through equity, dignity, and transformation for all, and on March 18, it launched a series of artist-centered, artist-driven, and artist-led dialogues. The series explores how artistry, identity, and advocacy continue to intersect during such turbulent times. The first event was facilitated by the Center’s long-time dance educator and performer Nailah Randall-Bellinger. Other panelists included Joh Camara, Sunanda Narayanan, and Laura Rodriguez, who helped lead the event of over 60 people, sharing their perspectives and relating to each other’s insights on a new kind of online dance world. While the event was mainly focused on creating a conversation about the obstacles of navigating dance via Zoom, the underlying theme of the event also highlighted instructors’ and dancers’ efforts toward accessibility. The panelists also discussed how they have managed to teach and perform as the number of stages they work with has multiplied across the Internet, and how to approach racial equity in art through a digital lens.
At the beginning of the event, Jill Johnson, Director of the Dance Center, welcomed everyone and began by acknowledging the accessibility services and giving a land acknowledgment to those whose traditional lands she was on. Such remarks from the Center’s director set the tone for an event centered around respect, inclusivity, and appreciation of art.
The event raised several questions regarding artistry and maintaining resilience not just through the complications of Zoom but through the bounds of racial identity. The speakers asked: “In dissonant times, how can the emergent power of artists and their work help repair, heal, and inspire through multiple pandemics and into wider futures of equity, dignity, transformation for the arts, education, cities, and beyond?” This question sparked a broader discussion about the responsibility choreographers and artists have to convey certain messages that pertain to real-life-phenomenons to their audience; both the panelists and attending members had much to say in response.
Panelist Sunanda Narayanan is a South-Indian Classical dance instructor who has been with the center for five years and teaches a complex, ancient form of dance called “Bharatanatyam.” She described her transition from teaching dance in a live classroom to on Zoom as frightening at first, as dance had only been familiar in a physical sense, and she believed the space in which artists could evoke emotions had contracted. However, she went on to describe how quickly she and her students were able to adapt and create within the new realm they were in, using what was available to them. “It is useful having the ability to share a video and say ‘look at how we can interpret this dance from this youtube video.’ Suddenly, everything is a button away,” she said. She now appreciates the digital aspects of dancing, saying that they “spoil” her, and that she hopes to incorporate the advantages into future in-person learning.
Head facilitator Nailah Randall-Bellinger talked about the two pieces she choreographed that were displayed at the event, as well as her experience transitioning to choreographing over Zoom. Her first Piece “ #shesstillbreathing” was choreographed in person outdoors in the woods, with every participating dancer in a mask. “In the same way that Breonna Taylor was killed while she was sleeping, Black women are not seen as being a part of the human condition,” she said in speaking to the message behind the piece. “They don’t see our image, our beauty, our efforts, leading black women to self-loathe,” she said. In her second piece “Women’sWork,” which was, conversely, done through Zoom with four dancers, Nailah hoped to get a similar point across. “The piece was about how Black women, from day one, have been burdened by the job of having to constantly hold everyone up, whether that be socially, politically, or emotionally,” she said. “Women’s Work,” on a very dynamic level, portrayed the burden that Black women bear in always having to contemplate their next decision for the benefit of those around them.
If there was one takeaway that Randall-Bellinger left the audience with, it was that dance is, and will always be, relevant and necessary. “Artists are going to create regardless. Instead of shutting down because of the pandemic, nope, we now have to dance with the pandemic,” she concluded. No matter the obstacle or limitations, artists will produce art given whatever materials are graspable within a given time and space, so long as the experience they express in their art remains true. As the pandemic has forced us all to work outside of our comfort zones, artists are embracing the challenge of expanding inclusivity –– working within new barriers to break down others. As the Harvard Dance Center event emphasized, one of the biggest challenges of transitioning onto Zoom-dance has been discovering new ways to account for everyone’s varying abilities outside of the in-person studio. Yet, it soon became doable and is now the foundation of a new kind of digital art, as the panelists highlighted. This new online style pushes people beyond their usual experience of art by depicting the urgency of addressing artistic equity, and its unique advantages will forever have an impact on the dance world.
The next talks in the series will occur on Thursday, April 1st, and Friday, April 16th from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., and will be facilitated by other Dance Center teaching-artists such as Tarikh Campbell, as well as Director Johnson.

In an unsurprising move, TikTok star Addison Rae released her debut single “Obsessed” this month, a short song that highlights self-love and empowerment (though Rae herself asserts in her Rolling Stone interview that “it’s not as deep as people will think it is”).
If you’re feeling déjà vu, it’s not just you. Rae is following closely in the footsteps of Dixie D’Amelio, the world’s eighth-most followed TikToker, and actress Olivia Rodrigo, who released debut singles “Be Happy” and “drivers license,” respectively, in recent months. These songs, made by and for TikTokers, became instant hits, though these creators previously weren’t famous for music.
The influencer-to-singer pipeline is created by the confluence of two movements: entertainer despecialization and the rise of music production technology that can sell almost anyone as a pop star. As a new generation of influencers establish fame on TikTok, it’s only natural that they expand their careers into music, especially considering the app’s merger with Muscal.ly in 2017.
This phenomenon goes back further than TikTok. Tana Mongeau, famous for storytime videos on YouTube and Snapchat, released her debut single “Hefner”in 2017 as a fulfillment of her longtime wish of becoming a rapper. The song proved to be her most lasting contribution to the music world, though she releases a new single almost every year. Ex-Viner Jake Paul began his rap career in earnest with the comically awkward “It’s Everyday Bro” in 2017. Diss tracks gave way to more polished songs like “Fresh Outta London” and “23” in 2020. Paul’s output consists of about 20 singles, and through his music and boxing stints, he has diversified his influencer portfolio. Athletes like Kobe Bryant, Deion Sanders, and Shaquille O’Neal all released music during their careers with varying degrees of success. As did the premier influencer, Kim Kardashian, in “Jam (Turn It Up),” a song she said was her biggest regret and one that producer The-Dream said “wasn't about kicking off a singing career; it was us really having the power of TV and goofing off."
So, can anyone with enough money and fame pay to be a pop star?
10 years ago, that question came to the fore when Rebecca Black released “Friday,” a thoroughly vapid piece that raised questions about the state of the pop music industry. Her mother paid a music production company $4,000 for the song and accompanying music video. For a song poorly received by many, its paradoxical legacy as the best of the worst made Black a household name and fascinated the music world — all because of a vanity project (She and others released a 10-year anniversary hyperpop remix last month).
As the music industry continues to add more and more middlemen to its professional ranks — the average three-minute song on the pop charts now takes five writers, not counting producers, engineers, musicians, and their agents — the distance between the song and the singer widens. Already well on its way, songs may soon become completely commodified, produced by career songwriters and sold to singers, who release it under their own name. Though some lament the commercialization of music, it’s certainly not new. As soon as written music became secularized in the late middle ages, the wealthy could buy access to musicians and composers for their own entertainment. TikTokers’ debut singles are simply the most recent demonstrations of this system.
Singing is one of the easiest forms of music-making, and everyone has a song to sing. Some release their new album in the shower, and others have access to the music industry mainframe. Access to musical instruments and the tools of the music industry has always been unequal, and as long as there is fame in this world, the influencer-to-singer pipeline will continue to operate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Moxie,” one of the newest Netflix original movies, attempts to tell an inspiring feminist story, but the end product is yet another microagressive, white feminist narrative — and the whole time, viewers are watching the wrong main character.
“Moxie,” released on March 3, was produced and directed by Amy Poehler, and its screenplay is adapted from Jennifer Mathieu’s young adult novel of the same title. In “Moxie,” high school junior Vivan (Hadley Robinson) becomes aware of the rampant sexism at her school and, inspired by her mother’s rebellious past in the Riot Grrrl Movement, distributes an anonymous zine titled “MOXiE!” setting off a snowball of patriarchy-toppling events. Though the subject matter is topical, the movie falls painfully short in many ways. Ultimately, all of the smaller shortcomings can be traced back to “Moxie”’s central failure: Vivian should not be the main character. Her friend, Lucy, who is dynamic, unapologetically Afro-Latinx (and maybe even queer, too) should have been centered in the film.
“Moxie” is set against the backdrop of the Riot Grrrl Movement, a nationwide movement started in Olympia, Washington in the 1990s, to address sexism in the punk rock scene and create a space for punk rock girls. Vivian’s mother, Lisa, played by Poehler herself, and her friends, took part in the Grrrl movement. It is safe to assume they were all white. In the movie, Lisa admits to Vivian that their activism wasn’t intersectional enough, although this acknowledgement never comes up again later in the film.
A 2015 VICE article written by Gabby Bess explains that “the typical Riot Grrrl, as outlined in an infamous 1992 Newsweek article that defined the movement for the mainstream, was ‘young, white, suburban and middle class.’” Bess’s article was partially a response to NYU’s Riot Grrrl Collection, which holds only one zine by a Black woman, Ramdasha Bikceem. Bess says that “there were black women who imbibed with the spirit of punk in their bones outside the Riot Grrrl movement as well. These women carved their own feminist pathways into the hardcore scene, precisely because they were rendered invisible by the Riot Grrrl movement.” Most notably, punk musician Tamar-kali Brown founded the Sista Grrrl Movement, a series of wild punk-rock shows by and for Black women and girls.
If “Moxie” intended to atone for the exclusivity of the Riot Grrrl Movement, it failed. That is because the story centers around Vivian, a white, able-bodied, straight, cisgender girl that only becomes aware of the issues in her high school because of the harassment and injustice her peers face. “Moxie” should have been about Lucy exploring the legacies of the Sista Grrrls that came before her, such as Ramdasha Bikceem, Tamar-kali, Honeychild Coleman, and Maya Glick. To see Lucy interacting with the archives of Riot Grrrl and beginning to carve out a space at her hostile new school for Black and brown women and femmes to find community would have added nuance to “Moxie”’s otherwise subpar narrative.
Granted, such an initiative would mean rewriting practically every scene, replacing Poehler as director, and hiring Black writers and producers, but, this raises the question, why was this not done in the first place? Again, the movie sought to “correct” the wrongdoings and shortcomings of the Riot Grrrls, whose anti-Blackness and trans-exclusivity have tarnished the movement’s reputation. In that case, the movie should have focused on the intersections of racism and sexism instead of straying away from them and could have done so by foregrounding Lucy’s story.
There is no way to strive towards collective liberation if the leader is a white woman, and Vivian is no exception. This is especially true when nothing bad happens to her in the movie, and it seems she gets to discover injustice is actually real because of the lived traumas of her Black, Asian, disabled, and trans friends.
Now, “Moxie” does well in including these other marginalized identities where Riot Grrrls were often neglectful, but the film tries to take on too much. Representation for the sake of representation is useless when the nuances of these various misogyny-affected identities are not explored. Not once in the movie does Vivian critically engage with her own privilege as a white cis woman. It is equally appalling to think Poehler and her writers thought their job was done by using “intersectional” simply as a buzz word and throwing in minority characters whose complexities are never explored.
However, Vivian is not the problem: Instead, she is a symptom of white supremacy. It is important to bring “Moxie” into a larger conversation on white feminism. White misogyny-affected people still benefit from white supremacy, but many of them are reluctant to acknowledge their positions of power. This only perpetuates white supremacy.
White feminists also participate in a co-option and a violent erasure of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color’s (BIPOC) struggles within feminist spaces. It is ultimately Vivian who completes the final redeeming act — all by herself — and reveals herself as “MOXiE!”, giving no credit to Lucy or any of the other “MOXiE!” girls, only further cementing the white savior themes of the movie.
While the loose ends to Vivian’s advocacy are now neatly tied, the other “MOXiE!” girls continue to face oppression from all sides. In fact, in the background of Vivian’s reconciliation scene with her mother, best friend Claudia (Lauren Tsai), and boyfriend Seth (Nico Hiraga), Lucy is speaking to the crowd, but she has no audio. The camera, the editing, and the story, render Lucy dispensable. Silenced. Where is the feminist inspiration in that?
Some may take these points as too harsh, but the question remains: who is “Moxie” for? The most obvious answer is white women seeking validation for their “activism.” It is not for women of color; it is not for trans women; it is not for fat, disabled, or neurodivergent women. It is also likely not the last of the “white feminism” media genre, so be warned: “Moxie” is not liberation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walter S. Isaacson ’74 has long provided incisive and invaluable insights into the towering figures of human history –– Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs. Isaacson himself is a preeminent figure of our age –– not only an acclaimed biographer, he has also helmed Time Magazine, CNN, and the Aspen Institute. It is from this unique vantage point that Isaacson has approached our foremost innovators and innovations. In his most recent book, “The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race,” Isaacson spotlights Jennifer Doudna, the Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and co-developer of CRISPR. Doudna and her colleagues are at the core of what he terms the new revolution of our time –– the life sciences revolution.
The Harvard Crimson: What surprised you the most in researching and writing about Jennifer Doudna and the development of CRISPR?
Walter Isaacson: What surprised me is how pure curiosity about a basic, weird phenomenon in nature turned out to be so useful. This all began with a graduate student in Spain, people who worked for yogurt companies, and other scientists trying to figure out why there are these clustered, repeated sequences in the DNA of bacteria. Eventually, they discovered that it was a way that bacteria fight virus attacks, and how they adapt to each new wave of virus so they can defeat it. For obvious reasons, that turns out to be useful to understand as we get hit by wave after wave of pandemic... Most notably, Jennifer Doudna at Berkeley, as well as George Church at Harvard and Feng Zhang at MIT, were able to take this discovery about the CRISPR system and engineer it into a tool that will edit human DNA in an easy and precise manner. And that was followed by a brilliant guy at Harvard, David Liu, who has come up with even more powerful gene editing tools. Likewise, Feng Zhang and Jennifer Doudna are now turning this tool into a detection technology to create easy-to-use machines that will detect the coronavirus.
THC: I wonder what, in the first place, sparked your curiosity and prompted you to write about Jennifer Doudna and the development of CRISPR.
WI: We’ve seen three great innovation revolutions in modern times, and they’re based on the three fundamental particles of our existence: the atom, the bit, and the gene. The first great revolution was in the first half of the 20th century and came out of Einstein’s papers. That was a revolution in physics that led to everything from atomic bombs to space travel to semiconductors. The second great revolution was in the second half of the 20th century. It was based on the idea that all information can be encoded in binary digits known as bits and that we can manipulate them in circuits with on-off switches. This leads to the internet, the computer, the microchip –– the digital revolution. Around the year 2000, there’s the sequencing of the human genome, followed by the development of genetic engineering, recombinant DNA tools, and eventually a full understanding of the roles that RNA can play. With this, we've entered the third great innovation revolution of modern times. That's the life sciences revolution, in which molecules will be the new microchip. We’ll be able to program them as tools and technology. Having written about Einstein in the physics revolution, and having written about Steve Jobs, Ada Lovelace, and others in the digital revolution –– I wanted to write about this third revolution, the life sciences revolution. And Jennifer Doudna –– because of her early work on the structure of RNA, and then her work on CRISPR, and then her involvement in the moral and ethical discussions internationally about using gene editing –– seemed to be a great central character for a book that also has a colorful cast of players, including Emmanuelle Charpentier, George Church, and Feng Zhang.
THC: As a biographer, when you’ve consciously chosen to hone in on one life as the central pillar, how important is it to simultaneously expand your outlook beyond the individual?
WI: I wanted to show that innovation is a team sport, that creativity is a collaborative effort. I wanted to weave together both these colleagues with whom Jennifer works and the competitors who are racing her to make discoveries, because that's part of the excitement and the mix of science. I also wanted to show the difference that an individual can make –– especially one who is persistent and ambitious and focused. And so, like most biographies, you want to weave together the individual –– the importance an individual can make –– with the collaborative nature of scientific advance. So my book is, to some extent, a biography. But it is also a set of interwoven narratives about the heroes of this new life sciences revolution.
THC: You’ve spoken recently about slippery slopes and the potential for unintended consequences that CRISPR brings. Since you've studied innovation and technological change over many different periods –– including the current one –– do you think there’s an ideal way that we as a society should approach technological innovation and change?
WI: I think it’s important for all of us to think about technological and scientific innovation together, rather than flinch and say, we don’t understand how vaccines work, or we don’t understand how the internet works, or how social media works. I think it's important –– and this is what my book tries to do –– to demystify vaccine discoveries and techniques for editing genes… So, by trying to bring an average reader into the world of scientific discoveries, I hope I’m promoting the possibility of more people being involved in the discussion about using these technologies in an informed way, including whether or not we should make inheritable edits to the genes in our children.
THC: We’ve talked about certain traits in a Leonardo da Vinci or Jennifer Doudna –– curiosity, for example. These innovators also, either in life or in death, came to be seen as leaders in their fields. You yourself are a biographer, but you’ve also been a professor, editor, and CEO. If you could draw leadership lessons from this wealth of experience –– your own or that of others –– what would you take away? What would you like people who are reading your biographies to take away?
WI: I think it’s important to know how to connect things to something larger than yourself. People always tell students to follow your passion. Now, sometimes you need to think that it’s not just about your passion. When Jennifer Doudna had a passion, such as understanding nature, she connected it to something larger, which includes how we create tools that will help make us healthier. So I look at a biography of Jennifer Doudna and look at CRISPR as a way to share the joy of not only understanding how something works –– which is particularly exciting when that something is ourselves –– but also understanding how you can lead a life that is not just successful, but significant and useful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After much anticipation, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” was finally released on March 18 with a mammoth 242 minute runtime. After Snyder had to step down from production on the original “Justice League” film due to personal reasons and his replacement Joss Whedon abandoned much of the original vision amid allegations of mistreating the cast and crew, the existence of this cut of the film is certainly monumental. By greenlighting it, Warner Brothers Studios opens the door for a new market — for films much longer than theatrical releases with a different type of viewing experience on streaming platforms. Moreover, it is wonderful that a director has been given the opportunity to correct the changes and have his artistic vision honored. However, the end result feels drawn out, convoluted and repetitive — it screams vanity project rather than landmark superhero film.
Initially, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” was planned as a miniseries — an idea that definitely should not have been dropped. The bloated runtime reads as a misguided attempt to compete with another film with a massive runtime: “Avengers: Endgame.” Even though “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” is split into seven parts, they all lack substance. Almost none of them could have stood as a compelling episode in a miniseries, and the film deeply suffers from the lack of structure. In fact, the plot doesn’t really pick up until part four. The film’s pacing is extremely gratuitous: pretty much every scene opens with unnecessarily long shots of characters walking, waiting, or stoically breathing. While the return of composer Tom Holkenborgmeant resulted in a score that had its moments — such as the resurgence of the theme from “Man of Steel” and the new leitmotifs for each of the main heroes — it was overshadowed by how very, very hard Synder was trying to be artsy and melodramatic, resulting in a first half that is practically painful to watch.
Unfortunately, the extended runtime is not put to good use for the titular team either. The film does away with the “team falls apart” trope found in basically every other superhero team up movie, a refreshing departure, but one that robs it of any driving conflict. The relationships between the characters are superficial and bland. There are contrived moments of tension that immediately fizzle out, while the team doesn’t have enough camaraderie to justify their other chummier moments. The extended runtime results in long-winded descriptions of a conflict for each character that is dragged to a sloppy conclusion by the end.
However, in an improvement from the previous “Justice League,” “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” explores the theme of fatherhood: what it means to be a good father or a bad one, a father’s impact on his child, and what a father should want to be. In a film that takes a long time to say very little, this motif helps unify several character journeys and the conflict in one of the more successful aspects of the film.
Considering the massive budget allotted to “Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” the CGI is disappointing at times, with conspicuously wooden or plastic-looking special effects. Unlike other entries in the D.C. Extended Universe, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” is R-Rated. With a couple of exceptions, the action stays fairly tame, though it is engaging enough. The larger issue is some unjustified extended fight sequences — including a long altercation in Themyscira that, while satisfactory, is rendered underwhelming by the fact that the viewer doesn’t know who the Amazon characters are, their relationships to one another, or their abilities. This is an issue that recurs repeatedly with the set-up and backstory for the first two hours.
This lack of clarity becomes a glaring issue again with Superman’s resurrection, as it’s difficult for the viewer to have any understanding of how powerful the characters are, especially in comparison to others in the series. Fight scenes are most exciting when the relative abilities and how they can clash are known — “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” did not understand this. Superman (Henry Cavill) is an overpowered god who can beat anyone with ease, and while his resurrection scene and fight with the rest of the Justice League is certainly a cool watch, it ruins any future dramatic tension. It’s also boring that he’s in such a different league from all the other superheroes. If Superman can move as quickly as the Flash, then why does Barry Allen need to exist? And given that Wonder Woman literally calls herself a god in 2017’s “Wonder Woman,” it’s weird that she can’t go toe-to-toe with a random alien. Considering audiences haven’t seen much to endear them to the other characters, this issue makes them all seem dangerously irrelevant.
By the end of the movie, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” is more interested in teasing upcoming DCEU projects than coming to a satisfying ending. While the villain Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) now has a better motivation than “be evil,” it’s so poorly explained that the promising change falls flat. Instead of being a credible opposition to the Justice League, he’s a vehicle to introduce the viewer to future villains. This shameless use of the movie as promotion results in an epilogue that is so confusing and disconnected that it feels more like a Comic-Con teaser than the conclusion to a blockbuster.
On balance, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” is an improvement on 2017’s “Justice League” — but only just. The plot had leagues more potential and so many nice, emotional moments that it’s doubly disappointing how drawn out and self-congratulatory the rest of the movie is. There are few better arguments for the merits of editing than this entire movie. Sometimes, too much is just too much.
Hopefully DC can keep learning from its mistakes, and the next installment can be more than a marginal improvement from the last.

In “Cherry,” the Russo brothers’ recent directorial effort starring Tom Holland, the audience gets a glimpse into the life of a man plagued by feelings of predestination and caught deep in the throes of PTSD. We follow Tom Holland’s character — who is never given a real name and is credited only as Cherry — from his brief time at college, through a tour in Iraq, and then as he grapples with PTSD, addiction, and a life of crime. This film never shies away from the raw, messy parts of its protagonist’s life. Not for the faint of heart, “Cherry” is at times a grotesque psychological drama and at others a romanticized look at the struggles that may befall any person.
“Cherry” begins with what will come to be the end of the film: Cherry heading into another bold bank robbery. In the narration that begins the film, the main character admits as a 23-year-old adult that he doesn’t understand what motivates people to do what they do. In a world where he can’t quite make sense of anything, even his own existence, Cherry feels disenfranchised by and alienated from society. The voiceover, a brief glimpse straight into the psyche of an already struggling man, is an eloquent example of the yearning for purpose that the remainder of the film explores.
As one of seven sections of the movie, the prologue shows the main character, made haggard by addiction but somehow still cracking jokes, attempting to rob a bank. In cutaways, he jokes with the audience about how most bank tellers are ladies, so it’s important to be nice, and that the key to a good robbery is confidence because most tellers don’t care. At first, it would seem that “Cherry” might touch on some heavy subjects but skirt around them carefully. It quickly becomes clear that this is far from the case. The following two sections of the movie follow Holland as he meets his girlfriend Emily (Ciara Bravo) in college and subsequently joins the army after thinking she was breaking up with him. She ends up waiting for him those two years, only to reunite with a man scarred by war. The remainder of the movie follows them as they both spiral due to his PTSD and eventually fall into addiction, living hit to hit on heroin.
What helps to distinguish “Cherry” from other crime films is its two outstanding directors: The brothers Joe and Anthony Russo. These men are most notably known for their wild success with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having directed a plethora of “Captain America” and “Avengers” movies. However, they have also found a modicum of success with more straightforward thrillers like Netflix’s “Extraction” and “21 Bridges”. Having often cast actors they’re familiar with from the MCU — Chris Hemsworth in “Extraction” and Chadwick Boseman in “21 Bridges” — the choice of Spiderman's actor Tom Holland as the lead in “Cherry” is unsurprising. Breaking out from his usual good-guy role, Holland adds a surprising amount of depth to his character with incredibly intimate acting. From his scenes in the classroom to those on the battlefield as an Army medic, Holland’s charisma shines brightly through the screen. It’s hard to watch this film and not sympathize with his heartbreaking tale.
At its core, “Cherry” is truly a story of addiction — opioid addiction — in Cleveland, where the Russo brothers make it clear that it’s a serious issue. When Xanax no longer helps Cherry with his mental and physical anguish, a doctor prescribes him oxycontin. As Cherry continues to unravel due to his untreated PTSD and Emily succumbs to the chaos of their situation, they both fall into addiction. Cherry quickly loses his money, and he and Emily turn to heroin.
In a horrifyingly accurate portrayal of how this type of addiction unfolds, “Cherry” fails to provide a meaningful solution for either character. Emily, after a close call with death during an overdose, attends rehab; but as soon as she leaves, she immediately craves another high. Cherry ultimately only finds solace by turning himself in after his last heist. It takes 20 years in jail, convulsing on the ground while throwing up blood, and a consistent clean environment to finally break the bonds of addiction. There’s no further message about how to meaningfully escape the bonds of addiction without falling into a flawed criminal justice system.
Throughout “Cherry,” the cinematography stands out as a carefully-crafted way to elucidate the characters’ wide range of emotions. The use of a fish-eye lens to distort the sense of reality when Cherry first gets high on oxytocin leads to the continued sense of distortion throughout the rest of the film; it establishes the disconcerting mood during the subsequent heroin scenes. During the film’s last third as Emily and Cherry struggle with their addiction, the cinematography is notably less agile, artistic, and engaging. Purposefully, the movie focuses all of its energy on these raw, intense scenes, as the couple shoots up and struggles to simply exist.
As a drama, “Cherry” easily engrosses its audience and makes its two-hour-plus runtime fly by. Although lacking a deeper meaning at times, the film does shed light on the silent pandemic that has been ravaging much of the United States for decades. Tom Holland excels in the titular role and has clearly made bounds as a rising Hollywood star, just as capable of donning the superhero mask as taking on any other role that may open up for him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten people were killed in Boulder, Colo. last week.
Eight people were killed in Atlanta, Ga. the week before.
These 18 people were attending to their normal activities: working to provide for their families, buying groceries and maybe favorite candies for their little ones. Behind those 18 names were lives filled with excitement, heartbreak, and happiness. Yet, in a matter of seconds, these lives were taken as rounds hit the floor.
Until April 1, Colorado flags will rest at half-staff. As usual, powerful politicians offered thoughts and prayers to the victims of these attacks. I am glad these politicians pray for change and for those who are hurting; I pray too. But these politicians have a power to answer these prayers that I do not have. They have the power to make immediate change. As people of faith, they should know that God does not give us patience or strength, He gives us opportunities to become patient and strong. God does not immediately relieve these shootings, He gives us opportunities to stop these shootings. Yet, as these opportunities are presented, conservative politicians deny them and place lives at risk.
This past week, we are again reminded of the detrimental shortcomings of conservative policy. On March 12, the National Rifle Association blocked an assault rifles ban that likely would have barred the Colorado shooter from purchasing the gun he used to commit a massacre.
To connect a few dots, people are dead because of the NRA.
There are common-sense laws that need to be passed without the corrupt and insidious NRA interference. Many Americans support universal background checks and the elimination of military-grade weapons. Gun policies can’t be determined by special interest groups, but must match the cries of Americans who experience the deadly repercussions. Politicians need to listen to the people. We cannot risk any more American lives for a minority’s deluded belief that owning an assault rifle is part of being a true American.
This facade of an American identity becomes even more apparent as conservatives prioritize their political gains above saving lives. Hours after the Colorado shooting, Representative Lauren O. Boebert’s (R-Colo.) campaign sent out the following pro-gun propaganda:
“I Told Beto ‘Hell No’ when he tried to take my guns. Now I am in Congress to tell Joe Biden the same.”
Before she begins her crusade against gun control, I would ask Representative Boebert to speak to the families of Eric Talley, Rikki Olds, Kevin Mahoney, Lynn Murray, Denny Stong, Teri Leiker, Tralona Bartkowiak, Jody Waters, Neven Stanisic, and Suzanne Fountain, who lost their lives in the state she represents.
These family members, and countless others, deserve an explanation of why someone’s right to a gun was more important than their loved one’s right to live.
Equally horrifying is the contrast between the treatment of this shooter and Elijah J. McClain, a young Black man who was murdered by police in 2019 in the very same state. The fair-skinned Colorado shooter was taken in with only a minor leg injury after his actions took ten lives. McClain was walking home when he was stopped by cops, put into a carotid hold and injected with ketamine. So what was McClain’s horrendous crime: the crime that elicited worse treatment than a mass shooter in cities than an hour away? He simply “looked sketchy.” This was not an isolated incident. George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Stephon Clark, and many more were killed not because of a crime committed but because of the color of their skin. We assume police can protect us from shootings, yet simultaneously, they are perpetuating violence against people of color.
Many, if not all, of my Harvard classmates have seen mass shootings and police violence dominate headlines throughout their lives. We’ve practiced our own school shooter drills, praying that our school won’t be next. However, as our trauma has accumulated, politics has demonstrated that the right to own guns apparently surpasses our right to live.
No longer can we endure these massacres. We must demand our representatives ignore the NRA’s corrupt interests and fight for our lives. We must pressure them to intervene against the long-standing discrimination and racism within U.S. policing. Decades of inaction show that change must start with us, the generation that has never known a time without mass shootings.
Do I want to completely ban guns in America? Do I want these white shooters to be abused by police while being taken into custody? No, we don’t need a complete ban on guns, and certainly don’t need more police violence. We need gun laws to adapt to the development of dangerous weapons. We need to stop the continuous cycle of shootings that we have all become accustomed to.
Until then, Colorado, don’t raise the half-staffed flag a damn inch. We’d be disrespecting the country of equality, freedom, and happiness that the United States stands for.

Peer review, which can be traced back to the 18th century, originated as a publicity stunt. The Royal Society of London began a tradition of having well-known scientists write reports on new scientific manuscripts to increase the visibility of science.
It was only in the 20th century that peer reviewers alongside editors were imagined as scientific gatekeepers “to ensure the integrity of the scientific literature as a whole,” as Harvard History of Science professor Alex Csiszar wrote in a commentary in Nature.
Peer review became a more standardized, formalized journal practice after World War II. Since then, most journals follow a similar practice: When a researcher submits a paper for publication, journal editors bring in peer reviewers to evaluate the paper’s quality, suitability for their journal, and importance.
As Jack Szostak, Harvard professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Genetics and winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, told me in an interview, some reviewers do give constructive suggestions.
“There've definitely been times when reviewers pointed out a mistake that we made in interpreting the data or things like that,” Szostak said. “That's really the ideal.”
But oftentimes, peer review, a process that can take months, doesn’t align with the ideal of improving conclusions — or misses it altogether.
Problematically, peer review assumes a veil of objectivity and expertise when it is an incredibly subjective process. Reviewers inevitably have overt or unconscious biases towards the institution, methods, or even individual researchers of the publication they’re reviewing. Additionally, because reviewers must have a certain level of authority in the subject, their work is often in direct competition with what’s presented in these potential publications. In some specialized fields, only a handful of researchers — and by extension, reviewers — are available, most of whom are familiar with each others’ work.
Even more insidiously, peer review actually holds back scientific progress in two crucial ways. Firstly, it enables faulty studies to parade an illusion of authority, like the now-retracted fraudulent claim published in The Lancet in 1998 that linked the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine with autism. Secondly, peer review can actually suppress conclusions that shift scientific paradigms, discouraging those who question or bring up evidence against prevailing theories.
“The hardest things to get published are things that are really new and that go against the accepted wisdom in a field, and if you're contradicting what everybody thinks they know,” Szostak said.
It is hard to imagine most classic earth-shaking theories, for example, passing the threshold of peer review. Galileo’s and Einstein’s contemporaries all mounted harsh resistance to their novel theories, and would have likely prevented publication of heliocentric or relativistic theories, respectively. Maxwell’s famous kinetic theory of gases were anticipated and submitted for publication by another scientist over a decade before James Maxwell popularized them in a paper rejected by a “referee” in 1845. Such ideas would all be lost in today’s “publish or perish” culture where not publishing in top journals can severely jeopardize scientific careers.
“I mean, how many great ideas do we not know about because of a reviewer that was super nasty to someone, or how many scientists have decided to quit science because of a review that was super nasty?” Demba Ba, associate professor of electrical engineering and bioengineering at Harvard, said in an interview
While there is no perfect solution that can allow dominant existing ideologies to accurately judge new ones, some adjustments to peer review can ensure it’s more productive, such as more defined assessment metrics and training for reviewers. In a survey by Elsevier and Sense about Science in 2019, 66 percent of surveyed scientists “felt reviewers would benefit from clearer guidance on reviewing criteria.”Greater transparency is also needed, such as through public reviews with reviewers’ names. Additionally, many journals are moving towards “double-blind review,” which preserves the anonymity of the reviewer and the author. It’s not foolproof, however, because authors are recognizable from their body of work in the subject matter, citations, or writing style.
Ba is on the Board of Reviewing Editors for the journal eLife, where reviewers and editors collaborate to write their reviews, which are then published alongside accepted papers. eLife and other journals are experimenting with varying methods of peer review in an attempt to move away from the hypercompetitive yet ineffective publication process.
There’s been growing use of preprint servers like arXiv and bioRxiv, where scientists can upload papers that are not yet published or have already been rejected by peer review. At such forums, scientists can share conclusions and debate results without the gatekeeping of peer reviewers. It’s evolution in real-time.
“People can see it, people can write comments. They can write criticisms that can give you ideas for how to make a stronger case for whatever you're proposing,” Szostak said about preprint servers. “So even if a paper doesn't get accepted in some fancy journal because it's a really groundbreaking new finding, at least it's out there, and people can see it and they can judge for themselves.”
When introduced in the early 1800s, some claimed peer reviewers “used the cover of anonymity to advance their personal interests — perhaps through undetectable acts of piracy — at the expense of helpless authors,” as Csiszar puts it. Since then, peer review has changed, both in practice and in principle. While worthwhile adjustments can and should continue to be made, peer review ultimately continues to be a paradox, a seemingly necessary evil. In this way, peer review, like science, is a work in progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The preceptor system is here to stay, which is to say that preceptors themselves will continue to be shown the door. An optimistic committee review on the role of preceptors and senior preceptors within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has reaffirmed the appointment cap system, under which all but higher-up senior preceptors are hired with a set time cap. When this expires, irrespective of their performance, they must leave. While the cap system has some logistical merits, the review hints at a broader problem in terms of how our institution engages with its non-tenure-track teaching staff. Preceptors aren’t disposable, and they shouldn’t be treated as such.
Harvard preceptors were unsurprisingly disappointed by the latest review process and its results. This tracks: The inquiry into their field of work irrationally excluded them all. Not only did the review committee contain no preceptors, senior or otherwise, but it also failed to hold any live consultations with preceptors after a planned in-person meeting was canceled last year amidst (understandable) Covid-19 concerns. The meager substitute our university offered — an online survey — does no justice to the discourse needed on how Harvard’s teaching faculty are treated, amidst concerns voiced by students and non-ladder faculty more broadly.
This complete lack of direct input is both troubling and indicative of our institution’s attitude towards preceptors themselves. We agree with Expository Writing preceptor Margaret Doherty’s assessment that the review seems to dismiss preceptors as nothing more than “just teachers” — temporary and easily replaceable. This outlook, which creates a hierarchy between shades of teachers, is colored with an unfortunate and ironic disdain for prioritizing instruction; a condescending and inaccurate depiction of how instruction, research, and writing interweave in academia that distinguishes between “true” scholarship and teaching.
Yet the notion that knowledge production and dissemination are separate fields stands starkly opposed to Harvard’s own presumed mission as a higher education institution. In this specific case, it’s also borderline absurd: Preceptors and other non-ladder faculty are “the bedrock” of many of our teaching programs, and deserve admiration for their crucial work. Failing to include their voices in a study of their own line of work is as counterproductive as it is disrespectful.
So the University should, and probably could, have managed a more thorough, inclusive review. But does that mean that its findings on the necessity of time caps are entirely wrong? Is our entire preceptor system kaput?
Not quite.
Despite the disappointing way the review regards preceptors, we too find good reasons for the appointment cap to stay. Preceptors are often newly minted Ph.D.s or rising graduate students who are paid to teach as they advance their careers and seek larger and more secure roles in academia. The position is largely transitional; an ephemeral post that must remain open to future doctoral graduates and young intellectuals seeking to develop their skills and fatten their resume. Successful preceptors are expected to spread their wings elsewhere and vacate their positions for newcomers, allowing the next generation of academics to emerge. Allowing un-capped preceptorships would break a virtuous cycle of renewal, limiting the already scarce paths to a career in higher education.
That doesn’t mean we don’t value preceptor-led classes, or the uncharted paths they can explore. In fact, we find many preceptor-taught courses innovative in their pedagogy and refreshing in coverage; popular and stimulating enough to merit outliving their original instructors. Such courses should be handed off to new, ambitious preceptors who can help preserve their educational value, without stifling access to entry-level university positions.
This transitional dynamic, however, must be bidirectional. If the role of a preceptor is but a stepping stone in a broader academic career, our university must provide the means for our budding professionals to fully develop, as well as an acknowledgment of and respect for their work. In the short run, Harvard should strengthen the resources dedicated to professional development for preceptors and expand its programs from the limited capabilities of Harvard's Derek Bok Center for Teaching & Learning, which the review highlighted as their sole source of career support. Particularly this year, amidst the ongoing pandemic and subsequent academic hiring freezes, the University should prioritize making sure that preceptors can realistically achieve their career goals within their capped appointment times. If we want the broader benefits of constantly attracting new scholastic talent, we must protect the future of those we regularly force out of our ranks.
Almost every undergraduate at Harvard will be taught or shaped by a preceptor at some point or another. These teachers — for they are, in the best sense of the word, our dutiful teachers — play just as important a role in our Harvard education as Harvard itself plays in the development of their careers. It’s about time we start acknowledging them.

The Harvard Institute of Politics announced the formation of the “Conservative Coalition” — a hub for students at the College to develop their political identities and “advocate for IOP-wide conservative representation” — in an email to affiliates March 4.
Grace K. Bannister ’21, one of the coalition’s student representatives, wrote in an emailed statement that it was formed in response to concerns from conservative members of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee about the lack of “any institutionalized conservative voice in the planning process” of its programming, and how that was “reflected in the programming itself.”
“The IOP had become limited insofar as all of its staff are politically left of center,” she wrote. “Whenever right-of-center ideas were discussed, it seemed to be through the lens of helping our left-of-center peers understand them, rather than discussing ideas as they are.”
Bannister wrote that “lack of conservative thought” in the IOP led to “repetitive and hollow attempts at discussing conservatism,” citing events on the “Future of the Republican Party” and “Future of Conservatism.”
“It’s a limited conversation that had become one of the only forms of engaging conservatives at the IOP,” she wrote. “The Coalition was formed as an attempt to help the IOP step beyond this lens of engaging conservatives as ‘the other’ and create an institutionalized conservative thought partner to help IOP leadership craft thoughtful and engaging programming.”
Bannister added that “staff and student leadership were with us every step of the way in the formation of this project.”
IOP President Menatallah “Menat” N. Bahnasy ’22 wrote in an emailed statement that the Conservative Coalition is a “unique opportunity for our community members to learn from one another and build ideas together.”
“The IOP, like any institution, can always improve, grow, and become better,” she wrote. “When several of our student leaders shared the need for more conservative representation and thought, student and staff leadership quickly supported them in building strategies and ultimately the Coalition.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote in an emailed statement that the IOP “has a longstanding commitment and history to encourage and enable diverse opinions to be heard.”
“From Resident Fellows to Forum guests and in our nonpartisan programming, we seek to ensure that our community engages in open discussion of a broad range of perspectives and ideas across the ideological spectrum,” Gearan wrote. “The IOP staff has worked closely with student leaders of the Conservative Coalition to organize this effort and we look forward to the work ahead.”
The coalition, which plans to meet biweekly, held its launch event on March 11 — a panel entitled “Conservatism in Higher Ed” featuring Alice Stewart, a member of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee, and Stephen P. Rosen, a Government professor.
Bahnasy wrote that she and other student leaders “remain committed” to ensuring that all students “feel included and are at the table” in the IOP.
“I am confident that the Coalition will be valuable to the IOP — it fills a need that students have felt for a long time, and has already brought new students and ideas to the forefront of our community,” Bahnasy wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighty percent of surveyed members of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences said FAS does not have a healthy level of BIPOC representation within its ranks, including 50 percent of respondents who strongly disagreed that the faculty is sufficiently diverse.
Additionally, 65 percent of survey respondents said the FAS does not have a healthy level of female representation within its ranks, including 26 percent who strongly felt that way.
The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,100 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard’s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, challenges they face as academics, and pressing issues on campus — including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.
The 94-question survey obtained more than 300 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 26 to March 5. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first and second installments of The Crimson’s 2021 faculty survey series explored faculty perspectives on the University’s tenure procedures and Harvard’s response to divestment movements on campus, respectively. This third installment examines how faculty view Harvard’s climate and culture, as well as Title IX issues within the FAS.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment for this story.
The ranks of Harvard’s FAS have grown more diverse in both gender and race over the past decade. According to the latest report from the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, 15 percent of appointments to both tenure-track and tenured positions made between 2017 and 2021 have been underrepresented minorities.
In comparison, just 10 percent of tenure-track faculty appointed between 2007 to 2011, as well as 10 percent of tenured faculty appointed during that period, identified as underrepresented minorities.
Harvard defines underrepresented minorities as faculty who self-identify as Latino, Black or African American, Native American or Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.
Despite Harvard’s progress in new appointments, the faculty at large remains largely white. Eight percent of tenured faculty and 13 percent of tenure-track faculty today identify as underrepresented minorities, compared to five percent and 11 percent in 2007, respectively.
In response to The Crimson’s survey, 50 percent of surveyed faculty strongly disagreed that Harvard has a healthy level of BIPOC representation within the FAS. Another 30 percent of respondents somewhat disagreed. Just seven percent of survey-takers agreed that the FAS had healthy BIPOC representation.
Sixty-five percent of respondents disagreed that Harvard has a healthy level of female representation within the FAS. However, opinions differed based on respondents’ gender identity.
Male-identifying respondents were more likely — 31 percent versus 17 percent — than female-identifying respondents to believe that the FAS currently has a healthy level of female representation. On the other hand, 17 percent of male-identifying survey-takers and 39 percent of female-identifying survey-takers strongly feel the FAS does have adequate gender parity.
In the current academic year, 42 percent of tenure-track and 28 percent of tenured faculty identified as female, according to the FAS report. A decade ago, in 2011, 37 percent and 22 percent of tenure-track and tenured faculty, respectively, identified as female.
During a faculty meeting earlier this month, FAS Dean Claudine Gay reaffirmed FAS’s commitment to a diverse faculty while also acknowledging the slow nature of institutional change. She emphasized that while the diversity statistics have indicated some growth in Harvard’s recruitment and promotion of faculty of color, there is still room to improve in creating an academic environment where these faculty “can thrive.”
Gay added that, especially following the recent tenure controversy regarding Cornel R. West ’74, she and other Harvard faculty have been asked “whether Black scholars can succeed at Harvard,” which she described as “a legitimate question to ask of a University as old as ours, with a past represented rather instructively by the portraits on the walls of our Faculty Room.”
“Harvard as a place where Black scholars can succeed is what we are committed to as an institution. It’s the future we need and are striving to build, and getting there has my full attention,” Gay said. “I will be the first to admit to sometimes feeling frustrated by the slow pace, but I also know that change that lasts takes time to create.”
Harvard’s efforts to prevent sexual harassment have come under scrutiny in recent years, with several prominent faculty being accused of sexual misconduct towards students or colleagues.
The survey results underscored that harassment remains a prevalent problem in the FAS, despite the school’s efforts to address climate and culture issues. A little more than a quarter of survey respondents said they know someone in their department who has experienced sexual harassment, though responses differed based on respondents’ disciplines.
Thirteen percent of respondents from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences said they knew of someone in their department who had experienced sexual harassment, compared to 18 percent in the Arts and Humanities, 30 percent in the Social Sciences, and 38 percent in the Sciences.
In February, an external review committee found that decentralized sexual- and gender-based harassment resources at Harvard — among many other factors — prevented the University from effectively censuring Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez despite sexual harassment claims spanning four decades.
In the wake of the report, Harvard announced last week that the University’s Title IX Office and Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response would be consolidated into a new Office for Gender Equity managed by the University administration.
A majority of survey respondents — 60 percent — said they believe the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board, should revoke the tenure of faculty members who are found guilty of sexual misconduct by the Office for Dispute Resolution. Thirty-one percent strongly agreed.
While the FAS Dean can sanction a faculty member for violating the sexual harassment policies, including by revoking his or her emeritus status, only the Corporation can revoke tenure altogether, a move not seen for several decades.
Faculty respondents held varying levels of comfort in approaching the FAS Office for Faculty Affairs — which supports faculty in their workplace issues — with concerns. A little more than a third of respondents overall indicated they held qualms about approaching Faculty Affairs, and 44 percent of female-identifying respondents said they were somewhat or strongly uncomfortable with doing so.
In comparison, just 23 percent of male-identifying respondents indicated any discomfort going to Faculty Affairs.
For its 2021 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 26 to March 5, 2021. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in February 2021 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
Of those faculty, 315 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 309 participants answered at least one question, while 235 participants completed every question in the survey.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents, 38 percent identified themselves as women and 19 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2020 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 32 percent and 25 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
According to the report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty — a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. Similarly, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 106 — or 9 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 6 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City Council marked the beginning of its Monday meeting with a moment of silence for Xavier Louis-Jacques, a 19-year-old Cambridge resident who was fatally shot Saturday morning near the Rindge baseball field and basketball courts.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said he has been “struggling” with the shooting all weekend.
“This issue is very personal to me, this young man went to school with my son,” he said. “This could’ve been my son, and that’s just really deeply painful to realize.”
He also pointed out how these tragedies do not seem to be going away.
“The fact that these types of tragedies continue to happen in our city over and over again, and that we’re just not resolving the root causes, is deeply troubling,” he said.
The council unanimously adopted a resolution to go on the record in formally “expressing its deepest condolences'' to Louis-Jacques’ family. Councilors also passed a policy order to schedule a “Safe Streets, Safe City” meeting as quickly as possible.
The initiative, which convenes the Cambridge Police Department and other city leaders, will work to combat and prevent violence in Cambridge, especially during the warmer months when incidents of violence tend to increase.
Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob also delivered the weekly Covid-19 pandemic response update to the council at the meeting.
Similar to Massachusetts as a whole, the city is experiencing a spike in cases driven primarily by infections among young people, according to Jacob.
“When we drilled down to look at the nature of the spike, we noticed that it was greatest among young adults in their 20s with around 53 percent of the new confirmed infections last week among residents ages 20 to 29,” Jacob said.
According to the Cambridge Public Health Department, more infectious Covid-19 variants such as the B.1.1.7 strain also played a role in the rising case counts in Cambridge and in the state at large.
Cambridge remains in “Phase 3” of its Covid-19 reopening plan, despite the statewide move to “Phase 4” last week. Jacob attributes the rise in cases across Massachusetts and in the city to the relaxation of public health restrictions with the progression of reopening levels.
“Pandemic fatigue is real, which may be compounded by loosening restrictions which we've heard about across the Commonwealth and across the country,” Jacob said. “As I've stated before, we are not out of the woods yet.”
As the city continues its vaccine rollout plan, 24 percent of all Cambridge residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine as of March 23, according to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale.
On April 5, the city will enter the final stage of “Phase Two,” which expands vaccine eligibility to include individuals age 55 and older, as well as those with one underlying medical condition.
Individuals age 16 and older in Massachusetts will be eligible to receive the vaccine after April 19, when the state enters “Phase Three” of its vaccination program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Law School clinic that offers professional experience to law students in negotiation and mediation published two reports at the end of last year on political activism and public safety reform in Boston.
The first report, entitled “Power, Protest, and Political Change,” examines global political movements that have brought about lasting change. The report draws on interviews from both American and international political organizers conducted by co-authors Brooke A. Davies and Daniel Oyolu — students at the Law School and participants in the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program.
The report description poses the question, “If you want to make change as an organizer, how do you build power to get into the negotiating room, and then how do you wield that power effectively once you’ve sat down at the table with your political leadership?”
Oyolu said that racial justice protests that broke out throughout the United States over the summer motivated the report, which he said can serve as a resource to people looking to make change.
“In the aftermath of the George Floyd murder as well as the racial reckoning and protests across the country, Brooke and I were thinking, ‘What are ways we can use our training in alternative dispute resolution and the resources we have at Harvard to contribute to organizers, people on the ground, advocates, and activists for social change?” Oyolu said.
Clinical Instructor Lisa K. Dicker said the students’ contribution to the report — “born of and designed by” Davies and Oyolu — was unique.
“This was a project that Brooke and Daniel thought of, designed, and brought to the clinic for our supervision,” she said. “Oftentimes, it’s a bit of the reverse — we get projects coming to us from client organizations or from client groups.”
One of the goals of the report, Davies said, was to “create a free and accessible guide” for activists and community organizers. The two students interviewed leaders of the Black Lives Matter Movement, members of the U.S. Institute of Peace, and revolutionaries in six countries currently experiencing mass political uprisings.
“We gained a wealth of both problems and challenges that these activists are facing but also enormous insight into the lessons that they have learned,” Davies said. “One of the challenges was just taking the wealth of information that we had gathered from all of these interviews and all this research and boiling them down.”
The second report, entitled “Rethinking Boston’s Public Safety System,” provides recommendations spanning from “broad, overarching ideas” to “specific programs” for reforming Boston’s public safety system.
The report’s co-authors, law students William J. “Billy” Roberts and Anna K. Vande Velde, interviewed officials employed by the city’s various public safety departments to examine those agencies’ practices compared to their counterparts in other states.
“Our focus did shift throughout the semester from attempting to look at the individual characteristics of Boston’s public safety system to a broader search of public safety systems in other cities that might serve as examples for or offer insights for Boston’s public safety system as it attempts to introduce reforms,” Roberts said.
Vande Velde said she was surprised to learn through research that a multitude of systems designed to promote public safety operate throughout the country but receive little attention.
“One thing I didn’t expect was for there to be as many other systems and alternative programs out there that we could look at,” Vande Velde said. “There’s still not nearly enough, but there were some that had been there for 30 years and really hadn’t been getting much attention until this year.”
Roberts said one of the report’s main findings is that public safety is intimately related to and dependent on other aspects of a society.
“There are interconnections with access to mental health resources, access to housing, access to education, racial justice, discrimination, etc.,” Roberts said. “In considering potential reforms to policing or to a public safety system more broadly, those other factors need to be taken into account and woven together with the institutions that we classically think of as bearing on public safety.”
Rachel A. Viscomi, the director of the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinic, wrote in an email that the clinic took a “novel approach” through developing the report without a traditional client. Usually, a third-party group interested in using the clinic’s services works with the law students.
“We undertook the project independently, in an attempt to support the city of Boston and the City Council as they determine how to move forward in rethinking public safety,” Viscomi wrote. “In particular, I hope that [Roberts and Vande Velde’s] thoughtful reflections on how interconnected the 911 system is with the many other systems at play here will help to expand the dialogue around these questions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Center for Integrated Quantum Materials and the Learning Center for the Deaf are developing new signs in American Sign Language for quantum science concepts to increase accessibility in the field.
Mandy P. Houghton, a CIQM associate and former high school science teacher, is spearheading the project. Houghton, who is deaf, is working on the project with several other deaf individuals who work in STEM.
The project creates a more effective way to communicate STEM concepts through ASL by developing new signs, a framework for using them, and YouTube videos to share these developments with the deaf and hard-of-hearing — should they choose to adopt them.
Colin P. Lualdi, a fourth-year PhD candidate at the University of Illinois and a collaborator on the project, explained the limitations of some current ASL signs in communicating even basic scientific concepts such as an electron.
“A version commonly used by ASL signers involves one hand spinning around the other hand, which is balled up in a fist. The idea is that the spinning hand is the electron spinning around the nucleus, which is represented by the fist. This is fine, but what if you want to talk about electrons as stand-alone objects?” Lualdi said. “Now that student will be needlessly misled into thinking that the electron can never exist outside of an atom.”
While it was still possible to discuss quantum physics in ASL before, the new framework allows for more effective learning and communication, Lualdi said.
Houghton’s team followed a multi-step process to develop these new signs. They first conducted a needs assessment among undergraduates, PhD students and professionals. Next was the actual translation of quantum science concepts into ASL, which was no easy task, according to Houghton.
"Our focus is not just in developing stand-alone signs for quantum concepts without context," Houghton said. "It is important to model each sign in varying contexts so that people can see how the signs are portrayed accurately and how their nuances might change from one context to another."
After developing these new signs, the team recorded themselves using them and checked with others in the field to ensure the signs are conceptually accurate. Finally, they published the videos on YouTube in the hopes that others will find the signs helpful and adopt them.
Though the Covid-19 pandemic threw a wrench into ordinary life last spring and the team had to halt recording, they are excited to get back in the studio soon and resume disseminating their work to other ASL users, Houghton said.
The funding received from the National Science Foundation through CIQM was recently renewed for a third year. The project, which started out small and only met once a week, has since become a significant, long-term undertaking as the team realized the scope of the problem of lacking proper signs even for many fundamental STEM concepts.
The current limitations of ASL may turn deaf students away from STEM fields, said David E. Spiecker, a Ph.D. candidate in optics at the University of Rochester. Spiecker said he switched his major from physics to communications as an undergraduate because the language barrier made it difficult to stay engaged.
“When students lack proper language for learning concepts, they get frustrated and ultimately get turned away from STEM as something ‘too difficult for them,’” said Spiecker.
Houghton also said that having to use English and fingerspelling can be difficult and frustrating when communicating daily in a science classroom or profession. Often, they have to come up with “hacks” to get around this, and the new signs will hopefully eliminate these frustrations.
Combined with the lack of representation and role models in STEM, deaf students might not be aware that science is a path they can take, Houghton said.
“Helping out with this project is particularly important to me because I strongly believe that quantum information will play a significant role in our future,” Lualdi said. “I want to be sure that the deaf and hard-of-hearing community can participate in this paradigm shift rather than be left behind due to communication barriers.”
