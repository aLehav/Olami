After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To say that Petite Noir, the stage name of Cape Town musician Yannick Ilunga, had a diverse musical upbringing is an insult to understatements. Born in Belgium, Ilunga relocated to South Africa, fronting death metal band Fallen Within during his angsty teenage years, before finally settling down in the United Kingdom. Indeed, his debut album “La Vie Est Belle,” possesses both European and African musical elements, which, in the wrong hands, could have spelled disaster. Thankfully, Ilunga has managed to avoid a cluttered aural aesthetic, melding the eclectic set of sounds into one unexpectedly cohesive sonic entity. “Belle” fully lives up to its name—despite drawing from a number of clashing influences, Ilunga has produced a variegated, compulsively listenable record.

Ilunga began making waves after appearing on 2013’s “Saint Heron,” a compilation of alt-R&B tracks curated by Solange Knowles. His track, “Noirse,” proved a clear standout, and the subsequent critical and audience support provided the artist with a enough momentum to release his acclaimed EP “The King of Anxiety” earlier this year. Specializing in what he calls “noirwave,” best described as polyrhythmic African beats imbued with the overt romanticism of early ’80’s alternative, Ilunga culls sounds from diametrically opposite sources: hermetic South African villages to the cosmopolitan streets of London, ethereal melodies to industrial percussion. In including the musical sensibilities of a global audience, Ilunga renders “Belle” both accessible and riveting.
Filing “Belle” into one genre seems nearly impossible, as Illunga weaves strands of hip-hop, dance, alternative rock, jazz, and more into the album’s tapestry. On “Intro Noirwave,” the lyric-less opener, Ilunga layers heavy drums and chirping tropical birds over industrial daytime hum of a modern city. Meanwhile, in the thundering “Freedom,” the singer bellows how “freedom / comes when you least expects it,” over staccato tribal rhythms imbued with silky electronic textures, before finally breaking down in a traditional African chant. Indeed, “La Vie Est Belle” wallows in a captivating aural ambiguity that never feels overwhelming—instead, listening for the next vocal flourish or bizarre sample becomes part of the fun.
And yet, the occasional recognizable melodic build and trite lyricism can give the album a familiar, even hackneyed, feel. “Just Breathe,” the most radio-friendly of his offerings, possesses an anthemic, arena-rock quality, akin to Bloc Party’s seminal hit “So Here We Are.” The track seems destined for a cheesy teenage coming-of-age film or network-TV drama—the antithesis of what Ilunga stands for. Similarly, “MDR” pays seeming homage to “Grease”: “you’re the one that I want / you’re the one that I need,” Ilunga sings, a reference that feels oddly out of place with the palpable intensity of the song. Moments like these—where Ilunga attempts to appeal to listeners’ pop sensibilities—feel forced, detracting from an otherwise spotless album.
Yet while Ilunga stuffs “Belle” with a barrage of African drums, glittering synthesizers, jangling guitars, and feral animal calls, the album’s most captivating instrument is his own voice. Despite his African roots, the Congolese-Angolan singer sounds eerily similar to his British new wave predecessors—one listen to the thumping “Down” immediately evokes memories of The Cure’s Robert Smith or Duran Duran’s Simon Le Bon. Ilunga vacillates between heady coo and sonorous croon with startling ease, his voice at once whiny and soulful. And he never fails to surprise: On the title track, Ilunga suddenly begins rapping in French over a bevy of slow-burn guitars. Though many of the singer’s contemporaries openly dabble in experimental production, few have the vocal talent to match.
Noir has consistently mentioned that Kanye West’s “808s and Heartbreak” molded both his identity and signature sound, saying, in a January 2015 interview with Pitchfork Media, “Here’s a black guy just breaking all boundaries. I will always respect Kanye.” And while Noir lacks West’s mountain-sized ego, his unwavering audacity to push the rigid boundaries of pop music makes him similar to the rapper. Yes, the songs don’t “sound” particularly new, but their composition is undeniably ambitious, grand in both scope and emotional heft. “Belle” radiates with a hypnotic, understated sexiness, and for an artist who has spent his life roaming around the globe, sounds remarkably self-assured.

Lorely Rodriguez, the artist who performs as Empress Of, gazes forward contemplatively from the cover of her debut album, “Me.” She has a fist pressed against her mouth, a position that at once seems as if it could indicate anxiety, contemplativeness, or control. This ambivalent and variously suggestive gesture encapsulates the complex and multilayered nature of the album. “Me” is, on every level, a meticulously and beautifully crafted album—a stunning, masterful debut.

Rodriguez’s chosen medium is dance music, and over self-produced pop backing and eminently bumping beats she spins tales both intimately personal and keenly political. Dance music might not seem like the most obvious choice of genre for self-reflection. But it is closely attuned to the physical reality of the human body and concerned with facilitating the body's movements through and experiences in the environment. In Rodriguez’s capable hands, this style lends itself well to the expression of inner personal truth and sharply sketched political reality. Rodriguez, like fellow artists FKA Twigs and Shamir, is proving that pop electronic is currently home to some of the most exciting and innovative musicians.
Rodriguez's music is unabashedly honest, powerfully unafraid of showing the truth regardless of what it might look like. She is not hesitant to reveal vulnerability; she opens the album singing, over a spare arrangement: “Should I be afraid? / You don’t seem to be / All I want to be is you.” Her beautiful, expressive voice sings lyrics that are confessional, self-exploratory, and unsparing in their vision. For instance, in the final track, “Icon,” she sings tenderly about a sensual seaside fantasy, only to cut herself off with, “But I’m just in the room with the lights on.” In “Need Myself”—her slightly skewed version of a pop empowerment anthem—she sings confidently to a lover she is done with: “I don’t need this now/Not from you.” Unflinchingly, she continues, laying out the failures of their relationship: “I’m just lying to myself / When I’m lying next to you / I’m making love to myself / When I’m making love to you.” But when she sings of what she does need, what she does want—“I just need myself…to love myself”— notably to the same tune as her original line of rejection, her voice trembles slightly on each repetition of the word “myself.” As she sings these lines over and over again, with a raw openness and vulnerability, she seems to demonstrate the difficult work of building one’s confidence and self-esteem, finding one’s inner source of power. It is a deeply affecting listen.
She is similarly clear-eyed in her political vision—in “Water Water,” she sings, cuttingly, to a less-than-aware lover, “Water, water is a privilege / Just like kids who go to college.” Her songs often explore how the political intersects with the personal—in “Kitty Kat,” she questions a partner’s condescending behavior towards her. “If I was a man would you still do the same?” she sings. Later in the track, she brilliantly rephrases this question as a command: “Don't kitty, kitty cat me like I'm just your pussy.” This is pop politics near its finest. Rodriguez’s lyrical acumen is matched by her deft compositional skills—“Water Water” and “Kitty Kat” are two of the best sounding tracks on the album. The former sounds as vital, as wild, and as necessary as its title subject. The breaks between verses feature Rodriguez wordlessly vocalizing over burbling, crashing synth waves. The latter shifts between a huge, bruising synth bass line on the verses and sharp stabs of synth arpeggiation on the chorus. The sounds as fierce and powerful as the accompanying lyrics.
Rodriguez is also capable of writing songs of great beauty. “Make Up” is one such song, one of the most stunning tracks on the album. It opens with a glittering, crystalline synth line than runs through the song. She sings evocatively about a close, freeing relationship—“I don't have to fake it / Don't have to wear make up.… Kiss off all my lipstick / I don't have to fix it.” She continues, achingly: “Why don't we make up our own rules / And break them when we like/Shake me off the branch/And take the biggest bite.”The song is mostly in a minor key, which compliments its yearning tone. On the bridge however, the song switches to a major key and to a more hopeful tone. The bridge features a stunning vocal run: Rodriguez’s voice shoots stratospherically, and for the next few measures she remains in that higher register, her voice soaring, riffing, wordlessly, gorgeously. She sounds utterly and beautifully free, fully in the moment of creative, artistic expression.

It has been four years since Zach Condon-led Beirut released “The Rip Tide” to critical acclaim. “The Rip Tide” was a work of rare maturity, paring back the occasional instrumental excess and melodrama found in Beirut’s previous work to create a sound that was rich but never pompous. Unfortunately, this tautening impulse manifests itself in the band’s new album “No No No” as a sort of musical listlessness. Arrangements are smaller than ever; so is the music’s charm. And with a play time sitting just under a half hour, one almost gets the impression that Condon could barely pull together enough material for a full album.
The album’s instrumentation decisions are baffling. Condon is, above all else, a brass player, and one of the unique components of Beirut’s sound was a heavy preference for magnificent brass sections over more typical pop arrangements. This preference prevented the band’s often keening melodies from becoming cold or whining; Condon’s trumpet and flugelhorn gave warmth and grandeur, transforming what might sound like mere complaint into tragedy. In “No No No,” brass has been largely pushed into the background in favor of keyboards and percussion. Trumpets are still trotted out for muted appearances in short episodes, but overall the feel is not very Beirut-like and not very exciting.
The album’s titular single, “No No No,” is far and away the best track in the collection. Like most of the other songs, it is built around a repeated groove with little elaboration. The sophisticated instrumentation (featuring horns more prominently than elsewhere on the album) and the charm of the melody itself, which displays a cheer that is uncustomary for the band, rescue it from dullness. Similarly, “At Once,” while structurally very simple, displays the judicious and tender alternation between sparseness and lushness that made “The Rip Tide” a work of such beauty. “As Needed” is a lovely instrumental piece with a guitar-centered arrangement that, while entirely atypical of Beirut, is charming just the same.
Unfortunately, the rest of the album is largely indifferent and includes at least one truly unpleasant piece: “Perth,” whose bumpy electric piano riff will be uncannily familiar to anyone who has ever been put on hold by an automated answering service. The album features none of the sonic ambition of the band’s previous work—many of the songs feel like themes that were never actually developed into proper compositions. “Pacheco” and “So Allowed” sound like abandoned Ima Robot outtakes overlaid with Condon’s plaintive vocals. Flirtation with electronic music is not new for Condon—the EP “March of the Zapotec/ Holland” experimented aggressively with it—but this new work lacks the vitality of those prior excursions. At its worst moments, “No No No” feels like the music piped into waiting rooms: not quite bad, but not quite something you would ever play at home either. It is neither magnificent nor intimate, but something in between, holding the listener at an affable but impersonal and almost bureaucratic distance. It is the sort of music that should be played in the offices of insurance agents. “We’re all pleasant and well-meaning people here,” it says, “but let’s not have too much fun, either.”

In a departure from his recent show of bravado in his beef with Meek Mill, Drake has just dropped a remix and freestyle over the Weeknd’s track, “Tell Your Friends,” that hearkens back, stylistically and lyrically, to a Drake circa 2011—the softer Drake behind “Marvin’s Room” and “Doing it Wrong”. This freestyle is imploringly emotional; addressed to an unnamed love interest, the track begs her to recognize his vulnerability and authenticity.
While the production is near-seamless and the character of his message complements the Weeknd’s laid-back beat, Drake’s lyrics fall disappointingly short and do not measure up to the quality of his vocal performance. Drake throws around clichés with horrifying nonchalance: “Your body insane in person / wanna do special things for you”; “This time is different, you give me purpose.” Each line of this freestyle could be taken separately and used as part of a series of suggestive, sappy Hallmark cards for failing relationships. Though it feels indulgent to speculate as to the subject of Drake’s affection, given the directness of his message and several attempts at wordplay (“the ball is in your court / no defense, nobody’s keeping score”), it seems entirely reasonable to suppose that this freestyle is at least partially addressed to Serena Williams.
This is not to say that the track is entirely devoid of impressive elements. Drake makes an interesting change of rhythm and flow to the freestyle, at times. He closes with a vulnerable admission that he feels lost: “Been thinking ‘bout home actually / Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley / and Niks has Ezee / And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore.” “Tell Your Friends” feels like an uninspired attempt at Drake’s usual seduction, similar to his early work, but utterly lacking in the same feeling of sincerity.

Harvard students, by definition, benefit from exclusivity.
No matter how egalitarian you are in principle, attending an institution with a 5.3 percent acceptance rate automatically makes you more “The Plastics” than “The Bolsheviks.”
From literary magazines to so-called humor publications; from final clubs to a cappella groups, the day-to-day life of a Harvard student consists of simultaneously ignoring, embracing, and trying to overcome exclusivity.
This raises the question: Why are so many of the coolest things at Harvard nearly impossible to get into?
In order to answer this question, we must go back to high school, because, before anybody is a Harvard student, they’re a high-school-student-who-wants-to-go-to-Harvard. And high-school-students-who-want-to-go-to-Harvard are (to borrow a phrase from Donald Trump) massive losers—losers who often sacrifice social success, sleep, kindness, or some combination of the above to try and penetrate an almost impenetrable admissions office. Even if you were cool in high school and still managed to get into Harvard, something had to give.
And to make these kinds of concessions (developing caffeine addictions, alienating friends, suppressing libidos, etc.) for a 5.3% shot requires not only optimism, but also, at least, a modicum of hubris.
This is why people believe in The Harvard Douche: an infamous creature whose poisonous combination of arrogance, ambition, and verbatim memorization of the “We Want Prenup” section of Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” makes him or her nearly intolerable to be around. The Harvard Douche is the part of us—bigger in some than in others—that tells us we can (and should) one day hold political office, run a Fortune 500 company, or marry Taylor Swift.
The image of The Harvard Douche is why we have a bad rep. Fear of being perceived as one is why we hesitate to tell strangers where we go to school. And he (or she) is why even our tutoring organizations, sketch comedy groups, and foreign language cliques are so exclusive.
We all resent The Harvard Douche and most of us try our hardest to run away from him. Only the most optimistic of us appreciate what he stands for: a relentless need to accomplish what seems impossible.
Because while there’s hardly anything more annoying than a quixotic college student trying to change the world (A Harvard Douche), I am far more annoyed by the complacent Harvard student. You know who I’m talking about: the join a single-sex club, intern at Goldman, go to business school, go back to Goldman type—the dude who chooses to work on Wall Street, even though he or she in no way needs the money. The Harvard Dick.
The Harvard Dick has betrayed the unflinching hope of every high school student who strived to attend Harvard—at least the ones who haven’t been essentially “in” their whole lives. He’s rejected blind optimism in favor of resigned pragmatism; dreams of fighting socioeconomic inequality for dreams of purchasing a house in the Hamptons; taking risks for being practical.
This is why I propose promoting—rather than eradicating—The Harvard Douche. He’s the only thing stopping us from The Harvard Dick.
Sure, The Harvard Douche might be overconfident—his egotism might even be intolerable. But I like him so much better than his dickier, self-satisfied counterpart.
The Harvard Dick runs our social scene, many of our publications, and nearly all of our extracurriculars. He dismisses Divest Harvard protestors’ goals as impractical, ignores #BlackLivesMatter protestors, and perpetuates a male-dominated social scene. He says he’d like to integrate final clubs, but claims there’s nothing he can do to overcome the power of the graduate boards—just like he doesn’t see how he can win a fight against Exxon or the criminal justice system.
The high-school-student-who-wants-to-go-to-Harvard in most of us would absolutely despise The Harvard Dick. I hope The Harvard Douche many of us became feels the same way.
Because in order for Harvard to be the leading institution it should be, it is essential that we maintain the hubris and idealism that got us here.
Now, I get that this whole argument might sound a bit reductive; clearly, not everybody at Harvard is douche or a dick. But these two categories of Harvard students are, undoubtedly, at war with one another—a war dictating whether we accept our role as one step on the prep school-to-Ivy League-to-Wall Street chain, or if, like almost all of us did in high school, we transcend the traditional path.
Rather than conform to Harvard’s institutions, join The Harvard Douche and fight them. Strive to do something you think you’ve only got a 5.3% chance of accomplishing.
On Wednesdays, wear something other than pink.

It’s only the first month of sophomore year, and already I’m missing Annenberg. It isn’t the imposing architecture, though nice, nor the elegant statues, which are impressive. The swai-laden menus and barely functional water machines certainly don’t trigger memories of halcyon days. Surely it isn’t a culinary quality that—despite identical ingredients and menus—never fails to glorify the Houses by contrast. No, instead it is what Annenberg represents: one of the few truly uniting—and unexpectedly critical—parts of the freshman experience.
I should be clear: I’ve won the lottery with Leverett. River views from a brilliantly lit dining hall are hard to beat, especially when located in a McKinlock Hall clearly still basking in its post-renewal glow. Yet from my admittedly spoiled perch along the river, I’m strangely beginning to feel a certain nostalgia for freshman year’s overcooked and underwhelming big-box style cuisine.
One of the paradoxes of Harvard is that after admitting 1,600 amazingly talented high school seniors with myriad backgrounds, passions, and personalities, much of freshman year is spent compartmentalizing. The landmarks—move-in day, study card day, and housing day—all celebrate our fragmentation into dorms, courses, comps, houses, and concentrations, successively limiting our interactions to a shrinking portion of the College.
In some ways, of course, this is beneficial. Sixteen-hundred is a daunting number. To spend our four years swimming in a sea of vaguely familiar faces would be bewildering. Yet given the tendency of freshmen to coagulate around similar academic interests or popular activities, in practice Harvard is never as horizon-broadening and transformative as it is in theory.
The magic of Annenberg is that it is a counterweight. The first month-and-a-half of school is a time when Annenberg conversations make it possible to meet a truly random cross-section of the freshman class. The mathematician meets the artist; the musician, the athlete; the journalist, the scientist; and the computer whiz, the poet. Though name-concentration-dorm introductions (or complaints about the food) are hackneyed, a half-dozen of my friendships attest to the power these conversations hold in forming meaningful bonds.
As sophomore life has gone from a distant prospect to a surreal reality, a part of me worries for the relationships I’ve built from my FOP trip, from my entryway, and yes, from random Annenberg conversations, all sustained through the occasional meal. When I was a freshman, there was something magical about walking through Annenberg’s slightly-too-heavy doors and knowing that nearly every freshman I knew would do the same, probably twice, that day.
Of course, it can be daunting too: I’ve walked the terrifically awkward Annenberg Circle far more times than I’d like to admit—marching up and down the rows of tables, tray in hand, desperately searching for a friendly face while wondering how it could be mathematically possible to see so many and yet know so few. And still, it manages to be exciting and unifying.
I’m worried that as my sophomore peach fuzz matures into the more steady rhythm of upperclassman life, these unifying elements will become increasingly rare. Annenberg and the Yard will become more distant, and so too will the reality of each member of my class coming together a couple times each day. Not every person has walked the halls of Leverett House or written for The Crimson. Like sadly few other places and times—Harvard-Yale, Housing Day, and maybe CS50, if David Malan gets his way—Annenberg truly is a common denominator.
The Admissions Office brochures say that the House system enables Harvard to create a small liberal arts feel within the context of a large research university. They’re not wrong. Yet something is still distressing about the fact that the Quad is seen as Harvard’s Bermuda Triangle, a place where freshman-entrywaymates-turned-quadlings go to simply disappear. It is distressing that vanishing into the bowels of the Crimson, the IOP, or PBHA isn’t too uncommon. And why is it that the only time the entire class comes together after freshman year is at the Baccaulaureate Service—two days before commencement? Shouldn’t Harvard be more uniting than that?
The problem isn’t with the Quad, or with the dining halls, or with any other specific place. It certainly isn’t with hard work or extracurricular involvement. It’s a broader problem with the lack of unifying social spaces to accompany the Houses’ smaller communities.
The irony of Annenberg is that what makes it special to me is what makes it frustrating to most. It is the big-box, big-tent side of Harvard that is on one hand inclusive and on the other impersonal. As a newly inaugurated sophomore, though, Annenberg is beginning to acquire a special place in my heart, if perhaps not my stomach.

Harvard can be a lofty place, so it’s not surprising that its framework for undergraduate education was designed with lofty goals: The College’s program in General Education seeks “to prepare [students] for an ars vivendi in mundo,” or the art of living as "mature adults in the world at large." General Education's performance since 2009 has shown that the program’s means cannot achieve so ambitious an end.
A much-needed mandatory five-year review of Gen Ed released this spring revealed what most on campus already knew: Students and even faculty have trouble articulating the philosophy behind Gen Ed. But it’s more than ostentatious Latin phrases and language and overwrought principles that have made Gen Ed a failure.
For one thing, many of the Gen Ed classes specifically designed to fit into the program’s model are, in a word, bad. Professors are incentivized to create classes where students will learn something impossible to teach. No one course can turn a student into a citizen of the world, and instead widening the scope and aim of a class tends to make that class too scattered, too easy, or both. Many Gen Ed courses, engineered to be more useful than your average college course, become useless instead.
Other, better classes—ones that would have had a place in the course catalog even without the Gen Ed program—often don’t qualify for Gen Ed credit. Some government concentrators on the American government track enter senior year with unfulfilled United States in the World requirements despite having learned more than most students about, well, the U.S. in the world. Similarly, social studies concentrators who spent hours pondering ethical reasoning will often find they have yet to fulfill Ethical Reasoning.
This flaw stems partly from the Gen Ed application process, which asks professors to explain how their courses comply with program’s philosophical underpinnings. Many choose not to bother, especially when Gen Ed courses draw in hordes of students interested in a class not because of its curriculum but rather because of its Gen Ed designation.
Simple distribution requirements would achieve Gen Ed’s basic goals without forcing students to take classes tailored to goals they do not understand. The College could divide all existing classes into categories, whether they are broad—the humanities and STEM, for example—or narrower, and ask that students take a certain number of classes in those areas.
That way, students will learn more at Harvard than what they want to focus on coming in or what they end up focusing on coming out. Some will discover they are passionate about something they never would have guessed would draw them in. Others will simply leave these ivied walls knowing a little more about the world than they would have otherwise. That’s already “ars vivendi in mundo”—the Latin and the cumbersome logistics gone, but the learning intact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I love traveling the Southeast the way I love fake-deep indie rock music by bands composed entirely of white men.
I love it the way I’ve loved too many hetero-centric rom-coms, the way I love the smell of meat grilling despite being a vegetarian, the way I love the joggers I bought on sale a few weeks ago from Anne Taylor Loft. The way I love things that are not mine. The way I love things that maybe ought to be. Were supposed to be. And it’s hard loving these things that look and feel like home when they insist on being forbidden, alienating, mean: Loving the idea of the thing, often getting nothing in return.
Rarely has my family traveled outside of the usual Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee area (with an occasional Louisiana or Alabama thrown in). Once, my mom’s job flew us out to Utah, which was my first time on an airplane, but not my first time getting peculiar stares as a result of being the only black person for a matter of square miles. We don’t usually stray too far from home. On longer trips—to college, to D.C.—we get to see the whole southeast in all it’s rural glory, making it the only part of the U.S. that feels like a whole, continuous, sprawling thing. The rest of the country reduced to a sleepy view from an airplane.
My butt gets sore from sitting up and looking out the window for hours, so I lay down, and the Southeast is scrolling past me in real time. I listen to John Denver, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash. I pee in endless roadside gas stations. I eat at Cracker Barrel. And in this way it’s mine. All of this Southern Americana. It’s mine because I say it is, and because damned if I haven’t seen my fair share of sunsets from Southern rest areas, damned if I don’t know every word to “Take me Home, Country Roads.”
On the way to school this year, we made our halfway stop in West Virginia. My parents and I got off the elevator, turned the corner onto our floor, and I immediately made eye contact with a middle-aged white man wearing a t-shirt with the confederate flag printed on the front. The man had been exiting his hotel room with his child, but when he saw us he clutched the toddler almost violently, yanking her back inside the doorway. I’ve grown up surrounded by Confederate flags. Talking to a college friend when Walmart decided to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise, they asked, appalled, “Walmart sells confederate flag merch?!” From my experience, Walmart doesn’t really sell much else. It wasn’t shocking, but that isn’t to say I didn’t think about it before going to sleep that night, and it isn’t to say I didn’t get up to make sure the door was dead bolted.
A few weeks earlier, we took our yearly trip to the beach, a family tradition by which I feel blessed. Even when I was younger I felt thankful for the privilege of that kind of leisure. Back then I was also already aware of the scarceness of any other family that looked like mine on the beach. Those vacations were a hotbed for terrible insecurity and self-loathing surrounding my giant, sandy, knotted hair and deepening brown skin as I looked around enviously at the literally endless sea of little white kids, frolicking carelessly. I’m over this now that I understand that no one does beach curls like black girls. Still, there’s always the clouds. This year, my family unknowingly planned the trip for the date one year since Darren Wilson, a police officer who walked away from the shooting physically and legally unscathed, murdered Michael Brown. On the beach, I watched my Twitter feed fill with accounts of the militarized police force attacking mourning residents, of another shooting, of continuous injustice for Brown and his family. So I got into Facebook arguments with people from home, because that was all I could do.
Later, we talked about going to a Gullah Museum, and my patently tight-lipped Dad disclosed for the first time that his grandmother’s great grandmother was an enslaved black woman, her great grandfather a slave master. I spent that night on the balcony researching the nearby plantation where she was enslaved, hopelessly searching ancestry.com, feeling itchy, restless. On the drive back from the beach we stopped at a gas station where a group of teenage boys were hanging out, sitting in and around a pickup truck bed from which they were flying a giant Confederate flag.
And still, people always ask, “Why are you always thinking and talking about race? It’s over, why won’t you just give it a rest?” And I wish I could, often. I feel guilty for being sad in the rented beach chair my dad saves every year to get. Arguing about protests I’m not at in neighborhoods that aren’t mine. Crying about the unmaking of bodies I never knew the making of.
I’m sick of white foolishness encroaching on my precious, magical, all-mine Black Joy. Even now, even writing this, I doubt whether Black Joy is a hot enough take about which to write a column, when in reality it’s the most revolutionary thing I could possibly write of. Sometimes, I think about how other people don’t ever have to deal with things like this pushing their joy out of the way, and the frustration with that unfairness leads me to near fury. Sometimes, I sit down to write a column about Black Joy, and I can’t stop thinking of the white guy in Tasty Burger yelling “White Lives Matter!” I would like to be able to drive across the land my family has made and made home without feeling threatened. I want to shake people sometimes, physically shake them from their shoulders. I can almost hear myself shouting: “Do you understand? None of the things that are mine feel all the way safe. Like literally, actually safe. None of the things that are mine feel mine. My grandma plucked honeysuckle from her front yard and made the best pies. Can’t the south just be mine? I lay on the grass in The Yard and do reading for all these difficult as hell classes. So that too, can’t that be mine? And these clothes? And these words? My dad’s green eyes? My name? If not, what is? Do you understand?”
It feels so basic. If you don’t ever have to think about the thing, how can you not spend all your time feeling thankful that you don’t have to think about the thing, instead of telling other people they are silly for thinking about the thing? But still, how could you? If you’ve never felt unsafe in a highway rest stop two hours from your bedroom; if you’ve never felt threatened walking down Mass Ave in the middle of the day; if you haven’t known night to be a deadly thing.
I trust my peers enough to at least imagine being hit by the ripple in the air when the kid in section says that word. To consider the privilege of a frightless summer. To at least make a guess about how it feels to have a thousand words to say about a feeling. And still, people won’t.
Do you understand?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will continue requiring College applicants to submit the essay portion of the SAT or ACT, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane, despite that peer institutions like the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, Brown, and Cornell have moved to make the essay optional.
The SAT and ACT essay portions—which currently require students to write an organized response to a prompt in 25 and 40 minutes, respectively—have divided the Ivy League in a debate over whether the tests can accurately assess an applicant’s writing ability.
For now, Harvard still requires applicants to submit either the SAT or the ACT with writing, but acknowledges the recent policy changes at other colleges, according to Dane.
“Over the next few years, we will carefully study how predictive an element the overall writing section of the SAT is as it relates to academic work at Harvard,” Dane wrote in an email.
Penn decided this summer to make the SAT and ACT essays optional, citing their “weaker predictive power” in gauging matriculated students’ success at the school. Removing the essay requirement may benefit first-generation, Latino, and black applicants who are statistically less likely to "have complete testing profiles," Penn's John McLaughlin said in a press release.
Still, Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia who now runs a college consulting business, was skeptical of Penn’s reasoning, saying that a transcript alone may not predict an applicant’s academic preparedness as well as a transcript and associated test scores.
“They’re going to have to prove that transcripts in and of themselves predict success just as well,” Muth said.
In response to criticisms of the writing section’s evaluative capability, the governing bodies of the SAT and ACT will debut reworked essay sections this year. Beginning in March, the SAT essay will be optional, 25 minutes longer, and feature a more specific, text-based prompt. The ACT will lengthen its essay by 10 minutes and ask students to evaluate three perspectives on a societal issue.
Muth said the redesigned essay tests were “more in line with a real critical thinking exercise” and emphasized that colleges should wait and analyze data from test-optional schools before renouncing standardized testing.
But for the time being, Muth added that as a highly selective and visible school, Harvard and its admissions policies carry extra weight. If Harvard eliminates the tests, Muth said, “a lot more schools will be encouraged to as well.”

As refugees flow into European countries and talks to impose migrant intake quotas in European Union countries continue, several Harvard faculty members asserted that the crisis is not simply an EU responsibility and called for the United States to increase its humanitarian refugee uptake.
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said the U.S. has a responsibility to assist EU countries who are struggling to deal with the large mass of people fleeing civil war and conflict in North Africa and the Middle East.
“The U.S. has a particular responsibility for helping to resolve instability in the Middle East. I believe Western countries, including the U.S., need to take in a lot more refugees,” Jasanoff said.
The White House announced last week that President Barack Obama has ordered that 10,000 refugees be allowed into the U.S. in the next year.
Nicole A. Sütterlin, an assistant professor in the department of Germanic Languages and Literatures, pointed out the long-term implications of growing refugee intakes. “It remains to be seen how these countries can cope with accommodating such a vast influx of new arrivals into their society in the long run,” Sütterlin said.
She said Germany’s recent announcement of border restrictions is not “ideologically motivated,” but rather is reflective of the increasing strains placed on Germany and the need for a global distribution of responsibility.
“Germany is sending a message to Europe and the world that each country has a responsibility here… in particular countries that have had a major hand in provoking the crisis in the Middle East, such as the U.S.,” she said.
Professor of European Studies Peter A. Hall also said the U.S. must learn to embrace diversity to take on a larger role in alleviating the unfolding EU refugee crisis.
“The world of the 21st century is a new one in which ethnic and religious diversity, built on flows of migration, will be a fact with which all nations, including the United States, must learn to cope,” he said.
Jasanoff also addressed public fears of radical Islam and terrorism moving into Western societies by having large numbers of refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
“Syrian refugees are fleeing authoritarianism on the one hand and radical Islam on the other. Isn't taking in these refugees the perfect way to demonstrate the superiority of secular, democratic society?” she said. “Instead of building a bridge between ‘us’ and ‘them,’ we're just building even higher walls.”
Referencing a PBS NewsHour report on the refugee situation, Sütterlin pointed out that if the United States were to proportionally welcome as many refugees as Germany pledged to accept this year, the number of refugees accepted would be 3.2 million this year. About 1,500 Syrian refugees have been taken in by the U.S. since the outbreak of the Syrian conflict.
“It is high time that we respond with humanitarian acts, not with acts of war,” said Sütterlin, speaking of possible global solutions to the EU refugee crisis.

The Undergraduate Council was forced to move to a temporary website after their server was compromised during a summer cyber attack of the Faculty of Arts and Science network.
In June, administrators discovered the cyber attack, a security breach to its Faculty of Arts and Sciences and central administration information technology networks that may have compromised email login information. According to the UC’s technology chair, Jason F. Herrmann ’18, the Council’s official website was one of the servers affected.
Administrators informed students about the breach in an email in July, encouraging all members of the network to change their email passwords, but they did not specify which FAS pages were affected at the time.
Since the incident, the UC has switched to a temporary website, which now contains information for prospective Council representatives, including a timeline for this week’s elections and a comprehensive list of campaign rules. The Council's old site hosts documents detailing representatives’ voting patterns and copies of current legislation, among other features.
The current site will serve as a “temporary hub for vital UC functions during the ongoing transition back to our original domain,” Herrmann said.
UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 designed the temporary site, according to Herrmann, who added that the old UC site should be up and running in about a week.

Residents in five rooms on the first floor of 20 DeWolfe Street awoke Tuesday morning to a flood of sewage coming from their in-suite toilets, soaking the carpet floors and damaging personal property.
The incident originated from a clogged sewage pipe, according to Leverett House Building Manager Paul J. Hegarty, who oversees DeWolfe, which hosts overflow housing for some upperclassman Houses.
The totality of the damage will be assessed on Thursday, Hegarty said. Meanwhile, residents of the five rooms affected, including four student suites and one tutor residence, have temporarily relocated to rooms in McKinlock Hall and the renovated Inn at Harvard. Hegarty said he expects them to remain there until Monday.
Residents were given instructions to return Wednesday morning to move their belongings into storage while their rooms are repaired and sanitized, according to Amanda X. Fang ’18, a Crimson sports editor.
The students who live on the other floors of DeWolfe also have to put up with the stench that the flooding created.
“Oh my God, it smells horrible,” said Giannina Marciano ’18, one of the residents affected by the sewage overflow. “It smells like shit, like completely like shit. It’s humid. It’s really moist. When you walk into DeWolfe 20, you can just smell it right away.”
Marciano said a similar incident occurred three days earlier when the toilet in one of the suites overflowed, but was promptly repaired without causing significant damage.
In some rooms, the sewage spread from the bathroom into the residents’ bedrooms, damaging shoes, rugs, textbooks, and a vinyl player, according to Marciano.
Another student affected, Alexander H. Jin ’18, said he and his roommates were not immediately relocated until sewage started leaking from a closet wall later in the afternoon.

After years of construction starts and stops, Harvard officials offered more details on coming plans for the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex in Allston at Tuesday’s Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting.
Representatives from Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, Harvard Business School, and the Boston Redevelopment Authority discussed the development but did not reveal floor plans or renderings.
In contrast to 2007 plans for the science complex—which then did not focus on serving undergraduates—this newer iteration will emphasize undergraduate education and research. According to Harris Band, senior director of Allston master planning, the new complex will feature a single building that will cover 586,000 square feet and feature classrooms, research labs, retail spaces, a cafeteria, energy facilities, and additional parking. 
The single building—as opposed to the four smaller buildings proposed in 2007—will cover roughly a third of the property. The remaining land will be dedicated to public green spaces, with the possibility of future development on about half of this land.
SEAS, which received a record $400 million donation from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson this summer, began construction on the new complex in 2008 as part of Harvard’s original development plan for the University’s holdings in Allston. After Harvard had laid the foundations, the financial crisis put a hold on the construction of the complex. In 2012, University President Drew G. Faust named the renewed construction of the complex a focus of Harvard’s $6.5 billion capital campaign.
According to Band, Harvard administrators believe “strongly that the planning principles that framed the 2007 project and this current project are largely the same.”
Official renderings of the complex are set to be released in the coming weeks. Behnisch Architekten is the architectural practice charged with designing the complex.
Allston residents present at Tuesday's meeting said they were concerned about undergraduates flooding the available parking spaces around the complex.
Permitting documents for the science complex will be submitted this fall, and the BRA Board is set to approve the project this coming spring. Steel framework construction is slated to begin this summer.
Harvard is also nearing its filing date for development on the new Klarman Hall on Harvard Business School's campus. William Rawn Associates will design this new auditorium, which will house about 1,000 seats, span two stories and 76,000 square feet, and replace the existing Burden Hall auditorium. The basement level of the auditorium will be connected to adjacent buildings via tunnels.
“We’re currently at design development, and we’re 65 percent designed,” said Andrew F. O’Brien, the Business School's chief of operations, who added that the developers have begun the permitting process. According to O’Brien, Burden Hall is set to be demolished in 2018.
Klarman Hall's construction will occur concurrently with the SEAS development.
“We are bringing two important projects to Harvard and running them on the same track,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications. “We’ve also built in a robust set of meetings to get feedback from all of you on these developments; there’s going to be multiple opportunities for conversation.”
In addition to conversations about ongoing construction work in Allston, BRA senior project manager Gerald Autler named seven of eight members of the Flexible Fund Executive Committee, a governing body charged with allocating $5.3 million from Harvard’s community benefits package to projects in Allston. Four of the executive committee members will also be members of the task force.

Campaign advertisements and pleas for votes inundated email inboxes and Facebook feeds this week as 51 College seniors, some serious and others joking, vied to be elected the first or second class marshal for the Class of 2016.
The two students elected to those positions will manage the Senior Class Committee, serve as spokespeople for the senior class, and solicit donations from their classmates for the annual Senior Gift fund, among other responsibilities, this year.
The voting period opened to seniors on Tuesday morning, the start of a 24-hour period. The candidates who receive the two highest vote totals will be named first and second marshal, respectively, on Friday. 
Students will elect six more class representatives, called program marshals, in a separate election scheduled for next week. That is a departure from previous years, when first, second, and program marshals were elected from the same pool of applicants in the same round of voting.
Dozens of seniors regularly clamor to run to represent their class on the Senior Class Committee, and on schedule, eager members of the Class of 2016 have mounted their own campaigns, creating Facebook events and sending mass email messages calling for their classmates' support.
But while many candidates have promoted serious platforms and goals, a slew of improvised, comical campaigns have also emerged.
One Facebook page, titled “Trump for Senior Class Marshal,” promises to “make the Harvard Class of 2016 great again.” Another online page promoting Connor M. Harris ’16, who is not in fact an actual candidate, advertises an array of humorous policy proposals, such as “Reinstitut[ing] the swimming test.” “Every failed attempt reduces the pH of the pool by 0.5,” the page declares.
Harkening back to last year’s election, one group of seniors created a page dedicated to promoting the reelection of Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the first marshal of last year's senior class. Goffard, also a former Undergraduate Council vice president, described himself as “flattered, amused, and definitely a little shocked” by the suggestion. He added that he looked forward to his “impending victory” in the contest.
Among the candidates officially on the ballot, Allejah T. Franco ’16 said he did not initially intend to mount a serious campaign. Although he signed a statement of candidacy at the urging of his friends, he said he was shocked to see campus covered with posters promoting his campaign soon afterwards. Julianna R. Aucoin ’16, along with other members of Franco’s rooming group, discretely organized the thorough effort in what she said began as an attempt to surprise their friend but soon developed into a potentially winning campaign.
“We noticed that it’s so much easier for us to be overly promoting when it's not about us,” Aucoin said. “It’s super obnoxious if someone were to have a website, have a Twitter, have that many posts in a Facebook group that they were serious, but when you use humor that way, it becomes fun, rather than annoying.”
The number of candidates are up for election this year is on par with last year, when 52 students ran for the positions. But with a new voting system in place, it is difficult to directly compare the two election cycles, said Clint D. Ficula, assistant director of the College Alumni Programs at Harvard Alumni Association.

“Cold Call”—a new Harvard Business School podcast series deriving its name from the often fear-inducing pedagogical technique of professors randomly selecting a student to detail specifics of course material—launched last week from host Brian Kenny, the Business School’s chief marketing and communications officer.
The bi-weekly podcast “takes the School’s legendary case method and distills it into podcast form,” according to a press release. Kenny—who oversees the Business School’s global brand and coordinates the planning and implementation of the School's marketing, communications and public relations efforts—will interview authors on the development and key messages of their case studies.
The first podcast posted last week featured a condensed version of a case study on British fashion designer Stella McCartney, who has released an organic skincare products and lingerie line. Business School professor Anat Keinan co-published the case in January 2015, following Business School Dean Nitin Nohria’s pledge in January 2014 to double the number of female protagonists in case studies over five years.
Business School faculty pioneered the famous case study method as a way to learn from studies of businesses in a group setting. Since its inception, the case method has become a widely adopted educational strategy throughout graduate business schools. Cases written by Business School faculty constitute 80 percent of cases sold globally. Thirty-three percent of these cases focus on international examples.
Over the past year, HBS has received significant attention after releasing a number of online educational endeavours, such as HBX Live! and HBX CORe.
The podcast endeavor marks the School’s continued foray into education through alternative media sources. “Cold Call” follows the podcast series “The Business,” which was first released in 2013 and also hosted by Kenny. “Cold Call” is available for free streaming on SoundCloud, iTunes, and iTunesU.

From posters in the Yard parodying TV shows to Photoshopped images of Harvard administrators posted online, 136 candidates began their campaigns Tuesday for a position on the Undergraduate Council.
Just an hour into the start of the official student government campaign period, self-promotional posters of seven different freshman Elm Yard candidates were already plastered on a bulletin board outside Weld Hall—representing a mere fraction of the yard’s 25 candidates running for a seat on the Council this year.
A poster for Maxwell Benegas ’19, imitating the popular dating application Tinder, told prospective supporters: “Not looking for a hookup, so swipe left if that’s what you want. I’m here to serve as your Undergraduate Council Elm Yard representative!”
Posters ranged from the humorous—a parody of the Emmy-award winning comedy show “The Office”—to the sentimental—candidates’ baby photos—but they are not the only way students have taken to the campaign trail.
According to Benegas and Michael Liu ’19, both Elm Yard candidates, freshmen have also posted to their class Facebook group with campaign materials.
“There is a lot of campaigning going on, and I think it’s big on social media.” Liu said. “There are so many GIFs and memes and random shock-value … campaign materials in there, a lot of just really weird content.”
Upperclassman candidates are also taking to Facebook to campaign for the election.
Shaiba Rather ’17, a UC veteran running for reelection in Cabot House, edited an image of the face of Dean of the College and Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana several times into a group photo. Rather also changed her Facebook profile picture, displaying text saying “hey fish, I sea you,” seemingly a reference to Cabot House’s mascot.
Rather attributed the sheer number of candidates running for spots on the Council as a reason for this year’s robust campaign materials.
“Pressure is definitely on not only veteran council members but also upperclassmen to perform,” Rather wrote in an email. “Campaigning this year seems more like a necessity than an option, as it has in the past.”
In Eliot, candidate Taylor D. Marquis ’18 sent out a House-wide email with a link to the Council’s voting portal just four minutes after the campaign period had commenced. Marquis said he also plans to campaign on Facebook by changing his cover photo and plans to post flyers in every entryway in the House.
The campaign and voting period are the same time this election cycle. Elections will close on Friday at noon.

UPDATED: September 16, 2015, at 2:56 am
Faculty and nonunion staff members on Harvard’s health plans will see an average 7.3 percent increase in their insurance premiums next year, a hike administrators announced Tuesday and attributed to rising health costs.
The jump in premiums comes after the University revamped its nonunion health benefits policy after faculty and staff members overwhelmingly criticized last year’s changes, which introduced an out-of-pocket deductible and coinsurance for the first time. In announcing the 2016 options, Harvard officials once again cited the rising cost of healthcare as the major impetus for increasing health insurance costs. Health care spending jumped 4.8 percent in Massachusetts last year, according to the state Center for Health Information and Analysis. 
Concerns expressed by faculty over the past year influenced officials, as Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an August email, to improve the reimbursement system and create a new health insurance option that offers no deductible or coinsurance at the point of care for those who “seek more predictable out-of-pocket costs at the point of care.” There are nine health insurance choices for nonunion staff members from either the Harvard University Group Health Plan or Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.
The new benefits options also offer an updated reimbursement program, which allows lower income workers on most of the available plans to be reimbursed dollar-for-dollar for out-of-pocket expenses at the point of care, above a certain threshold. Individuals earning under $30,000 can apply for reimbursements for out-of-pocket costs above $600; employees earning between $30,000 and $39,999 can be reimbursed over $800; and individuals earning between $40,000 and $69,999 can be reimbursed over $900.
Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann fleshed out the new plans to nonunion staff members in an email on Tuesday, allowing employees to assess their health care costs for the next year before open enrollment begins on Nov. 9. The sign-up period runs through Nov. 23.
This year’s premium increase is a stark contrast to the fall in premiums last year, when the University’s changes had employees pick up more of the bill in the form of coinsurance and deductibles. University administrators attribute the premium increase to rising healthcare costs, including the rise of specialty drugs—or expensive prescriptions including drugs to treat Hepatitis C and cancer—that are putting pressure on healthcare vendors across the nation.
Harvard will cover in-network diagnostic labs and x-rays for nonunion employees on some plans, without deductibles or coinsurance. The University will charge higher copayments for office visits on these plans—an increase from $20 to $30.
Harvard’s newest option for 2016—the Point of Service Plus plan—offers no deductibles or coinsurance for in-network services but has a higher monthly premium, either $128 or $140 for individuals in the lowest salary tier, and $344 or $379 for families in that tier, depending on whether an employee chooses the Harvard University Group Health Plan or Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The in-network out-of-pocket maximum for the Plus plan is $2,000 for individuals and $6,000 for families.
“We did not acknowledge the strength of people’s anxiety about any level of risk, and so recognizing that anxiety we will reintroduce a plan that enables people to say, ‘I would rather be absolutely certain and pay more in order to be absolutely certain that I don’t have to have coinsurance or deductibles,’” Faust said of the new Point-of-Service Plus option.
Harvard will continue to offer its standard Point-of-Service plan—available from HUGHP and HPHC—with an in-network $250 deductible for individuals and $750 for families. After the deductible is met, Harvard covers 90 percent of costs and the employee covers 10 percent of costs before they reach the out-of-pocket maximum of $1,500 for individuals and $4,500 for families.
When coupled with the increase in office visit copayments, Harvard projects reducing the number of services on which coinsurance and deductibles are required to be cost neutral.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the majority of its nascent 2015 season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has played without the lead. The story was the same in the Malkin Athletic Center on Tuesday night through the first two sets. But narratives change.
After erasing a two-set deficit yet trailing New Hampshire, 12-14, in the fifth set, the Crimson punched in six straight points to take the match. Senior setter Hannah Schmidt and junior outside hitter Grace Weghorst teamed up to finish off the final two points, solidifying the Crimson’s hard-earned comeback, 16-14.
Coining a new term for itself midgame—a “cohesive fireball”—the Crimson team (2-5) became just that. Steeling itself at an 0-2 disadvantage against the Wildcats (6-6), Harvard turned up the heat to clinch the following three sets and claim its first win in six games.
“We had a saying, the ‘cohesive fireball,’” Weghorst said. “It came up randomly in that third game, and for some reason it stuck with us. It lit a fire under us, and we really went for it.”
That cohesion was on display in the second set, when a critical diving save allowed senior libero Sindhu Vegesena to set up Weghorst, who fired a kill to tie the score, 21-21. Though the Crimson ultimately lost the set to the Wildcats by three points, the second set proved much closer than the first and gave the team the momentum to power through.
“I think our mentality changed,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “Our team is very mental, so when we get down on ourselves we really get down on ourselves and we turn internal. When we become one unit, one cohesive unit, that’s when we play our best.”
The Crimson initially struggled to find its footing, trailing UNH for most of the first set. Unable to take the lead, the team ultimately dropped the first set 25-18, stymied by junior Demi Muses, who led the Wildcats in kills with 16.
Close play and a tight back-and-forth marked the second set, however, as the Crimson put increasing pressure on UNH. Starting with a kill from Holte to tie the score at one, the squad remained neck-and-neck with the Wildcats throughout the entire set. UNH maintained a marginal lead and ultimately took the set, 25-22.
Harvard finally pushed through in the third set, advancing from 4-4 to a 10-5 lead with three powerful kills from Weghorst and a kill from freshman Christina Cornelius and junior Corie Bain respectively. UNH fought back to close the gap, 13-12, but Harvard maintained a two-point lead from 14-12 to 18-16, until UNH tied the score at 18-18. Winning the next three points, however, Harvard maintained its lead and closed off the set with a quick kill from Cornelius.
After battling injuries through her sophomore season and playing only two sets in Harvard’s first three matches this year, Weghorst led the Crimson Tuesday with a career-high 24 kills.
“Obviously it’s hard to come in and play a lot, it’s hard for everybody,” the Texas native said. “I’ve had a lot of injuries, and I’m really fighting to get back. The support of the team was really important this time. They were extra supportive, extra cheery, so it worked out.”
The fourth and fifth sets again saw close plays, and tension escalated as Harvard tied the score 20-20 in the fourth set. With a comeback just at its fingertips, the team took a 23-20 lead and finished the set with Bain setting up kills for both Holte and Cornelius. Weghorst’s final two kills in the fifth set sealed the deal for the Crimson.
“I’m just ecstatic,” Holte said. “We had been in a rut for a while with some losses, and it wasn’t that the losses had big gaps in score. We had been very tight in scores, but it’s just something special to get a win, to get a ‘W,’ under your belt.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two teams will try this Thursday to right their respective ships as they attempt to regain footing before conference play.
The Harvard women’s soccer team (1-4-1) looks to snap its three-game losing streak and pick up its first victory since its opening match when New Hampshire (2-3-3) visits Cambridge tomorrow night at 7 p.m.
The Crimson will be trying to get back in the win column following consecutive losses to top-25 opponents Connecticut, Virginia, and William & Mary.
Having gone 0-1-1 at home this season in matches with Boston College and Alabama, Harvard will also be seeking its first win of the season at the newly-renamed Jordan Field. Despite the challenging nonconference stretch, the team is confident that it can rebound with a win.
“Our record doesn’t really portray how strong our team is,” junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack said. “We’ve got a lot of things to improve on, but we’re not worried about the numbers at this point.”
The match on Thursday will serve as another nonconference test for both teams. The Wildcats play two more games before beginning play in the America East, while the Crimson has three more games on its schedule before opening Ivy League play with a match at home against Penn on Sept. 26.
New Hampshire is currently riding a two-game losing streak of its own. The Wildcats fell at home to Temple and Lafayette, and have been shut out four times this season.
Junior goalkeeper Mimi Borkan and the New Hampshire defense conceded four goals in their loss to Temple on Sept. 11.
Last season, Harvard slipped by the Wildcats, 1-0, in a nail-biting double overtime finish. Senior midfielder Brooke Dickens scored the game-winner in the 101st minute. Durack, who came into the game at halftime, made one stop to complete the shutout for Harvard.
The Crimson has scored only one goal over its last three games and has been held scoreless over the last two. Junior forwards Midge Purce and Rachel Garcia have provided a majority of Harvard’s offense during the winless stretch, having generated a combined 15 shots on goal. Purce led the team last year with a team-best 10 goals.
Durack expects an emphasis on ball movement and offense on Thursday night, a sentiment that ninth year head coach Ray Leone echoed.
“We have to move the ball quickly,” Leone said. “That’s the way we play–try and find spaces.”
On Thursday, the Crimson will try to apply the same defensive pressure it did last season against New Hampshire and keep tabs on Wildcat sophomore midfielder/forward Brooke Murphy, who leads New Hampshire with four goals and nine points over the team’s eight games.
Senior forward Caroline Murray has also been a force for the Wildcats, tallying three assists and twelve shots on goal this season.
Harvard has come close to salvaging ties in two of the last three games. Against William & Mary, a potential game-tying shot by junior midfielder Bailey Gary hit the crossbar while a late Connecticut goal lifted Connecticut to a 2-1 victory in Storrs. The recent stretch against three ranked teams, according to Durack, is one of the most difficult—if not the most difficult—stretches that a Crimson women’s soccer team has ever had to play.
“The coaches are really good at getting us to keep things in perspective,” Durack said. “We take the lessons we learned from the previous games and apply them to the next.”
The chance to return home after three road losses, including two in three days, could be just the cure Harvard needs for its recent offensive struggles.
“The matches were exciting,” Leone said, but he emphasized that hitting the reset button would be vital to the team’s success.

With 4.1 K registered attending on Facebook, “Farmal: The Real Garden Party” is poised to be one of the most popular student social events. Hosted by and in the Harvard Community Garden this Saturday, the event promises to be “farmy, formal, and fantastic” with live music, dancing and, most importantly, vegetables.
In typical Harvard fashion, and due to an overwhelming student demand, those who wish to attend the event still can only be placed on a wait list through a “ticketing system.” Hey, you didn’t actually think that there could be a Harvard party open to all? Event organizers may have anticipated an inclusive, outdoors free-for-all, produce-powered dance party, but alas.
For those lucky enough to secure Farmal tickets (props to you for planning ahead, and congrats on having Saturday night plans!), look forward to three hours of live music from a selection of student musicians including the Dudley Co-op based Co-op band, Justin Giallorenzo and Tree Palmedo, The Lighthouse Keepers, Ratna Gill and Dylan Schaffer, and Laila Smith and Ben Wetherfield.
