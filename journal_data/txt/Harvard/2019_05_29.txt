After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end of the 2018-2019 academic year has arrived. I began my year with a long to-do list and, while I didn’t get through all of it, I am proud of how much we accomplished across the College this year. I am particularly proud that we opened our new Dean of Students Office, created the new pre-matriculation summer service program, and will launch our new General Education program this fall. I am also grateful for the opportunity to work with our new leaders, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh — and all of our dedicated Harvard College staff.
More important to me than any one achievement is my realization that I have ended this year with a different perspective on many issues. We engaged in difficult conversations about complex issues this year, including the admissions lawsuit, #MeToo, and questions of environmental stewardship and investment. Students have brought their concerns and opinions to me, pressed me to see their perspectives, and challenged my assumptions. Our students have been integral to transforming my thinking on different issues over the years such as the need for a program like the First-Year Retreat and Experience, and how the College should think about its connection to mass incarceration — and for that, I am deeply grateful. This year we marked the 50th anniversary of a historical milestone in student activism on our campus, 1969. Without that student activism, Harvard wouldn’t be where it is today, and without continued advocacy, Harvard will not be where we need to be tomorrow.
Harvard continues to grapple with the many challenges facing higher education, including protecting free expression, guaranteeing equal access to educational resources, nurturing a community based on inclusion, belonging, and mutual respect, and ensuring the we are accountable for environmental stewardship and responsible investment. We must continue to participate in robust and open dialogue about these issues.
Sustaining a college that enables all of its members to fulfill their potential is not easy work. Real and lasting dialogue in our community depends on treating each other with respect and dignity. Shutting someone down before they’ve had a chance to speak, communicating in 240 characters or by posting memes, retorting viciously against someone you disagree with, or assuming you have a monopoly on the truth rarely changes minds. On the other hand, we can make real progress when we engage in serious, respectful conversations in the classroom, over dinner in the dining hall, and at formal presentations.
Increasingly, I have come to believe that the polarization we see in society is exacerbated by the breakdown in the art of listening and dialogue. We get stuck because of fear that we will hear uncomfortable things. We get stuck because we fear we will not be heard. And yet, I have found even in my most difficult conversations this year that there is often common ground to be found. We all want to act to improve our collective future. We all want our friends, fellow students, colleagues, and everyone in the Harvard community to thrive. We all want to thrive ourselves.
As we end this year, I am recommitting myself to hearing you, to engaging with you, and to seeking common ground and areas of agreement. To find this common ground, we need your voices, your advocacy, and your ideas. And we all need to commit to creating an environment in which we are willing to listen to each other and to hear each other’s points of views and perspectives. There will be moments where we might agree to disagree on issues or decisions, but I promise you that I will take to time to really understand where you stand on an issue and why. I know you will do the same.
In the meantime, I want to offer congratulations to the Class of 2019 on your commencement. You have left an indelible mark on this community through your leadership and advocacy, listening and inquiry, creativity and hard work, and I am excited for all the future has in store for you.
Thank you also to our staff and faculty for the guidance you’ve given students and the commitment you’ve shown to Harvard College.
Classes of 2020, 2021, 2022 — I look forward to continuing our conversations in the fall.
Rakesh Khurana is the dean of Harvard College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past year has raised a number of questions about what it means to be a part of Harvard — what defines student activism, what students should expect from the Houses, and what workers should expect from the administration. But one question raised underpins the rest: How do students get here in the first place?
Last fall, the lawsuit alleging the College’s admissions processes discriminates against Asian American applicants went to trial — a three-week ordeal that roiled Harvard’s campus and higher education more broadly. The lawsuit has left us grappling with the great privilege, the complicated socioeconomic dynamics, and the tremendous responsibility of admission to Harvard. In light of these challenges to the admissions process, complacent pride in the achievement of admission is no longer acceptable or sufficient.
Harvard has set an example for race-conscious admissions since its inception, which provided a model for higher education across the board. The “Harvard Plan,” implemented in the early 1970s, served as an important alternative to other methods that set numerical targets for identity groups. The plan showed that diversity was not merely a box to be checked, but a critical component to a vibrant student body.
Yet almost 50 years later, Harvard now faces accusations that it has failed to live up to its pioneering approach.
Harvard has repeatedly denied the charge that it discriminates against Asian American applicants since anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions first filed its lawsuit in 2014. The October trial featured testimony from administrators, experts, and students, and revealed intimate details of Harvard’s admissions process to the public. Though arguments concluded in February, the judge in the case is expected to deliver a verdict in the coming months — a decision with the potential to determine the fate of affirmative action in America. The verdict, however, will likely be appealed — regardless of the outcome — and experts have said the case could go all the way to the Supreme Court.
The revelations from the trial expanded well beyond alleged discrimination against Asian American applicants. Documents in the case confirmed that the College’s admissions process lends a significant advantage to wealthy and legacy students. Months later in March, news of a national scandal came to the fore, revealing that wealthy parents paid athletic coaches to lie about the athletic ability of prospective students at several top colleges. While Harvard has not been implicated in the scandal, the Boston Globe reported that the College’s head fencing coach sold a house substantially above market price to the father of a former and current Harvard fencer. All the while, admissions became more selective, as the admit rate dropped yet again to a record-low 4.5 percent for the incoming Class of 2023.
We need to ask ourselves what admission to Harvard means in terms of its criteria and its purpose. Is admission just another award bestowed on elite applicants, or is it more? We believe it must be the latter.
Admission to Harvard is a remarkable opportunity to develop the skills and intellect necessary to change the world — hopefully for the better. In the face of recent challenges and skepticism, Harvard must reaffirm its educational mission and the importance of affirmative action in fulfilling that purpose.
In pursuit of that vision, we reaffirm our support for affirmative action and its positive impacts it has for students on campus from all backgrounds. Affirmative action takes a step towards correcting the systematic inequalities and disadvantages present for marginalized groups in our society. Affirmative action acknowledges that, in some ways, our standardized test scores or high school grades are a measure of the resources we had access to in the past — not our potential for the future.
Beyond these historic facts of systemic inequity, a diverse student body allows all who enter the gates of Harvard Yard to broaden their perspectives and engage in immersive learning experience that reflect our society today.
The allegations of discrimination in Harvard’s admissions process — and other aspects of it that might privilege some groups over others — are not to be taken lightly. The College should critically evaluate its admissions process and immediately rectify systematic biases it may be assigning to Asian Americans, even if these biases are unintentional.
In the same vein, we believe any preference in admission given to legacy applicants or applicants from wealthy families undermines the entire process. This practice is especially contradictory when we think about leveling the playing field for those of disadvantaged backgrounds. While we understand that there must be compromises to these values to fund University programs, Harvard must ensure it does not compromise the integrity of its admissions practices in the process.
We stand by Harvard’s holistic admissions processes that seek to gain a sense of a student as more than any one measure of success such as standardized test scores or grade point averages. If the society that produces individuals who apply to Harvard is in itself inequitable, how can success — or merit, for that matter — be quantified or judged equitably? How do we even define merit in this case? Certain factors beyond the control of a high school student, such as their birthplace, race, or gender, greatly impact students’ ability to display “merit” along these quantifiable lines. This impact is indicated through evidence that standardized test scores, for example, benefit white and high-income high school students.
Once we come to the understanding that admission to Harvard is not a matter of merit per se, as that idea is not as simple as it seems, the possibility of humility for the College’s students emerges. Admission to Harvard is a privilege, not a right. The opportunities, therefore, that come with it must be understood as something we have been lucky to experience — not something we were owed. With that comes a responsibility to make a tangible impact on the world for the better and we must not take that lightly.
We believe that the type of students a selective college chooses to admit speaks to the institution’s mission. Accordingly, it’s critical to view Harvard’s admissions practices through the lens of how well these practices serve its mission to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has traveled across the United States defending and promoting this aim as he has made the case that institutions of higher education like Harvard should provide a space where students can spend their time “learning how they can best serve the world.”
To be sure, this work is not merely a matter of admissions. In particular, Harvard must work not only to recruit a diverse group of students onto its campus, but also to provide those students with the education and means to take on a range of challenges as they graduate.
As such, we have been particularly concerned with the limited degree to which students go on to engage in public service work — a field that fits neatly into Harvard’s stated mission. We urge the University to put more effort into providing the pathways and resources to make public service an exciting, respected, and plausible career, much as there are for other private sector ones.
For each student who commits to Harvard, the College commits to cultivating an environment that will work to provide the tools, intellectual depth, and sense of self to be a “citizen leader.”
In recognition of this commitment, we continue to stand behind Harvard’s efforts to create a diverse campus of varying backgrounds and academic interests, and, in that vein we applaud the College’s long-standing commitment to financial aid. During their time at Harvard, we believe students should also have the opportunity to study a diversity of fields from faculty of diverse backgrounds. As we have previously opined, students who are learning how to best serve the world, benefit substantially from doing so in an environment where they actually encounter insights from as varied an array of viewpoints as possible.
SFFA’s challenges to affirmative action and the ongoing national admissions scandal have left institutions of higher learning to evaluate their current admissions processes and determine how they should ideally function. This presents an important opportunity to Harvard to reaffirm its mission and to clarify its admissions practices to successfully serve this goal. In Harvard’s case, this means the College has the chance to distinguish itself — at least in terms of its goals — from common public misconceptions such as charges that Harvard is self-serving and elitist. By clarifying the service-minded nature of its institutional mission, Harvard can strive to regain the public trust it has lost in the whirlwind of admissions scrutiny over the past year, while also articulating its mission and great commitment to broad accessibility more definitively than ever. Such a renewed effort would not only strengthen the University’s ability to pursue its own mission, but would also serve to strengthen the position from which Harvard may serve as a vigorous defender of affirmative action on campus and on the national stage.
Harvard is at a crossroads. Though the legal question of affirmative action will ultimately be decided in the courts, this year’s developments present challenges to Harvard’s mission that the University must confront. As it fights to protect affirmative action, Harvard must make it clear to the world that its main mission is to cultivate and educate its students so that they can make a difference. The goal of the admissions process must be to find the right individuals to create a student body that benefits of all its members through shared learning, rich discourse, and productive collaboration.
As the members of the Class of 2019 graduate, they have the opportunity to reflect on their admissions into the College and the live they built here as friends and classmates. But that reflection — and the knowledge that so many others will not get this opportunity — must underscore the importance of the fact that they will go forth into the world after having benefited from an imperfect admissions process. That privilege comes with great responsibility. We hope they find purpose and joy in the chance to use their Harvard degrees to build a better world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a particular dilemma that sometimes arises during my private conversations with students at the Bureau of Study Counsel. It may be especially fitting to mention this dilemma this Commencement week — a time of beginnings and endings — as it points toward a kind of continuity. It is a dilemma deserving of respect and exploration, as it can be long-lived and deeply felt. It might be expressed as a tension between impression management and true learning, and might begin with a statement like this:
“I want to do justice to Harvard and to myself and to everyone who has supported me. So, I know I should get started right away on assignments and do my absolute best on them. But Instead I find myself doing them at the last minute and feel disappointed in them and myself. Why do I do this?”
If I listen well enough, the student above might elaborate:
“I guess if I start a paper and realize that it’s not going to be amazing, I feel I can’t let that represent me. I get paralyzed and start doing emails or something. When I finally turn something in, I feel relief, but not exactly joy, even if the grade is fine. Maybe I'm just lazy… I want to be able to love learning again.”
Eventually, many of these conversations arrive at a deeper set of questions and some answers that can set the stage for navigating life not only during, but also after Harvard. Sometimes, it comes down to, “What is higher education for?” And some students have a ready answer: to get a degree, or to gain financial security, or to have influence, or to honor their family, or to find something they can commit to, or to learn. Or, they say, it’s for all of these. But, I’ve learned that it’s not easy to aim for all of these at the same time. In fact, they often collide with one another.
Here’s how one such collision can look in the Harvard context: Students know perfectly well that they are frequently evaluated based on performed results — whether a paper, project, GPA, or thesis — in a sense, their “smooth image.” These evaluations come not only from others; students also tend to judge themselves based on the image they present. And it’s not a crazy idea; realistically, some of their future options might be affected by that image. On the other hand, they may have come to Harvard hoping to find or to follow what interests them — to engage in transformative, rather than performed education, to pursue what they love or discover what they love.
This predicament arises here partly because Harvard itself has an established image as a place to which the “best and brightest” gravitate. So, when students arrive, it’s no wonder if they feel pressed to demonstrate, both to others and to themselves, that they are one of those best and brightest — that they are brilliant, already accomplished, and thus worthy of the investments bestowed upon them. So, sometimes it’s not just their image in the eyes of the world; it’s their image in their own eyes.
However, this focus on image presents a challenge in complex, emergent situations. Here’s the thing: it’s hard to demonstrate what you know — to produce amazing results — and at the same time honor what you don’t know — the not-knowing, the messy process of coming to know. It’s hard to be open to uncertainty and ambiguity, things critical to learning, when we are intensely focused on showing what we already know.
If we think each product we make — a paper, a thesis, a professional accomplishment — has to carry the weight of showing the world our true potential, the high stakes can become paralyzing. And often a second challenge arises: The inclination to discuss this predicament collides with the concern about risking one’s image. Many of us, including faculty members, save this subject for the situations in which we feel the most secure, or we don’t discuss it at all. The Success-Failure Project at Harvard is one effort to create places for reflection and discussion of these issues.
This dilemma can take on various shapes in post-Harvard life. It can manifest in career choices and an avoidance of professional risks, even those risks that might lead to more satisfying careers and unexpected discoveries. Some scientist colleagues tell me they shun some innovative research directions in favor of research that is more likely to produce clear, expedient results. Some students and alums say they feel a powerful obligation to their families for years of guidance and financial support and, understandably, that can pull them toward more certainty and less risk in their decision-making.
But I also know some students and alums who ask themselves what they genuinely enjoy and what kind of life they want, and then they pursue some version of that, even as they keep their families’ wishes and needs in mind. And many families, if not immediately, eventually appreciate their students’ efforts to make an authentic, meaningful life. Some graduates decide to devote years to exploring an idea. And an increasing number of companies and graduate schools say they want colleagues and scholars who can take intelligent risks, who understand that the best discoveries and innovations often involve many mistakes and false starts.
Of course, there isn’t a single solution to this dilemma, but some students, alums, and faculty eventually arrive at some questions that help them approach it with integrity and discernment: As a leader, how can I help create systems that affirm the dignity of real learning—systems that recognize mistakes as integral to true excellence? How can I invite friends and colleagues to discuss what helps them take intelligent, worthwhile, creative risks? What problems seem worth solving? What might bring me genuine satisfaction in the long term of my life?
Entertaining such questions over time will seldom lead to simple, permanent answers, but it can lay the foundation for a different kind of security, the security of living a life that, while perhaps less predictable, honors the reality of how knowledge happens: through disturbance, confusion, failure, and the unforeseen possibilities they unlock.

After the Harvard chapter of sorority Kappa Alpha Theta disaffiliated from its international organization to become gender-neutral last August, the new group tried to retain part of its past, dubbing itself Theta Zeta Xi.
College administrators didn’t like the moniker.
The Dean of Students Office asked the group members to rebrand themselves if they wanted administrative recognition to shelter their members from College policies, which penalize single-gender social organizations, Rena N. Simkowitz ’19 wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Simkowitz — who is the former CEO of Harvard’s Theta chapter — and the group’s other leaders at the time eventually settled on the name “Themis Asteri,” evoking a Greek goddess instead of Greek row.
“Personally, one of the hardest parts of undergoing the transition to be an RSO was that even when I was dedicating multiple hours a day to the process of transitioning my organization, I felt like I was never doing enough,” Simkowitz, an inactive Crimson sports editor, wrote. “The bar that I needed to reach in order to ensure that members of my group would not be sanctioned for their affiliation was constantly going up.”
Themis Asteri is one of 14 organizations listed by the Dean of Students Office as a “Recognized Social Organization” for the 2018-2019 school year.
The designation represents the practical culmination of the College’s social group sanctions, first announced in 2016 by former University President Drew G. Faust. The sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of unrecognized single-gender groups from holding campus leadership positions, captaining varsity athletic teams, and receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
After three years of protests, committees, shifting rationales, lobbying, and lawsuits, the implementation and effect of the policy are finally beginning to take shape.
But onlookers and club-members say the landscape of social groups remains sprawling and complicated. As the new recognized social groups turn one year old, the policies have led to a group of social clubs stumbling toward change, documents littered with administrative lingo, and a still-murky future for social life at the College.
When Faust first debuted the sanctions three years ago, she and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the policy aimed to combat a rising tide of sexual assault on campus, including incidents from within the walls of all-male final clubs.
The sanctions drew intense protests from women’s groups almost immediately. Rallying in Harvard Yard, they argued that the policy would eliminate fledgling all-female groups rather than their more entrenched all-male counterparts.
Last August, their predictions came true. For three months, the College was without all-female groups as both sororities and female final clubs buckled under College pressure.
After the sorority Alpha Phi returned to campus in December, Harvard now boasts one. National Panhellenic Conference Chief Executive Officer Dani Weatherford said the new chapter is much smaller than its predecessor as many former members have since chosen to join a gender-neutral club, the Ivy.
Of the 14 recognized organizations listed by the DSO website, nine are former women’s groups and five are former men’s groups.
Simkowitz wrote that she thinks the sanctions’ differential impact stems from the unique mission of all-female groups. She wrote that, because the missions of women’s groups are often leadership- and service-oriented, their members tend to seek the opportunities affected by the sanctions.
“The University has created a policy that makes it impossible for women's organizations, which were founded with leadership-focused missions, to exist, while many of the men's groups are still thriving on campus with little-to-no structural or cultural changes following the implementation of Harvard’s social organization policy,” she wrote.
“In practice, Harvard’s policy, explicitly targeting leadership opportunities, was a direct attack only at the women’s organizations,” she added.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment.
Chiara “Kiki” Albanese ’19, a former member of the IC Club, said she thinks the policy has strayed far from its initial purpose. She said women’s groups have become “collateral damage.”
“The irony in taking away women’s spaces, in order to work on the issue of sexual assault on campus, was kind of laughable to me, because anecdotally, that’s, I think, one of the more protective measures,” she said.
When the female groups disappeared last summer, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller wrote in a statement that he was pleased both formerly all-male and all-female groups applied for College recognition.
“These applications represent a cross section of male, female and multi-gender groups, as well as fraternities, sororities and final clubs,” Miller wrote. “We are thrilled to have received so many applications, and excited to begin working with all of these groups.”
For both formerly all-male and all-female groups, the path to recognition has been far from uniform. Several former club leaders said they have seen inconsistencies between groups on the path to RSO status.
Simkowitz and former Oak Club president Christopher P. Ulian ’19 said that, in addition to changing names, some groups have had to “rebrand” in order to appeal to recruits of different genders. They said administrators advocated changes — such as new titles, logos, and organization colors — in order to make sure the RSOs are totally new groups rather than repackaged versions of sororities and fraternities.
The Themis Asteri website states that its “founders saw [the new name] as reflective of our organization's commitment to always strive to make decisions that are in the best interest of current and future Harvard students.”
Other clubs, though, have allegedly had to make fewer changes to make it onto the RSO list. Several club leaders and members with knowledge of the matter said that the Delphic and Bee Clubs, which share a house on Linden Street, are merged in name only. They said the two clubs hold many separate events and selected members independently last fall.
Undergraduate and graduate leaders from both the Delphic and the Bee did not respond to requests for comment.
Ulian wrote in an email that leaders of several recognized social groups formed a council after a series of group meetings with administrators beginning in the fall of 2017. He said the leaders strategize over how to navigate the road to recognition.
“It has provided opportunities for the clubs to have a hand in creating and implementing the recognition process, both through the representation that the co-presidents have on the RSO committee and by allowing club leadership to provide formal feedback and occasionally pushback to the administration,” he wrote.
Ulian said he broadly agrees with administrators’ decision to make different asks of different groups.
“There are also differences in the actual mechanics of each group's transition process, because each group is coming from a different place,” he added.
Once a group makes it onto the DSO’s list of compliant organizations, its work is far from over. To stay in the administration’s good graces, it must continue to demonstrate compliance with the policies.
Assistant Dean for Student Engagement and Leadership Kate Colleran wrote in an emailed statement that her office will continue to work with recognized groups to ensure they fall in line with the sanctions. To shield their members from the College penalties, groups must prove that they have a gender-inclusive roster each year.
“We have been in regular communication with all of our RSO’s and these conversations have been very useful and productive. We plan to continue engaging with them, not only to ensure compliance with the policy, but to assist with any issues that may come up and make sure they have what they need in order to be successful,” Colleran wrote.
“All of our RSOs have demonstrated a commitment to gender inclusion and must continue to do so,” she added. “Each group is asked to submit an annual gender breakdown.”
Last spring, the DSO created a three-tier system of recognition for social groups: “Interim Recognition,” “Full Recognition,” and “Recognition with Distinction.”
The three tiers have varying requirements. Depending on which level a social organization is seeking, College administrators may ask its leaders to produce house rules, complete alcohol-related trainings, or create plans to reduce members’ financial burden.
All tiers do, however, have two major components in common. One is a gender-neutrality requirement. The other is a mandatory divorce from outside influence, whether from a national Greek organization or a graduate board that wields control over groups’ day-to-day affairs.
“Our intention has been to ensure that all organizations are operating independently from national or graduate boards, meaning that these boards are not involved in the group’s day-to-day operations, budget management or guidance of overall mission,” Colleran wrote.
Some social organization leaders said they faced as much difficulty in meeting the “local autonomy” requirement as they did in going gender-neutral.
Simkowitz wrote that the requirement to separate from her organization’s national sorority proved time-consuming.
“[It was] a complex, multi-step process that involved first formerly disaffiliating from Kappa Alpha Theta, an international sorority, and then incorporating a new, locally-autonomous 501(c)7 organization with by-laws that would enable us to be co-ed,” she wrote.
She added that she feels administrators have not adequately recognized the challenge that meeting their standards poses. In particular, she pointed to the difficulties social group leaders face when trying to shift their groups’ traditions and culture.
“Over the last year, the Theta leadership has worked tirelessly to figure out the best way to structurally build an organization from the ground up while also navigating the complex task of how to best approach integrating men into a space that was formerly designed for women,” Simkowitz wrote.
Fly Club graduate president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 wrote in an email that he thinks many of the all-male final clubs, including his own, may consider admitting members of all gender identities in the future. But he added that they will always resist other parts of the policy: College oversight and the mandate to sever clubs’ graduate and undergraduate arms.
“The central issue is the organizational autonomy of self-sustaining off-campus social organizations that involve students and alumni and that make no use of Harvard’s name or resources,” Porteus wrote.
“‘Gender neutrality’ has been a Crimson herring, used by the administration to divert attention from other, indeed onerous requirements for official ‘recognition,’ supposedly the only alternative to sanctions,” he added.
Goldman declined to comment on the College’s requirement that organizations operate independently from a national or graduate board.
Despite the staunch holdouts, Ulian and Colleran both wrote that they are hopeful about the future of sanctions-compliant groups at the College.
“The Dean of Students Office is committed to engaging in regular dialogue with all of our social organizations to ensure that they are getting the most out of their time at Harvard College, and that they have the guidance and resources needed to meet their full potential,” Colleran wrote.
“I'm optimistic about the future of RSOs, and excited to see the ideas that new classes will bring,” Ulian wrote.
The sanctions have survived a series of internal reviews and repeatedly won the endorsement of the University’s top administrators. But the policy’s advocates also currently face an external challenge: a pair of lawsuits brought in December by a group of plaintiffs including the national organizations for several fraternities and sororities and three unnamed male final club members.
The suits allege that the sanctions infringe upon students’ freedom of association and discriminate against them on the basis of sex. After receiving competing filings from both sides in March and April, state and federal judges will decide whether to let the case move forward.
Administrators will also likely face their first real challenges enforcing the penalties in the coming months. As members of the Class of 2021 enter their junior year, they will be eligible for a growing number of the athletic captaincies and leadership positions that fall under the sanctions.
Though College officials have repeatedly denied that they will use an anonymous reporting system to seek out students who violate the policy, they have also declined to specify exactly what system they plan to use. Still, Ulian said that, after meeting with administrators, he is sure the sanctions have teeth.
As for students in recognized organizations, they must both continue to meet the administration’s standards and prove that they can flourish long-term.
Porteus wrote that, in the coming year, both administrators and RSOs have a steep climb ahead compared to some of the centuries-old final clubs.
“Harvard administrators have yet to prove that socially engineered student social organizations — conceived and policed by itinerant deans with no long-term commitment to Harvard — have a robust future independent of sanctions,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard fossil fuel and prison divestment activists launched pledges this week calling on alumni to withhold donations to the University until administrators concede to their demands.
The campaign comes as part of a broader effort to publicize their causes during Commencement this year. Divest Harvard and Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — which advocate for divestment from the fossil fuel industry and companies with ties to United States prisons, respectively — have called on students to wear orange to commencement and petition Harvard alongside the donor pledge.
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign released their donor pledge Monday, while Divest Harvard recirculated a pledge originally issued in 2017. Both pledges urge alumni to pause their donations to Harvard until it withdraws its nearly $40 billion endowment from fossil fuel or prison-related companies and reinvests its money in causes the groups believe to be more sustainable.
HPDC’s pledge reiterates its call for Harvard to disclose its investments in prison-related companies, divest from those entities, and reinvest in rehabilitating people affected by “the prison-industrial complex.”
“We, the undersigned, pledge not to donate to Harvard until it discloses its endowment holdings in and divests from companies that are profiting from the prison-industrial complex, and takes meaningful steps to repair harm and rebuild wealth for Black, brown and poor communities pursuant to the demands of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign,” the pledge reads.
HPDC’s pledge also encourages donors to invest in a new fund for organizations that will redistribute the donations among those locally affected by mass incarceration.
Harvard Law School student and HPDC organizer Anneke F. Dunbar-Gronke said the pledge was designed to prioritize reinvestment, especially for an institution like Harvard.
“We’re showing them that this is what reinvestment looks like,” Dunbar-Gronke said. “It looks like putting money into democratically led, community-led groups and pools where people who are most impacted by the harms that these institutions have benefited from then get to do with that money what is best for the community.”
Divest Harvard organizer Isa C. Flores-Jones ’19 said the group decided to recirculate their two-year old donor pledge after HPDC released their own.
“As result of conversation together, we also thought that now it might be a good time to relaunch and sort of strengthen this call across the College, asking everybody not to donate,” Flores-Jones said.
The pledge calls on Harvard to “show moral leadership” by divesting from fossil fuels and urges signatories to withhold their donations to the College until the University entirely divests its fossil fuel holdings and reinvests in “just and sustainable” alternatives.
This is not the first time Divest Harvard and HPDC have collaborated. In April, the groups coordinated a protest at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum during an event in which University President Lawrence S. Bacow was slated to speak.
The groups’ April protest came amid a semester of intensifying calls for fossil fuel and prison divestment. Divest Harvard and HPDC have held their own rallies in Harvard Yard, released several petitions, and met personally with Bacow.
In addition to the donor pledges, alumni from the classes of 1964 to 1975 wrote a letter in coordination with Divest Harvard and HPDC to Bacow supporting the two groups and urging Harvard to “play a far more public leadership role” in addressing the issues of climate change and mass incarceration.
Alumni who signed the letter — members of a particularly political generation on Harvard’s campus — said they saw divestment to be imperative.
“Investment in fossil fuels and prisons are moral evils,” Heather B. Cantino ’72 wrote in an email. “Harvard's wealth and commitment to science and truth obligate it to divest.”
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 said he believes climate change is “one of the great existential crisis." He added that over the course of meetings with alumni and faculty about divestment, he has come to recognize the disagreements that exist among people’s opinions on divestment .
“As I’ve said at the end of many of these meetings, the one thing I can guarantee you in the Harvard community is there are enough different views that sometimes you have to agree to disagree,” Lee said in an interview last week.
Both Divest Harvard and HPDC are also uniting for another in-person demonstration during this year’s Class Day and Commencement. The groups are planning on wearing orange pins and wristbands for the College’s Class Day Wednesday and decorating their mortarboards with orange for the University-wide Commencement exercises Thursday.
"We are asking all students to use the space provided by their mortarboard cap to send the message to the University… and to anybody who might be watching this graduation ceremony that we will not remain silent and complicit in the actions that our university is taking elsewhere around the world,” Flores-Jones said.
“Essentially, we’re asking that our diplomas and degrees remain free of investments in the climate crisis and prison industrial complex, respectively,” she added.
Flores-Jones said these actions were an example of “joyful organizing” at the close of the academic year.
“I think it’s celebrating the community that we’ve built together here on campus, in calling for awareness of these issues and calling for awareness of all of our institution… of all of the ways that institutions are implicated in these violent industries,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 said the Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — was briefed on and supports Harvard administrators’ recent decisions to relieve Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. of his Winthrop House faculty deanship and to sanction former professor Jorge I. Dominguez.
In an interview Thursday, Lee said that though he and Sullivan are friends, he ultimately supported Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s choice not to renew Sullivan and his wife Stephanie R. Robinson as faculty deans of Winthrop House because the climate in the House had become “untenable.”
Khurana announced his decision May 11 — ending more than three months of activism calling on Sullivan to step down after he decided to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his sexual abuse case. Sullivan told the judge presiding over the case May 10 he would no longer represent Weinstein.
A day before Khurana’s announcement, The Crimson reported allegations brought by a dozen current and former Winthrop students, tutors, and staff that Sullivan and Robinson — who both teach at Harvard Law School — had created a toxic environment in the House for more than three years.
“Ron Sullivan’s a friend. I’m on the Law School faculty with him. My daughter has taught for him. And so I know Ron and Stephanie well and I respect them,” Lee said. “We recognize the things they’ve done, but it was the right decision.”
Sullivan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Lee — who also serves as one of the head trial lawyers for Harvard’s case against anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions — drew on his own experience as an attorney and said he understands the issues with the scandal were never about the right to representation, but rather about the environment in Winthrop.
“I think that this has never been about the right to counsel or representation. It can be hard to be faculty dean and trial lawyer at the same time because you can have competing imperatives,” Lee said. “It has always been for Dean Khurana and Dean [of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine] Gay a question of ‘Are we acting in the best interest of the students in Winthrop House? Is there an environment where they can prosper and succeed?’”
Sullivan, his colleagues at the Law School, and media commentators have argued that Harvard should not discipline him for fulfilling his duties as a lawyer and representing an controversial defendants. Some undergraduates have contended that Sullivan’s representation conflicted with his job as a faculty dean.
Lee added that students spend three years in undergraduate houses, and one of those years should not include “discomfort.”
“Having in mind that once you go to a house, you only have three years. So a year of discontent, discomfort, and ambiguity is one-third of your experience,” Lee said. “And as Dean Khurana said in his letter, that was the critically important issue, and we fully support the decision.”
Lee also said he and the Corporation support Gay’s decision to strip Dominguez of his emeritus status and ban him from Harvard’s campus after a months-long probe found that he had engaged in “unwelcome sexual conduct.” The Office for Dispute Resolution launched an investigation into Dominguez after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Dominguez faced sexual misconduct allegations spanning four decades from 18 women.
Shortly after Gay’s announcement on May 9, University President Lawrence S. Bacow informed members of a Government committee that Harvard would conduct an external review of the circumstances that led to the department’s failure to maintain a safe work environment.
Lee said Gay and Bacow presented the recommendations to revoke Dominguez’s emeritus status and bar him from Harvard’s campus to the Corporation.
“The recommendations that were implemented by the President and by Claudine, by the Dean of FAS, were reported to the Corporation simply because of the importance of the recommendations, and we fully supported their decision,” Lee said. “When I say came to us, it didn't require any action on our part. It was reporting to us on something that would be of some significant interest to the community.”
A lawyer for Dominguez did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As concert-goers swarmed Allston over the weekend for the annual Boston Calling music festival, local businesses and residents were divided on their feelings about the shows happening in their own backyard.
The festival, which takes place at the Harvard athletic complex on the Boston side of the Charles River, brings significant business to local restaurants over its three-day run, according to Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson.
“It has become a significant weekend in The Square,” Jillson said. “We’re grateful for the... opportunity to help our businesses.”
Jillson also said that the festival, which is a member of the Square’s business association, encourages younger visitors to the area.
“It’s becoming almost a rite of passage for young teens, and the number of young teens and families that attend the event is growing,” Jillson said. “The hope is always that they’ll....want to come back a lot.”
For years, Boston Calling was hosted at City Hall Plaza in the heart of Boston, but moved to Allston three years ago. This year, it featured performances by Twenty One Pilots, Tame Impala, and Travis Scott, among others.
Douglas Cho, who owns Boston Tea Stop in the Square, said that the first year after the move to Harvard, the music festival caused some disturbances that resulted in his store deciding to close earlier in the day the following year.
“The first year, we had a really, really high number of drunk people that… caused problems,” Cho said. “We actually ended up closing early a couple of the days just because it wasn’t worth the trouble.”
Cho said the beverage shop resumed regular hours this year after a marked decrease in disruptions.
“This year was probably the most mellow,” Cho said. “This year we just stayed open and it was fine for the most part.”
The move to Allston, however, has also caused issues for local residents who have complained about the volume of the music festival.
Angela Tang, a retired resident of Oak Square, said she was not notified in advance of the festival in a manner accessible to her, resulting in confusion on Sunday night when she could hear the music but could not identify the source of the noise.
“I walked about five blocks, at least five blocks, to see where the loud party comes from,” Tang said.
Tang said she hopes that in the future, the music festival will hand out flyers to notify senior residents that do not see social media alerts.
She also said she believes that Boston Calling should end performances at 10 p.m. in order to respect residents.
“I think 10 o’clock all the bands should be shut off,” Tang said.
Boston Calling did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon. The festival maintained a community hotline to field concerns throughout the festival’s run from Friday to Sunday.
Elaine M. Meehan, another Oak Square resident, offered a different perspective, noting that she enjoyed seeing Boston Calling hosted in Allston.
“I think it’s great where it is, I think it is very much in line with who Allston has really become as a part of the city,” Meehan said. “I would kind of be sad if they took it away.”
Meehan also commended Boston Calling and Harvard for its organization and communication in the form of traffic signs and social media postings.
“I do think that they do a very good job of controlling the environment around it making sure that people are… safe and the people are aware that Boston Calling is coming,” Meehan said.

As students head out of Harvard Square for the summer, another familiar place will be packing up too. John Harvard’s Brewery & Ale House will leave its flagship location May 30th.
The restaurant, which opened its Dunster Street location in 1992, operated a brewery until 2016, preceding the larger eatery’s departure later this month.
The departure caps a year of extensive commercial turnover in Harvard Square. Multiple restaurants, cafés, and stores — including Urban Outfitters, Crema Café, Chipotle, and Au Bon Pain — have closed their doors in recent months.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that the restaurant’s longevity in Harvard Square was a sign of its quality.
“As with many things… a restaurant life doesn’t usually exceed a couple of decades, and the fact that they went three decades is a testament to John Harvard’s Brewhouse,” Jillson said.
Several employees at the restaurant referred comment to Trinity Property Management, the real estate company that owns its space.
John Harvard’s Brewery spokesperson Paul Pettas said that the restaurant appreciated local residents' support after nearly 30 years.
“We appreciate being part of the community and we are grateful to everyone in the community,” Pettas said.
Pettas declined to provide further comment, including why the restaurant closed.
Pettas said that John Harvard’s had an “agreement” with its property owner not to say anything further.
“It was kind of the agreement that we made with the property owner that we would just say that, and that was the statement that we put out,” he said.
A spokesperson for Trinity could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
Several John Harvard’s patrons said they had enjoyed eating there and that they were surprised to hear it was closing.
Charlie M. Needle ’59, who was visiting Harvard for a reunion, dined at the restaurant Tuesday with his former Winthrop House roommate. He said that it was “excellent” and that he hadn’t known about the impending closure.
Harvard Law School student Christopher P. Childers, who also ate there Tuesday said he was sad to see a common Square destination close.
“I’ve been here a few times,” he said. “I feel like it’s a staple.”
Another patron lamented the changing landscape of restaurants in Harvard Square.
“I would rather support, you know, a smaller business than a chain,” said David R. Childers, Christopher’s father.
Those who are sad to see John Harvard’s ales no longer available in the Square can visit its Framingham, Mass. location.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College students gathered Tuesday evening for two commencement ceremonies honoring students from underrepresented backgrounds, one for Latinx students and another for black students.
The Harvard Latinx Graduation Ceremony — which took place in Radcliffe Yard — and Black College Graduation — which took place in Memorial Church — each celebrated more than 100 graduates.
Before the College-specific event, undergraduate and graduate students gathered in Radcliffe Yard Tuesday afternoon for a University-wide black commencement.
At the Latinx commencement ceremony, graduates received sarape stoles and listened to speakers who discussed their experiences at Harvard as Latinx students. The ceremony was narrated in both English and Spanish.
Harvard Extension School student Adan Beltrones Orozco began the event’s speaking portion with an address in Spanish. After that, Zoe D. Ortiz ’19, a Crimson editorial editor, delivered the undergraduate address, during which she urged her fellow graduates to remain proud of their Latinx heritage.
“I am a product of so many struggles and so much perseverance in the face of a country that doesn’t believe that I belong within its borders,” Ortiz said. “I am a brown girl, a Latina, taking up space and places that were not made with her in mind.”
Ana R. C. Andrade ’19, who attended the Latinx graduation ceremony, said she appreciated the inclusion of languages other than English in the event’s proceedings.
“So many parents, maybe Spanish or Portuguese speaking, who maybe feel a bit out of place in other Harvard events... can come into that space and really be greeted by a language that they know and have that bit of culture there,” Andrade said.
The College’s black graduation ceremony featured musical performances from students, presentations of awards, and a speech from Tatyana M. Ali ’02 — an actress best known for her role as Ashley Banks in the comedy series “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” Though Professor of the Practice of Public Policy Cornel R. West ’74 had been scheduled to speak, he was unable to make it to the ceremony.
In her keynote speech, Banks commended students for their accomplishments and encouraged them to make a “lasting impact” through meaningful relationships and support systems beyond college.
“Investing in your community will give you a sense of purpose much greater than yourself,” she said. “Continue to create community wherever you find it.”
Student speaker Devontae A. Freeland ’19 urged attendees to continuously examine “the meaning of black community” after graduation.
“How do we increase black solidarity that is inclusive of mixed race, queer, transgender, and Afro-Latinx communities?” Freeland asked. “How do we make space for other narratives of blackness?”
After the speeches, attendees took a moment of silence to remember Courtney S. Blair ’19, who passed away in 2018.
To conclude the event, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay presented kente stoles to the graduates with John S. Wilson — the former president of Morehouse College and a senior adviser and strategist to Harvard’s president. Gay became the first African American FAS dean in August.
This year’s ceremonies were not the first time Harvard hosted commencement exercises for students from historically marginalized groups. This year marked the fifth annual Latinx commencement and the third annual black commencement.
Several College students said they were frustrated that the University-wide Latinx graduation overlapped with the College’s ceremony for black students because they were unable to attend both.
Melonie N. Vaughn ’19, who attended Black College Graduation, said the conflict was “unfair” to students who identify as both Latinx and black.
“I identify equally with both. I’m a black Latina,” Vaughn said. “I shouldn't have to choose between my identities.”
Andrade said she thinks of both parts of her black and Latinx identity as “each a piece of the puzzle that is me.”
“By themselves, none of them really makes me feel complete,” she said. “That's why I wanted to be part of both of those [events] to fill those different parts of my identity.”
Andrade and Vaughn said they think the conflict stemmed from the fact that the Latinx graduation was organized primarily by graduate students who might not have known about the College-specific event for black students.
Andrade said she reached out to the Latinx Graduation Committee to inquire about the conflict. She said the organizing committee told her to notify them if she decided not to attend the University-wide event so they could open up a spot for someone on the waitlist.
“Immediately being hit with the, ‘If you’re not going, we’re giving your spot away for someone else’ in the moment felt a little jarring,” Andrade said.
The committee, which comprises nine graduate students and two administrators, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Andrade said she does not hold “any hard feelings” with either of the event planning committees despite the scheduling conflict.
“I think a lot of this comes from Harvard’s institutional lack of support, supporting all of these events, because it then falls on all students themselves,” she said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment.

After weathering a bevy of campus controversies, Harvard’s Class of 2019 will leave Cambridge behind and enter a world of tumultuous politics most seniors view with an increasing sense of doom.
Well over half of survey respondents — 68 percent — believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and an overwhelming majority (92 percent) view President Donald Trump unfavorably. More than half of graduating seniors believe the president should be impeached. When it comes to hot-button Harvard issues, meanwhile, students largely support Harvard’s race-conscious admissions system, currently the target of a high-profile lawsuit alleging racial discrimination. A majority of respondents also oppose the College’s controversial social group sanctions and want Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels.
Each year, The Crimson conducts a survey of Harvard’s graduating class of seniors, collecting data about where the class is headed next, how they spent their time at Harvard, and what they think of the College and the nation. This year’s edition drew 717 responses, representing roughly half the class. The survey, emailed to each senior, remained open from May 1 to May 18 and was anonymous. The Crimson adjusted the results by ethnicity and gender to account for non-response bias (see “Methodology” section for more). 
Though seniors may be pessimistic about the world they’re entering, and while some are dissatisfied with Harvard’s management of various campus crises, the vast majority of respondents indicated they feel upbeat about at least one thing: Close to 90 percent said that, given the chance, they would choose Harvard again.
Compare this year’s results to the Class of 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students will be attending Commencement ceremonies or enjoying the start to their summer vacations, the Harvard baseball team will be readying itself for the Super Regional round of the NCAA Baseball Tournament. After capping off their 27-13 regular season (14-7 Ivy), the winningest in many years, with a victory over Columbia in the Ivy League Championship, the Crimson is heading to Oklahoma City to face Oklahoma State on May 31st.
Harvard Baseball’s season has been one to remember. It featured a Beanpot Finals appearance, a broken saves record, a nation-leading slugger, and a historic nine-run ninth inning comeback. To top it all off, the team has made it to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2005, and the players could not be more excited.
“It’s obviously been a super fun year so far,” said senior first baseman Patrick McColl. “Playing in the Ivy League Championship and winning that on our home field has been an unbelievable experience. And we’re a super tight team, so it’s been the best. We get to keep playing, which is the best way to end a Harvard Baseball career.”
For McColl and the other seniors, the berth into the Tournament is especially meaningful. The veterans of the Crimson squad will leave their mark on the program as they don a Harvard uniform for the last couple of times.
“It’s awesome — it’s the best thing to go out on top,” McColl offered. “Winning an Ivy League Championship in any year is cool — it’s cool for the freshmen coming in right away and getting that win — but especially for us, the team struggled a little bit early on in our careers, so seeing that whole transformation and ending up on top in our last year is really special. We can all look back on an unbelievable experience that none of us will ever forget.
At the helm of Harvard Baseball is head coach Bill Decker, who received his share of accolades this year as he led the program. In November, Decker was named one of the most influential representatives of baseball by the New England Baseball Journal, and Decker was recently named Ivy League Baseball Coach of the Year. Decker’s leadership has been invaluable for the team throughout this year’s historic run.
Joining Decker with Ivy League honors is junior outfielder Jake Suddleson, who was named the Ivy League Baseball Player of the Year. The Crimson’s cleanup hitter, who broke Harvard’s single-season RBI record with 53 runs batted in, is joined by junior designated hitter Hunter Bigge and McColl himself on the first-team All Ivy list. Senior outfielder Ben Skinner’s name appears on the second team list, and junior infielder Chad Minato earned an All-Ivy Honorable Mention.
“The accolades are definitely well-deserved to everyone who got them,” McColl commented. “Everyone who got recognized worked really hard this year.”
The most significant games of the team’s season will be played on the road — so gone is the home field advantage that the Crimson has gotten accustomed to in the past few weeks. But now that it has been announced that Harvard will be facing off against Oklahoma State, the squad can prepare for the matchup much more effectively.
“We’re okay with the travelling thing — we’ve done that before early in the season when we had to fly places as a team — but we’ve been playing a lot at home, so going on the road is something we have to prepare for,” McColl added. “But it’s fun to go on a journey, go somewhere as a team where we’ve never been before. And it was a bit of a waiting game for a while — now that we know who we’re playing, we can really prepare and be ready.”
Heading into the contest, the team is excited and optimistic. A win in Oklahoma would be icing on the cake of a season for the ages.
“We’re unbelievably excited and super ready to play,” McColl said. “And hopefully we can surprise some people and go win a regional.”

Tutors have helped their students through a lot, whether undergraduates are applying for a fellowship or dealing with a third concentration change. They’ve seen it all when it comes to students slowly realizing their academic and pre-professional ambitions. In an effort to retrieve some of their wisdom in this commencement season, we emailed resident tutors from across campus asking for their advice for graduating seniors.
“Graduating from Harvard is an incredible achievement and you and your loved ones should be proud, but what happens next is the important part. Be kind in how you use your degree. Be thoughtful. Be fearless. You've been given a great gift and you'll have an opportunity to change the world with it. Best of luck!” — Alysha L. Johnson Williams, Resident Tutor, Quincy house
“Congratulations, seniors! My advice would be to try to make decisions based on what you think has the potential to make you happy, as opposed to what other people tell you that you “should” be doing, or as opposed to what your classmates are all doing. There can be a tendency to fall prey to groupthink and to worry about what other people will think of your choices. But the truth is, now is the best time in your life to take a risk and try something you’ve always wanted to try. You’ll always have that Harvard degree to fall back on, no matter what happens!” — Tom J. Roberts, Resident Tutor, Currier House
“Learn how to cook at least one meal really, really well, preferably multi-course. Travel as much as possible, because pretty soon you won’t have the time or the energy. Reread your favorite children’s books to remind yourself what it felt like to be a kid. And check in with the people whom you know need help—even if they stop responding.” — Joseph K. Lee, Senior Resident Tutor, Adams house
“When trying to figure out your next steps in the coming years, whether that be a job, more education, or something else, talk with as many people as you can to hear about the paths that led them to where they are today. Don’t hesitate to reach out to anyone in your circles (or even a loose connection’s circles)! As long as you are gracious, most people are happy to share their thoughts, which can be very helpful in finding your own path. A few years from now when a recent Harvard grad asks you for your time and thoughts, you’ll be happy to return the favor.” — Meredith Dost, Resident Tutor, Quincy House
“Life is long. Now is the time to try things that you are passionate about, even things that might not meet societal/family expectations. Following your heart when making decisions about career and life will never steer you wrong.” — Avik Chatterjee, Resident Tutor, Currier House
