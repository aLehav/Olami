After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Grand Nationxl is a hip-hop and artist collective from the San Francisco Bay Area that intends to reshape music industry norms around empathy.
“Wellness is the genre,” said Grand Nationxl founder, rapper-producer Kevin Allen, in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Our collective is based on taking care of each other and building an ecosystem that comes before music and before the art.”
Allen, formerly known as Erk tha Jerk, created Grand Nationxl in early 2020, bringing together over 15 artists, including A&R manager and rapper Brookfield Duece and rapper Mani Draper.
The group initially emerged from weekly recording sessions at Slapwagon Studios in Oakland, Calif. with Allen, Brookfield Duece, and Draper.
“We just started doing sessions together and it became a routine on Thursday nights,” Allen said. “I was thinking that I knew a lot of dope artists and they probably knew a lot of dope people, so it’d be dope if we all just made music.”
With each consecutive Thursday night session, the original group continued to add members, combining Allen’s rap artist network in the Bay Area with Draper’s connections to local live musicians.
Although Grand Nationxl is a newly formed entity, Draper said that individual group members, like Allen, have played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Bay Area rap scene.
“We've always been part of it and ingrained in it,” Draper said. “We just had to take a different route in order to do it together.”
During his time as Erk tha Jerk, Allen mentored Bay Area producer P-Lo whose collaborations with artists like The HBK Gang, ALLBLACK, and Offset Jim have set the tone for the Bay Area rap sound over the last several years.
Allen, Brookfield Duece, and Draper agreed that one of the greatest strengths of Grand Nationxl is the collective’s ability to leverage the past experiences of each member.
Following just a few weeks of recording at Slapwagon, Allen said that the group became official, recognizing the quality of music that they were able to produce together.
“The album started to form,” Allen said. “From there, the collective kind of took shape and was born. We realized we needed merch and something to sell. We can't just talk over beats all day.”
The teamwork and power of shared knowledge that helped unite the group immediately became one of its strongest selling points, according to Grand Nationxl marketing consultant Danielle Allen.
“Bringing everybody together in this opened our eyes to the idea that a label isn't enough,” she said. “You get in there, and it's not necessarily what you expected it to be.”
“Us being together and having each other to lean on, prevents us from falling into traps and equips us to know how to move forward,” Allen added.
After coming up with several dozen potential group names, the nascent collective settled on the moniquer Grand Nationxl, a reference to the Buick Grand National sports car that was popular in the Bay Area in the late 1980s.
According to Brookfield Duece, the car was a less expensive alternative to luxury sports car brands like Corvette, but owning one was seen as a status symbol in the Bay Area.
“It’s supercharged with a lot of horsepower for a car out of stock,” Brookfield Duece said. “Everyone in the hood bought one. It was a really fancy car for someone just living at home with their mom or just still being in the hood.”
“The name chose us,” he said. “None of us are big on our own, but together we all feel like we are high level sports cars. We all feel like we're at a high level of performance.”
In June 2020, the group released their first album “Twice on Sunday Season 01,” debuting at #3 on the Apple Music Hip-Hop charts. In the latter half of 2020, Grand Nationxal released six more projects, three of which broke into the top 10 on the Apple Music chart.
Draper said that the team-player attitude among Grand Nationxl members and the ability to check egos at the door has been a key to their success.
“If you look at the most successful albums over the last 20 years and go read the liner notes, there's 40 people on there,” Draper said.
“Brockhampton, Griselda, Dreamville — look at who is having the most success,” he added. “It's crews like us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard battled through a hard-fought 110 minutes to secure a 1-1 draw at Bryant University on Saturday afternoon. The extra time ensued after regulation was not enough to separate the two sides. In the overtime session, neither team was able to find the golden goal despite both squads coming close in an end-to-end affair.
Harvard (1-0-1, 0-0 Ivy) had more corners and shots on goal than Bryant on the night, outshooting the Bulldogs 27-15, the highest shot tally for the Crimson since November 2015. Despite this shooting advantage, Harvard could not find the elusive second goal, settling instead for a draw.
The Crimson found itself behind halfway through the first half when Bryant took the lead through sophomore defender Abdel Talabi. Talabi rose higher than Harvard’s defense on a Bryant corner kick to head the ball home, putting the Bulldogs ahead on one of their two shots in the first half.
After going behind, the Crimson kept creating chances but could not find the back of the net until just before the halftime break. With just over a minute to play in the half, senior forward Nico Garcia-Morillo levelled for Harvard with a stunning first-time volley from a tight angle just inside the box. Garcia-Morillo found space for the shot after first-year forward Ale Gutierrez picked out the senior’s run with a perfectly-weighted long ball, after battling to retain possession in midfield.
“Ale Gutierrez played a beauty of a through-ball. Then, once the ball popped up, it was the perfect height for a volley,” Garcia-Morillo said of the goal. “I didn't think twice and ripped it second post. Thankfully it went in.”
Bryant settled into the game in the second half as the Crimson’s early intensity declined somewhat throughout the match. The shot margin narrowed in the second stanza, with Harvard edging the Bulldogs 9-6 in shots, closing the gap from the Crimson’s 13-shot advantage in the first frame. Bryant almost stole the points in the 78th minute, as a flicked-on header from senior midfielder Jonathan Brackett off a long throw-in rattled the woodwork. Despite some close calls, Harvard stayed disciplined on defense throughout, dealing with long throws into the box from Bryant’s Talabi all afternoon.
Garcia-Morillo almost sealed a dream performance eight minutes into extra time, as the forward charged into Bryant’s defensive third and fired a shot at goal which beat Bryant’s goalkeeper, but the Florida native was denied by the crossbar, and play went on.
The game continued in this end-to-end fashion, with Bryant nearly breaking Harvard hearts just a minute after Garcia-Morillo’s chance. With ten seconds to play in 1OT, the Crimson cleared a cross to the edge of the box, only to see a Bryant shot come in and be saved off the line by junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson. The danger was not gone though, as Bryant headed the rebound on target for what seemed like a sure game-winner. Somehow Nilsson got up to make the save, keeping the game alive as the first period of extra time drew to a close.
“Obviously it felt great to keep us in the game and give us another period of extra time to try to win the game,” Nilsson said of the save. “Especially at that stage of the game and given that we had dominated that first period overall.”
Nilsson made six saves on the night and is now averaging 6.5 saves per game through two games this season. Despite his heroics in extra time, Harvard could not rally to find the game-winner.
“We managed to come back after conceding the first goal, and now our focus is to put on a good performance on Tuesday,” Nilsson continued. “We’ve been waiting a long time to play on our home field, and hopefully we walk off with a strong performance and a win.”
Harvard returns home to face Northeastern on Tuesday after playing its opening two games on the road. Meanwhile, the Huskies will be looking to pick up momentum from a 2-1 win over Hofstra as the cross-town foe enters the matchup with the Crimson. Tuesday’s game at Jordan Field will also mark the first men’s game played at Jordan in almost two years. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard continued its solid start to the season on Sunday, defeating Monmouth 4-1 in New Jersey. The Crimson got two more goals from junior standout Angela Caloia, who now has five tallies in five games. Senior forward Murphy Agnew chipped in two goals of her own, opening the scoring in the 25th minute and closing it in the 86th. The Monmouth match marked the second game of the week for the Crimson, who tied Power-5 opponent Boston College on Thursday in a back-and-forth game that saw multiple lead changes, six second-half goals, and a pair of scoreless overtimes immediately after the goal frenzy.
With just two games separating Harvard from its Ivy League opener against Penn on Sept. 25, now is a good time to take a step back and consider the Crimson’s performance in its first five games. Harvard remains undefeated through five games for the first time since 1996, a season in which it went 15-2-0 overall and won all seven league games. It is an encouraging start to the season for a team with serious hopes of winning the Ivy League. Here are some takeaways from the opening few weeks of the season.
YOUTH MOVEMENT
Given the strength of the two recruiting classes the coaching staff has brought in since this team last played in 2019, it comes as no surprise that many of the underclassmen have immediately staked claims to major roles on the team. Four of the team’s six leaders in minutes are first-year players: center-back Jade Rose, midfielders Hannah Bebar and Josefine Hasbo, and forward Ainsley Ahmadian. Bebar scored a fantastic game-winning goal against St. John’s, while Hasbo, a Danish international, is already one of the Crimson’s most important players, buzzing around midfield, orchestrating attacks, and making well-timed runs into the box like the one that netted her a goal on Thursday against Boston College. The talented first-year players make Harvard a better all-around team than it was in 2019, and the improvement may accelerate as the Crimson’s underclassmen continue to settle in.
CHANCE CREATION
While Harvard has had some inconsistent performances, the one constant has been its tendency to rack up shots. The Crimson has outshot its opponents 96-33 in five games, or about 19-7 in the average game. Many of these shots have come from outside the box, and after the St. John’s game, head coach Chris Hamblin spoke about the difficulty of generating good chances against a team willing to sit back and soak up pressure.
“When they have a lot of numbers around their defensive area, you’re not going to get many clean-cut chances,” Hamblin said. “So we’ve got to work to move the ball out quicker to open them up a little bit.”
In the Boston College game, Harvard showed some signs of being less stagnant in the attack. First, Ahmadian picked up the ball in midfield, drove at the defense, and delivered a perfectly weighted through ball to Hasbo, who needed only to slot the ball past the Eagles’ goalie. Then, it took just three passes from Harvard’s defense to cut open Boston College’s defense and give Agnew a chance to finish from point-blank range. This was a marked change from the start of the season when the Crimson fired 22 mostly low-percentage shots at the Fairfield goal and only notched a single tally.
Bebar and Ahmadian have combined to take 32 shots, 16 on target, but have scored only one goal (Bebar’s golden goal against St. John’s). As their scoring chances continue to mount, odds are that the lifelong friends and Chicago natives will break through and find the scoresheet. Add that to the goal per game from the center forward Caloia and the dynamism of Agnew and Hasbo, and this Crimson group can quickly become a team that will threaten its opponents in a variety of ways.
DEFENSIVE INCONSISTENCY
While the Crimson’s attack has improved recently, defensive questions remain after the team gave up two set-piece goals to St. John’s in the second half and then shipped three more second-half goals against Boston College. At its defensive best, Harvard is stifling, pressing hard and forcing turnovers in possession after no more than two or three passes. In the first half against St. John’s, the Red Storm rarely possessed the ball for more than a few seconds and struggled to sustain possession in the Crimson’s final third.
But in the second half, as St. John’s began to come out of its defensive shell, Harvard was not able to keep up the defensive intensity, instead beginning to cede territory and possession in midfield. The Red Storm managed seven shots in the second half after taking just two in the first. For the most part, the Crimson still kept St. John’s from creating dangerous chances — the Red Storm’s two goals both came off of corner kicks, which is a separate issue for Hamblin and his coaching staff to address. It is also not realistic to expect high-level pressing over the course of 90 minutes, but Harvard can probably find a better balance. This is especially true given that the best Ivy League teams will likely offer far more going forward than most teams Harvard has played so far this year. The Crimson has tended to field attack-minded lineups so far this season, but Harvard will have to be careful to remain solid at the back if it does not want a repeat of 2019’s four goals conceded to Brown.
THREE-TEAM RACE?
The Crimson’s strong start is worth putting into some Ivy League perspective. Harvard’s biggest competition in the league could be Brown again. The Bears return seven of the nine players who started at least 15 games in 2019, including the dynamic attack of Ava Seelenfreund and Brittany Raphino, whom Crimson fans might remember from their impact on Brown’s 4-2 win at Ohiri Field in 2019. And while Brown has taken two losses already, they have come against Hofstra and Notre Dame, two teams that receive votes in the Top 25 and are probably better than anyone Harvard has played. The schools play one common opponent before the league schedule kicks off: Northeastern, whom the Crimson plays this upcoming Wednesday before Brown does next Sunday. The respective results this week might provide a small hint as to the relative strengths of 2019’s Ivy League champions and runners-up. In any case, the teams’ matchup on October 16 stands out on the calendar as the Ivy League season approaches.
Princeton is the other team to look out for this season, especially after a victory over No. 9 Rutgers earlier this week in Piscataway, N.J. The Tigers are undefeated heading into a Thursday matchup with Hofstra. Like Harvard, Princeton has some promising underclassmen who have made instant impacts, making the Tigers something of a dark horse in the Ancient Eight title race.
