The creative genesis of “I Am Number Four” is not difficult to reconstruct: in this age of smoothie meals and mixed salads, somebody at Dreamworks decided it would be a great idea to make a dual-genre movie that combined the teen angst of “Twilight” with the bombast of “Transformers.” While in theory this may have seemed like a good concept, in practice, D.J. Caruso’s attempted amalgam of cinematic styles rapidly devolves into a showy Michael Bay action flick which substitutes characterization and plot with impressive CGI creatures and intense fight sequences.
The opening of “I Am Number Four” feels very familiar. Echoing the start of “Twilight,” it introduces Number Four (Alex Pettyfer), a hunky yet troubled teenager who has recently been forced to move to a place called Paradise, OH, which “should have been called Irony, OH.” His backstory? He is one of nine alien children—the last of their race, of course—taken to Earth because they have “legacies”—special powers that will allow them to defeat the destructive race of Mogadorians. These Mogadorians are hunting down the children one by one, conveniently in order. Seeking to blend into the populace, Number Four takes on the unassuming alias ‘John Smith,’ and he and his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant) try to look natural. Henri stays home as a ‘writer’ while John heads off to school.
This is where “I Am Number Four” takes its teen movie turn, with Dianna Agron of “Glee” fame starring as the obligatory gorgeous ex-cheerleader love interest, Sarah. Within 10 film minutes, John and Sarah are madly in love and eating dinner at her parents’ house—unfortunately for the movie, the one thing CGI cannot do is character development.
To John’s dismay, the local quarterback hotshot (Jake Abel) still claims Sarah as his own, and typical high school drama ensues—complete with a missing father, a local spring festival, and a haunted house. Of course, there comes a scene in every superhero’s movie when he must save his beau from the clutches of evil. In this case, it isn’t the Mogadorians, but rather the more laughable menace of the school’s quarterback—backed by a football team which has somehow acquired night-vision goggles for the smackdown. The acting in these sequences is exactly what one would expect from the “Glee” backdrop—shallow, unbelievable, and predictably paint-by-numbers.
What saves the movie from its own silliness and soppiness are its true villains, the Mogadorians—tall, ugly aliens with red eyes who could easily serve as doubles for Lord Voldemort in the “Harry Potter” series. As John absurdly attempts to survive high school, the genuinely frightening Mogadorians are tracking him down in their Mustangs, alternatively passing as humans in prosthetics and scaring little children without them. Their well-realized malevolence lends actual urgency to a storyline that would otherwise be confused for daft dramedy.
The finale of “I Am Number Four” brings all the genre confusion and assorted awkwardness to a head, as each of the movie’s cinematic styles are stacked implausibly atop one another. In classic Michael Bay form, the film culminates with an epic battle scene. But in classic “Glee” form, that fight scene incongruously takes place in a football stadium. Finally, in classic superhero form, viewers get to watch John’s hands light up like flashlights and discover just what he can do with his much-vaunted superhuman powers. But as the audience has no investment in the characters or storyline, the climax is all flash and no substance. Viewers who are not 14-year-old girls looking for the next Edward Cullen should consider themselves forewarned.

Ed Helms seems to like road trips. His last major movie, “The Hangover,” depicted a debaucherous weekend trip to Las Vegas in which he consumed copious amounts of alcohol and drugs, got cozy with a prostitute, and was savagely attacked by a stranger. Helms replicates all of these feats in “Cedar Rapids,” his newest vehicle—directed by Miguel Arteta—but this road trip to the sleepy eponymous Iowa city lacks the drive of its predecessor. Although successful in some respects, “Cedar Rapids” is to “The Hangover” as Cedar Rapids the city is to Las Vegas: much less energetic and much more forgettable.
Helms plays Tim Lippe, a geeky insurance agent who has lived in Brown Valley, Wis., all of his life. Not that he wants to leave; his greatest aspirations are to build a little green house in his backyard and raise a family. But after a colleague dies in a suspicious choking accident, Lippe is called upon to represent his company at a convention in Cedar Rapids.
The rest of the movie largely consists of Lippe trying to deal with and understand the workings of the foreboding outside world. He fails to comprehend both the standard practices of the city’s life—boarding a plane, checking in at a hotel—as well as the people who inhabit it. He is bewildered by the come-ons of fellow conference attendee Joan (Anne Heche) and the aggressive and free-for-all attitude of rival agent Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly). But of course, while trying to stay out of trouble, he entangles himself in several messy adventures and engages in the sort of behavior he originally detested. By the end of Lippe’s coming-of-age story, he has made a couple of great friends, fallen in love twice, dabbled in hard drugs, and triumphed in a battle of good versus evil.
Although all of this is standard fare for a comedy, “Cedar Rapids” doesn’t seem to be trying very hard to get laughs. The punch lines are minimal, and the movie dedicates a large amount of time to Lippe’s character development and relationship trials. The result is a movie uneasily balanced between farce and a genuine mid-life crisis drama. This confusion makes for an uncomfortable viewing experience—Tim Lippe is a fairly likable and honest guy with good intentions, and viewers feel guilty laughing at his mistakes and tribulations. Are they meant to mock him or identify with him?
Perhaps the movie’s main issue is Helms himself, who, although excellent in his supporting roles on “The Daily Show” and “The Office,” isn’t quite engaging enough to carry an entire film on his own. In “The Hangover,” he shared the spotlight with the arrogant Bradley Cooper and the eccentric Zach Galifianakis, allowing him to inhabit his shy and underwhelming character without feeling pressure to create comedy on his own. In “Cedar Rapids,” by contrast, he’s expected to provide the laugh lines almost single-handedly, and the results are spotty.
That said, Helms gets a lot of help from Reilly—Helms’s cutthroat competitor—whose charisma provides most of the energy in a film populated by largely uninspired performances. Reilly, like Helms, is used to playing supporting roles (“Chicago,” “Talladega Nights,” “Step Brothers”), and his own feature, “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story,” was largely a failure. But in “Cedar Rapids,” he looks quite comfortable as the crude and alcoholic Dean “Deanzy” Ziegler, reveling in cringe-inducing puns and body humor; some of the best moments in the film are his interactions with his roommate Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) and his superior Orin Helgesson (Kurtwood Smith).
“Cedar Rapids” has a modest cast and modest aspirations, and fairly portrays the Midwestern city vibe of its titular city. At the same time, it is hurt by its internal thematic contradictions and second-rate performances. “I think I did a fair to middlin’ job,” Wilkes comments proudly to Lippe and Ziegler at one point in the film. The same could be said about “Cedar Rapids.”

Liam Neeson’s most recent on-screen display of jaw-chiseling grit, “Unknown,” is an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink action thriller which seems to draw influence from the genre’s entire canon. After a spectacular chance car accident in a European city, American university professor Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) falls into a coma, waking up to find his memory fractured and his identity stolen by another man (Aidan Quinn). Even his wife Elizabeth (January Jones)—with whom repeated and graphic flashbacks tell us he has showered at least once—will not vouch for Harris’s identity to the police. Evading arrest, the real Martin Harris embarks on a mission to find the people who stole his identity. Along the way, he teams up with Gina (Diane Kruger), a hard-working illegal immigrant with a perfect figure, a heart of gold, and a wardrobe that changes in times of duress, much like her accent. And yet this delightful fluff is tarnished by delusions of artistic grandeur. “Unknown” persistently tries to transcend its genre but gets only halfway there, ironically ending up in the cinematic no-man’s land of films which lack any real identity of their own.
Venturing where few action thrillers dare to go, “Unknown” forsakes the usual themes of redemption, revenge, and personal reinvention, and instead chooses to explore the self. The audience is put into the mindset of Neeson’s Harris; frustratingly, we are not given much more information than the doctor himself. Viewers thus experience the surreal disorientation of the protagonist’s identity displacement first-hand. Director Jaume Collet-Serra, who pulls the audience into Harris’s predicament so completely, deserves credit for coaxing something meaningful out of a typically mindless genre. On the flip side, these high-minded directorial choices make other elements of the film unforgivable. What would normally be justifiable as over-the-top camp is now rendered unworthy and distracting.
A soaring and clichéd score, for instance, haunts every scene with any semblance of emotion. Sappy musical progressions instruct sympathy as opposed to suggesting it, in the style of such decidedly low-brow movies as “Armageddon.” Similarly, the usual attack on the senses that is so entertaining and engaging in traditional action thrillers is at odds with the film’s more reflective themes.
On top of these musical shortcomings, a rash of unconvincing performances populates “Unknown,” partly due to the clunky, clichéd dialogue of writers Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. Mistaking blandness for subtlety, January Jones does her best impression of a brick wall, while Liam Neeson is forced to work with lines like “I didn’t forget everything. I remember how to kill you, asshole.” While aspiring to action hero status of the Harrison Ford variety is no sin, and while Neeson admittedly brings an intensity and strength to his roles that few can match, his character’s unwieldy bravado leaves little room for the pretension that litters the film.
“Unknown” is replete with the sort of stock material that promises entertainment and genre-piety: a car chase through the streets of Berlin ending in the requisite explosion, a mistaken identity, a flashy Middle Eastern prince with dubious motives and even more dubious taste in facial hair, Bond-like spy devices, a ticking time bomb, and a secret code. In the end, the bad guys die, the guy gets the girl, and viewers leave the theater wanting to buy a Samsung phone and drive home in a Volkswagen. In other words, in the traditional action arena, the film delivers as well as the genre allows. But these elements are in constant tension with the movie’s more sophisticated and ponderous aspirations. The movie’s conflicting impulses are most pronounced when the film arrives at its obligatory climactic twist, which is fully understandable in a dramatic context but not in an action one. With a collection of cinematic qualities that fail to add up to a coherent whole, “Unknown” ends up as identity-challenged as its own protagonist.

There is not a single plucky heroine or Prince Charming to be found in Emma Straub’s endearing new collection of short stories about love. Her predominantly female protagonists are humorous, but Straub does not resort to the typical hallmarks of ‘chick-lit’ to entertain. Instead of having her protagonists fall over themselves in the pursuit of men, Straub makes incisive, brutishly funny observations without a trace of cloying sweetness. Consider what Amy, the young but pessimistic professor in “Some People Must Really Fall in Love” has to say about her student’s hygiene: “it got worse in the spring when the layers began to come off, like my students were twenty-five little onions, all waiting patiently to make me cry.” But despite her occasionally pungent observations, Straub’s narratives are not without heart. Without resorting to clichés or melodrama, her short stories create realistic portraits of their wry and weary protagonists. Although her characterizations are occasionally repetitive, “Other People We Married” not only satisfies, but elevates its genre through precise touches of wit and sentiment.
Straub’s talents shine brightest in three of her stories. “Some People Must Really Fall in Love” follows Amy, perhaps the wittiest of Straub’s heroines, as she deals with being passionately in love with one of her students while halfheartedly dating an older man. As seen in the other stories, Amy’s pain is beautifully, acutely detailed. The realistic, vivid ending of the story offers insight on the character’s hopeless circumstances.
In the third story, “Pearls,” Straub turns a familiar scenario—two college roommates attempting to ignore their romantic tension—into a heartfelt exploration of the raw emotions of youth. Though she draws upon stereotypes in her characterizations by endowing one of the roommates, Jackie, with more masculine attributes than the object of her desire, Franny, Straub focuses on their youth and innocence, something scarce amongst the other heroines. She allows their love to be touching but never sentimental or hackneyed.
Straub applies the same precision she uses for the disappointments of her older protagonists to young Jackie’s crushing, sudden realization that Franny is unwilling to continue their romance after their brief vacation in Palm Beach. When Jackie waves to Franny, asking her to come closer to the surf, Franny stays still and Jackie thinks of “the faceless boys on Broadway, and the way that Franny would have run to them, without even giving it a second thought, just because they were handsome and tall and exactly what she’d always imagined she would have. Jackie hadn’t imagined that ever.”
The third highlight of the collection, “Hot Springs Eternal” is the only story without a female protagonist. It follows a gay couple, Richard and Teddy, as they take a trip to Colorado that will determine the fate of their tenuous relationship. Richard, the older and more sophisticated of the two, is tired of waiting for Teddy to mature. Richard has taken to closing his eyes in times of stress. His therapist calls this “taking stock;” Richard calls it “the no Teddy zone.”
Straub’s witty characters are remarkably realistic, but some are too similar to others. This restraint from exploring other types of characters sometimes weakens her writing—her continual variations on the same themes can become tiresome. In “Map of Modern Palm Springs,” two sisters with a dysfunctional relationship take a trip together, but Straub’s resistance to differentiating them produces a weak portrait of the pair. Neither of the sisters has any particularly engaging characteristics. Although they are at different stages in life, the most memorable difference between them is that one is annoyingly compliant and the other annoyingly domineering—a simplistic binary that means their bickering only irritates, even though Straub is clearly attempting to entertain.
She also chooses to revisit Franny, the girlish roommate from “Pearls,” in two other stories, showing her as a wife and a mother. Featuring Franny in other stories has the potential to add a level of sophistication to Straub’s structure. However, the conceit fails because it feels inconsistent and arbitrary—Franny is the only character that is privileged this way. The author never explores the repercussions of Franny’s relationship with Jackie, and Franny’s portrayal grows more cartoonish with age.
Likewise, though Straub’s abrupt endings normally work to her advantage, creating the tantalizing sensation that the story will continue without us, her deftness works against her in some of the stories, particularly in the extremely short “Orient Point.” This story’s melodramatic ending feels insufficiently developed, given its brevity.
By ordering her stories roughly according to the characters’ ages, Straub has made an enlightening commentary on the large and unknowable theme of love. She opens the collection with youthful characters, like Amy, the lonely professor, and Jackie and Franny. She then transitions gracefully to stories of older women—some widows, others involved in marriages that have long since passed their honeymoon stage. Examining the classic conflicts of love with fresh eyes, Straub ends the collection with the wholly modern love story of “Hot Springs Eternal.” One of the few tales with an ending more sweet than bitter, Straub’s last word is an optimistic one. Her cerebral protagonists are never destined for fairytale endings, but when Richard finds Teddy at a party after their argument, the story’s realistic, relatable resolution is just as satisfying. Teddy is wearing another man’s shirt, but Richard, in a quiet gesture of forgiveness, simply offers Teddy his own shirt and tells him to “put this on.”
Happy endings are rare in “Other People We Married,” but the poignant conclusions to each of the 12 stories complement Straub’s genuine, complex characters. This realism serves to create a nuanced, thoughtful depiction of love and loneliness in the modern world, all while avoiding the stylistic pitfalls associated with the chick-lit or romance genres.

The 1940s were a time of war, fear, and uncertainty in Hungary. It was first a battlefield in World War II, and then a site of Soviet rule and collectivization. It is against this backdrop that Sándor Márai’s “Portraits of a Marriage,” a 1941 novel only now translated into English by George Szirtes, takes place. Márai focuses not on falling bombs and political ‘disappearances,’ but instead directs his attention to the characters’ stories of marriage, love, and personal and social change.
Though titled “Portraits of a Marriage,” Márai’s novel is by no means a static picture. Rather, it is a recounting of three lives, during which the main characters, Ilona, Peter, and Judit, reflect and comment upon their experiences and viewpoints. Narrated in three parts by the characters as they speak to acquaintances, the novel feels like a fireplace conversation between an older and a younger generation, a passing of knowledge, a sharing not just of memory but of experience. Márai’s precise and graceful prose and inventive narrative structure allow his novel to transcend the well-worn ideas he address in the novel: the disappearance of love, the death of class and culture, and disillusionment. He lets the reader stumble upon his themes as his characters discover them through self-reflection. Thus, the experience of reading “Portraits of a Marriage” feels more like discovering the wisdom of experience than reading a trite sequence of events.
“Portraits of a Marriage” is above all a chronicle of disillusionment with love. It first follows Ilona as she struggles to keep her husband Peter. As her narration progresses, she comes to terms with the fact that not everyone has one true love. This discovery opens her eyes to a world of experience that she previously was unable to explore. Yet, she is uncertain that the trade-off is worthwhile. “I was constantly attending to one man and had no time for the rest of the world,” she says. “I lost the man and gained a world. Do you think that’s a poor exchange? ... I don’t know. You might be right.” Márai’s novel derives its power from these vacillations; rather than delivering a heavy-handed lecture about how love in its idealized form does not exist, Márai allows the reader to discover this alongside Ilona and decide upon the statement’s validity for himself or herself.
Peter, too, develops a darker view of love as the narrative unfolds. At first he searches for love as an escape from loneliness, but he later realizes that this is impossible, that loneliness is inevitable, and that love is unsustainable. “It is no accident that history has regarded great lovers with the same awe and veneration as heroes, as brave pioneers who have risked all by voluntarily embarking on a hopeless but extraordinary human enterprise. Yes, true lovers run every kind of risk, literally, in every possible sense.” As Peter reflects upon his failures in love, Márai adds a twist to his cynicism: he mitigates his pessimism by the belief that the attempt to realize true love is a poetic, though futile, effort at real humanity. He views love as a Sisyphean struggle to add something incredible to life. Here, Márai departs from the platitude that true love is impossible, and presents another way of thinking, giving his novel a dimension of philosophical weight.
Peter eventually comes to terms with his alienation, realizing that everyone faces it, and, as certainly as humans will always strive for love, loneliness is a fact of life. “But one day we too grow up to be adults and learn that loneliness—genuine, fully conscious solitude—is not a punishment, not a wounded, sickly retreat from life, not isolation, but the one and only truly fitting condition for man,” he says. “And then it becomes less hard to suffer it. It is like berating pure mountain air.” Márai echoes this sense of disillusionment and loss throughout the book: in Peter’s loss of hope in overcoming isolation, in Ilona’s surrender of her belief in true love, and in the overall disappearance of social class, a broad historical change that Márai chronicles over the course of the novel.
While many authors have attempted to treat the disappearance of social class, Márai’s exploration of the theme is effective because he explores it from the viewpoint of a broad variety of  characters. Peter, the personification of the middle class, sees himself as the guardian of a dying culture. To him, the rituals of class, though seemingly meaningless, are ways of preserving his caste’s values from the encroaching proletariat. Judit, who is from a poor family, realizes that class is more than a set of customs; it is something deeper—an inheritance and a mental state, unattainable for those who do not have it and inalienable for those who do.
However, “Portraits of a Marriage” does not simply identify class as elusive and selective. It also associates it with a dying way of life. Márai effectively and powerfully cements this idea in the epilogue. The narrator, a bartender, identifies his lawnmower and his car as marks of status, declaring after obtaining these things that “I am genuinely cultured.” He is pitted against Peter, the personification of higher social class. Though Peter is literally and symbolically dying, and is now a poor laborer, he somehow retains a vestige of his middle-class upbringing. Class is dying, Márai says, and, though the younger generation has as much wealth as the older, monied class, it will never participate in the same culture. Márai departs from explicitly revealing meaning through the narrators, to implying it using the contrast between differing characters. This shift to a more subtle style is a particularly effective means of emphasizing Márai’s commentary on the death of class.
This blurring of social boundaries, along with Peter and Ilona’s discovery of the inexistence of love, all take place against the backdrop of World War II. However, worldly events are secondary to the characters’ problems—Márai  demonstrates that psychological struggles are more important than those of flesh and blood. In this context, Márai lends his arguments a sense of importance; they become powerful and universal.
“Portraits of a Marriage” chronicles three different lives as a way of exploring the broader themes of love, loneliness, disillusionment, and the death of culture. The book’s power stems from Márai’s style of narration; each character examines the themes from different viewpoints, but all comment on them with the retrospective wisdom of experience. The conversational and reflective nature of his narrative style allows the book to transcend the tedium that usually accompanies such hackneyed material. Although the novel is a straightforward portrait of three lives, Márai transforms it into a work of feeling and significance, into a true revelation of knowledge and viewpoints from a culture past.

“There’s something I must tell you all.” Thus opens one of the stories in Dezsö Kosztolányi’s “Kornel Esti.” “It’s marvelous fun going around in a foreign country if voices are merely sounds which leave us cold and we stare blankly at everyone that speaks to us.” The narrator goes on to tell a splendidly simple yet playful story about a lengthy conversation with a Bulgarian train guard, his side of which consists of a masterful manipulation of the words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ and the question “Do you smoke?”, the only Bulgarian phrases he knows.
More than 75 years after its original publication, “Kornel Esti” has finally been translated into English from the Hungarian by Bernard Adams. Although the book is ostensibly a collection of linked short stories, Kornel Esti, the titular protagonist, describes it differently. For him, it is partially a hypothetical travelogue, “say[ing] where [he] would have liked to go,” and partially a fanciful biography, in which he promises to “give details of how often the hero died in [his] dream.” Hovering over the entire narrative is the nearly invisible narrator, who opens the book by recalling, “I had passed the mid-point of my life when, one windy day in spring, I remembered Kornel Esti.” He continues to bring Kornel back into his life, and writes the rest of the stories as retellings of the tales Kornel relates to him. By the end of the book, the narrator has quoted him so extensively that ‘I’ begins to refer to Kornel himself.
In this way, “Kornel Esti” seems to unfold like Edgar Allan Poe’s classic tale of the double, “William Wilson.” Throughout the narrator’s childhood, Kornel was his constant friend and complete opposite. Kornel would urge him to do things he would never dream of doing, from sticking his tongue out at adults to killing birds. Their similarities and differences are laid out so neatly as to verge on the ridiculous: “We stumbled on the fact that both of us had been born in the same year, on the same day and at the same hour and minute: 29 March 1885, Palm Sunday, at six in the morning. This mysterious revelation affected us deeply.” When they are young adults, “nightmare figures” whom the narrator has never met appear at his door. They recognize him as Kornel and make disreputable demands; the development invites an interpretation that Kornel and the narrator are contradictory aspects of the same person.
But that is precisely where Kosztolányi surprises. The book does not turn out to be a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle between two halves of a personality for dominance over the whole. Instead, Kornel Esti and the narrator come together into a symbiotic relationship from which the prose and storytelling draws its power. “Make me whole again, like you used to,” the narrator tells Kornel. “One man isn’t enough to write and live at the same time.” Kornel, who can no longer write because he is too scattered, begins to meet with the narrator once or twice a month to tell his stories, and the narrator in turn edits out the superfluities and transforms them into prose.
Throughout Kornel’s stories and the narrator’s recollections, the beautiful is juxtaposed with irritation, boredom, and violence; Kosztolányi favors sweeping statements with fanciful specifics. On another train—it seems that much of the book takes place in transit—Kornel describes the “family-like traveling-companionship, that fortuitously forged train-fellowship, recruited of necessity from total strangers,” before adding that the same familial pool of total strangers will “greet another total stranger, arriving late and unexpectedly, not much more warmly than they would a masked robber equipped with chloroform.” Similarly, myriad sparks “[soaring] in great arcs” from a train engine “like swiftly fading falling stars” must include “one smut, however, [to fall] into his eye.” Along the same lines, the narrator grandly declares that “the greatest writers in Germany become the least overnight and new poets suddenly go out of fashion,” but then stops to wonder how exactly it happens: “in just a few minutes, while they were shaving at home, not suspecting a thing.”
These juxtapositions of elegance with the quotidian contain a hint of morbidity. In the story of the conversation with the Bulgarian train guards, Kornel explains to the reader the meanings a shake of the head can take. According to Kornel, a shake of the head can mean anything from “typical” to “never heard the like” to “such is life.” “That,” he says, “can be used for anything. No situation has yet occurred in life for which ‘such is life’ isn’t appropriate. If somebody dies, even then we just say ‘such is life.’”
Kosztolányi, in addition to being a poet, critic, translator, and short story writer, was also a journalist. In all of these roles, he was witness to the great changes that the 20th century brought to Hungary, especially after the First World War. But though he notes wryly that some people are able to move on with their daily lives and forget war, revolution, and the Spanish influenza—to say nothing of the complete ruin of kings, world banks, and countries—he writes that “Kornel Esti was not such an ingrate. He remembered everything that was really important.” He admits from the beginning that “Kornel Esti” is half dreams and fantasy, and explains that “hardly anything happens to most people. But I’ve imagined a lot.” Yet, within his stories, Kosztolányi takes care to remember everything that is really important. He manages to find the playful, the surprising, and the beautiful in life, and he weaves the fragments together into a story that addresses the great concerns of his time without sacrificing any stylistic flair.

Going solely by intuition, the story of David and Goliath would not be illustrated with both figures dressed in 16th-century armor. Nor would the clash would be narrated in modern German. However, in the Houghton Library, where many of Harvard’s rarest and most valuable books are housed, a centuries-old edition of Luther’s translation of the Bible is opened to an illustration of this anachronistic scene.
“The Bible in Type, from Gutenberg to Rogers: An Exhibition Commemorating the Four-Hundredth Anniversary of the King James Bible” celebrates beautifully-crafted examples of history’s best-selling—and arguably most influential—book, the Bible. The exhibit celebrates the 400th anniversary of the printing of the King James Bible, which was translated in 1611 and remains the most popular English version. It displays works including Harvard’s Gutenberg Bible, the first Bible produced on a printing press, and one of only 48 in existence.
Hope Mayo, the Philip Hofer Curator of Printing and Graphic Arts at Houghton Library, organized the exhibit, and selected the Bibles as examples of typography and design. She believes that the Bible can not be overstated as a source and inspiration of visual art.
“I have come to realize that when you read about the history of type design, over and over again, [historians will say that] the greatest achievement of this designer was such-and-such a Bible, or the most important use of this typeface was in a Bible,” Mayo says.
However, the Bible’s importance lies not only in the history of print books, but in modern fonts we use every day. “If you look on your dropdown menu on Microsoft Word, you will see Baskerville, named after John Baskerville, whose greatest creation was the Baskerville Bible. Bruce Rogers, an American designer, used a typeface he had designed called Centaur, which is still available in digital form,” Mayo says.
The beauty of the blackletter text against the startling pristine paper of the Gutenberg Bible belies the painstaking labor with which the book was created. Each letter was individually placed on the printing press, and even more amazingly, the Lucida Blackletter font is still available today.
While the exhibit was primarily organized to highlight the physical beauty of the Bibles’ design, Mayo also hopes that those interested in other aspects of the Bible will find the exhibit informative. “The printers and graphic designers will be interested in, of course, the design and typography,” Mayo says, “but those interested in the literary will pore over the King James version and see the end of Psalms and beginning of Proverbs. And finally, those interested in the Bible as a religious text will see it through that lens.”
W. James Simpson, chair of the Harvard English Department, believes that those interested in the exhibit for its literary aspects should not underestimate the Bible’s influence. “The Bible has influenced the language of literature enormously—both [in terms of] narrative and the actual language of the Bible. Think of all of those stories in Genesis or David in the book of Samuel, think of the language of the Psalms that have so much poetry. Anyone who studies English has to take the Christian and Hebrew Bible seriously,” Simpson says.
The exhibit displays eight Bibles, some of which are mentioned by tour guides as they shepherd their groups onto the steps of Widener Library only a few feet away. Among the older books is the Gutenberg Bible; an Antwerp Polyglot Bible, which includes Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic text; Luther’s controversial translation into German; and the 1611 printing of the King James Bible. The four newer examples, which would not have looked out of place in a modern design scheme, are all renderings of the King James Bible and include the Golden Cockerel Press printing of the Four Gospels, whose designer, Eric Gill, created two other familiar fonts, Perpetua and Gill Sans.
Mayo hopes that the exhibit, which is open the entire duration of library hours, will serve all members of the community. “These are rare, beautiful and valuable books, and the average man on the street doesn’t often get the chance to look at a Gutenberg Bible. It’s an opportunity for the public to see them and look at them as a religious text and literary influence,” Mayo says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Writing is not something that you do. Writing is something that you are,” said two-time Tony Award winning composer Maury Yeston. A full house in Harvard Hall 201 on Tuesday, February 15 welcomed Yeston to Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 31: “American Musicals and American Culture,” taught by William Powell Mason Professor of Music Carol J. Oja. Yeston’s visit was an hour-long question-and-answer session during which students in the class asked pre-prepared questions about his work on the musical “Nine,” his influences, and his background.
Yeston was raised in Jersey City, N.J., just a subway ride away from New York City, which he said “[made] the dream almost credible and much more in reach.” Piano lessons from his mother fostered Yeston’s musical prowess at a very early age, though he said his interest in musical theater fully emerged after seeing the Broadway play “My Fair Lady” in its first run when he was a young child. Yeston attended Yale University as an undergraduate, but musical theater was not his main focus. “I was doing so much of everything. I hit the ground running at Yale, as one of the last bastions of the enlightened amateur. My life as an undergraduate at Yale was just learning everything I could, voraciously,” he said. He studied Japanese Literature and Philosophy, and even composed a cello concerto debuted by Yo-Yo Ma. His work on Broadway began with “Nine” in 1982, followed by “Grand Hotel” and “Titanic.”
Many of the students’ questions were about “Nine,” for which Yeston won a Tony Award for Best Original Score, and from which the class studied select numbers. When asked to choose his favorite number from “Nine,” Yeston requested that the audience answer instead, because he couldn’t possibly choose just one. The class responded almost unanimously with “Be Italian.” The highlight of the visit was Yeston’s impromptu performance of the song, during which he walked the audience through the piece, stopping between every few bars to explain his thought process and tell anecdotes about the song’s conception.
The film adaptation of “Nine” was released in 2009, and Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas performed “Be Italian” in the film. “Fergie was extraordinary,” said Yeston, when asked what he thought of her performance. “She got the job from studying, and was so grateful to get the job.”
Yeston was at ease in front of the class; along with his Broadway experience, he has made a secondary career out of providing instruction and guidance to aspiring musicians. Returning to his alma mater, Yeston served as Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Music Studies at Yale University for eight years, and has been director of the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theater Advanced Workshop in New York City since the early ’80s. His time at BMI began as a student, and he studied alongside future prominent composers including Alan Menken, who composed music for many of Disney’s most successful animated classics, such as “The Little Mermaid,” “Aladdin,” and “Beauty and the Beast.”
After their teacher passed away, Yeston took over the position and taught the course for free. Yeston claims one of the best parts of the job was that he was able to spot early talent in composers like Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, the creators of the Tony Award-winning “Avenue Q.” “These are people I instantly knew were extraordinary … The day that those guys walked in I knew they were going to go the distance, I just had that feeling,” Yeston said.
One of Yeston’s professed goals is to provide others with the same kind of advice, guidance, and support that he considers himself incredibly lucky to have received in the first stages of his career. “There are very direct connections between the great practitioners of musical theater and the younger generations,” he said. One of the producers of “My Fair Lady,” whom Yeston knew when he was younger, suggested that Yeston’s music be brought to Alan Jay Lerner.  Lerner, who wrote the screenplay and lyrics to “Gigi,” “My Fair Lady,” and “Camelot,” soon became a mentor and friend to Yeston and helped initiate his career in musical theater.
Yeston’s charismatic answers and comical anecdotes made for a receptive and engaged audience. Professor Oja referred to Yeston as a “true theoretician of musical theater,” and commented on his impressive ability to explain the development of his acclaimed work. “He is able to say how he does what he does, when most artists just do,” she said. Class member Lauren J. Tomkinson ’14 also enjoyed the event. “I liked how he related his personal experiences to his work and how animated and personable he was.”
A true believer in going after you want in life, Yeston advises undergraduates to follow the same principle that allowed him to have more than one career: “There’s an idea that you should realize your full potential, I think that’s true. I’ve been a teacher, a lyricist, and a composer. I’ve been involved in filmmaking. There’s just no end to it. I think that process starts when you’re an undergraduate. There’s no reason to abandon passionate curiosity.”

March 3-5, 7:30 p.m. and March 5, 2:30 p.m.
Adams Pool Theater
Directed by Rachel V. Bird ’13
Produced by Sesheta B. Mwanza ’13
“& being a woman & being colored is a metaphysical dilemma / I haven’t conquered yet,” recites the Lady in Yellow, played by Chelsea C. Grant ’14 in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s new staging of “for colored girls / for black boys.” The production is a combination of Ntozake Shange’s choreopoem “for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuff” and its unofficial response, Keith Antar Mason’s “for black boys who have considered homicide when the streets were too much,” and seeks to shed light on conflicts of gender and race.
First-time director Rachel V. Byrd ’13 says, “although this is not every black woman’s story, the play sheds an unapologetic light on issues that plague the African-American community exponentially more than other races.”
This is heavy stuff; themes of love, incarceration, and rape run through the show, which consists of a series of poems with associated movements recited by a group of nameless men and women. First adapted by Jon E. Gentry ’07, the script intersperses male and female perspectives to provide a unified view of black hardships. “Even though the experiences seem impossible, they are very applicable now, even 40 years later, and thus important to understand,” says Linda I. Ugbah ’12, who plays the Lady in Blue.
The cast faces the difficulty of conveying difficult themes to students who grew up in very different environments. Byrd is quick to stress, though, that the show is not only for those who have lived the black experience. “The title is more of a courtesy—something for black actors to be a proud of—but that doesn’t translate to something exclusive.” Far from it, she wants everyone to be able to take something away from the show. “We have to push boundaries of comfortability to build awareness,” Byrd said.
Adds stage manager Jeremiah J. Cross ’11, “my professor in [African and American Studies 10: “Introduction to African American Studies”] told us that there are 40 million ways to be black, and I think that we’re working with that since our cast is represented by the Caribbean, Africa, and the United States—the black experience is shared, but variable.”
Byrd wants to use the production to reach out to the Harvard community and educate them about what some of their classmates have been through. “Cry, laugh, be vulnerable. Come learn,” she says.

Though brutal in its content, “Howie the Rookie” by Mark O’Rowe gives off a certain intimacy, the type of personal closeness one might feel knowing the history behind a black eye. O’Rowe’s play is a cozy one, consisting of only two roles—two Irish brawlers who drive the play with their intertwining monologues. The structure is unconventional: rather than being viewed in real-time, the story of the play is recounted, told through mesmerizing and ricocheting anecdotes. Director Ali R. Leskowitz ’11—who is a Crimson arts editor—and the show’s two highly adept leads make full use of this format to capture their audience’s imagination, creating a play that pummels with nuance.
Entrenching itself in the underbelly of the Irish working-class, “Howie the Rookie,” which runs in the Loeb Experimental Theater from February 18-20 and 24-26, opens on a character lying on a mattress with a pulsating background of English electro. The scene is immediately reminiscent of the destitute nihilism explored in works like “Trainspotting,” the 1996 Danny Boyle film about drug addiction in Scotland. O’Rowe’s play explores the balance of masculinity, responsibility, and redemption working within this “chav” culture—imagine American Apparel hoodies or track jacket-type threads. Together, Howie Lee (Adam J. Conner ’14) and the Rookie Lee (Peter K. Bestoso ’14) weave a visceral picture of this gritty landscape, taking turns spewing reels of sharp and fiercely funny dialogue affected with Irish slang.
Though “Howie the Rookie” has only two actors, it boasts plenty of characters. Aside from the two avatars, names like “Ollie,” “Peaches,” “Mousey”, and “Gingerboy” populate the piquant world of the play. Conner and Bestoso narrate a brief span of days bouncing between decrepit bars and locales like “Video Vendetta” during which they have serendipitous and recurring run-ins with these characters.
The suspenseful plot, built more by each monologue, involves the Rookie’s attempts to redeem himself after stomping on a pair of fighting fish that belonged to “Ladyboy,” a savage figure rumored to have “three rows of teeth, like a shark.” As this central story unfolds, colorful encounters along the way flesh out the world of the play: on two hilarious occasions, Peaches’ “massive sister Avalanche” surprises Howie by grabbing his “flute” while he’s hitting the “jacks.”
Making the banter and anecdotes compelling is the key to the play’s wonder, and its two leads accomplish this with panache. The foremost recognition for the play’s success belongs to Conner and Bestoso, who do prodigious jobs portraying the down and out lads. The show is done in full Irish character, and Conner and Bestoso nail the accents impeccably, capturing the speed and snarl of the rhythm. The pair’s acute physical expressivity also gives motion to the monologues. Conner anchors the play with a graver, more tempered performance; Bestoso lends charm and élan to the role of the Rookie with a youthful face, smirking disposition, and odd lankiness. In a choreographed sequence representing the play’s first fight scene, he gives himself a forceful punch in slow motion, then speeds time back up to fall and immediately hoist himself up in a move befitting Michael Jackson. These surprising bouts of violence punctuate the story, appropriately amplifying the play’s cathartic moments.
Leskowitz has constructed a well-tuned vision. There is a great sensitivity to detail in the play, contributing to a natural yet dynamic atmosphere. A gorgeous set design, consisting of a rising frame of wood panels covered in graffiti, is evidence of this meticulousness. Scattered through the panels are pints of beer, a phone, and a toilet—“the jacks”—made brilliant by the actors’ discreet and seamless access to them.
The music, another vital backdrop, does not always serve the play as well. The array of electronic beats and ambiance that comprise the soundtrack, while inspired, is often gratuitous and overbearing in its frequent presence. At its best moments, it flares up naturally, pinning the audience to the Howie and Rookie’s plight; at many others, it enters and exits abruptly, only distancing the actors from their pulsating world.
Another mild improvement might be made in the play’s climatic pacing. The final moments crept up too swiftly, unbalancing the impassioned tenor of the ending. Yet when all the elements gel, the audience latches on to the play, grimacing and laughing all at once, as Conner and Bestoso spin their yarns. “Howie The Rookie” makes an epic of brawls and banter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her production of Sophocles’ “Ajax,” director Sarah Benson takes a route popular in contemporary culture and seeks to portray war as hell. The genius of the Ancient Greeks, however, was to recognize that war causes the intensification of all human experience, good and bad. Benson’s limited interpretation, which portrays it solely as a detriment to society and individuals, fails to do justice to the multifaceted exploration of war and its consequences in Sophocles’ text.
The American Repertory Theater production’s narrow scope is a pity, because in many other respects the production is genuinely successful. A vast, cavernous set—effectively representing Ajax’s tent—threatens to swallow the actors whole, yet the action remains compelling due to the energy of their performances. Special mention should go to Brent Harris as an immense, chiseled Ajax, Ron Cephas Jones as a conflicted Odysseus and Thomas Derrah in the ostensible bad-guy role of Agamemnon. Charles Connaghan’s translation loses a little bit of the nuance of the Greek, but is otherwise satisfyingly muscular and clear—appropriate language for the military camp in which the play is set.
Ajax is one of the mythical heroes of the Epic Cycle. In Sophocles’ play, his murderous attempts at revenge on his Greek rivals Odysseus, Menelaus, and Agamemnon are diverted by the goddess Athena into the blind slaughter of the army’s cattle. On waking from his divinely-induced madness, he commits suicide out of shame. To a certain extent, the story overlaps with Benson’s last piece, a well-recieved production of Sarah Kane’s “Blasted” at the Soho Rep. Both explore the impact of war on human psychology in the form of alienation from loved ones, desensitization to violence, and even madness.
Unfortunately, Benson’s determination to convey this, and thereby make the play more obviously relevant to a contemporary audience—the costumes and set design are highly derivative of modern U.S. army fatigues and hardware—has led her to twist the text into an almost unrecognizable shape. Most emblematic of this is her treatment of that vital staple of Greek tragedy: the Chorus. Modern directors often approach the Chorus with trepidation, fearing that its highly formal, stylized interludes will be too alien or too ritualistic for a contemporary audience. Consequently, directors try to sideline the Chorus or reduce its significance in the play. This is a deep misunderstanding of the text and foundation of classical tragedy, completely ignoring the fact that historically the Chorus came first—in Sophocles’ time, actors were still regarded as something of an experimental, new-fangled invention.
Benson’s treatment falls into this exact trap. The Chorus is represented as a collection of talking heads on projector screens above the stage. These speakers fill breaks in the text normally containing the most evocative language in the play with their own words, rendering them devoid of interest. Most of the heads spout everyday banalities—“it sucks, it really sucks right now”—and the few of interest, mainly veterans of modern wars, say little to do with Ajax’s story.
Benson has attempted to turn the focus of the play completely towards the Trojan War, neglecting its important ideas on honor, family, and fate. 2000 year gap or no, these are themes that are universal, and a proper appreciation for the role of the Chorus is essential for conveying them. Whether or not the director chooses to mimic the highly formulaic staging of an Athenian amphitheatre, she must at least find a way of portraying the Chorus so that it fulfills the same role in the text as was originally intended. Otherwise the play feels oddly dissatisfying and empty, as “Ajax” does despite the brave performances of the cast. In trying to make “Ajax” a play for our time, Benson has forgotten that it is a play for all time.

On Saturday, February 19, the Boston Conservatory Dance Theater presented “Liaisons,” a farewell performance for Yasuko Tokunaga, the company’s outgoing Artistic Director, and director of the Boston Conservatory’s Dance Division. The program featured two works by renowned choreographer Martha Graham, and “The Moor’s Pavane,” a 20-minute dance interpretation of William Shakespeare’s “Othello” by Mexican choreographer Jose Limon. To complete the program, contemporary choreographers Parren Ballard and Thang Dao each presented the world premiere of an original composition.
The performance opened with “Frontier,” a quietly powerful work originally choreographed by Martha Graham in 1935. To the faintly militaristic melodies of a fife and drum, a solo dancer (Catherine Jaeger) conveyed through movement both the adversity and excitement of life in the American West. To evoke this somewhat wistful setting, one segment of a wooden fence rested at the center of the stage; this simple yet effective set piece gestured to the bygone era without any trace of overstated theatricality.
Barefoot and attired in a long, dusty-pink dress, the dancer was wrapped in a floor-sweeping skirt, a costume characteristic of Martha Graham pieces. The fluid yet figure-hugging gown allowed the audience to see the dancer’s every careful contortion. Indeed, throughout the piece,  Jaeger’s movements were purposeful and deliberate; focused exhalations were even audible at times.
A second Martha Graham piece, “Lamentation,” followed. Seated on a bench, and contorting her body from side to side, soloist Giulia Pline moved her body in a way recalling an erratic metronome. As the piece progressed, her oscillations grew more anxious, and her body began to twist in angular juts and starts. Encased in a body-length tube of maroon fabric, Pline’s every move created new triangular shapes. Appearing like a mourning Madonna of the modern world, she twisted through the various stages of grief, lit only by a dim purplish light.
Unlike the solo pieces which preceded it, “The Moor’s Pavane” featured four dancers, each loosely representing a member of Shakespeare’s two parallel couples: Othello and Desdemona, and Iago and Emilia. The decision to structure the story around the play’s two principal pairs allowed the classic narrative to be somewhat refocused and reframed. With the ever-changing arrangements of the dancers onstage, Limon’s piece was able to visualize the complex web of relationships among the characters. At times, the couples are clearly juxtaposed; in a technically-complex opening sequence, the evident passion and sincerity shared by Othello and Desdemona is subtly contrasted with the snake-like dance of deception between Iago and Emilia nearby. In this way, Limon presents the latter’s relationship as a cheap imitation of the genuine emotion deeply felt between Othello and Desdemona.
Indeed, when Iago and Emilia dance, it is clear they exist to frame the story of the misguided yet nobler lovers. In what is perhaps the most visually arresting moment in the entire piece, the devious pair begins to move toward one another as Othello violently suffocates his wife. This suggests that they unite as a couple most powerfully when conspiring to destroy others.
In particular, Desdemona (Megumi Kawahire) danced her part with evident cheer and naïveté. In the opening scene, her movements were as much marked by gaiety as Othello’s (Daniel Johnson) were by passion and precision. Like Shakespeare’s jealous military leader, Johnson punctuated his every movement with a sharply-defined edge; he fueled each twist and snap with a palpable intensity of spirit.
The piece’s costuming, by Pauline Lawrence, offered a particularly decadent visual treat. Johnson, clad in luxe, blood-red velvet robes, contrasted strikingly with Desdemona, who appeared to float on thick layers of virginal white tulle, her grace as airy and refined as the gossamer puffs dotting the sleeves of her dress. Musically, the piece featured dramatic classical compositions, often imbuing the performance with a quietly-pulsing aural heartbeat. Even more powerful, however, were the abrupt halts in the music during particularly impassioned exchanges between Othello and Iago (Brett Sjoblom). The startling moments of orchestral silence, punctuated only with a few terse pants of breath, dramatically underscored the violent tension trembling in the air between the two men.
Though Kawahire was clad in pure white, the piece’s three other characters were each enrobed in rich flame-colored tones: Sjoblom in burnt amber yellow, Emilia (Amanda Jenny) in fiery orange, and Johnson in blood red. In the dance’s final moments, these three hues first rise and then slowly quiver down to meet Desdemona’s splayed body, calling to mind the slowly-dying embers of a once great fire.
To balance the dramatic and deeply mournful mood evoked by Limon’s masterwork, the second half of the performance featured the thoughtful, ballet-inspired “Radian,”  a new piece by Ballard. Dao’s high-energy choreography followed, offering a large ensemble piece to close the show. Like Tokunaga’s own tenure with the Boston Conservatory Dance Theater, “Liaisons” moved through a series of intricate, complex, and highly emotional experiences with both beauty and grace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tide of political engagement that has characterized the uprisings and revolutions in the Middle  East has captured the world’s attention since Jan. 2011.
Beginning with Tunisia, popular revolutions have swept up Egypt and Libya, with the latter country currently in a half-way house between civil disobedience and full-scale civil war. In Egypt, meanwhile, a grassroots revolt succeeded after 2 weeks of protest in toppling Hosni Mubarrak and gaining the support of much of the country’s military.
In Libya, with the communication blackout imposed by Muammar al-Gaddafi’s trembling regime, it is difficult to say what will happen in the coming days, but the pattern of one protest inspiring another across the region looks set to continue. Bahrain has spent the past week riddled by sectarian-driven protests, while hundreds of thousands of Iranians are reported to have taken to the streets last weekend. With governments ranging from Morocco to the kingdom of  Jordan forced into promising democratic concessions, the region grapples with alarming chaos as it awaits momentous change to come.  Despite the appalling violence that has ensued as a result of this turmoil, we are convinced that the uprising in Egypt and elsewhere is a positive step for the Arab world and for democracy and human rights in general. It should go without saying that all Americans should support any person’s right to vote and basic political rights—something Egyptians have been sorely deprived of since 1981—regardless of their religious or political beliefs.
Throughout all of this, the United States government has chosen to remain on the sidelines, at least publicly. So far, the people of Tunisia and Egypt—the majority of whom is under the age of 30 in both cases—have been responsible for driving the removal of their repressive dictators. President Barack H. Obama may be right to call for reform and democracy but not interfere actively. After a tumultuous recent history in the region, this is clearly not the opportune moment for more U.S. intervention in the Middle  East.
From our perspective, however, the revolutions sweeping across the Arab world offer a telling lesson. When we discuss the ‘domino effect’ of protests engulfing the Middle  East that began symbolically with the self-immolation of one Tunisian street vendor, 26-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi, on December 17, 2010, we need to remember that these are overwhelmingly movements of young people. In Egypt, the early vents of revolution began in 2008 with the founding of the student-worker alliance known as the April 6 Youth Movement, which has represented a wave of dissatisfaction among students and unemployed youths. When we take into account that over 60 percent of the Arab world is under the age of 30, it becomes even clearer that it is our peers who are largely responsible for determining greater freedoms and opportunities for the future.
The political engagement of so many people of our generation and what they have achieved so far ought to inspire more young Americans to take real actions for the causes that they care most about. If the population of Cairo can bring down an authoritarian dictatorship—and, in doing so, force their new military government to promise democracy and human rights after three decades of oppression—then American youths who, to be sure, face entirely different circumstances and problems, no longer have any excuse to wallow in the political apathy that has come to characterize our generation. In short, we can use the example of those under much greater duress as a sign of how much an individual can achieve through active political involvement.
The role of social media in the downfall of Mubarrak and Zine Ben Ali, the former president of Tunisia, has been both lauded and rejected by analysts and protesters alike. In the end, though, it seems foolish to speak of social media as causes rather than catalysts, as the role of Facebook groups and tweets rests entirely with what users make of them. In fact, Facebook can even serve as an enabler of complacency for many Americans. By simply ‘liking’ a page supporting democracy in Egypt, human rights in Darfur, or the Green Movement in Iran, it is far too easy for many young people here to go to sleep at night thinking they have used their online procrastination to advance social justice.
In the different ways social media are appropriated, we see very clearly a great gulf in political engagement in America and the Middle East. While an entire generation of Americans today has grown up using Facebook to augment social life, our counterparts in the Middle East are likely to know the site equally as a means of exercising political agency. In places like Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, and Tunisia, Facebook and social media have certainly enabled repressed populations to organize and protest the authoritarian edifice.
It says something about the political involvement of young Americans today that our country’s most energetic grassroots movement of the past two years was the Tea Party, so clearly dominated by citizens middle-aged and upwards.
Despite the wave of youthful enthusiasm in the 2008 election, it seems hard not to draw the conclusion that so many of those supporters have melted into an anonymity of inaction once again.
Young Americans today should not react to the uprisings in the Middle East by merely thinking that change for the better is taking place. Rather, we should all respond by wondering what we ourselves can do in our own country to follow meagerly in the footsteps of young people across the world who are making their voices count today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, a friend asked me if I wanted to go to a developing nation together to volunteer for a few weeks. When I asked what she had in mind, she said she wasn’t sure, but that it would be fun to explore the country and “make a difference.” Since I had never been there, I thought it sounded fascinating – yet I also couldn’t imagine trying to effect meaningful social change in a place where I have such little knowledge of the key social issues and hardly any familiarity with the culture.
To my surprise, my friend’s mindset seems to be a fairly common one within our generation. We feel we can justify taking expensive trips to seemingly exotic locales by “doing good” while we’re there – even if the balance between vacationing and volunteering is often nebulous, and if the actual social impact of volunteering for a few days is minimal. This trend is reflected in the proliferation of companies and organizations that promote “voluntourism,” a way for people to explore new places and simultaneously “help” the host country. On our own campus, numerous student groups organize service trips and conferences abroad, although the application processes for such trips sometimes emphasize the travel experience more than the social impact. In at least some cases it seems that the tangible social impact created by the trip is also unclear. To be sure, there are also many student groups that travel abroad to implement projects that are truly focused on creating social change with concrete, measurable outcomes. But I am questioning those who purport to make a difference – and, indeed, exalt the supposed social good they claim to effect – when the purpose of the trip is really to explore and enjoy an interesting new place.
“Voluntourism” is fundamentally incompatible with making a real social contribution. By definition, these trips take people to places they know little about, so that they can enjoy the new sights as tourists. It is naïve – and presumptuous – to think we can create positive social impact in places with which we have little or no cultural familiarity. As Uzodinma Iweala ’04 wrote in The Washington Post a few years ago, idealistic college students and others who travel to Africa with a mission of “bringing light to the dark continent” do more to affirm their own cultural superiority than actually to aid those in need. Along these lines, it would have been highly presumptuous of me to travel to an unfamiliar developing country and seek to offer something in a place where I hardly know the needs of the local population and where my cultural ignorance might hinder me from actually helping.
Additionally, volunteer vacations are typically too short to make a significant difference. Volunteering with third-world orphans for a week or two may be an inspiring and transformative experience for the volunteer, but such a transient stay is unlikely to make a lasting impact on those whom the trip purportedly helped. I learned this tough lesson from my own experience. Last summer I traveled to India, the country where I was born and spent numerous summers during my childhood, to work in a marginalized community of sex workers along with two fellow Harvard students. We each spent from three to eight weeks in the community and volunteered and played with the children there nearly every morning. Although we – and hopefully the children – enjoyed our time we probably did not create a lasting impact. More sustainable is the weekly volunteer program we set up in partnership with New Delhi college students who are able to serve as lasting role models for the children. Although the trip certainly was not voluntourism, as its purpose was neither to tour India nor solely to volunteer with the underprivileged children of sex workers, I think the relatively short duration of our time with the children makes it unlikely that we made a real difference in their lives.
Voluntourism can be a fun and interesting way to explore a new place. Such trips can help tourists learn about the world and gain a better understanding of how people in other cultures and social situations live. But the volunteering itself is highly unlikely to result in real social progress; in fact, perhaps the greatest benefit results from the tourist spending that stimulates local economies. If the primary goal were to effectively tackle critical social problems, the money paid for travel and accommodations on these trips could be better spent on existing organizations that are already doing great work in their own countries. When we volunteer in a foreign country for a few days, we shouldn’t deceive ourselves that we are effecting transformative social change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow, Representative Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, is speaking at the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. He arrives at Harvard after a week of intense debate on Capitol Hill, during which he led the effort in the House to approve the biggest cuts in discretionary spending since World War II. We understand the need to rein in federal government spending; as members of the “future generations” politicians refer to so frequently, we appreciate that continuing to borrow 40 cents of every dollar we spend as a nation is unsustainable. What is deeply upsetting is that in their zeal to please the voters who swept them into office, Representative Cantor and his fellow House Republicans have placed the burden of shrinking the U.S. deficit squarely on the backs of the global poor. Taking advantage of a period of economic uncertainty to cut aid to the world’s voiceless poor may be politically expedient, even politically popular, but it is morally wrong.
Particularly infuriating is House Republicans’ decision to cut $1.5 billion in funding from America’s global health and child survival initiatives around the world. These cuts, which include a $525 million reduction in our commitment to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and over $800 million less for global AIDS programs, would have a devastating effect on millions of women, children, and men in the developing world. A recent analysis by the Health Global Access Project found that the cuts to the Global Fund alone, if enacted, will lead to 68,000 more infants being infected with HIV at birth, 12 million fewer families having access to bet nets to prevent malaria, and the elimination of lifesaving treatment for 434,000 people with tuberculosis and 483,000 people with AIDS. If the effects of having to halt and reverse the scale-up of successful American programs are taken into account, the human costs reach even more staggering proportions, with more than 1 million preventable deaths possible as a result.
Trimming deficits on the backs of the poor and vulnerable is not only immoral – it does next to nothing to actually solve our country’s fiscal problems. As Michael Gerson of the Washington Post put it: “No one can reasonably claim that the budget crisis exists because America spends too much on bed nets and AIDS drugs. Our massive debt is mainly caused by a combination of entitlement commitments, an aging population, and health cost inflation.” Claiming that our deficit problem can be solved by cuts to global health initiatives, instead of meaningful reform of our country’s entitlement programs and tax code, is disingenuous and irresponsible.
Indeed, advocates for cutting global health funding argue that we can’t afford to continue to pay for these life-saving programs. We propose two ways to do so. First, let the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthiest 2% of Americans expire. The continuance of these tax cuts is estimated to contribute $700 billion to the national deficits over the next decade—money that could be better allocated to fully fund global health programs while still greatly reducing our deficit. Second, pass H.R. 755, the Investing in Our Future Act, which would raise $28 billion a year for global health and climate change mitigation programs by levying a 0.005% fee on currency transactions carried out by banks every day to the tune of billions in profits. While both of these ideas are associated with Democrats, let’s also not forget that the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), America’s biggest bilateral global health initiative, was created by President George W. Bush and reauthorized by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2008. We strongly feel that global health is not a Democratic or Republican issue, but an American one.
So what do we do now? Here at Harvard, we care about global health, at least nominally. We have numerous departments, institutes, and centers devoted to its study and practice, and many of us have taken courses or traveled to distant countries to learn about helping the global poor. Yet, when it comes to promoting and protecting U.S. funding for programs that provide lifesaving treatment and disease prevention for millions abroad, we too often remain silent, content that our own lives and health are not at risk. Tomorrow, you have an opportunity to speak for those who cannot. We call on those who share our view of the urgency and importance of this issue to join us at 5:30 PM on Thursday in front of the Littauer Building of the Harvard Kennedy School. Together, we will urge Representative Cantor to call for a restoration of full funding for U.S. global health programs. On this issue, we truly believe, lives hang in the balance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nation’s budget deficit, it appears, has become the fashionable political obsession of the day. In this trend, Congressional Republicans, owning up to a long history of using vital and dynamic social programming as a political bludgeon, have proposed a series of devastating cuts affecting those Americans who need government assistance the most. The scope of proposed Republican cuts targets only the small fraction of the federal budget that covers domestic discretionary spending and the cuts there are dramatic and reprehensible. It is now the responsibility of Senate Democrats and of President Obama to show their support for American communities by opposing these cuts.
The Republican budget proposal released by House Appropriations Committee Chairman, Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky) includes sweeping cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and a slew of other federal agencies critical to public health and safety. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be entirely eliminated.  The much-lauded Pell Grant Program, which funds college educations for low-income students, is also slated for steep reductions. Defense spending has, predictably, not only avoided cuts, but is actually slated to increase. And, just in case one was tempted to think Republicans could keep their Culture Wars out of the national budget, Rogers’ proposal also includes the complete defunding of Planned Parenthood.
Perhaps the most egregious elements of the budget proposal, though, are direct cuts to American communities. Among these is the complete elimination of funding for the AmeriCorps program. Less than two years ago, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, Congress quadrupled the size of AmeriCorps, lauding its effectiveness and the incredible work its volunteers performed by engaging with the country’s most vulnerable communities. All that seems forgotten now, as programs like Teach for America, City Year, and Citizen Schools–all of which are popular and innovative postgraduate choices for Harvard seniors–face elimination.
Community Development Block Grants, which provide incredibly far-reaching and critical support for America’s urban areas, also face steep reductions. In Boston alone, the block grant-funded Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) provides for housing, heating, fuel assistance, elderly services, health care access, and educational support to add to a long list of other vital community services. ABCD cuts even stand to affect the student-run programs of Harvard’s Phillips Brooks House Association (PBHA), which engages over 1,600 Harvard undergraduates in over 80 service programs throughout Boston and Cambridge. Large and well-known campus programs like the Summer Urban Program (SUP), which uses ABCD youth development grants to pay its summer counselors, and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which works closely with housing assistance and homelessness prevention initiatives funded by ABCD, stand to be heavily impacted along with other programs.
In his recent State of the Union address, President Obama declared, to bipartisan applause, “We do big things.” But the notion that this nation, founded by farmers and minutemen battling an empire in the name of unprecedented freedoms, that won two World Wars and secured a global peace, that landed a man on the moon and inspired mankind, cannot support our own communities and our fellow citizens is small and sad. And we are not, as Republicans are so fond of announcing, broke. Paying taxes at the lowest rates since 1950, however, will not support this country’s future. Both Republicans and Democrats need to grow up and stop using ever-increasing tax cuts for short-lived political gain. If this budget proposal should, by some means, be approved in whole, or even in large-part, the results will be devastating for all Americans. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Winning the future, as President Obama recently challenged, starts with providing responsible support for our cities, our neighborhoods, and our children.

Shakira’s newest music video, the English version of “Loca” featuring Dizzee Rascal, is the type that, if played at a gym, would make everyone doing sit-ups capitulate, go to Chipotle, order everything on the menu (to go) and then watch “True Life: I’m Obese” alone on a dirty futon.
Things begin cheerily enough, with Shakira on colorful roller skates in the midst of a complete fan-frenzy. She waves, laughing, probably thinking that they should be charged money to look at her. Of course, the next directorial decision is to have her writhing all over the beach with front row tickets to ab city. All of this is deftly mixed in with footage of Shakira dancing in the streets to the delight of onlookers armed with camera phones and stalkers wielding duct tape. When Dizzee Rascal hits the mic, Shakira is off in her own version of “The Motorcycle Diaries,” chauffeured by a tattooed man who would never be allowed to pick up children from day care. They ride away into an ambiguous sunset: the time changes so frequently throughout the video that you can’t tell—is it morning? Is a storm brewing? Is it time for Africa yet?
Then Shakira is in the air. “Bring it On” style. She’s flying into the splits and doing things with her legs that only Gumby dolls ought to do. Though her vertical jump probably is very high, my money is on a hidden trampoline in the sand. All of this madness concludes with Shakira submerging herself into the ocean in a manner much akin to Virginia Woolf’s final-act-wading-out-to-sea. It’s OK for our friend Shakira, though, because in the concluding seconds of the video she’s giggling away before probably shouting: “Aye not dead! Just loca!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an appearance at the Harvard Book Store yesterday, Amy L. Chua ’84 said that while her book “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother” has garnered significant criticism, she wrote the work propelled by a desire to share the story of her relationship with her two daughters.
After the publication of an excerpt in The Wall Street Journal, Chua became the subject of widespread debate as a virulent criticism quickly built against her advocacy of allegedly typical Chinese parenting techniques.
“I could not in a million years imagine my book to be perceived this way, as preaching Chinese parenting as superior,” said Chua, a Yale Law School professor. “This is not a parenting book. It is a memoir. This book was written in a time of genuine family crisis when I thought my family was falling apart.”
Chua said she was taken aback by the fact that no critic had reviewed her book as it was originally intended.
“The book is a lot more complicated than how it was initially portrayed,” Chua said, referencing the Wall Street Journal article that drew widespread attention and generated international controversy. “I wanted to write a self-critical book. I thought it was actually pretty funny.”
Chua said that while her parenting technique worked well with her older daughter, the method ran into trouble with her younger daughter, who, Chua said, was “a fireball.”
In the weeks following the publication of the excerpt in The Wall Street Journal, Chua tried to soften her perception as a so-called “Tiger Mother,” and has often said that her work was meant, at least in part, as a critical evaluation of her parenting style.
Chua said that she intended her book to serve as a universal work that would attract audiences from a variety of races and backgrounds.
“I feel like Amy Chua actually portrays a pretty positive image of herself,” said Eliza M. Nguyen ’14, a Crimson News comper. “Before coming here, I expected her to be more serious, but she’s actually pretty funny, personable and friendly.”
Following the event, about 35 students joined Professor Alfred C. Yen from Boston College Law School who moderated a follow-up discussion sponsored by the Harvard Political Union and the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian-American Association.
The debrief served as a forum to reflect on Chua’s book and how the book was perceived by parents and children.
“Chua is refreshing in contrast to what I hear back at home,” said Robert K. Nishihara ’13. “Parents are often worried there’s too much work, AP classes, and stress, but the value of education is important to acknowledge. And parents should have high expectations.”
Yen asked the audience to consider whether Chua associated Asian culture with a specific form of strict parenting.
“If she did not want to associate a parenting style with Asian-ness, why wouldn’t she say strict parenting or tiger parenting instead of Chinese parenting?” Yen said. “Does she avoid essentialist trap?”
Students debated whether the premise of a tiger mother prioritizes nature over nurture, or vice versa. Topics of discussion also included if this stern parenting style advantages or disadvantages children, as students shared their personal stories with their own parents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Career Services discovered a loophole in its traveling and graduate fellowship application system last Thursday which allowed students to view faculty recommendation letters.
According to OCS director Robin Mount, the problem was quickly solved, and the population affected was relatively small, most of whom were seniors.
Since last fall, notification e-mails were sent to faculty members—with students copied on the message—when they uploaded recommendation letters.
Those e-mails included a link at the bottom of the e-mail that allowed students to view their letters of recommendation.
The problem with the link to recommendation letters was first reported in mid-January by a student applicant, Mount said.
At that point, OCS stopped copying students on notification e-mails.
But students who had previously received notification e-mails could still access their letter of recommendation.
It is unclear how many students clicked on the link and viewed the recommendation letter submitted for them, but by last Thursday students notified Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith about the problem. Smith then brought the problem to OCS, which hastened to close the loophole.
“We take full responsibility. It was a mistake.” Mount said.
“But it was an honest mistake in designing a product that would serve our community better.”
“A few curious students hit the link and they realized that they could see the recommendation letter,” Mount added.
To solve the problem, OCS worked with Symplicity, a software company, to disable the links that were previously sent out to students.
“We manually sent out new links to recommenders so that those who are currently in the process could still go into the system,” said Deb Carroll, the director of the On-Campus Interview and Employer Relations Office.
“None of their recommendations
were lost,” she said.
Mount said that the problem is fixed and that the recommendation system has not been compromised.
“The most important thing to communicate is that no one hacked into the system.” Mount said.
“We are right in the middle of the most intense fellowship submission process. We don’t want to put fear in anybody.”
OCS has sent a letter to all the students and faculty members in the fellowship application system, explaining the nature of the loophole and the measures that OCS has taken to correct it.
The letter emphasized that “currently no student can access any recommendation files on the system or any files at all other than those containing submissions by the student himself or herself.”
“I just want to thank students for being such honest communicators and helping us fix this problem,” Mount said.
“We welcome critique and advice to help us improve our services.”
Smith declined to comment for this story. Symplicity could not be reached for comment yesterday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A total of 332 graduate students applied for residential tutor positions in Harvard’s 12 residential Houses for the fall 2011 term, 5 more than applied last year.
Residential tutors, which are typically Harvard and MIT graduate students, receive free room and board in exchange for monitoring and advising undergraduates.
Applicants are able to apply to multiple Houses, an option many take advantage of, according to Dustin M. Saldarriaga, a Cabot tutor involved in the selection process.
Although the number of applicants leveled out this year, over the past three years the number of applicants increased, which many attributed to the difficult economic climate.
Gina D. Burke, director of housing for the Office of Student Life, said that she did not know why the number seems to have stabilized this year.
There was some variation in the number of applicants among individual Houses.
Cabot received about 230 applicants according to Saldarriaga, which he said represented a decrease from last year’s number.
About 250 people applied to Adams House, which Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said is about 30 to 50 fewer than last year.
Diana L. Eck, House Master of Lowell, said that Lowell received 275 applications for its two open spots—a significant increase over the 212 applications it received for the fall 2010 term.
Currier had 247 applicants, according to Kristen A. Lindquist, a senior resident tutor in Currier who was involved in the selection process.
The priority deadline for tutor applications was Jan. 28, but most Houses are still accepting applicants.
Kirkland, Lowell, and Adams generally receive the largest number of applicants by the time the process is complete, according to Van C. Tran, Lowell House tutor.
The tutor application website said that preliminary decisions should be made around Feb. 25.
Most houses are still in the process of determining how many residential tutors they will be able to hire.
That number varies between houses and depends on the number of tutors departing at the end of the current school year.
Anne G. Douglas ’12, co-chair of the Adams House Committee, said the number of available spots can change throughout the year as current tutors finalize their plans.
“It isn’t really a black and white process because even when they send out the invitations to applicants, things can still change,” Douglas said.
Many Houses involve students and tutors in the selection process, which generally involves reviewing the applications and a series of interviews.
“We’re looking for someone that either has experience in a residential community or really does seem to value community,” Saldarriaga said.
House Masters have the final say in tutor hiring.

Two members of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, which was commissioned by President Obama, discussed their findings before a packed crowd in Science Center D yesterday.
Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray, who was on the commission, began the program with a brief overview of the human and economic loss from last April’s spill, as well as the confusion that followed.
“The response plans of the entire industry were laughable,” Murray said. “Basically what it was is that they hired the same contractor to write the response plan and no one really looked at  it and they kind of went on the shelf.”
Murray said that BP’s unsatisfactory plan led to confusion over who was in charge of managing the many tasks associated with the cleanup.
Several times during the evening, Murray contrasted the oil drilling industry with the nuclear industry, at one point mentioning that unlike the nuclear industry, the oil industry does not have an independent overseeing safety agency to establish common safety regulations.
Richard A. Sears, a visiting scientist at MIT, was another member of the commission and spoke at yesterday’s event.
Both guest speakers voiced their opinions on the factors that led up to the oil spill and the failures that occurred once the cleanup began.
While Dean Murray’s thoughts on the spill often centered on managerial problems, Sears focused on the technical aspects of the spill.
According to Sears, BP used “hyper-linear thinking” to make unsound assumptions and then base further decisions on those assumptions.
Sears also said that BP did not have adequate sensory equipment to detect the problems that would later result in the spill.
“The blowout preventer is an integral piece of drilling equipment,” Sears said.
“It is there as the last line of defense.”
Blowout preventers are valves that monitor oil and gas wells.
“There’s no sensors within that blowout preventer to warn anyone on the rig floor that there is oil and gas coming in,” he said.
The evening’s program came roughly one month after the release of the final report from the commission, which Obama established in May last year.
The discussion was sponsored by the Future of Energy series and was free to the public.

Scientists discussed the importance and impact of the Human Genome Project yesterday at a panel moderated by University President Drew G. Faust in honor of the tenth anniversary of the publication of a nearly complete genome map in the scientific journal Nature.
The panelists—professors, a Genome Project leader, and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner—all agreed that the mapping of the human genome was tremendously valuable and will continue to drive research for many years to come.
An international undertaking that successfully mapped the entire human genome in 2003, the Project has had an enormous impact on research, considering its relatively recent publication a decade ago, according to Medical School professor Eric S. Lander, who spoke on the panel and also directs the Harvard and MIT-affiliated Broad Institute.
“They have the tools to do today what it used to take armies to do,” Lander said.
Yet Lander and some of his fellow panelists added that some public expectations of immediate results were impractical.
“The discipline of inventing medicine is one that takes a very long time,” said Vicki L. Sato ’68, a professor at Harvard Business School and the Molecular and Cellular Biology department.
M. Susan Lindee, chair of the Department of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, brought up ethical questions that have arisen due to the recent availability of genomic information.
For example, doctors or scientists are left with an ethical dilemma when they discover that an individual has an incurable disease after conducting unrelated genetic testing, or when they discover that an individual is not in fact the father of his child.
Panelists added that more cooperation between scientists of different disciplines has been required to operate the new genetic sequencing technologies and decipher the results.
Student response to the panel was quite positive.
“I thought it was inspiring, and showed how important education in science is in our country,” Matthew D. Moellman ’14 said.
The panelists posed many important questions about where society and science are headed, according to Brandon Liu ’14.
“Clearly this is a critical moment as we are just beginning to integrate genomics into medical care,” FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg ’77 said.

Former Children’s Hospital Boston Pediatrician Melvin D. Levine died Friday last week, a day after a class action lawsuit claiming he sexually abused his patients was filed against him. He was 71.
Officials in North Carolina, where Levine, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, lived after leaving Massachusetts in 1985, have yet to disclose a cause of death.
Attorneys behind the class action suit allege that Levine engaged in inappropriate conduct with his patients over the course of his career.
“From 1966 through at least 2006, Melvin Levine would, during the course
of medical examinations, make kids strip naked, and then in a non-medical way would manipulate their genitals,” said Carmen L. Durso, the attorney representing the plaintiffs. “My office has talked to in excess of 60 people who all tell the same story.”
Edward F. Mahoney, Levine’s attorney, denied the allegations in a statement released Friday.
“This entire episode has been a tragedy,” Mahoney said. “Throughout it, Dr. Levine never wavered that his care and treatment of all children was appropriate in all respects, and he steadfastly denied the allegations against him.”
Levine, a Rhodes Scholar, worked at Children’s Hospital from 1966 to 1985, when he moved to the University of North Carolina Medical Center , retiring in 2006.
Over his career, Levine saw over 15,000 patients, and around 40 of those patients from his time at Children’s Hospital joined the suit, according to the complaint filed in Suffolk County Superior Court.
Levine signed a consent order in 2009 that barred him from ever practicing medicine again after five former north Carolina patients came forward with allegations of abuse, according to Durso.
In 2008, Levine voluntarily gave up his North Carolina medical license.
Children’s Hospital investigated a claim of abuse that surfaced after Levine’s departure but found no wrongdoing.
The suit filed against Levine also accuses Children’s Hospital of negligence.
Durso contends that Children’s was negligent in allowing Levine to meet with his patients in “secluded” places without parental supervision.
“My clients blame Children’s equally for not taking appropriate action,” Durso said.
Children’s Hospital released a statement defending its actions in reference to Levine.
“The fact of the matter is that except for the one complaint we investigated, no one alerted the hospital to any concerns regarding Dr. Levine. The hospital supervised Dr. Levine’s practice in accordance with the applicable standards of the time.”
The University of North Carolina Medical Center declined to comment on the allegations levied against Levine.

Leila Fawaz, a Tufts University professor and Middle East scholar, will lead Harvard’s Board of Overseers, one of Harvard’s highest governing bodies, for the 2011-2012 academic year, the University announced last week.
Robert N. Shapiro ’72, a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray and a former president of the Harvard Alumni Association and the Harvard Law School Association, will serve as the Board of Overseers’ vice-chair.
“We’re greatly fortunate to have such an outstanding pair of Overseers to lead the board forward next year,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “Leila Fawaz and Rob Shapiro have brought extraordinary dedication and insight to their service as Overseers these past five years, and it will be a privilege to benefit from their leadership and guidance in 2011-12.”
Fawaz and Shapiro will assume their positions following Commencement this May. They will succeed former solicitor general Seth P. Waxman ’73 and Massachusetts Technology Collaborative Executive Director Mitchell L. Adams ’66.
“Certainly, together with my fellow Overseers, I hope to support President Faust and her colleagues in their vigorous efforts to adapt to changing times and to maintain Harvard’s standing as the best university in the world,” Fawaz wrote in an e-mail.
Fawaz was the founding director of the Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies at Tufts University, and also serves as a professor of history at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
Fawaz, who was raised in Lebanon, studied at the American University of Beirut before pursuing graduate degrees in history at Harvard—in 1972 she received an A.M. and in 1979 she received a Ph.D.
She has been a member of the Board of Overseers since 2006 and has served on the executive committee since 2009. She is the head of the board’s social sciences committee and serves on a number of other committees.
“I expect that we will also be thinking about such issues as Harvard’s evolving international agenda, its efforts to think innovatively about teaching and learning in the college and across the schools, and the ways the different parts of the University can work together both academically and administratively,” Fawaz wrote.
Shapiro graduated from the College in 1972 and concentrated in philosophy. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and received a J.D. from the Law School in 1978.
Shapiro currently chairs the Overseers’ standing committee on institutional policy.
Shapiro was on the Harvard Corporation’s governance review committee last year, which resulted in a historic governance overhaul that dramatically expanded the size of the Corporation.
Next year will be the final year of both Fawaz and Shapiro’s six-year Overseer term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a panel discussion yesterday, speakers at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government argued that the election of President Obama has not translated into a post-racial society.
Speakers at the panel titled “Bending the Arc of Justice: Black History and the American Radical Tradition,” said the election of Obama, while a major victory for black community, has distracted the public from many social issues that still exist within minority communities.
“I see it as a distraction from the challenges that marginalized communities have historically faced and will continue to face in the future,” said Panelist Monique W. Morris, vice president for research and advocacy at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. “The success of one individual was important in altering the narrative of America, but as a result we are less inclined to focus on the quest for justice.”
If society focuses on issues of mass incarceration, residential segregation, and educational disparity through the lens of one man’s success, the public will lose sight of many of the ongoing injustices that disproportionately affect blacks, Morris said.
“African Americans are the people most likely to be incarcerated within the world,” she added.
Yesterday’s panel—moderated by Timothy P. McCarthy, director of the Human Rights and Social Movements Program at the Kennedy School—was organized in honor of Black History Month to discuss the history of black political movements and their continuing effects on modern day politics.
Some of yesterday’s speakers also argued that many misinterpreted the grassroots support for Obama’s presidential campaign.
“The problem with the social movement that got him [elected to office] was that they couldn’t agree on anything else,” Peniel E. Joseph, a professor at Tufts University who spoke at the event.
Joseph argued that the campaign was mobilized by a number of disparate social advocacy groups that grew disaffected after the Obama administration failed to directly address the wide range of his supporters’ concerns.
“We confused this campaign with a movement,” McCarthy added.
Joseph and the other panelists said that it is vital that Americans not allow the so-called “era of post-racial politics”  breed political complacency.
“To quote Congressman [John R.] Lewis, ‘Barack Obama is what we get at the end of that bridge to Selma, but we can’t forget that there are still many bridges to cross,’” said Joseph.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mellow music played in the background as union supporters and their opponents chanted across a divided, police monitored Beacon Street in front of the Massachusetts State House yesterday.
The rally was a reaction to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed ban on collective bargaining in the state. Massachusetts union workers were called upon by their unions to show support for government union members in Wisconsin.
Unions in attendance at yesterday’s rally included the Boston Public School Teachers Union, Service Employees International Union, Iron Workers Local Union No. 7 and Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
Union workers carried signs that bore logos such as “united we bargain, divided we beg”.
State senators and representatives were also present in support of the unions, as was the State Secretary of Labor Joanne F. Goldstein.
The rally also attracted the attention of many union opponents, who stood in front of Boston Common and protested many of the pro-union speakers.
Harvard union members said they felt that the event was important to attend because many of the issues facing the Wisconsin unions feel very close to home.
“The pressures on any employer are the same,” said HUCTW member Lesley A. Schoenfeld, a Harvard Law School Library Assistant.
She stressed that unions are important because they give workers an opportunity for a voice, which they would not otherwise have.
Adrienne Landau, another HUCTW member, echoed Schoenfeld’s view on the importance of unions, saying that employers often try and save money by “not giving people the power of negotiation.”
The speakers at the event argued that unions are the backbone of the modern economy.
“Why would [Walker] stab a knife into the heart of the economy?” one of the speakers asked the audience. The question was answered with an eruption of cheers.
While union supporters outnumbered their opponents, they faced a vocal opposition.
The crowd gathered on the other side of the Beacon Street and held signs with slogans such as “Labor Yes, Unions No” and chants, including “You work for us.”
“It’s time to get tougher on the unions,” said Earl H. Sholley, a Mass. Republican who ran against Congressman Barney Frank.

Nancy E. Laird has been appointed as an Associate Dean of the College and Director of Budgets and Finance, according to an e-mail sent to the College staff late last week.
Laird, the current director of budget and financial planning in executive education at the Harvard Kennedy School, will start at the College on March 21.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mail that Laird will be filling the shoes of Patricia B. Harrington, who vacated the post in order to serve as director of finance and administration in the office of the University President and Provost.
Laird will be responsible for managing the budget of the College and working closely with D. E. Lorraine Sterritt, the College’s dean for administration, to allocate financial resources, according to Neal.
She will also oversee the work of the College’s financial analysts.
Laird said in an e-mail that she will coordinate with College units such as the Office of Student Life and the Freshman Dean’s Office.
Laird also wrote that she will serve as a liaison to the FAS, which includes the College in its budget.
Coming from the Kennedy School, Laird wrote that, “I was most attracted to the opportunity to work at the College, which is the ‘heart’ of the university.”
Earlier in her career, Laird worked as a senior financial and planning administrator at Harvard Medical School.
Prior to her time at Harvard, Laird held positions in financial planning and budgeting with the State of New York and the New York City Housing Authority.

University President Drew G. Faust will join a newly formed American Academy of Arts and Sciences commission that aims to examine and improve teaching and research in the social sciences and humanities, the Academy announced last week.
The commission was formed at the request of several Republican and Democratic members of Congress who charged the Academy with examining how the nation can bolster scholarship and education in the humanities and social sciences through the efforts of Congress, state governments, universities, non-profits, and schools.
“As our world becomes more interconnected, building a solid foundation in the humanities is of vital national importance,” said North Carolina Representative David E. Price, who helped draft the Congressional request, in a press release.
The Commission’s membership includes scholars in the humanities and social science disciplines, scientists, leading business leaders, philanthropists, and other professionals.
Faust will serve alongside Harvard Law School Professor Annette Gordon-Reed, philanthropist Carl H. Pforzheimer III ’58, former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61, artist Chuck Close, movie producer George Lucas, and actor John Lithgow ’67.
A national assessment of the humanities and social sciences has not been conducted in 30 years since the 1980 report of the Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities.
Duke University President and Commission Co-Chair Richard H. Brodhead emphasized the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the United States’ future prosperity.
“The humanities and social sciences provide the intellectual framework for the nation’s economic, political, and governing institutions,” said Brodhead in a press release.
The Commission plans to complete its assessment over the next 18 to 24 months, according to the press release.
Faust could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Senior heavyweight rower David Wakulich set a record for the fastest ever 2000 meter time for Harvard on Sunday at the C.R.A.S.H.-B. Regatta at Agganis Arena.
Wakulich, Harvard’s sole heavyweight representative, entered himself into the competition because he wanted to test himself and take advantage of his last chance to compete in the event while at Harvard.
Wakulich, grew up in St. Catharines, Ont., a rowing town, and picked up the sport in high school after a family friend and coach encouraged him.
After being injured in the beginning of his college career, Wakulich developed quickly in his sophomore spring, earning a spot in the first varsity boat that year.
“He’s stronger now than he’s been at any point,” coach Harry Parker said. “He’s also been very good rowing at home in Canada.”
Harvard doesn’t specifically train for this event, but Wakulich took the initiative to enter the race and better himself.
“It’s a neat venue—a lot of noise and a pretty energetic atmosphere,” said Wakulich of the event. “The noise boosts your performance. They might not be cheering for you, but you can pretend everyone is. It definitely is a confidence boost.”
This historic event brings 2000+ male and female coxswains, lightweight, and heavyweight rowers to Boston, ranging in age from 14 to 90+.
Prior to competing, rowers submit their latest 2k sprint times and are positioned based on time for their race. The top recorded times are grouped together in the front row of ergs, and Wakulich was competing there in the event’s final race of the day.
“[Wakulich was in] the honor row [where] the fastest people that everyone wants to watch sit,” junior rower Nick Jordan said.
“It’s helpful to initially sit down and see two huge guys beside me and think, ‘okay, I gotta pull hard,’” Wakulich added.
Wakulich was looking to test himself against his own time as well as the other best in the world, so he encouraged his good friend, Washington sophomore Conlin McCabe, with whom he rowed on the Canadian junior team, to enter. Wakulich wanted the competition to make him row faster, and he was aware of McCabe’s caliber and training. McCabe ended up winning the event with a time of 5:48.0.
Overall, Wakulich placed fifth out of about 250 rowers and third in the Under-23 division. His lightning speed of 5:56.9, just .1 seconds behind the 4th place finisher, was .9 faster than his previous time, making it a personal best and the fastest time for Harvard yet.
“He’s always been one of our leading members,” Harvard captain Ant Locke said. “He always manages to produce performances when it counts.”
“Dave is a very, very capable rower,” Parker continued. “He works very hard and he’s getting stronger every year. He did an outstanding bit of rowing on Sunday.”
Wakulich recorded the faster ever 2k time for Harvard Crew, beating the previous best by Malcolm Howard (5:57.8) in 2004, the year that Harvard won the National Championship in rowing. Howard went on to win Olympic Gold in the 8+ at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing for Canada.
Wakulich is looking into the future to perhaps follow in Howard’s footsteps. The Olympics has always been in the back of his mind as a goal and something to work toward.
“I’m starting to get pretty excited about the prospect of rowing for the Canadian national team,” Wakulich said. “I’m looking forward to U23’s this summer if I can stay healthy and not break anything.”
Knowing that someone else got a faster time on Sunday drives Wakulich to train harder and be faster.
“What this time means is that I still have to go a little faster,” he said. “The evidence is right there of the fellow who won, getting a time over and above any other college student in the nation.”
“It is somewhere I need to be if I want to perform at a world championship or Olympic level,” Wakulich said.
And competing at the Olympics is a “reasonable aspiration” for him, according to Parker.
“He could potentially compete at the international level,” Parker said. “He’s not very far away from it now.”
Coach Parker and Wakulich’s teammates commented on his lighthearted demeanor, which contrasts his 6’8’’, 214 lb frame.
“He’s an exceptional athlete giving just his size and physical capabilities, along with how coordinated he is,” Jordan said. “He has great physical gifts for the sport of rowing...He’s surprisingly goofy and easy to talk to for how intense and focused he is.”
“He’s an interesting fellow with a great sense of humor. He’s a real asset to our team,” Parker added. “He’s very promising.”
For now, Wakulich is focusing on the spring and summer season for Harvard.
“I want to do well here,” he said. “I want to win a National Championship for Harvard this year.”
As for his future: “I’d love to be rowing,” said Wakulich. He hopes to compete in Amsterdam for Canada, and hopefully make a boat for the Senior National Team. He is looking into moving to the west coast of Canada to Victoria to train for a living.
As for his new record?
“It’s an open invitation for any Harvard oarsmen, past and future, to go faster,” Wakulich said. “I won’t be content if that record stands for more than a year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So often coach speak rings hollow. Teams talk about each person knowing his role or doing what it takes to win, while at the same time players are checking box scores and chasing personal accolades. But with the Harvard men’s basketball team, I’m beginning to believe the clichés.
Take, for example, sophomore forward Christian Webster’s weekend. On Friday against Cornell, Webster shouldered much of the offensive load. He had the hot hand—going four-of-eight from the field and three-of-six from distance—and his teammates were looking for him. Much to the ire of the Big Red faithful, the sophomore pulled off the rare feat of drawing fouls on three separate three-point attempts, including one four-point play, en route to scoring a game-high 20 points in a 73-60 win.
This performance came on the heels of a ridiculous second half against Brown the previous weekend, in which Webster tallied 18 points in 15 minutes to spark a 24-point comeback. Naturally, you’d expect the forward to settle into the role of a primary scorer. Against Columbia—one of the worst defensive teams in the league—Webster would surely try to match his last two offensive outputs. Wrong. Webster scored exactly zero points against the Lions on Saturday.
But the sophomore didn’t have an off night. In fact, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and Webster’s teammates were quick to credit him for the win. Tasked with guarding Noruwa Agho—the Ivies’ second-leading scorer—Webster went from a go-to scorer to a defensive stopper.
Holding Agho to just seven points on two-of-12 shooting and notching three steals, Webster was the key cog of a defense that limited Columbia to a season-low scoring total, as the Crimson cruised to a 61-42 victory.
Webster’s weekend was indicative of a larger trend for this Harvard squad: players fulfill team needs rather than personal goals. Webster is far from the only player carrying out this “we, not me” attitude.
So far this season, sophomore guard Brandyn Curry has run up a well rounded but modest (at least by All-Ivy standards) stat line of 9.4 points, 5.5 assists, and four rebounds per game. Yet the numbers don’t show that Curry has been the maestro behind the Ivy League’s best offense. On Saturday against Columbia, he had the Lions’ guards on skates all evening, but rather than create shots for himself, Curry created open looks for his teammates.
Sophomore forward Kyle Casey is the most athletic player on the court most nights that Harvard takes the floor. But rather than outrun, outmuscle, and outjump his individual defender, Casey has relied on an arsenal of mid-range jumpers and drives to the hoop that best fit the Crimson’s offensive system.
Junior co-captain Keith Wright, whose production in the post has been Harvard’s bread and butter, had a relatively quiet weekend offensively but made it his mission to control the glass. The big man corralled 11 boards in Ithaca and 12 the next night in New York, as he recorded his 10th and 11th double-doubles of the season.
Junior co-captain Oliver McNally bounced back from a sprained ankle to provide defensive leadership on Friday and an offensive lift—he totaled 15 points—on Saturday. The victory at Penn on Feb. 5th, in which McNally scored just seven points but did not hesitate to take and make the game-winner, typified how the junior picks his spots and leads the team when it needs him the most.
Harvard’s starters aren’t the only ones who have embraced their roles. Freshman guard Laurent Rivard has been a lethal shooter off the bench, freshman guard Matt Brown has become a lockdown defender, and sophomore forward Jeff Georgatos has been a reliable big.
The Crimson’s “teamness” has given the squad incredible flexibility and balance. Five players have led the team in scoring; six average more than 9.4 points per game. Harvard is perhaps the most challenging team to prepare for because it can beat its opponents in a variety of ways—in the post with Wright and Casey, on the perimeter with Rivard and Webster, up top with McNally and Curry, or at the free throw line with just about anyone.
Last season, then-Yale coach James Jones said that he thought the Crimson was better (at least offensively) with Jeremy Lin ’10 on the bench. He believed Harvard was more multi-dimensional and used its weapons more fully when the All-Ivy guard took a seat. His comments seemed blasphemous at the time, but, with the Crimson sitting at 20-4, they’re looking more and more prescient. He won’t be proven right, however, unless Harvard can go further than it did last year. It’s only two weeks until the Ivy’s bid to The Dance is determined. Only then, we’ll have our answer.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Though Harvard managed less than half as many shots as Brown last night in Providence, two early goals were enough.
The Crimson (7-19-1, 5-14-1 ECAC) found the net twice in the first period, and a strong showing in goal from senior Ryan Carroll allowed the team to take down the Bears (8-14-5, 6-12-2). The win gives the team a chance to improve its standing next weekend for the upcoming ECAC playoffs.
The two teams combined for 14 penalties in the game, including eight in the second period. Harvard was able to capitalize on its power play chances in the first period, going two-for-three in the opening frame.
Sophomore forward Conor Morrison netted the game’s first goal, finding a crease to his left behind the goalie after a pass across the net.
The second goal, also on the power play, came with just under three minutes left in the first period. Sophomore defenseman Danny Biega fired a shot from in front of the blue line to push the game to 2-0.
Junior forward Alex Killorn looked to have tipped the puck as it went into the net, and was originally credited with the goal. After video review, it was determined that the puck actually deflected off of a Brown defender and into the net. Biega was credited with the goal during the first intermission, and it is his fourth in his last five games.
“[Biega] is really starting to blossom as a player,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “Since Christmas, he’s really elevated his game, along with others. That’s been a real key component to our better play as of late.”
Despite outshooting the Crimson 41 to 20, Brown had trouble finding the back of the net. The team squandered a number of potential chances for a power play with penalties of their own, and the Bears were zero-for-four with the one-man advantage.
Brown had a number of chances late in the game, particularly in the third period. The Bears outshot Harvard by a margin of 20 to one in the last 20 minutes, but could register just one score, at 8:08 off of a mid-rink steal.
“We were just being real aggressive, blocking shots,” Carroll said. “They didn’t get any opportunities from anywhere in close.”
There were a number of close calls—one shot went off the post, and Brown missed a number of potential scoring chances with passes in front of the net. The Bears pulled their goalie with a little more than a minute left to play, and the team had a number of near-misses in the last 90 seconds.
“[Carroll has] done a great job controlling his rebounds, and he’s very calm in there,” Donato said. “He’s done a great job with making sure that a lot of their opportunities are one shot and out, not getting multiple chances.”
The game is also the Crimson’s third in the last four days. The team played on the road over the weekend against Colgate and Cornell.
Harvard plays more weekday games than other collegiate hockey teams, but the team’s recent schedule is still unusually packed.
“Three games in four nights is tough, but I think even more is the travel. There was a lot of snow Saturday post-game coming out of Colgate,” Donato said. “We didn’t get in until almost 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning. It was a quick turnaround, but I thought our guys really came out strong today.”
The ECAC rivalry was tense at moments, and Donato attributes the aggression to Brown’s “in-your-face style.” Referees had to intervene in a number of different skirmishes, including a brief multi-player confrontation after the final buzzer.
“[Brown’s aggression] doesn’t really affect our game play, but we’re more weary of it,” Carroll said. “They come hard, and we were ready for it.”
Despite the strong offensive showing on the part of the Bears late in the game, Brown could not capitalize on the Crimson’s apparent fatigue, and Harvard’s play around its net allowed the team’s two first-period goals to hold. Carroll controlled most of shots, and the defense cleared its rebounds effectively.
“For the first two periods, we executed pretty well and the power play…was very solid,” Donato said. “We knew this one was going to be a tough game, and it was, but it’s a good sign that we had enough to get the victory.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As midterms and papers slowly crush all of us, the athletes of Harvard are crunched for time as they battle to win not only Ivy League glory, but national recognition too. Basketball is coming to a close and a chance at making history is on the horizon. While women’s squash may have come to a close, the men’s team can redeem themselves after last week’s loss to Yale, and the women’s swimming and diving Ivy League Championships are on tap for this week. Take a break from your studies to check out what’s going on around the Ivy League in this week’s edition of Around the Water Cooler.
As the basketball regular seasons come to a close, both Harvard men’s and women’s squads have a chance at doing something that’s never happened in this history of Harvard: hold the Ivy League title at the same time. The men’s team has never won the title and currently sits atop the rankings alongside rival Princeton, while the women’s team is one game behind the Tigers. If it wins the Ivy League it will receive its first bid to NCAA March Madness tournament to compete for the national championship.  Princeton’s men’s team had sole possession of first place until this past weekend when the Tigers lost to Brown in a major upset.
Harvard’s women’s team won both of its games over the weekend against Columbia and Cornell. Similar fortunes of victory may be bestowed upon the Big Red’s squad when it hosts Princeton this coming Saturday. An unlikely win by Cornell over the Tigers would also place the Crimson in a tie for the number one spot.
In other women’s basketball news, Harvard freshman guard Christine Clark has earned recognition as Ivy League Rookie of the Week. This is her third time receiving the award and deservedly so after having a career-high 28 points against Columbia. Junior Brogan Berry also received recognition this weekend for scoring the 1,000th point of her career.
This week is also set to be dramatic with the Crimson women’s swimming and diving team at the Ivy League Championships on Feb. 24-26. Princeton has been picked as the favorite to win the championships due to the fact that they were dual-season champions after remaining undefeated in the Ivy League. Last year’s championships were the closest in the Ancient Eight’s history after the Tigers narrowly beat Harvard by 30 points. The Crimson’s only loss this year came at the hands of Princeton, making for a mighty rematch this coming weekend.
In squash, the Yale women were able to defeat Harvard, the defending national champion, for the Ivy League title last week. This week, the Bulldogs were once again pitted against Harvard for the Howe Cup—the award given to the CSA National Team Champion—and came out victorious, remaining undefeated throughout their entire season.
Yale also asserted itself in men’s squash last week by defeating the Crimson at Harvard for the Ivy League Championship. They are to return to Cambridge yet again this week on Feb. 25-27 to battle for the Howe Cup on the men’s side.

Even though Harvard’s men’s hockey team has struggled earlier in the season, the squad has been holding its own and impressing many in the past week. Sophomore defensemen Danny Biega put up a series of impressive performances, winning Inside College Hockey National Player of the Week, ECAC Hockey MLX Skates Player of the Week, and Harvard COOP Athlete of the Week.
The Quebec-native, whose brother also plays on the team, has posted a goal in four-straight games, while adding five assists and nine points. In this four-game span, the Crimson finished off the 59th annual Beanpot in third place after beating rival No. 15 Boston University, 5-4. The game featured Biega scoring the tying goal with four minutes left in the final period. On the road against Cornell, Harvard finished off the Big Red, 4-3, with a game-winning goal by Biega 12:27 into the final period.
After a tough loss on the road to Colgate, 2-1, in which Biega scored the only Crimson goal, Harvard defeated longtime rival Brown, 2-1, in the 158th meeting of the two teams. Not surprisingly, Biega scored the decisive shot in the first period that helped the Crimson hold on for the win.
With the final games of the regular season coming at home against Clarkson and St. Lawrence this weekend, Harvard has a great chance to improve their current 11th place standing in the ECAC.

You're in your dorm room late at night, and you're starving. You're sick of food from the Kong and Noch's, and although there are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance, the weather outside is frigid. Enter SeamlessWeb, an online service that facilitates delivery and take-out orders from nearby restaurants.
SeamlessWeb was inspired by employees at large corporations who wanted "to be able to go home and have access to 40 cuisine types, ratings, reviews … deals of the day, pictures of their food," said Ryan Scott, chief marketing officer of SeamlessWeb.
Through SeamlessWeb, users in 27 cities in the United States and the United Kingdom can find restaurants in their area, browse menus, and place orders.
"People are still ordering take-out and delivery via the phone and paper menu, and paper menus are a dreaded icon in top metropolitan areas," Scott said. "You might be missing out on a special deal and it's certainly not environmentally friendly."
SeamlessWeb, however, offers discounts for first-time orders at many restaurants and allows customers to select an "eco-friendly" option if they prefer to receive deliveries without excess plastic or napkins. The service is also available as a mobile application for iPhone, Blackberry, and Android phones.
Whether you're ordering late-night favorites or exploring new options in the Square, SeamlessWeb aims to be "the most convenient way to get exactly what you want," Scott said. And with over 50 restaurants in the Cambridge area, you’re bound to find something you like.

Approximately 15 students gathered in Emerson Hall earlier this afternoon for peppermint tea, vegan snickerdoodles, and discussion at the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior's inaugural CommuniTea event of the semester.
"We do a mix of activities," HSMBB Co-Chair Jackson M. Kernion '12 said. "For academic events, we invite our favorite professors to talk to a small group of undergrads in an informal setting about their work."
The group also plans a symposium each year for students pursuing MBB tracks within a variety of concentrations and others interested in MBB-related topics.
The afternoon’s event was planned as a discussion with Harvard Medical School neurology Professor Carole E. Landisman concerning the effect of synaptic plasticity on everyday experiences such as perception and memory.
"It's usually very informal," said Natalie C. Padilla '12, the coordinator of the event. "We try to look up MBB faculty or people who have classes that are up-and-coming."
As the hour wound up, some of the students began their own MBB-centered discussions, ranging thematically from the relationship between neurons and memory to the mental complexity necessary to speak tonal languages like Mandarin.
Although Landisman did not end up making an appearance, most students seemed content to mingle alongside similarly-minded peers.
