After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a number of injuries making the success of Harvard wrestling uncertain, the squad emerged from its first weekend of dual meets to prove one thing—the Crimson will not go down without a fight. Harvard (1-1-1) split its slate of contests, topping Franklin & Marshall, 29-15, and falling to Rutgers, 29-14, on Friday before tying Hofstra, 20-20, yesterday.
“We didn’t wrestle well [Friday], but I’m excited how some guys turned it around [Saturday],” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “They were a lot better and showed more enthusiasm.”
HARVARD 20, HOFSTRA 20
The energy that Weiss observed on the mat in Saturday’s contest against the Pride will prove crucial for the Crimson as the dual season unfolds, given the number of sidelined grapplers. Harvard bounced back from its loss to Rutgers by winning four of the eight bouts contested at the Mack Sports Complex, but with heavyweight Spencer DeSena out due to a skin infection, the Crimson forfeited the final matchup and settled for a tie.
“We probably should have beaten [Hofstra],” co-captain J.P. O’Connor said. “We pushed them to the limit…everyone went out and fought…but it hurt to lose the six points.”
O’Connor—ranked No. 1 in the nation at 157 lbs.—earned a 6-1 decision over No. 19 Jonny Bonilla-Bowman to cap an undefeated weekend and push his record to 17-0.
Fellow co-captain No. 10 Louis Caputo (184) also completed a flawless weekend, dominating Anthony Tortora for a 9-1 major decision that extended Harvard’s lead to 20-10 with two bouts remaining.
“[Caputo] looks good, he’s firing on all cylinders,” O’Connor said. “It’s really great to have him back in the mix, especially with us being banged up. He’s one of the best in the country.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, Hofstra responded with a major decision of its own at 197 lbs., yielding a tie after the heavyweight forfeit.
Nonetheless, Weiss pointed to a number of strong efforts that bode well for his small squad. In addition to the sustained excellence of Harvard’s co-captains, rookie Steven Keith (125) completed an undefeated weekend despite moving up a weight class. The freshman earned a 12-2 major decision at 133 lbs. over Jeff Rotella.
Junior Michael Sadler (165) also enjoyed a solid night, notching a 13-6 victory for his first win of the season.
RUTGERS 29, HARVARD 14
The Crimson could not close out Friday as well as the day began, falling to the Scarlet Knights in Newark, N.J. Freshman Tony Buxton (141) provided a boost for Harvard, opening the match with an 11-0 major decision. Coupled with a 6-3 decision for Keith, the rookies demonstrated their full potential.
“It’s been fun to see the [younger wrestlers] mature,” Weiss said. “Especially for Steven and Tony, I expect some big things, because they’re not wrestling like freshmen, they’re wrestling as well as I knew they could.”
Caputo (8-2) also stepped up with a 10-1 major decision, and O’Connor managed a narrow 3-2 win to preserve his top ranking and undefeated season. Despite a stellar start to his senior campaign, O’Connor emphasized that there is room for improvement.
“I’ve always been really tough on top and bottom…but I’m working on getting my offense going,” he said. “I’m trying to let loose and show more of what I really have…just trying to get myself to wrestle to my potential.”
While Caputo and O’Connor certainly did their part Friday, Rutgers rode two pins and two major decisions to put the match out of reach.
HARVARD 29, FRANKLIN & MARSHALL 15
The Crimson opened its dual season with a bang, earning two pins and a technical fall to win its first match as a team. Harvard was rarely threatened, as the Diplomats forfeited the first two weight classes and nullified the Crimson’s disadvantage with a mutual forfeit at heavyweight.
O’Connor and Buxton notched impressive pins, downing their opponents in 2:30 and 2:00, respectively. Caputo also added a dominant performance, posting a 16-0 technical fall over Matt Latessa.
“Caputo was strong as ever,” Weiss said. “He’s just going to keep rolling.”
If Harvard continues to get such strong performances from its top individuals, the squad has the potential to keep rolling as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Home-ice advantage seems to be a theme of the Minnesota-Harvard hockey rivalry. In December, the Crimson women twice shut out the then No. 2 Golden Gophers at Bright Hockey Center, but on Friday and Saturday nights the Harvard men’s hockey team (2-10-2, 2-5-2 ECAC) found itself on the other side of the coin as it dropped both contests in Mariucci Arena, 5-2 and 3-1.
In many sports, home advantage comes from outside factors—weather, fans, travel complications. But according to the Crimson players, Mariucci, the home rink of the Golden Gophers (11-10-2), was daunting because of the ice itself.
“I don’t know if we were prepared to play on the Olympic sheet,” freshman Conor Morrison said.
The larger rink size lends itself to faster, more fluid hockey, whereas Bright’s smaller rink is geared toward tougher, more physical play.
“Minnesota’s one of the most physically gifted teams in the country,” captain Alex Biega said.
Harvard was able to adapt to the rink over the course of the weekend, playing a tighter game on Saturday than it had on Friday. But the trip to the Twin Cities proved disappointing to a team that had just ended a 10-game winless streak with an upset of No. 8 Quinnipiac.
MINNESOTA 3, HARVARD 1
Hockey is not a game for slow learners, and the Crimson’s improved play in the second game of the double-header was not enough against the Golden Gophers Saturday.
“I think we were better with the puck,” Alex Biega said. “There were a lot of good signs.”
Minnesota put the puck on the net early, though, outshooting Harvard in the opening minutes—a trend that would continue for the rest of the game. But junior goaltender Kyle Richter stood tall, and when the Crimson found a window, it was able to notch the first goal as sophomore Colin Moore scored at 7:57 in the first.
But Harvard continued to be outshot and the Crimson lost its early lead before the period expired when Minnesota’s Cade Fairchild took advantage of a Golden Gopher power-play with less than a minute left in the period.
Harvard was never able to rebuild momentum as Minnesota would outshoot it by increasing margins—14-7 in the second period and 16-6 in the third.
Golden Gopher sophomore Nick Larson put Minnesota ahead midway through the second period. A holding penalty on Mike Carmen gave Harvard a chance to retaliate, but shots by senior Doug Rogers and Alex Biega didn’t make it to the goal, where goaltender Kent Patterson was starting for the first time since December 4.
Larson would seal the deal for Minnesota just eleven seconds into the third period. “We’ve learned some valuable lessons,” Biega said. “It’s a matter of really sticking together as a team.”
MINNESOTA 5, HARVARD 2
For two periods, Harvard played Minnesota evenly. When senior Chad Morin gave the Crimson the only goal of the second period, it looked like momentum from Harvard’s decade-ending win over Quinnipiac might carry it to another upset.
But the Golden Gophers still had a few tricks up their sleeves as the hosts scored four goals in the third period to defeat the Crimson 5-2 in the Mariucci Arena. Only one of these came on a power play.
The period was perhaps the lowest point of Harvard’s doubleheader.
“We had far too many turnovers,” Alex Biega said.
Jacob Cepis wasted little time reclaiming the Gophers’ lead in the third period, taking advantage of period-opening power play to put Minnesota up 2-1 before a minute had expired.
The shots just kept coming at Richter, who made 40 saves Friday, and by the middle of the period the Gophers had racked up a 4-1 lead following goals by Nico Sacchetti and Zach Budish.
Minnesota’s third goal in the period looked to be a wakeup call for the Crimson, who started putting more pucks on the net after that point. Though the squad was unable to take advantage of a power play, Morin scored his second goal of the night—and of the season—a minute later to put Harvard back within two.
“He’s worked awful hard,” Biega said. “It’s great to see that kind of stuff.”
With the deficit reduced, the Crimson pulled Richter from net in a last-ditch effort to tie the game up. The plan backfired as Tony Lucia scored with just two seconds remaining to put the Gophers’ final margin of victory back to three.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks to a month-long break from play jammed in the middle of the Harvard women’s hockey team’s schedule, the Crimson’s 2009-10 campaign can appropriately be described as a tale of two seasons. And thus far, the trajectory of the second seems to be mirroring that of the first.
No. 5 Harvard (8-4-3, 6-4-1 ECAC) began play in late October inauspiciously, struggling early on to a 2-3-0 start before an eight-game stretch without a loss propelled the team back into the national rankings. This weekend, the Crimson took the ice for the first time since Dec. 8, once again scuffling out of the gate with a 3-3 tie against Princeton (9-9-3, 7-4-3) on Friday and a 1-0 loss yesterday to Quinnipiac (9-7-6, 6-3-5).
“I think we’re starting off again kind of how we did at the beginning of the season,” junior forward Kate Buesser said. “I think it is hard to take that month off, but I don’t think it’s going to get us down for much longer.”
While Harvard quickly found itself staring down a 2-0 deficit on Friday against the Tigers, the Crimson clawed its way back into the game and eventually settled for the draw.
On Saturday, Harvard dominated control of the puck, outshooting the Bobcats, 31-9, but the Crimson was unable to capitalize on its opportunities and suffered a 1-0 loss.
Harvard played without standout senior goalie Christina Kessler this weekend, who helped lead the Canadian U-22 team to gold in the MLP Cup.
“She’s one of our best players,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Any time you take one of your best players out of your lineup, there’s going to be an impact. You hope you don’t miss a beat, but sometimes you do.”
Freshman backup Laura Bellamy started in Kessler’s place, making 21 saves over two games.
“I think [Bellamy] responded very well,” Stone said. “She made some big saves down the stretch of the Princeton game. She did a good job against Quinnipiac.”
QUINNIPIAC 1, HARVARD 0
Quality often trumps quantity, as the Crimson found out the hard way against the Bobcats yesterday.
While Harvard launched 31 shots at Quinnipiac goalie Victoria Vigilanti, none of them reached the back of the net. The Bobcats, on the other hand, made the most of their limited chances, converting one of their nine shots into the only goal of the game.
Just over 17 minutes into the second period, Quinnipiac’s Kelly Davies received a pass from teammate Kate Wheeler and slipped it by Bellamy to give the Bobcats a 1-0 lead they would not relinquish.
The Crimson had ample opportunity to get on the board, but few of the pucks unleashed in Harvard’s shot barrage presented Vigilanti with much difficulty.
“I don’t think they were that difficult to save,” Stone said. “When we had real Grade-A chances, we shot it right into [Vigilanti’s] pads or shot it wide. We played on the periphery and didn’t jump into the deep end.”
The Crimson’s best opportunities to even the score came late in the third period. Harvard went on a power play with under four minutes left in the game but failed to convert.
Later, when the Crimson pulled Bellamy to give itself a 6-on-5 advantage, Buesser and junior defenseman Leanna Coskren nearly collaborated on a scoring effort. Buesser pushed the puck over to Coskren, who returned it with a hard pass. Buesser tried to tip in a goal, but the shot went wide.
“We had a chance to put it in but it didn’t work out,” Buesser said. “The hockey gods were not in our favor.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 3
The Tigers caught a rusty Crimson team off-guard on Friday, wasting little time getting on the board with two goals in the game’s first nine minutes.
But Harvard settled down in its defensive zone and then took to the attack. The Crimson cut the deficit in half 11:45 into the first, when senior forward Anna McDonald scored off of junior Ashley Wheeler’s assist.
After the first intermission, Harvard completed its first comeback effort of the game, tying the score on freshman defenseman Kelsey Romatoski’s first career goal.
“We’ve come back a lot this year,” Stone said. “[The Harvard skaters] kept the game very simple. They used the people that were open.”
Princeton seemed to stymie the Crimson’s momentum when the Tigers’ Paula Romanchuk scored her second goal of the game with three minutes left in the second period. But Harvard had one more comeback left in it.
Princeton’s Charissa Stadnyk was called for high sticking 15:39 into the final frame, and the Crimson took advantage of the power-play opportunity. Freshman Jillian Dempsey found the net to once again bring the score even, with Buesser and Coskren picking up assists.
“We had gotten our forecheck rolling at that point,” Buesser said. “We were getting a lot of shots on goal. We got the power play and it really fell into place.”
Harvard got off the lone shot of the overtime period, but neither team was able to break the tie before time expired.
