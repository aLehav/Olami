After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kanye West likes to keep his listeners guessing. Whether with the hushed lullaby of “Only One” or the brooding meandering of “Wolves,” his latest releases showcase the diversity of his musical artistry; “FourFiveSeconds” even prompted some to predict West’s turn toward country. But for the “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy”-braggadocio purists, Yeezy released “All Day,” a single off his upcoming album “So Help Me God” and an unapologetic, smirking response to an audience boxing him into their definition of rapper.
“All Day” demonstrates unequivocally that West has been singing because he already knows how to rap. He growls and bites his way through verses that storm by without a single slurred word or misplaced emphasis. The message, too, remains clear: The first verse features West rapping, “I don’t let ’em play with me / I don’t let ’em talk to me no kind of way” over a bouncing, arrogant bassline while Theophilus London and Allan Kingdom take over the singing. On occasion, a “Monster”-style riff carves through the track, injecting no small dose of adrenaline into a song that almost lures the listener into comfort with its haunting, falsetto background vocals.
It’s an invigorating track, but not a perfect one: Paul McCartney’s guitar interlude feels like an unnecessary reminder that West has taken to exploring the acoustic guitar, and Kingdom’s refrain leans more towards garbled than harmonically warped. “All Day” doesn’t need to be perfect, though. “They need that Ye in the streets, boy / There’s been a motherfucking drought,” West spits. It doesn’t matter what you think of him or his music—everyone will listen to the new album when it comes out, because they know that at the very least, they’ll be surprised.

In the opening seconds of his latest effort, an almost unintelligible, possibly drunk Skrillex offers his audience a convenient substitute for cheap party drugs: “And now we have a new prescription for you / it’s called … Jack Ü.” The man, real name Sonny Moore, may be onto something: The album, unexpectedly dropped midway through a 24-hour DJ set, sent the audience into such a euphoric frenzy that, according to authorities, immediately pulled the plug on the concert. Indeed, listening to the self-titled debut album of Jack Ü, the unholy marriage of electronic heavyweights Skrillex and Diplo, is for the most part an exhilarating and intoxicating experience. Though only running for a brief 36 minutes, the umlaut-happy “Skrillex and Diplo Present Jack Ü” plays like aural Red Bull—fizzy and invigorating, its swirling caffeine highs generally compensate for its eventual crash of a conclusion.
Individually, Skrillex and Diplo have had their shares of recent missteps. Last year, Skrillex’s first studio album, “Recess,” proved to be a largely middling affair, resembling a collection of unreleased, lackluster material instead of a truly innovative piece of music. Similarly, Diplo’s second album with his side project Major Lazer, 2013’s “Free the Universe,” confused critics  by involving collaborators (Peaches, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig, Wyclef Jean, Bruno Mars, and Tyga to name a few) who seemed wildly out of place on the dancehall-influenced tracks. But while Skrillex and Diplo may have struggled alone, the union of EDM’s most assiduous artists marks a clear improvement to their listening appeal. Formed almost two years ago, Jack Ü fuses the frenetic dubstep stylings of Skrillex with Diplo’s near-obsession with importing and remixing global sounds. Together, the pair’s respective contributions work alchemy on the record: Skrillex’s ADHD-addled base drops coalesce with Diplo-culled influences from Brazilian favelas and Jamaican shantytowns to create a refreshing addition to the general patois of the electronic world.
Unlike Skrillex’s “Bangarang” or Diplo’s “Guns Don’t Kill People…Lazers Do,” “Jack Ü” lacks that one, irresistible track that will indubitably conquer clubs across America; nevertheless, the album contains a number of immaculately produced gems and stellar featured guests that elevate its quality. “Take Ü There,” the album’s Kiesza-fronted lead single, stands as a testament to the strength of the Jack Ü partnership. The commanding vocal hook, rumbling bass, and raga-inflected drop unite to generate a thrilling musical experience. Likewise, “Beats Knockin” features a relentless barrage of handclaps, electronic trills, and clipped vocal samples that grip the listener from the beginning and never let go. The album never shies away from embracing its own lunacy; over a bombastic, trance-jungle beat, the inimitable 2 Chainz utters the album’s most intellectually stimulating line: “Yeah, I’m the shit / I should have Febreze on me.” It is the duo’s self-awareness of its role in the musical hierarchy—the architect of brazen, stupid entertainment—that renders the album so listenable.
Many EDM albums contain a few collaborations that, though conceptually strong, simply fail to come together; “Jack Ü is no different. In a sense, the album’s trajectory mirrors that of a 5-year-old on a sugar rush: initially restless, giddy, and even a bit frantic, before devolving into a lethargic mess. On “To Ü,” the breathy, slinky vocals of beloved electronic duo AlunaGeorge often drown under the track’s thumping, unflagging beat. Arguably the most anticipated song, “Where Are Ü Now,” features perpetual media punching bag Justin Bieber. While the singer sounds surprisingly refined and mature, his solid vocals are marred by heavy production. And desultory tracks like “Holla Out” and “Mind,” ripe with distortion and laser-like effects, are neither innovative nor catchy enough to warrant a second listen. “Jack Ü ” sinks to its nadir when Skrillex and Diplo stray from their trademark aural assault and begin to delve into a more atmospheric aesthetic; while their attempts to innovate are commendable, there is no point in exploring the quiet when the two so obviously love to be loud.
Then again, to analyze the artistic merit of an EDM record produced by a duo whose name sounds like a black market Swedish energy drink may be an exercise in futility. Frankly, “Jack Ü” is not, nor did it ever intend to be, some sweeping musical statement or incisive sentiment on the human condition. Rather, the record is a manifestation of Skrillex and Diplo’s unwavering need both to party and to convince others to party with them. Despite the occasional lull in energy, “Jack Ü” provides audiences with an opportunity to hear two dance music mavericks masterfully bounce off each other’s strengths. The result is massive, noisy, and pure insanity—unabashedly dumb, but undeniably fun.

This week saw the release of “Should Have Known Better,” the second single off Sufjan Stevens’s upcoming album, “Carrie and Lowell.” Shrouded almost completely in autobiographical references, the song suggests that a personal tone will dominate much of the album, which is named for his mother and stepfather. Whatever the case, “Should Have Known Better” is putting a strong foot forward for Stevens’s new work.
Like the first single, “No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,” “Should Have Known Better” features a very sparse arrangement: acoustic guitar, an electric piano, and a very understated backing chorus. Gone are the trumpet flourishes of “Illinois” and the synthesizers of “The Age of Adz.” Nevertheless, the artistry in production is admirable: at no point does any part of the backing overtake the acoustic guitar or Stevens’s half-whispered lilt. This is not a lo-fi aesthetic.
On the other hand, the lyrics are a significant departure from the closely focused poetry of lead single “No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,” and resemble in some ways the more impressionistic lyrics from his previous work. In spite of their somewhat mysterious (and some might say obscure) portent, they are full of melancholy for the past set against hope for the future. The message seems to be encapsulated in the seventh verse: “I should have known better / Nothing can be changed / The past is still the past / The bridge to nowhere.” In the final verse, Stevens sets the past against the future directly, singing: “Don’t back down: nothing can be changed / … My brother had a daughter / The beauty that she brings, illumination .”
If “Should Have Known Better” and “No Shade” are to be taken as programmatic statements on the new album, “Carrie and Lowell” has a sorrow at its core that is unusual even in the context of Stevens’s other work, and even more emotional effectiveness.

As the Harvard men’s basketball team begins its fourth consecutive NCAA trip, its following is at an all-time high. Back in Cambridge, fans are gathering at Kennedy’s on the Square to watch, while in Jacksonville, Fla.—the site of the team’s first round-game against the University of North Carolina Tar Heels—alumni have gathered for what has become a semi-annual reunion for the closest fans.
“Basketball has brought together fans from disparate alumni segments,” said John Wang ’88, who flew into Jacksonville Wednesday. “Personally, I have met and developed friendships with alumni fans from all over the country. It also helped me reconnect with Harvard.”
Wang, who attended last year’s second- and third-round contests in Spokane, Washington, noted that the team’s following reminds him of that around Harvard hockey in the 1980s, when Harvard annually competed for the national championship.
Rob Edwards ’83 pointed to the platform the NCAA basketball tournament provides. Unlike in football—where the Crimson are barred by Ivy League rules from postseason play—Harvard competes on the hardwood with national powers like Arizona, Michigan State, and North Carolina.
“There are lots of different storylines here,” Edwards said. “[However] to me the biggest storyline is that we can build a first-rate basketball team at a first-rate university and not compromise the mission of the university, which at the end of the day is teaching young people to be leaders in society.”
Fellow alum Mitchell L. Dong ’75 unashamedly noted that it was Harvard’s ability to compete on the largest stage that drew him to the team. Although Dong—like many of the team’s newest fans—did not follow the team at school, its surge under coach Tommy Amaker caught his attention.
“I like following winners, that’s what I do in my business,” Dong said. “I think of myself as a talent scout because you want to hire and follow the winners. They started winning and I started following them.”
Dong said that wherever the tournament has taken the Crimson—Albuquerque, Salt Lake City, Spokane—“easily 100 alumni” have come to cheer on the team. Like many of his fellow fans, he now blocks off the tournament on his calendar at the beginning of the year.
Former player Vince Lackner ’72 says that the reaction has been the same among former players. Lackner said that 30-40 alumni come each weekend for the team’s Alumni Basketball weekend, with more than half playing in the Alumni Game and many owning season tickets.
“We’ve had enough fans that we were able to make 18 stops during our three nights of pub crawls,” Lackner said. “We’ve dubbed our pub nights as ‘Crawlitas.’ I’ve got that domain name locked up for the next couple of years.”
This year, however, Dong, Lackner and the Crimson were both nearly left home for the spring. After Harvard lost to Yale on March 7, it needed the Bulldogs to fall the next night in Hanover to have any chance at a bid. However, the dominoes fell Harvard’s way—the Bulldogs blew a five-point lead to Dartmouth with less than 30 seconds remaining, and the Crimson triumphed in a playoff a week later.
“It’s not just a great year for Harvard athletics, but a great year for Harvard against Yale,” Dong said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team bounced back from its 0-4 weekend against Stetson with a pair of victories on Tuesday afternoon over Massachusetts in Winter Haven, Fla. The Crimson offense came alive in the twin bill, posting 20 runs on 27 hits after registering only six runs on thirty hits in the four games last weekend.
“[The doubleheader] was a much-needed response to our Stetson series,” said senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan. “To come out and score 20 runs in two games, that was a response that our offense needed. It was good not only to get the two wins but to also build up confidence.”
Sophomore lefties Greg Coman and Kevin Rex picked up victories on the mound for Harvard (7-7) to keep the Minutemen (0-5) winless on the season.
HARVARD 11, UMASS 8 (7 INNINGS)
UMass took an early lead in game two, knocking Crimson starter Nick Scahill around for four runs in just one and a third innings of work. However, it took Harvard little time to erase the early four-run deficit. The team scored three in the third as McGuiggan and captain Ethan Ferreira each drove in a run.
“It’s always hard playing a seven-inning game, especially when you do have to come from behind because before you know it, the game’s over,” McGuiggan said. “When we fell behind early, we knew that we couldn’t wait until later in the game to start scoring runs. The hitting was extremely contagious. It seemed like as soon as one guy got a hit, all the guys behind him started to step up and get hits as well.”
The Crimson had a five-run fifth inning, highlighted by senior centerfielder Mike Martin’s double and steal of home, to take an 8-4 lead. After the Minutemen added a run in the bottom of the frame, Harvard tacked on three more the next inning to seal the victory. Coman struck out four in his two and two-thirds innings of work to pick up his first win of the year and the second of his Crimson career.
The Harvard offense was paced by senior Tanner Anderson, who had three hits and two RBIs, and McGuiggan, who tallied a single, a double, and two RBIs. Freshman Ian Miller and junior Sean O’Neill each worked a scoreless inning in relief for the Crimson.
HARVARD 9, UMASS 3 (7 INNINGS)
After an offensive explosion by UMass in the first two innings of Tuesday’s early game, the Crimson took a 4-3 lead in the bottom half of the second frame that it would not relinquish. After surrendering three runs (one earned) and five baserunners in the early going, Rex bounced back with scoreless frames in the third and fourth.
“I think the approach stayed the same, I just had to refocus and get the ball down in the zone,” Rex said. “The first time through the lineup, I left some balls over the plate and they hit them. Second time through was stick with the same game plan, just execute pitches a little better.”
Junior T.J. Laurisch slammed the door on the Minutemen, throwing three run-free innings en route to his first save of the season.
While Rex did allow his first earned run of the season, he picked up his second win of the year and his ERA sits at just 0.69, the lowest on the team for pitchers with at least two innings of work.
“Compared to my season last year, I’ve thrown a lot more strikes,” Rex said. “I’ve been more consistent throwing at the strike zone, but I think it’s really been a team effort this season. Our defense has gotten a lot better and so it’s a lot easier to throw with confidence.”
The Crimson offense produced at least one run in each of its six times up. Leadoff hitter and sophomore Drew Reid scored three runs and had two hits while Farreira added a pair of hits and drove in two runs from the cleanup spot.
The senior catcher’s second RBI of the day came on a homerun, his first of the season, to left field in the bottom of the sixth. McGuiggan, Martin, and junior designated hitter DJ Link all had two-hit games for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.—One decade ago, sixth-graders Siyani Chambers and Marcus Paige stepped onto a hardwood court in the upper-Midwest corridor of the country. The point guards and primary playmakers of their respective teams, Chambers and Paige faced off that day in a matchup that would be repeated once every summer for the next half-dozen years, through the grind of AAU play and across their respective home states of Minnesota and Iowa.
Now, years later, roughly 1630 miles to the southeast and with more than half of college under their belts, juniors Chambers and Paige will go head-to-head once more; as Chambers sat in the front row of Harvard’s athletics complex watching the NCAA Tournament Selection Show this past Sunday, he learned that his old AAU battles would be renewed, with his Crimson (22-7, 11-3 Ivy) taking on Paige’s No. 4-seeded North Carolina (24-11, 11-7 ACC) in the second round of this year’s Big Dance.
“[Paige is] a great point guard,” said Chambers at Wednesday’s press conference from Jacksonville, Fla. “I've been playing against him for a long time. We lived pretty close to each other…so our teams crossed paths a lot.”
Since eschewing the Midwest and heading to Chapel Hill, N.C., Paige has evolved into one of the nation’s premier floor generals. A preseason All-American selection and the media’s ACC Preseason Player of the Year pick, Paige entered his junior season as the Tar Heels’ most recognizable face. He had averaged 17.5 points per game in his sophomore campaign, with his stat sheets often highlighted by his lights-out shooting from deep (38.9 percent).
“He's an outstanding, complete basketball player,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He's crafty…. He's a kid that I think has played exceptionally well in bigger games for their program and has a knack for coming up big in the second half…. [H]e's a big-time scorer and a big-time shot-maker.”
Paige, with the preseason expectations piled on his back and one of the country’s toughest schedules in front of him, underwhelmed Tar Heel followers in the opening days of the 2014-2015 season. Prior to a Dec. 27 matchup against the University of Alabama, Paige had shot just 34.6 percent from the floor through 11 games, a nine percent drop from his sophomore year clip.
Paige was battling plantar fasciitis, and, along with him, his team was struggling. From Jan. 31 through Feb. 24, North Carolina dropped five of its seven games, including consecutive losses against Pittsburgh and Duke that saw the point guard shoot a total of 5-of-22 from the floor.
But something changed late in conference play, and the Paige that Chambers will match up with on Thursday is one that has made a cool 30 of his last 61 shots from the field, a statistic spanning the ACC tournament and North Carolina’s final regular season contest against Duke. His points, assists, and minutes per game are all up as he and his team march their way towards tournament play, a fact that both Amaker and Chambers are well aware of.
“He's a great playmaker and a great shot-maker,” Chambers said. “He runs this team very well and I'm looking forward to the matchup…. [W]e're going to do our best to try to contain him as much as possible.”
Paige, meanwhile, will be facing a point guard that he deems a markedly improved shooter than the one he competed against in the gyms of years past. Chambers—whose primary skill in AAU play according to an ESPN scouting report was his ability to “score off the dribble or create for his teammates thanks to his speed, quickness and ability to penetrate”—has stretched his offensive repertoire beyond the arc, Paige noted.
“Looking at his percentages and watching [him] on film, he's really comfortable shooting [the] three-ball now,” Paige said. “Back in the day, he was just using his speed to drive by people. So he's still got that really good end-to-end speed with the ball, but his jump shot has really, really improved.”
That newfound knack for shooting the rock, Paige explained, is one of the facets of Chambers’s game that North Carolina will spend time “try[ing] to take away.” After all, it is only fitting that when Paige and Chambers face off once more, their matchup will come down to the same tricks of the arsenal, the same skillsets, that they showed off against one another on those parquet floors so many times, so many years ago.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla.—During Wednesday’s press conference, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker said he was glad his players did not notice his reaction when North Carolina was matched with the Crimson (22-7, 11-3 Ivy) during Sunday’s selection show.
“Boy, this is who we have to play?” Amaker recalled thinking. “Thinking about how terrific and great they are and they always have been, it wasn’t necessarily a very pleasant thought internally when I saw the actual draw.”
The numbers back up Amaker’s fears.
The Tar Heels (24-11, 11-7 ACC) earned a No. 4 seed in the tournament and have been rated even higher by various metrics. They played 19 tournament teams during the regular season, including three games against eventual No. 1 seeds.
North Carolina point guard Marcus Paige was ranked the top recruit at his position when he came to the Tar Heels in 2012. A year later North Carolina added the No. 6 ranked center and a top-10 power forward. The current crop of Tar Heel freshmen includes three players listed in the top three at their respective positions.
Of course, none of those numbers will mean anything when the teams face each other at 7:20 p.m. Thursday in the NCAA Tournament’s second round. But they all point towards this game being the second toughest Harvard has played all year, behind only its 76-27 throttling by Virginia back in December.
To pull off the upset, Amaker said, “We are very hopeful that we can work for good shots, take care of the ball, and play solid sound defense.”
“We also need a team like Carolina to have a bad day or a bad night,” he added, “So we are hopeful for that too.”
The Tar Heels have had off nights late in the year, including losses to Pittsburgh and North Carolina State. North Carolina went on to reach the ACC Tournament final by beating the Cavaliers, but entered that tournament with a 4-6 stretch.
The Tar Heels have had success by scoring in droves—it enters Thursday 17th in the nation in scoring at almost 78 points per game and is second in the nation in assists—and by crashing the boards. North Carolina is second in Division I with 41 rebounds per game.
The Crimson, meanwhile, rank 260th in points per game and 171st in rebounds.
A lot of that has to do with the slow place Harvard prefers (averaging 63.8 possessions per game this year), which has helped the Crimson frustrate opposing offenses in upsets over New Mexico and Cincinnati in the last two years.
UNC, on the other hand, will look to push the ball and generate extra possessions. The Tar Heels are 16th in the country with 71.9 possessions per game. And even that is not enough for Carolina coach Roy Williams.
“We haven't been as assertive at establishing the tempo ourselves, Williams said Wednesday. “I've said a hundred times that I'd much rather win 90-80 than 60-50.”
To create that type of game Thursday, the Tar Heels will extend their defensive pressure, Paige explained.
“We want to run every time even if we don't get a quick shot, just to run and get pressure and get the tempo to our liking,” he said. “They're more comfortable in the high 50s, low 60s, but we want this game up, more possessions, so we have a chance to get the ball inside and get our break going. We're probably going to extend our defense, try to pressure them into some turnovers so we can start that break.”
That strategy will put more responsibility in the hands of Harvard guards junior Siyani Chambers and senior Wesley Saunders.
Chambers had a slow start to the season but has dropped his turnover numbers every month of the year, averaging 2.4 assists per turnover in three March contests.
Saunders’s turnover numbers have held more steady, but his assists have jumped up to 5.7 per game in March, as he has embraced the playmaking role Amaker has given him.
Thursday, Saunders will have to make those plays while often being guarding by J.P. Tokoto, a 6’6” wing with a 6’9” wingspan named to the ACC’s All-Defensive Team last season. It will be a tough matchup for Saunders, as it will be for the Crimson in general.
But this Harvard team is used to long odds, given it needed a late-game collapse from Yale against Dartmouth on March 7 and a last-possession bucket from Steve Moundou-Missi last weekend just to earn the Ancient Eight’s automatic bid to March Madness.
The Crimson will try to extend that Madness a little longer on Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past three years, there had been a monkey—or more accurately speaking, a bulldog—on the back of the No. 17/15 Harvard men’s ice hockey team.
With the rubber match of the ECAC quarterfinals going to double overtime and No. 19/- Yale continuing to generate great chances to get the game-winner, the claws of the bulldog seemed to dig in deeper. But when junior forward Jimmy Vesey controlled a rebound off a shot from fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally and lifted the puck past Yale sophomore goaltender Alex Lyon, the Nashville Predators draft pick shrugged off the bulldog with one flick of the wrist.
But even though Harvard was able to beat Yale—and do so twice—for the first time since March 2012 to keep its season alive, more work awaits the team if it wants to accomplish its ultimate goal of winning the ECAC Men’s Hockey Tournament and clinch a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
Harvard travels to fabled Lake Placid, N.Y. to take on No. 7/7 Quinnipiac on Friday in the semifinals of the conference championship with a trip to the final at stake. The Crimson has not won the conference championship since 2006.
“There was a lot of relief from the stress and physicality of the [Yale] series, but I think we’ll be able to regroup,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 during a tournament teleconference on Monday. “We’re just focused on winning our next game and playing our best and seeing where everything falls. I worry a little about physically and mentally recovering, but I don’t worry about our focus.”
Harvard now sits at 15th in the PairWise Rankings, a great indicator of the 16 teams that will be chosen to duke it out in the national tournament. But with a loss on Friday, Harvard would all but likely fall out of the top 16, severely hindering its chances of earning an NCAA Tournament berth.
“Our guys had a goal from the beginning of the season to make it to the championship weekend and to get to Lake Placid,” Donato said. “Our guys are very excited.”
Harvard, in that case, will hope for much different results than the last time thesse two teams squared off at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in late February. The Bobcats rode a first period in which they scored three goals on 14 shots (to Harvard’s six) to a 5-1 lead early in the third period before a late goal from sophomore Sean Malone made the final score differential three in favor of Quinnipiac.
Two of those five goals came off the stick of last year’s ECAC Rookie of the Year Sam Anas. The sophomore ranks third in the conference with 23 goals scored on the year, accounting for more than 20 percent of his team’s goals. He also had an effect beyond the box score in the two sides' last contest. Pinned against the boards, Anas sent a between-the-legs pass to senior Matthew Peca, who would be credited with the second assist on the ensuing goal.
But in Game 3 of the Bobcats’ quarterfinal series against Union, Anas left the ice with a left leg injury in the first period, leaving his status for Friday’s contest up in the air.
Regardless of whether or not the sophomore is on the ice, there’s reason to believe that Friday’s game between the two New England schools won’t be so lopsided. When the Crimson fell 5-2, Patrick McNally was absent with a knee injury. He returned to the surprise of many—and the chagrin of the Bulldogs—for the Yale series, notching the game-tying goal to send Game 3 into overtime as well as the assist on Vesey’s game-winner. With McNally, Harvard earned a 5-2 win on the road against Quinnipiac on Dec. 6.
“[Harvard just has] a ton of talent,” said Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold on Monday. “It’s going to be a lot for us to handle on Friday, but we’re looking forward to the challenge.”
A healthy and reintegrated fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell also adds a dimension to the Harvard offense that the Bobcats have not yet seen this season. The North Andover, Mass., native was playing his first game of the calendar year against Quinnipiac, and since his one-game stint on the fourth line that night, he has rejuvenated the second line, scoring three goals and adding an assist on McNally’s game-tying goal in Game 3.
“It was probably the healthiest we’ve been all year headed into the [Yale] series,” Donato said. “Getting guys like Blackwell and Patrick McNally back in the lineup...[we’re] in some ways a new team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following back-to-back losses at the Asics Tournament in Long Beach, Calif. this weekend, the Crimson (9-8) traveled to Malibu, Calif. and a matchup with No. 4 Pepperdine (15-4) in the hopes of ending its cross-country trip on a high note.
However, Harvard instead suffered second straight-set defeat in five days. Although the Crimson rallied to claim the game and avoid the shutout, the visitors could not avert an eventual 3-1 loss to the Waves.
“We had a few opportunities, and you need to take advantage,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “There’s not a lot of room for error. You make one mistake, and they jump on it.”
Facing defeat in the third set, Harvard leveraged mistakes to its own benefit, using five errors by Pepperdine to rally back from a 16-10 deficit. The Crimson went on an 8-2 run to build a 20-19 lead, and despite a late surge from the Waves, the visitors hung on to win its only set, 27-25.
Three kills from co-captain DJ White and a pair of attacking errors from the opposition sealed the deal for Harvard, ensuring that the team would not be shut out.
“It was good seeing [that] we could take a set off of the fourth-ranked team in the nation,” Baise said. “It was good to see that lineup worked out pretty well.”
However, the Crimson didn’t always find the going so easy.
In the first set, Harvard built an 8-7 lead off six kills only to watch Pepperdine respond with an 8-1 run, which prompted a Crimson timeout. Although Harvard fought back within five, the Waves repelled the advance to claim the frame, 25-17.
The Pepperdine defense proved to be the deciding factor in the set, as the Waves held Harvard to a .156 kill percentage and a total of 10 kills.
This logic was reversed in the fourth set, when Pepperdine’s offensive efficiency powered the hosts to victory. The Waves scored a game-high .452 kill percentage in that frame, which it won by six for the match victory.
Even so, the Crimson kept this fourth game close until the final points. Harvard exchanged blows with Pepperdine until a 12-12 tie, at which point the Waves used a 6-1 run to take control. Three Crimson errors in a late-game 4-0 stretch punctuated the frame.
Throughout the contest, Harvard debuted a new lineup that handed libero responsibilities to sophomore Casey White. After the match, Crimson players were encouraged by the results.
“We were just kind of mixing things up,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “I think [that] going forward we’re going to work with that lineup and compete as well as we can.”
Early in the second set, the new strategy seemed like a recipe for success, as Harvard took an early 4-3 lead off three service errors and a kill. But Pepperdine regained the advantage soon after and expanded the margin to 25-21 at the end of the frame.
“They were a really good serving team,” junior outside hitter Branden Clemens said. “Each of the games we lost, we were neck and neck until they got a serving run that was three or four points in a row…. We would stay with them, but after the serving run, we couldn’t get rid of the deficit.”
Clemens paced the Crimson in kills with a total of 14. DJ White and freshman middle blocker Brad Gretsch followed with 13 apiece.
Much of Harvard’s offense came during the comeback third set, when the Crimson posted its strongest offensive performance of the night. Harvard finished with 15 kills on a .321 kill percentage in that section. Meanwhile, the Waves racked up eight mistakes and a .200 hitting efficiency.
“It’s great seeing the guys bounce back,” Baise said. “I thought we’ve always been pretty resilient this year. If we’ve had a bad match, we’ve come back the next night or the next weekend and done better…[and] that was the case.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the end of t­­he first quarter of the No. ­15/16 Harvard mens lacrosse team’s game against No. 2/2 UNC in Chapel Hill on Tuesday night, the Tar Heels had already run away to a 5-0 lead. Throughout the rest of the game, North Carolina refused to let its lead go, en route to a 15-10 victory over the Crimson.
Harvard was dominated from the outset on the scoreboard. The Tar Heels were able to score the first six goals of the game, five of them from senior attackman Jimmy Bitter, before the Crimson knew what had hit it. After the lopsided start, Harvard was unable to bring the game back to within five goals for the rest of the match, losing to an ultimately superior UNC team.
“They were the better team [in the game],” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “They’re an outstanding team both athletically and skill-wise. Any little mistake you make, they make you pay, and we made little mistakes offensively and defensively and they made us pay with goals.”
Despite The Tar Heels’ early lead, the Crimson was able to get back into the game in the second quarter, as junior attackman Deke Burns and junior midfielder Ian Ardrey tallied goals for Harvard before the two teams went into halftime with Harvard down 7-2.
“We were generating a lot of good scoring opportunities, but we just didn’t finish our chances well,” Wojcik said. “Their goalie made a number of saves, and the combination of that and the fact that they shot the ball really well…you can’t let a great team like that do that. They buried their chances and we didn’t."
The Crimson was unable to get much momentum going in the third quarter, however, as each of its goals would be sandwiched by goals from North Carolina. Jack Breit, Brendan Newman, and Devin Dwyer each scored for Harvard, but their efforts were overshadowed by five Tar Heel goals in the quarter, extending the lead to seven going into the final period.
“We got outplayed,” junior goaltender Brian Moore said. “They don’t just have ten guys, but they have a whole team of really good lacrosse players. We dug ourselves a hole in the first quarter, and we were never really able to get out of it, but we definitely kept battling through the next three quarters.”
To start the fourth quarter, UNC scored three straight goals to put the game away and secure the victory, stretching out to a 15-5 lead with only nine minutes remaining in the game.
At the end of the game, the Crimson scored five straight goals to bring the score back to within five, but those efforts did little to bring a victory back into range for Harvard.
Freshman midfielders Morgan Cheek and Carney Mahon each contributed one goal to this streak, and junior attackman Will Walker scored three goals, on his way to leading the Crimson in goals for the day. Walker did, however, take a game-high 11 shots, five of which were turned away by Tar Heel junior goaltender Kieran Burke, who would finish with 21 saves and a dominating 68 percent save percentage.
“They shot the ball better than us,” Wojcik said. “They were more opportunistic and the mistakes they made, we didn’t punish them for, and they did a really good job of capitalizing when we made the same mistakes.”
Harvard was able to perform well in several aspects of the game, as the team would ultimately end up wining the turnover battle 18-17, and barely losing the groundball game 40-39. Sophomore faceoff midfielder Austin Williams even won the day on the faceoff X, securing 14 of his 27 attempts on restarts.
However, these efforts would not be nearly enough for the Crimson, as North Carolina was simply able to execute better on both sides of the field.
“There are a lot of places for improvement, both individually and as a team,” Moore said. “We need to not just match the intensity of the other team, but we need to be the ones that are forcing the issue, making the big hits, running through tough checks, and picking up groundballs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4/3 Crimson, recently crowned as ECAC champions, will claim one half. The No. 2/1 Eagles, regular-season Hockey East winners, will occupy the other. On Friday night, when the locker rooms empty at the start of the Frozen Four semifinal between the two squads, three different teams will take the ice.
But in between the local competitors, or rather among them, there will be a third squad, invisible to the casual eye but patently obvious to anyone who knows a thing or two about high school hockey in New England.
In Friday’s matchup between Harvard and BC, the winner is the ISL.
A TEAM OF THEIR OWN
Formally known as the Independent School League, the ISL is a consortium of 12 New England prep schools that boasts some of the most intense girls high school hockey competition in the nation. Over the past decade, ISL alumnae have earned spots on an impressive array of hockey sides—from professional teams to Olympic squads and back again.
Or, more regularly, they have played for the Crimson and the Eagles.
“I have some really good friends on the BC team, which makes it fun playing against them,” said Harvard junior forward Mary Parker. “A lot of those local kids…play together over summer and then go off to the schools during the year. It creates a fun atmosphere.”
Between the two semifinalists’ rosters, 13 players hail from the ISL. This is no collection of slouches, either. Even at the Frozen Four, an event designed to showcase the cream of college hockey’s crop, the New England league stands out for having produced so many impactful players. Consider this lineup of ISL talent:
Goalie: BC freshman Katie Burt. The first-year net minder owns the stingiest goals allowed average in the country at 1.07 scores conceded per contest.
Defense: Harvard senior Michelle Picard; Crimson senior Marissa Gedman. A former Olympian, Picard leads Harvard as a co-captain. Throw in Gedman, who is the only Harvard defender to see action in every game, and you have a formidable line.
Offense: Eagles junior Alex Carpenter; Harvard junior Mary Parker; BC freshman Kenzie Kent. This is a first line with three of the most dangerous players in Division I competition. Carpenter leads all other athletes in goals (37) and assists (44), while both Parker and Kent rank in the top-20 nationally in points.
Bench: a full second team, highlighted by an Eagles co-captain (forward Emily Field) and a Crimson goalie (sophomore Brianna Laing) who started nine games this year.
All 13 will march into Ridder Arena for Friday’s matchup, and yet, months or years before that, all 13 marched out of an ISL school. In some ways, this Minneapolis semifinal has already been played years ago—in a homey high school rink in the middle of Massachusetts.
HOME LEAGUE ADVANTAGE
To be specific, there are 10 rinks: 10 rinks owned by 10 individual schools. Thayer Academy and Roxbury Latin School, the only two members of the ISL without on-campus facilities, make do by driving to a nearby center.
The availability of playing surfaces is the most obvious explanation for the success of ISL players at the next level. Not every high school has the means to build and operate a functioning ice rink. The 12 ISL schools do, for the most part.
However, Harvard coach Katey Stone pointed to a different factor as the reason behind the athletic success of ISL graduates.
“They’ve got real good coaching,” Stone said. “That’s why a number of kids have come from there—because those kids are well-prepared, and they’ve got a leg up on the coaching.”
Just as ISL schools produce talented hockey players in bulk, they also retain high-level coaching talent. Years before coming to Lawrence Academy in Groton, Mass., Kevin Potter earned All-American honors as a senior skater at Bowdoin. He now serves as the school’s athletic director and girls’ varsity hockey coach.
As in most matters related to ISL girls’ hockey, however, Noble and Greenough leads the pack. Tom Resor, the girls’ varsity head coach, has worked at the school since 1986, and three assistants join him to train the Bulldogs.
Two of these assistants once had National Team experience; one, namely Sara Decosta-Hayes, won a gold medal in the 1998 Olympics as the Americans’ goaltender. True to past form, she now instructs Nobles’ goalies.
The impressiveness of the coaching staff translates to obvious results. In the past 14 years, this boarding school with a population just over 600 has won 14 league titles. Eleven of the 13 ISL players who play for the Eagles or the Crimson once attended Nobles.
“The ISL has been strong, but certainly Nobles has carried that flag for a long time,” Stone said.
So much time has elapsed that current Bulldogs can look up to a graduated rank of players that has found success on a national or even global stage. During Resor’s 14 years with the girls’ varsity, the team has graduated 11 National Team members and 35 college players, including 19 in the past four years.
However, former Bulldogs insist that Nobles, and all other ISL schools, do more than just pump out superior athletes.
“The ISL schools do a great job [of] preparing you both academically and athletically to take the step into these great universities, especially in the Boston area,” said Parker, a one-time Nobles student. “Going through the ISL program and seeing the older girls work hard…is something that you strive to do yourself.”
So the recruiting wheel turns. Players transform from awestruck youngsters into bona fide college stars, and the process repeats with another class of skating talent. This winter, Nobles captured its 14th consecutive conference title; the Crimson and the Eagles already have three ISL players locked up with official commitments.
Spanning the length of decades, this long migration of ISL hockey stars from prep school ice rinks to the Harvard and Boston College arenas shows no signs of abating. But the line of people will stop, if only for a few hours, in Minneapolis this Friday.
Mary Parker will be there, along with 12 of her ISL peers. They may wear new colors, but some of the old high school familiarity still lingers.
“It definitely adds a new friendlier element,” Parker said. “You never want your friends to beat you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three consecutive games scoring no runs, the Harvard women’s softball team exploded for twelve runs in two games on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Crimson (4-10) fell to Buffalo (7-17), the team defeated Loyola Marymount (15-20) to earn its first win on its annual spring break trip to California.
Senior second baseman Katie Lantz powered Harvard’s offense with six hits in seven at-bats, including a home run and two doubles, boosting her slugging percentage to a team-leading .641.
HARVARD 5, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 3
The Crimson loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the third inning eager to retake the lead after the Lions evened the score in the bottom of the second. Two quick outs on a fly ball and fielder’s choice threatened to ruin Harvard’s chances of scoring and continue the team’s difficulty capitalizing with runners on base.
But sophomore third baseman Catherine Callaway came through with a two-out, base-clearing double to give the Crimson a 4-1 lead. Senior first baseman Adrienne Hume added a single to score Callaway and make the game 5-1. Harvard’s four-run third inning matched its scoring total in five games this past weekend.
Senior Laura Ricciardone scattered three runs and six hits over five innings and sophomore Taylor Cabe pitched two shutout innings in relief to preserve the Crimson lead.
BUFFALO 10, HARVARD 7
Although the Crimson jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning, the Bulls took advantage of a series of Harvard defensive errors in the second inning to score four unearned runs with two outs. Buffalo managed to hold the lead in an offensive game that saw the two teams combine for seventeen runs and twenty-five hits.
Lantz and senior catcher Katherine Appelbe combined for six hits, five runs scored, and two runs batted in, but their offensive efforts were not enough to lift the Crimson over Buffalo and end the team’s five-game losing streak.
The Bulls added to its early lead against relief pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz. Buffalo’s junior third baseman Lauren Gambone hit a three-run home run off of the senior from Tucson, AZ in the fourth inning to extend the Bulls’ lead.
The Crimson staged a late comeback in the team’s final at-bat in the seventh inning, scoring three runs and bringing the tying run to the plate. But senior left fielder Andrea Del Conte fouled out with runners at the corners to end Harvard’s rally and the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.—“I have some history going against North Carolina…”
So said Tommy Amaker to a room full of media just minutes after learning that his Harvard men’s basketball team had drawn the Tar Heels as its second-round matchup in this year’s NCAA Tournament. Amaker paused for a brief moment as his comment drew a few laughs from the press, and then continued, expounding his relationship with North Carolina and extoling the past and present successes of the program.
Amaker, of course, is a proud Dukie; recruited by Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski just one year into Krzyzewski’s tenure, Amaker can be considered as part of the foundation of a program that, in the past 30 years, has grown into the powerhouse that Duke is regarded as today. From the first time that Krzyzewski saw Amaker—in Falls Church, Va., when the latter was just a sophomore in high school—he was determined to see the point guard in Durham, N.C., a fact evinced by the opening words Krzyzewski spoke to Amaker’s mother: “‘Mrs. Amaker, your son is going to look great in Duke blue.’”
Krzyzewski, however, was not the only coach that envisioned Amaker in that shade of jersey. Roy Williams, the current head coach and then-assistant coach of Duke rival North Carolina, also lauded Amaker’s play. However, despite Williams’s sentiment towards Amaker, he was unable to recruit the point guard, as the Tar Heels had already set their minds on a different ball-handler—future standout Kenny Smith.
“I loved Tommy when he was in high school,” said Williams at Wednesday’s press conference in Jacksonville. “I thought he was the most complete point guard out there in his class. He could score, he could defend, he was a coach on the court. He didn't make silly mistakes…. I really did have a great deal of respect for him as a player.”
Two years later, Amaker did indeed don the Duke blue and went on to play floor general in the Blue Devils’ ride to the national championship game in 1986, captain the team in 1986-1987, and return to Durham in 1988 as one of the program’s assistant coaches, a position he kept for a decade.
But as Williams left the Tar Heels for a head coaching job at Kansas the very year that Amaker joined the Blue Devil staff, the two’s overlap was virtually nonexistent. Ironically, it wasn’t until Amaker had left Duke and arrived at Seton Hall that the pair matched up in their first coaching duel, with Williams still on the Jayhawks’ bench.
Now, just about three decades after Williams first watched him play on his high school’s hardwood, Amaker will finally get the chance to face off against the program that he was taught to ‘hate’ and the coach whom sat on his rival’s sideline for so long.
But Amaker’s first thought after drawing North Carolina as his dancing partner was one of respect for, not rancor towards, the Tar Heels and, especially, Roy Williams—the man who he had played in front of in high school, played against in college, and competed against just once since entering the ranks of Division I coaches.
“[I] have a great appreciation for how awesome [North Carolina has] been throughout the history of college basketball,” Amaker said on Sunday. “What a program they’ve had through the years—players, and great teams and coaches—it’s as good as any.”
“[Williams is a] wonderful man, a wonderful guy,” Amaker continued. “He’s always been terrific to me…. [In] the coaching fraternity, everyone respects him greatly for his achievements but also for the kind of person he is.”
But there’s also some trepidation of playing a storied program like North Carolina, which features a frontline that truly redefines the descriptor ‘rangy.’ The Tar Heels are coming off of a big win over Virginia and a nearly-successful run through the ACC tournament, falling only in the title game to a talented Notre Dame squad. Harvard, meanwhile, has beaten only one NCAA Tournament team all year: Northeastern, in the opening weeks of the season, almost four months ago.
“[F]or me, thinking about how terrific and great [the Tar Heels] are and they always have been, it wasn't necessarily a very pleasant thought internally when I saw the actual draw,” recalled Amaker on Wednesday.
Amaker certainly knows what it feels like to go up against the program from Chapel Hill, having either played or coached against it for nearly half of the last 30 years. This is the team he has battled against upwards of 25 times since he first threw on the Duke blue; this is the squad he fought with for every inch in the ACC standings for that decade and a half. He might call the sideline of Lavietes Pavilion home now, but the mentality that Krzyzewski instilled in him all those years ago is still somewhere, evidenced by his admission that after he heard North Carolina’s name called on Sunday he thought to himself, “Boy, this is who we have to play?”
Perhaps Harvard senior wing Wesley Saunders phrased it best when he said that he was certain that Amaker is “having some flashbacks” and that it’s “nostalgic for him to be matched up against UNC.”
But, according to Amaker, it’s important to remember that he aligns himself now with Cambridge—not Cameron, Duke’s storied stadium. His rival is now Yale, whom his squad took care of last weekend—not the Tar Heels, whom Harvard hasn’t even faced since the 1970’s. For Amaker, that is, his past with the Blue Devils and his present with the Crimson split as he throws on the proverbial Harvard hoops pinny, shedding the blue that Krzyzewski spoke of in that high school gym in Falls Church, Va. along the way.
“I try to honestly keep my history out of it,” Amaker said on Wednesday. “It's not about me. It certainly is about what these kids have accomplished in our program…and how excited I am for them. But certainly they recognize, and we all do, the history and the tradition and the greatness of Carolina basketball, and so anything with me is really irrelevant…. [We’re just] hopeful that we will play well to showcase Ivy basketball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As covered earlier this week, the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-7, 11-3 Ivy) is being seen a substantial underdog to its first-round NCAA opponent—the North Carolina Tar Heels (24-11, 11-7 ACC). Below, men’s basketball beat writer David Freed looks at the five things Harvard needs to do to pull off the upset.
1. Control the Pace: In today’s media sessions, the top main topics were the pace of the game and the ability of the Tar Heels to control the boards. UNC likes to get out and run, where its athleticism can overcome opponents and generate early looks in transition. The Tar Heels just 1-5 in games with fewer than 65 possessions, whereas Harvard averages just 63.8 possessions a game. If the Crimson can keep the game slow, minimizing turnovers, they can keep a potent UNC offense in check.
2. Stop Marcus Paige: The heart and soul of the Tar Heels is junior point guard Marcus Paige, the team’s best perimeter scorer. Paige will be checked by a litany of Harvard defenders, likely starting with 6’0” starting point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers guarded Yale combo guard Javier Duren for many of the final two contests with Yale and has improved vastly as a defender in year three. If he does not excel here, however, Harvard’s chances will fall from slim to none.
3. Hold its Own on the Glass: Against a team that ranked second in Division I in rebounding, it is crucial Harvard be able to keep defensive possessions to one shot. UNC boasts length, depth, and size across its front line, while Harvard often eschews defensive rebounding to send people (read: junior Agunwa Okolie) out in transition. Junior wing Wesley Saunders and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi are the team’s two best rebounding rotation players and the two keys to the game. On the other side, Harvard will likely eschew rebounding to send extra players back in transition, as stopping the Tar Heel break is a priority for the squad.
4. Bench and Balance: Harvard coach Tommy Amaker is often quoted with these two words, his personal keys to the Harvard offense. Against a deep UNC squad, Harvard will need both its bench to provide solid minutes and support its big three—Chambers, Moundou-Missi, and Saunders—who will not overcome the Tar Heels on their own.
5. Regress To The Mean: In its biggest games of the year, Harvard’s shot has failed it when it needed it most. Two brutal three-point shooting performances against Yale were preceded by brick fests against Virginia and Boston College. Saunders went a combined four-of-26 in the two games, while the Crimson as a team shot just 24.5 percent. While some credit is due to the defenses of the opposing squads, Harvard missed a number of wide-open shots in each contest—against the Cavaliers in particular, the Crimson generated a series of early good looks. If the percentages revert back to the mean, Harvard will defy many of the doubters about its offense.
