“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” is a rare and exciting film: an adaptation that adheres nearly perfectly to its source material, a sequel that improves upon its predecessor, and a non-stop thrill ride of an action movie packed with social commentary. “The Hunger Games,” released in March of last year, was a similarly faithful and riveting adaptation. Yet under the helm of new franchise director Francis Lawrence, this film explores even darker and more ominous aspects of the country of Panem than the eponymous games: the vast political machinations underlying this futuristic totalitarian world. Grounded by grand world-building, a superb supporting cast, and the always-electric Jennifer Lawrence, “Catching Fire” is a powerfully acted and fantastically imagined glimpse into a frightening future.
The film opens back home in District 12, where wintry mists blanket the Appalachian coal mines and a post-traumatic Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) attempts to put her life back together after surviving the 74th Hunger Games. Francis Lawrence wastes no time in establishing this as a darker world than the previous film. Rather than the bleak summer of creaking cottages and lined faces that filled the opening minutes of “The Hunger Games,” we see instead a cold, gray, industrial landscape where Katniss cannot shoot an arrow without flashing back to a boy she killed.
But the novel did not linger on home, and neither can the film. Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are soon back in the Capitol, first to be lauded as victors and later to participate in a politically motivated second Hunger Games—this one intended to kill as many victors as possible by throwing them into a new arena together. The first 80 minutes or so of the film lead up to this moment, but there is nary a dull second, for the world outside the arena is as dangerous as that within. This epic exploration is one of the most successful expansions from the first film.
As Katniss, Peeta, and their eclectic entourage speed by train through the country, they both witness and inadvertently ignite acts of revolution wherever they go. For the passively placated citizens of the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are the “lethal lovers from District 12,” though their romance is strategic rather than genuine; but for the poor, disenfranchised masses that fill the other 11 districts, they are a symbol of hope that will soon explode into violent defiance. The world of Panem comes to life as viscerally on film as it did in the novel: from the penned-in and violently patrolled agricultural district to the sterile and Grecian capitol, there is grandeur in this world-building that effectively expands Katniss’s horizons beyond her home and the arena. She may be a gladiator for the new age, but this time, we get to see all of Rome.
Jennifer Lawrence anchors the film with frightfully convincing ferocity in a performance that could be called career-making had she not already proven herself several times over. In the space of five seconds, fear, shock, panic, and insanity flit across her face. In other sequences, she is as capable at hanging like a broken marionette doll at the tribute selection ceremony (known as the “reaping”) as she is at striding darkly and defiantly across a stage to play sycophant to her fawning Capitol audience. While her powerful performance tended at times to overwhelm other actors in the previous film, here they rise to the occasion. Hutcherson’s transformation is especially notable, taking him from a love-struck weakling to an equally compelling companion. Newcomers Finnick (Sam Claflin) and Johanna (Jena Malone), fellow victors-turned-tributes, encapsulate their characters’ most-loved attributes of charm and abrasiveness. From Woody Harrelson in his reprisal of the role of Haymitch Abernathy to Philip Seymour Hoffman’s introduction as Plutarch Heavensbee, these actors are perfectly cast, and their chemistry elevates the ensemble from mere role-playing to role-inhabiting. By the end of the film, even Hoffman, as recognizable as he may be, disappears into his character.
With a similar, if expanded, plot to the first film, “Catching Fire” could easily have come across as “The Hunger Games 2,” a mere stepping stone on the way to the vastly different world of the series’s third installment, “Mockingjay.” “Catching Fire” may be a sequel, but its insidious backbone, full of foreboding and a dark psychological tone, marks it as a film unto itself. It succeeds as a companion piece and an adaptation by clearly moving the series forward. Dark though this world may be, in this consistently heart-pounding and compelling adaptation, it is one we may not want to leave.

With the recent releases of “The Book Thief” and “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” it seems as though most popular books today are accompanied by their movie counterparts. Some adaptations, like the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, garner widespread popularity and critical acclaim while others, like the “Lord of the Rings” prequel “The Hobbit,” are profoundly unimpressive. Here are some of the best and worst book-to-film adaptations:

The Good
“Holes”
Admit it, we all watched and rewatched Disney Channel reruns of the movie adaptation of Louis Sachar’s stellar children’s novel “Holes” starring Shia LaBeouf.
 
“Schindler’s List” 
The only thing that’s different in the movie adaptation is that it’s named “Schindler’s List” while Thomas Keneally’s original novel is called “Schindler's Ark.” Steven Spielberg’s beautiful film adaptation will make you cry just as much as the book will.
 
“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe”
It’s apparent that director Andrew Adamson stuck close to his source material and created a faithful adaptation that captured the humor and wonder of C.S. Lewis’s classic children’s novel. But then Disney decided to make “Prince Caspian,” the sequel, where everything went down the drain.
 
“The Perks of Being a Wallflower”
The movie version of Stephen Chbosky’s young adult novel accomplished what the book is best known for: capturing the angsty early teenage years that we now refuse to believe actually happened. It could have done without Emma Watson’s awful American accent, though.
 
“Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory”
This childhood classic can make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, just like Roald Dahl’s book “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” did as a kid. Why did Tim Burton have to soil its memory with his 2005 adaptation, again?
 
 
The Bad
 
“Eragon”
While the pre-teen fantasy series is exciting and intricately crafted, the only thing that the movie has in common with the series is that there is a dragon thrown in just for good measure.
 
“Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events”
With its humor and wacky plot, Lemony Snicket’s book series was charming and unique. The movie, on the other hand, takes itself too seriously and bears almost no resemblance to the books. Audiences must have felt pretty unfortunate watching this.
 
“Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief”
This movie tried way too hard to be like “Harry Potter” (even down to the fact that it was directed by Chris Columbus, director of the first two “Potter” films), and failed miserably.
 
“Romeo + Juliet”
Baz Luhrmann’s modern adaptation of the classic love story tries too hard to be cool, and ends up a laughable and awkward mess. Shakespearean English just doesn’t work with Romeo driving around in a convertible.
 
“Sherlock Holmes”
The classic detective stories served as the basis for Guy Ritchie’s adaptation, which completely butchered the wit and originality that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s novels are known for. I think I can actually hear Doyle rolling over in his grave with Robert Downey Jr.’s every line.

Thanksgiving—which falls unusually late this year—is finally around the corner, bringing with it a welcome respite from the semester’s stresses. Although not all students will go home for the holiday, everyone can enjoy a break from classes—as well as the knowledge that the end of the semester is not far off. But Thanksgiving is the first such break in 12 weeks (aside from Columbus Day Weekend), and this year it is followed by only two days of classes before reading period begins. A real fall break earlier in the semester would give students the opportunity to catch their breath and help to alleviate student stress, even if just temporarily.
Harvard’s current academic calendar features a five-week winter break. While this provides plenty of time for rest and relaxation before students return for the spring semester, one of those weeks could instead be used to create a fall break similar to those of Yale and Princeton. This would give students a chance to unwind about halfway through the semester and hopefully provide a clearer framework around which to schedule midterms and other assignments. At the moment, the fall semester’s “midterm season” seems to last from the end of add-drop all the way to reading period. Adding a fall break would give students a welcome respite from this intense period of work.
Having a fall break would also allow students to pursue various activities outside of the classroom, including ones similar to those offered on campus during Wintersession or the many programs (such as the Philips Brooks House Association’s service trips) sponsored during spring break. This could be a fun and productive alternative for all students, and in particular for those for whom it is not feasible to travel home. Between classes and extracurricular commitments, most students are prohibitively busy during the academic year. Adding a fall break would allow students to better avail themselves of opportunities both on and off-campus.
The establishment of a fall break could go a long way in reducing student stress, but here the word “break” is key. Although it is unrealistic to expect that no work be assigned at all, the university and professors alike should strive to let breaks be just that—a relief from academic pressure, rather than reading periods by another name. If at all feasible, ending midterms before the break and keeping assignments due immediately afterward to a minimum could have a positive impact on students’ well-being and allow them to get far more out of their time off.
The university has already done much to change its academic calendar for the better—most notably by moving final exams before winter break in 2008—but there remains room for improvement. A fall break would reduce student stress and enrich the Harvard experience. This is one improvement that Harvard should enact, especially in light of recent administration efforts to alleviate student stress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael Cera’s recent article in the New Yorker illustrates the stereotypical personality that he embodies: the awkward, out of place white boy who, in pursuit of his genuinely good intentions, tends to exacerbate whatever tensions may exist in any given situation. Audiences everywhere sympathize with the Georges, Nicks, and Paulies they see on TV and in the movies—not to mention the fact that Cera’s repeated depiction of this one type of character is brilliantly entertaining. But no matter how often Cera showcases his one persona in the movies, I will never understand the Michael Cera craze. I have always found him entertaining, but that’s about it.
This summer I had the opportunity to hear Michael Cera speak at the Apple store in New York City. He and his friend Sebastian Silva were promoting“Crystal Fairy and the Magical Cactus,”a movie that Silva wrote and directed, in which Michael starred. Audience interaction with Cera and Silva was limited to a question and answer session at the very end, after which the two stars disappeared into the store’s back room. My friend, whose obsession with Michael far surpassed my mere respect for him as an actor and writer, was determined to meet him. We rushed out of the store and waited by the corner to see if we could catch him on his way out the back. And sure enough, about ten minutes was all it took for him to exit through the side-street door.
As we approached him, I took a deep breath to relish the moment—this was it. I was finally going to meet a famous person! Through my excitement, I reminded myself that he really was just another guy who had discovered a talent for acting and writing. Still, I couldn’t help but be just a tad nervous. So I decided to wait for a few people to go before me…you know, to tell him what big fans they were, to shake his hand, to tell him that Juno is their favorite movie, etc.
But Michael’s attitude about the situation was apparent from the moment he saw my friend and I walking toward him. I have never seen such a look on a person’s face: cold nothingness. His friend asked him, “Do you want me to get [so-and-so] so we can get out of here?” He replied curtly with more than a tinge of annoyance, “No. It’s fine.”
A small, squiggly semicircle of fans naturally formed around him as if he was radiating some magnetic force that kept each of us a certain distance away. The unspoken rule was that one person could approach Michael at a time. There was no suffocating him, or loud, obnoxious fans yelling in his face. Except one guy rudely snapping photos, everybody else asked Michael calmly and politely if they could take a photo with him. He simply declined. I wouldn’t even describe the general feeling of the group as excitement. On the contrary, awkwardness, that perhaps reached the level found in Michael’s movies, hung uncomfortably in the air. He just kept staring dead ahead, waiting for the next person to approach for whom he had to pretend like he was mildly grateful for their appreciation.
When that next person was me, I quickly ran through the lines I had prepared in my head one last time, extended my hand, and said, “Hi Michael, I just wanted to say that I really enjoy watching you act and I love your work. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear you talk about your new movie and it really is a pleasure meeting you.” My arm was left hanging, unshaken. I waited nervously for his response. After the most awkward pause of my life, he shifted his gaze to me for the first time (he had been still staring off to God knows where), and told me, “I didn’t hear a word you just said.”
There was no “I’m sorry…” There was no, “excuse me…” He didn’t request that I repeat what I had said—just that he didn’t hear a word. Taken aback, I fumbled with the few first words as I repeated my compliments. Only after I finished did he return my handshake, flash me a forced smile that looked more like he was sucking on a lemon, and reply, “Thanks.” I’m not going to lie. I was crushed. I would have expected this from maybe Brad Pitt, or Hugh Grant…but Michael Cera?
I will always laugh out loud at George. Nick makes me smile every time. And I still listen to Paulie on my iPod, from his recording with Juno. My appreciation for Michael as an actor has not diminished with this negative experience. But it did teach me the most cliché of lessons: No matter how unassuming and innocent a person’s character is in the movies—even if he plays that character every single time—I cannot form expectations about who an actor is in real life. We should all reassess our Cera craze to make sure that we don’t blur the lines between his personality and that of the characters he portrays, but instead simply appreciate Michael Cera, the actor, for his acting abilities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We will meet tonight at7 p.m. Don´t be late!” I am sure all members of Harvard´s student organizations have been in a situation like this before: a message in your inbox alerting you of the next meeting only a few hours before the time stated in the email.
For most College students that might be annoying and quite inconvenient. But there will be no problem getting there on time, since all locations on campus are only a few minutes away from student rooms, regardless of which of the 12 Houses they live in.
But this is not the case for 55 other members of the Harvard Community—including me. I am a Visiting Undergraduate Student and as such I am not eligible for Harvard Housing. The little-known VUS Program allows students from other universities to study at Harvard for one semester or one academic year. VUS are full students here in every aspect but one: housing. That should change. VUS should not only take the same classes, write the same exams, eat the same meals, and engage in the same extracurriculars as every other undergraduate: They should also live in the same Houses.
All the VUS belong to Dudley House, which is different from all other Houses, in that nobody lives there. Apart from that, Dudley offers plentiful resources: academic advisers, a library, a dining hall etc. It is the perfect place for all non-residents, like Graduate Students, VUS or regular undergraduates that decided against normal residential housing.
“The VUS were an active presence at the events we hosted at Dudley,” notes Eric Malczewski, the VUS Coordinator, in an email. Dudley offers them a community and that should not change. But apart from the VUS, every other Dudley House student is offered housing from Harvard.
The chief problem for a lot of VUS is proximity—or lack thereof. Proximity to each other and to Harvard Yard is what makes the community of Harvard College a community. Harvard College functions on the assumption that during the semester everybody is always on campus or just a few minutes away. This assumption often renders VUS out of sync with the rest of the social and study patterns on campus.
For us, a trip from our apartments to the Yard and back again often takes more than an hour. Yesterday at 1 p.m. I got a message from a Harvard-affiliated organization telling me to be at the John Harvard Statue in cocktail attire by 9:15 p.m., and not to be late. Luckily I was not yet in the Yard when I read this message, otherwise I would have had to take the 66 bus to Allston and back again just to change my clothes.
Since the 66 is quite erratic such a trip can easily take between one and two hours. The MBTA’s lack of late-night service also contributes to the mobility problems of non-resident students. And problems predicting bus arrivals can significantly mess with your midterm plans.
The VUS could be better integrated into the Harvard community. If Harvard is really committed to securing the diversity of its student body it should stop treating its VUS like campus commuters.
Some might argue that the goal of creating a welcoming culture should not convince Harvard to bear the cost of additional housing. But VUS could also pay for this and 100 percent of that money would go directly to Harvard since VUS are not eligible for financial aid from the university. That means that all the VUS either have secured scholarships from outside sources or have to pay the rent for their rooms out of their own pocket, regardless of whether Harvard supplies housing or if they have to find housing elsewhere, as is the case now.
A room in one of Harvard’s dorms currently costs a student $8,667 for one academic year. Since on short notice it is nearly impossible to find acceptable housing near Harvard Yard for less than $722.25 per month—the monthly cost of housing for resident students—most VUS´s would probably choose to pay that. All others can still try their luck finding a place of their own.
Asking the VUS to pay for housing would suit both Harvard´s need for funding and fulfill the wishes of VUS to become full members of the community.
Of course there might be other (solvable) problems. Karen Flood, Resident Dean of Dudley House, who is aware of the VUS’ wish for on-campus housing, writes in an interview, “the issue is really one of space.” Nonetheless there is reason for hope, since Flood and her colleagues are “also exploring longer-range plans to potentially secure housing specifically for the VUS.” That is laudable and would circumvent the problem of integrating the fluctuating number of VUS into the housing lottery system.
But even if nothing else could convince the Harvard Administration to change their ways, maybe plain rivalry can. Columbia University has a program for visiting students just like that of Harvard. But Columbia provides housing to many of them!
Certainly if Columbia can find a way to provide housing for its visiting students, so can Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We see them everywhere: crowding around the entrance to the T and sitting outside CVS. Some of us might work with them in shelters, while others simply see them as a way of procuring alcohol while underage. The homeless of Cambridge live alongside us, and yet seem entirely foreign.
Many students try to bridge this gap through community service, which is certainly an admirable choice. Every year, approximately 150 students work at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. But after students return from their shifts, how easy is it to forget that there are people spending the night outside? It is hypocritical to reach out to the homeless in deed alone, if our actions do not lead us to develop compassion for them as well. Often, the latter is more helpful. Rennell, a homeless woman who was invited to speak in a Sociology 149 lecture last year, said that “sometimes conversation is better than money, to know you’re part of the world.” Acknowledging the humanity present in another—this seems simple. But empathy, it turns out, is an acquired skill. This fall, I joined LIFT, a national non-profit that works one-on-one with clients in find access to jobs, public housing, and public benefits. Until I began speaking to clients and hearing their side of the story, I didn’t fully appreciate how hard their situation was, and how little of it was their fault. It is this human component that Harvard students seem to need the most help with.
In several recent scandals, Harvard students have demonstrated ignorance about the local homeless population. Logan Leslie ’16, who ran for Cambridge City Council, listed homelessness as an issue on his campaign website. While Leslie did well to identify this problem, he approached it in a way that was antagonistic towards homeless individuals. Calling them “vagrants,” and demanding that we stop “coddling” are not appropriate ways to deal with the homeless. Nearly one quarter of the homeless population suffers from a severe mental illness (in comparison, only six percent of the non-homeless have severe mental illness); caring for them is exactly the right thing to do.
Leslie’s insensitive statement painted the homeless as an enemy, but more poisonous facets of the Harvard community demean the homeless to the point of dehumanization. As part of this year’s initiation activities, The Hasty Pudding Institute instructed neophytes to complete several tasks, documenting each with a photo to evidence their success. According to multiple initiates one of these tasks included buying a pizza and delivering it to a homeless person in Harvard Square. It does not take a genius to understand that photographing a group of Harvard students in a staged act of charity next to a homeless person, as if he were a prop, is wrong. One of the initiates recalled how, during the scavenger hunt, one member engaged in jokes mocking the homeless. The president of The Hasty Pudding Institute declined to comment.
Nor is this an uncommon occurrence. Just last year, the Sablière Society created controversy when two of its initiates videotaped themselves mocking a homeless man.
Of course, Leslie’s comments and the actions of the Hasty Pudding Institute are not representative of the student body as a whole. The student-run Harvard Square Homeless Shelter is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. But the callous indifference present in both should raise red flags for the College community as a whole. This is especially true for the Hasty Pudding, a club that is officially recognized by the University. Whereas making jokes about the gay community or other minority groups is almost universally condemned on campus, jokes demeaning the homeless can often be tossed about with no objections. Aside from purely altruistic reasons, the administration should have an interest in educating students on this topic, so that they do not reflect poorly on the University as a whole.
By lumping individuals into a large mass of “The Homeless” we ignore the humanity present in each person. Homeless people should not be thought of as an enemy or as a nuisance; the real enemy is a system that does not adequately provide for people struggling with mental health issues. We cannot stigmatize those who are out of work without acknowledging that we live in a society where the vast majority of jobs are not advertised, and connections are frequently the key to securing employment.
Too often, we can become complacent about the work we do. Racking up a set amount of volunteer hours does not make you a “good person.” There should not be a sharp divide between how we treat homeless individuals in the context of volunteering and in the context of our daily lives. Lecturer Patrick Hamm, who invited Rennell and two other homeless citizens to his class, had the right idea. This ignorance and lack of empathy may only be resolved if students confront the humanity present in the homeless, no matter how different their backgrounds may be from ours. The first step is as easy as a smile and a hello.

A year after Harvard’s student body voted for an Undergraduate Council ticket that promised to “Demand Relevance,” and in a year when students elected a ticket running under the slogan “You could do worse,” undergraduates reflected on what the first-ever-winning joke ticket means for student government at Harvard.
“It just goes to show how disconnected [UC representatives] are with everyone and everything,” said Nathaniel S. Hay ’15.
The UC Election Commission announced late Thursday night that Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 had won the UC presidential election by a margin of more than 150 votes. The ticket declared their plans to resign immediately after that announcement, and the UC will elect a new president and vice president internally if Clark and Mayopoulos follow through with that resignation during the Council’s inauguration on Dec. 8.
Throughout the campaign, Clark and Mayopoulos garnered enthusiasm and support from the Harvard student body through humorous posters and jokes. Running under two goals–that tomato basil ravioli soup be served daily and that thicker toilet paper be made available to students–the team frequently emphasized their total lack of experience with the UC.
Sayantan Deb ’14, who voted for Clark and Mayopoulos, said he expected that the ticket would win all along because of the bond they were able to form with the student community.
“I think part of it came from just them being more visible,” Deb said.
Clark, a correspondent for comedy group On Harvard Time, made headlines last week outside of his successful UC presidential campaign. On Harvard Time’s Harvard-Yale parody video, which features Clark giving a fake tour of Yale, received national attention from organizations including Huffington Post and USA Today. After Clark and Mayopoulos announced their plans to resign, the popular entertainment website “BroBible” declared that “The Harvard Bros Who Pranked Yale Pulled an Even Bigger Prank on HARVARD.” 
But on campus, sentiment was at times more subdued. After the release of the election results on Thursday, Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15, one of the two other candidates for UC president, expressed disappointment in the student voters’ decision.
“It really shows a lack of confidence with the Council and our efforts, and I really wish that wasn’t the case because we do do everything for the students,” he said. 
In contrast, Tim R. Hwang ’08, who ran a joke candidacy unsuccessfully in 2006, said he was “absolutely thrilled” by the Clark-Mayopoulos victory.
“It’s great to finally see a joke candidacy like that rise to the commanding heights of the Undergraduate Council. It brought a tear to my eye,” Hwang said. 
Hwang said he thinks that the UC is taken too sincerely at Harvard. He added that he thinks the UC often attracts only future aspiring politicians to its presidency, resulting in a body “divorced from usual student life.”
Despite varying views on what the duo’s win means for the UC, both supporters and critics of the ticket expressed disapproval at the planned resignation.
“What would they do if they didn’t resign? Not much. What are they going to do if they resign? Not much either,” said Hay.
Deb said he wished they would not resign because he believes that more than past candidates, the two are connected to the student body.
Hwang said that although he had planned to remain in office if he had won in 2006, he admires and respects the decision of Clark and Mayopoulos not to do the same. 
 “From one revolutionary candidacy to another, I totally respect their choice, and I cheer them on,” he said.

He once successfully defended a goat accused of killing its owner, and, on Monday afternoon, visiting Harvard Law School professor Howard E. Abrams encouraged students gathered at an informal luncheon to take animal rights seriously. 
A former attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund and tax attorney by training, Abrams shared his own background as an animal rights activist and a vegetarian in a talk entitled “Free as a Bird?” Before a roughly 80-person audience at the Law School, composed mostly of law students, Abrams said that lawyers should think not only about the legality of a case involving animals, but also about its moral implications.
Abrams began the afternoon by discussing one of his more famous clients, a goat accused of murdering its owner. Because the goat’s owner had “tortured” it in order to make it a more aggressive guard animal, Abrams said that he was able to free the animal from punishment.
“Animal rights is the only thing that is important to me,” Abrams told the audience, shifting to his own story of vegetarianism.
Abrams said that he is not a philosopher and that he does not have his own consistent moral theory backing up his activism. Rather, he became a vegetarian after reading the argument of libertarian theorist and former Harvard professor Robert Nozick in his famous book “Anarchy, State, and Utopia.” In that work, Nozick argued that animal suffering cannot be justified with human pleasure it might bring—a reason, Abrams said, to avoid eating meat.
Abrams jokingly told his audience that he did not have children out of fear they might turn out to be carnivores.
“I was told I would like my children either way; but I am not convinced,” he said, laughing.
The roughly hour-long event was organized by the Harvard Law School chapter of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. The group also provided a free vegan lunch for attendees.
“We wanted to make more Harvard students learn about animal rights,” said Alene G. Anello ’10, a member of the Fund and one of the event’s organizers.
Sandeep S. Chhabra, a law student who attended the talk, said that the strength of Abrams’s commitment to animal rights surprised him.
“I think it is pretty remarkable how devoted he is to animal rights, [and] the extent that he values animal life over human life,” Chhabra said.
Abrams drew laughter throughout the event, and its ending was no exception.
“Even if I did not convince you, at least most of you did not eat meat for one meal,” he said.

With the world’s population expected to grow exponentially in coming years, the Harvard Innovation Lab is turning to students for solutions to the sociopolitical and environmental problems that population expansion may pose.
The Deans’ Design Challenge: Urban Life 2030, announced last Friday in collaboration with the I-Lab, will award the top eight student proposals with prize money, which will be used to fund the projects beyond their research and development stage. The Challenge will officially kick off on Dec. 3 at the I-Lab in Allston.
“By leveraging the resources available through the Harvard I-Lab—from educational programs to mentors—the Challenge will give students with a focus on design thinking the potential to make a global impact,” Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray, the co-chairs of the Challenge, wrote in a press release.
The Deans’ Design Challenge is the fourth contest of its kind to be sponsored by the I-Lab in recent years. It joins the Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge, the Deans’ Health and Life Sciences Challenge, and the President’s Challenge, which kicked off the series in 2012.
“I view these Challenges as a mechanism for collaboration and the birthplace of ideas—some of which may get recognized, some of which will go on regardless of the Challenge,” I-Lab managing director Gordon S. Jones said. “I think all of them should have the potential to be implemented in real world environments...as opposed to [being] a purely academic exercise.”
Like its predecessors, the Deans’ Design Challenge crosses academic departments, outlining four different disciplinary areas of focus for proposals.
The “Responsive Cities” focus asks how cities can improve functionality, “Urban Metabolisms” calls for ideas regarding energy efficiency and sustainability, and “The Future of Consumption” revolves around technological innovations in material consumption. The final focus, “Aging in Place,” asks teams to address the adverse effects posed by an older population.
“[The Challenge] would be particularly wonderful for those teams that involve people from different departments and disciplines,” Design School professor Ann Forsyth said. “I think that’s a real value of this kind of project.”
Gordon agreed, adding that Challenge winners “almost always include some unique approach or insight and include some consideration for how they can be economically sustainable.”
Participating Harvard Students will submit their proposals in February, before a committee of experts from the University and outside community judges them. Finalists will give presentations at an event in May, with a grand prize winner announced after. The sizes of the awards have not yet been announced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Institute of Politics and the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded John F. Kennedy New Frontier Awards to Charles Best, founder of DonorsChoose.org, and Democratic Representative from Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard at an awards ceremony Monday evening marked by numerous standing ovations and repeated references to President Kennedy’s call to service.
The awards were presented at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum by Jack B. Schlossberg, Kennedy’s grandson and a junior at Yale University. They recognize one elected and one non-elected individual under the age of 40 “whose contributions in elected office, community service, or advocacy demonstrate the impact and values of public service in the spirit of John F. Kennedy,” Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Elwood ’75 said during the ceremony’s opening remarks.
In his acceptance speech, Best said that grappling with issues of classroom funding while teaching public school in The Bronx prompted him to found DonorsChoose.org, which lets people donate money to classrooms around the country. The website has been used at least once by half of all American public school teachers, according to Schlossberg.
Best called the award the greatest honor of his public life, and said it was an “extreme example” of “the frontman for other people’s work getting credit for what they’ve done.”
“We are now embarking on our own new frontier,” Best said. “We’ve opened up our data so governments can see exactly what resources teachers most need in particular cities and see how to make school systems smarter, better targeted, more responsive to the needs of communities as they emerge in real time.”
Gabbard, the first Hindu congressperson and first congressperson of Samoan descent, said that she learned early to equate success with service. In addition to serving as a U.S. representative, she has been elected to city and state governmental positions and volunteered for combat service in Iraq.
“What does it actually mean for us to serve? How do we address in our own lives, answer this question—President Kennedy’s call to action?” she asked the audience. “It is by stepping outside of the safe boxes that we have created in our own lives and looking outward.”
Michael A. Kikukawa ’17, who hails from Gabbard’s congressional district, said that he found her speech inspiring.
“I liked what she said about how she just wanted to serve in life and wasn’t necessarily looking for the best job opportunity,” Kikukawa said.
The Institute of Politics also presented a surprise award to Tom McNaught, the executive director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, who will retire next year.
IOP director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 told The Crimson after the event that the ceremony had particular significance given its proximity to the fiftieth anniversary of President Kennedy’s death.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 500-win club welcomed a new member Saturday night as Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith clinched her 500th victory as the leader of the Crimson. Having spent 32 years at Harvard, Delaney-Smith is the winningest coach in Ivy League women’s basketball history. She joins 28 active coaches in Division I with at least 500 wins.
A strong offensive game gave Harvard (5-1) a lead Colgate (1-3) was unable to overcome as the Crimson defeated the Raiders, 91-76, at Cotterrell Court in Hamilton, N.Y. It was clear early on that Delaney-Smith would hit the 500 mark, as there were only two lead changes through the whole game.
The keys to the game for the Crimson were to get into an offensive stride, and shut Colgate down defensively. The Raiders strength lies in their ability to score, so Harvard knew they would need to silence the outside shooters to be successful.
“They were a really good shooting team so we wanted to make sure they didn’t get hot or get on fire,” junior forward Erin McDonnell said. “I think we did a pretty good job of doing that.”
The squad was able to force Colgate to the inside and take away their three-point game, with the Raiders only making five of 19 shots from behind the arc. In contrast, 40 of their 76 points came from inside the paint. The team had hoped to keep Colgate to below 70 points, but were unable to achieve that goal.
“They had a few very wide-open layups and that was very frustrating for us,” McDonnell said. “But we came together as a team and realized our defense was not our greatest and made sure we annihilate them the next four-minute segment.”
On the offensive side, it was entirely a team effort. McDonnell earned a career-high 19 points in the game, hitting four three-pointers. Co-captain Christine Clark scored 21 points for the fifth game in a row, leading the Crimson in scoring.  Junior forward Temi Fagbenle and senior guard Jasmine Evans also were double-digit scorers. The bench also was able to contribute 25 points to the victory.
Fagbenle made an impact in all statistical categories, leading the team in rebounds and assists as well as contributing 16 points in the victory.
While three-pointers became Colgate’s weakness in Saturday’s game, it was Harvard’s strength. The team made 9-of-14 from behind the line in the first half, while shooting 54.5 percent overall in the game. This was a major leap compared to their season average of 38.8 percent shooting from long range.
“We had a height advantage so Colgate had to try and take our inside game away,” Delaney-Smith said. “We found the open shooter and it was never the same shooter.”
The Crimson’s 91 points were the most it has scored all season. It is the first time since December 2010 that the women scored over 90 points.
The first half saw a Crimson offense that could not be stopped. The team shot 65.5 percent from the field. McDonnell scored eight of the first 10 Harvard points, putting them ahead quickly.  A similar pattern started out the second half, with the Crimson scoring seven of the first nine points. The largest lead came in the second half as Harvard led the Raiders by 23 points.
“They did get a few easy buckets that shouldn’t have happened,” McDonnell said. “Then we kind of pushed it back down their throats and never let them get into a run for too long.”
Turnovers were also important to the Crimson’s success. The team had 27 points off 22 turnovers, while Colgate conversely had only 12 points off of 17 turnovers.
Despite the significance of the victory for the record books, Harvard was entirely focused on beating a strong Raiders team. According to junior forward Erin McDonnell, Delaney-Smith wasn’t even aware of the landmark prior to the game.
“I don’t even think she knew it when we were playing,” McDonnell said. “She’s very humble…she totally forgot it was even her 500th win.”
The players themselves were very excited for Delaney-Smith’s milestone victory.
“After the game we were all talking about how blessed we were to play under a coach who’s been so successful throughout Harvard women’s basketball history,” McDonnell said. “It’s definitely an honor to play underneath her.”
Delaney-Smith only has to win 14 games to tie Princeton’s former men’s basketball coach Pete Carril for the title of most career wins by an Ivy League basketball coach, men or women.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a good weekend for the Harvard men’s water polo team outside of the pool. Crimson coach Ted Minnis was named CWPA’s coach for the year in his fourth year heading the program. Sophomore Ben Zepfel earned CWPA first-team honors, and sophomore Noah Harrison and freshman Joey Colton were both named to the second team.
But the story was different inside the pool, as the Crimson could not end its season on a high note. At the CWPA Championships in Providence this weekend, the team finished in sixth place with a record of 1-2.
BROWN 15, HARVARD 9
Sunday saw the fifth matchup between the Crimson (18-14) and the Bears (23-13) this season, with Brown able to come out on top, winning the series three games to two.
“We knew we were going to have to play our best game,” Minnis said. “These two teams know each other very well. If you look over the last two years this was probably the 10th or 11th time they have played.”
Harvard came out strong against a Bears team that relied heavily on its upperclassmen, with four straight goals that went unanswered. Tied at four heading into the second quarter, Brown was able to outscore Harvard four goals to two during the seven minutes, and led 8-6 going into halftime.
The Crimson cut the Bears’ lead to four in the fourth quarter on a goal by Colton, but that would be Harvard’s last score of the night as Brown went on to score twice more in the final minutes of the game.
“[Despite the loss], I think we played excellent defense this weekend. Our communication and awareness were phenomenal,” freshman 2-meter defender Dan Stevens said.
HARVARD 8, MIT 6
In the second game of the tournament, the Crimson was able to bounce back from a loss the previous night and come together in a victory over the Engineers (13-16).
Harvard came alive in the second half of the game, scoring five of its eight goals in the final two periods. After a slow start in which the Crimson trailed MIT, 5-3, in the second period, the defense took over and did not let any of the Engineers’ eight shots on goal fall between the posts.
“We came in and we were definitely on the letdown,” Minnis said. “We were a little flat and didn’t get going early offensively or defensively and ended up getting down 5-3 going into halftime, but we settled down and focused on getting shots on their defense pushing the ball into transition.”
During Harvard’s comeback in the third quarter, the Crimson took a shot that was blocked by the goalie, but Zepfel rebounded the block by beating both MIT’s goalie and defender to the ball and shooting it into the back of the net.
PRINCETON 9, HARVARD 7
Despite a strong start to the game, the Crimson could not close out a victory against the Tigers (22-5) on Friday night, as the team lost to sixth-seeded Princeton for the second time this season.
“We played well, there was not one play that could have cost us the game,” Minnis said. “Princeton scored two goals [late] that were great goals…it could have gone either way…we were a minute and a half from placing in the top four in the tournament.”
Harvard was able to win the first half of play, going into halftime with a 4-3 lead. But during the fourth quarter, the Tigers pressed ahead and scored three goals, none of which were answered by the Crimson.
“We got stagnant on offense which I think fed their counter-attack,” Stevens said. “Princeton is an aggressive team so when we failed on the offensive end, even for only one or two possessions, they will capitalize and they did.”
Stevens led Harvard with three goals during the game, followed close behind by sophomore Noah Harrison who had two. Sophomore goalie Colin Woolway had four saves in the loss.
Princeton was able to surge ahead in the fourth quarter with three unanswered goals that ended the Crimson’s hopes of a victory. Sophomore center defender Thomas Nelson and junior attacker Drew Hoffenberg each had three goals apiece, while the game winning goal went to freshman Curtis Fink.
“We had Princeton…but we let the momentum shift in their favor at the end and that killed us,” Stevens said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the opening faceoff of the women’s hockey game at Bright-Landry Hockey Center Friday night, Harvard dominated Boston University on the ice.
Heading into a competition between two nationally ranked teams, the No. 6 Crimson, prepared accordingly for its highly anticipated contest against an undefeated No. 9 Boston University. The Terriers had never lost to Harvard in regular-season play.
“Going into it, we were really excited for the matchup,” junior captain Marissa Gedman said. “We’re both ranked and they’re our rival across the river.”
Harvard began the game playing aggressively, especially on offense outshooting BU (10-3-1, 6-0-0 Hockey East) 16-9 during the first period. The Crimson (7-1-1, 6-1-1 ECAC) continued imposing its will throughout the game, emerging with a 3-1 victory.
“It was the only game of the weekend, so we all just left it out there and luckily it ended in our favor,” Gedman said. “Every time we play one of those ranked teams it’s ‘do or die’ because those rankings are huge when it all comes down to it.”
Senior Gina McDonald opened the game with a goal in the first four minutes, her first of the season, assisted by sophomore Dylanne Crugnale.
“Getting that first goal is huge, no matter who we’re playing,” Gedman said. “We have that goal every time we come out. It was nothing different for us. We try to grab the momentum right off the bat and then keep it rolling because that’s huge, especially when the game’s in your favor.”
Although BU proved competitive during the second period, outshooting Harvard, 11-10, it failed to put a puck in the back of the net.
With subsequent goals coming from junior Samantha Reber and sophomore Miye D’Oench in the second and third periods, respectively, the Crimson used its entire roster, decreased due to three team members currently on the Olympic team, to capitalize on opportunities.
“Every game, you’re looking at our score sheet and it’s different names and a bunch of different players,” Gedman said. “That’s really important in a team, especially because of how small our team is, that we’re getting so much production from a bunch of different girls. We’ve always been a tight-knit group, but even tighter now that there’s only 17 of us.”
Led by sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who had 34 saves Friday night, the Crimson held BU scoreless until the final five minutes of play.
“[The defense] did a really good job of moving the puck quickly and pushing the pace,” D’Oench said. “Emerance came up big for us, giving us confidence from the back. From the net to the defense to the forwards, everyone was playing with confidence and that helped us win. We’re a very young team, but a lot of the younger kids have really stepped up and are playing like veterans even though they’re not.”
Looking forward, the Crimson hope to use the momentum gained in the early stages of the season to continue to progress and improve.
“A huge focus for us right now going into our game every week is playing three full periods,” Gedman said. “The full 60 minutes. It’s really hard to go out and keep that high pace like we had in the first period. That’s a huge focus for our team and that’s always something we can improve. We’re not worried about it, but it’s definitely something we’re thinking about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As he made his way into the muddy final stretch of Saturday’s 10k race, senior Maksim Korolev found himself sitting comfortably in third place. First place was likely out of reach, but with his tried-and-true finishing kick at his disposal, the second-place runner was within striking distance.
For supporters of the Harvard cross country team, this was a remarkably familiar scene. In each of the squad’s last three meets, the veteran from Harrisonville, Mo.  had captured either first or second place.
But this race was different.
It was the final stretch of the NCAA Championships, and Korolev was chasing the defending national champion, Kennedy Kithuka of Texas Tech. The gap between Korolev and Kithuka was shrinking with each stride as the duo approached the finish line, with the clock ticking up to 30 minutes.
In the end, Korolev simply ran out of room to catch the defending national champion, falling just 0.4 seconds short of being the national runner-up.
Despite the half-second loss, Korolev etched his name in the record books, becoming the first runner in Harvard history to finish in the top three places at Nationals. His performance marked the highest Ivy finish on the men’s side since 1945, and just the third time that a men’s Ancient Eight competitor cracked the top three.
Korolev covered the muddy 10k course in Terre Haute, Ind. in 29:59.5—roughly 18 seconds behind Oregon freshman Edward Cheserek, who put on a dominant display to upset the heavily-favored Kithuka.
The Crimson men’s team, which qualified for Nationals for the first time since 1979, racked up 678 team points to take home 30th place of the 31 teams competing. Behind the standout performance from Korolev, Harvard’s remaining runners found themselves in the bottom half of the field.
Junior Will Geiken was the team’s second runner, earning 182nd place. Sophomore Tom Purnell (198th), junior Adam Cotton (208th), and senior Kurt Ruegg (227th) rounded out the scoring runners for the Crimson men.
“It was a great experience for those guys,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Obviously, the conditions were less than ideal, and it’s unlike any other race we’ve been to.... But I thought we gained a lot of experience from it, and there’s a real hunger to get back [to Nationals] and cement this program as a national-caliber program.”
After battling a leg injury for the past month, co-captain James Leakos, who kicked off the year by topping Korolev to win the Harvard-Yale meet, competed in the race but could not to overcome the injury.
Leakos was able to cross the finish line, but he did so in an uncharacteristically slow 36:39.7.
“The leg wasn’t cooperative, and he really struggled,” Saretsky said. “But I was incredibly proud of him for finishing.”
In the first 3000 meters of the race, Korolev positioned himself in the lead pack that consisted of about 10 runners. Due to the harsh racing conditions, the veteran tried to stick with the group and let the other competitors battle the wind for him. But his 6’4” frame didn’t do him any favors.
“It was incredibly muddy, windy, and cold out there, and I think that got to a lot of people,” Korolev said. “I remember thinking at one point, ‘Wow, I can see over all of these guys,’ but I still tried to draft.”
“One of the main things is going out there and being patient, letting the race unfold,” Saretsky said of Korolev’s strategy. “I thought he did an excellent job of…executing the plan.”
The large lead pack remained mostly in tact until just before the 5k mark, when Kithuka picked up the pace, daring the other runners to stay with him. Only Cheserek kept up with the defending champion, which left Korolev racing with NC State’s Andrew Colley.
“I just gauged the situation, and I felt like [going with Kithuka] would have pushed me over the edge a little bit.” Korolev said. “I was happy with where I was in the top five, so I decided to be a little more conservative about it, rather than do something crazy.”
When Colley started to fall back, Korolev found himself in third place, in what he called “no man’s land.” Kithuka and Cheserek were well ahead of the senior, and a large pack had formed about 10 seconds behind him.
Though the pack made ground on him between the 8k and 9k marks, Korolev picked up the pace in the final 500 meters, hoping to keep his position as the top American runner in the race.
That’s when he saw Kithuka, who had yet to lose a race in his collegiate career, in his sights.
“I just tried to make as big of a kick as I could to keep my place,” Korolev said. “That’s probably what kept me from second [place], is that I was thinking of staying in third instead of going for second…. With 100 meters to go, I definitely felt like I was reeling [Kithuka] in, but it was just too late.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They may call it The Game, but it didn’t seem like much of one on Saturday.
Harvard held a 28-0 lead at halftime. Moving the ball at will for the majority of the contest, the Crimson ended with 425 total yards of offense. And when the scoreboard read Harvard 34, Yale 7 as the clock ticked down to zero, the Crimson faithful officially made the Yale Bowl its own by storming the field.
The sight of Harvard fans celebrating with their victorious players has been a familiar one in recent years. Twelve of the last 13 matchups have gone the Crimson’s way against its archrivals, including seven straight.
This Saturday, the Yale Bowl once again belonged to Harvard.
By the start of the fourth quarter, much of the Yale student section had already left. The Crimson’s flurry of first half scoring—including four touchdowns from sophomore running back Paul Stanton on as many possessions—silenced the early shouts from Bulldogs fans.
The Harvard crowd, on the other hand, stayed in force. Admittedly, there was nowhere else they could really go. But the contrast of a boisterous mass of Crimson on one side of the stadium with a subdued, Bulldog-blue section directly opposite perfectly captured the reality: in recent years, what was once a rivalry has been anything but.
In 2012, it took until the latter stages of the fourth quarter for Harvard to seize control. But one year later, the Crimson’s dominance was made clear as soon as the two squads took the field. Before finally removing its foot from the gas pedal by turning largely to the running game, Harvard scored points on five of its first six possessions.
Indeed, the knockout blows came early. And it was Stanton who delivered a flurry of them—four, to be exact. Before the first half had ended—before the Crimson had even failed to convert a third down—the sophomore had tied the individual record in a Harvard-Yale game with four touchdowns.
Stanton got the scoring started on the Crimson’s first possession of the game. Taking a handoff to the left side, he cut straight back up the field and dashed untouched for the 29-yard score.
The very next possession with the ball on the Yale 21-yard line, Stanton received a screen pass from junior quarterback Conner Hempel and galloped up the sideline into the end zone, essentially untouched once again. Stanton’s third touchdown came on a nearly identical play; when Yale sent a blitz, the running back caught another short screen and weaved his way for an 18-yard score.
Despite putting up three touchdowns on his team’s opening three drives, Stanton was not yet satisfied. On Harvard’s next possession, he capped a 79-yard drive by diving into the end zone on second-and-goal. While entering the history books, Stanton had simultaneously transformed The Game into an early rout.
The young sophomore’s performance indicated that while history was on the Crimson’s side in the Harvard-Yale matchup, so was the present. After the game, Harvard coach Tim Murphy said that his team’s recent dominance in the annual showdown was “statistically unsustainable.” He may be right—but only statistically speaking.
Nothing else seems to indicate that Harvard’s run at the top of the Ivy League—and its taming of its biggest rivals—will end anytime soon.
It’s been repeated time and again, but still maybe not enough: last year, the Crimson graduated the All-Ivy Player of the Year at quarterback, a tight end now playing in the NFL, and one of the best running backs in program history. In addition, this year’s squad was racked with injuries to its key players all season long. Starters were leaving the field nearly every single week. When a player would finally come back, it seemed as if another would instantly go down.
With gaping holes in its offense and a rotating group of starters on both sides of the ball, the Crimson could have rolled over and settled for an average 2013 campaign. Instead, Harvard battled to a 9-1 record—one play away from an undefeated season—and earned a share of the Ivy League Championship on Saturday when first-place Princeton fell to Dartmouth.
For Harvard, when it comes down to it, it’s not the players who matter the most. It’s the system. Under Murphy’s direction, the Crimson has produced first-rate results year in and year out. Yes, Yale will improve in the coming seasons. An abundance of young talent playing under coach Tony Reno gained significant experience this year that will pay off going forward. But the past decade, the present, and the near future are all on Harvard’s side.
The theme of the week for the Crimson was to “expect the unexpected” from Yale. The Bulldogs would be entering the showdown fired up and, in all likelihood, would debut a variety of new offensive and defensive sets designed to throw their opponents off guard.
But for Harvard, it may be more apt to simply “expect the expected.” In recent years, no matter who’s on the field and no matter the setbacks along the way, the Crimson always finds its way to success. Accordingly, The Game, the rivalry, and the Yale Bowl itself all belong to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last two weeks, Columbia and Penn scored zero points on the Harvard football defense in the first half of each respective game. The Crimson’s offense, on the other hand, posted 21 and 31 points, respectively, in those halves.
On Saturday, the first half of football looked remarkably similar to the previous two contests, with Harvard’s defense posting a shutout against Yale while the offense lit up the scoreboard with 28 points. Unlike last Saturday’s thriller against the Quakers, Harvard (9-1, 7-1, Ivy) won the 130th playing of The Game handily, downing Yale (5-5, 3-4), 34-7.
“We started the Penn game just like that, but for a bunch of different reasons, lost our focus, so I thought it was a great reaction for our football team to jump out like that and get the momentum back,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
The Crimson offense, which converted five of its six first-half third downs, executed with surgical efficiency, reaching the end zone on every drive except the last one before halftime, when punter David Bicknell kicked it away with 19 seconds remaining.
Harvard’s 298 offensive yards heading into halftime were nearly double Yale’s output of 174 yards, and the Bulldogs offense, which struggled to put together cohesive drives, did not cross midfield until the second quarter.
On that drive, Yale couldn’t convert a successful drive into points. The Bulldogs reached the red zone, but sophomore linebacker Matt Koran wrapped up Yale running back Kahlil Keys in the backfield on a third down, forcing Reno’s squad to kick a 38-yard field goal. Kyle Cazzetta’s kick missed just wide left, leaving the Bulldogs scoreless.
“We didn’t convert on third downs,” Yale coach Tony Reno said. “We were one of 10 for third downs in the first half, and you’re not going to win football games when you don’t convert third downs.”
Yale’s second drive of the game seemed promising when Bulldogs quarterback Henry Furman hit a streaking Candler Rich for a 15-yard pass that would have put Yale in Harvard territory, but junior safety Norman Hayes knocked the ball loose, and senior cornerback DJ Monroe jumped on it. The Crimson would score on the ensuing drive to extend its lead to 14.
“We had a key third down converted, ball at midfield, momentum going our way a little bit in that drive, and we gave the ball back,” Reno said. “That’s kind of been [a theme] in our losses all year.”
FINAL STANT-ZA
Every Harvard scoring drive of the first half had one thing in common—each ended with sophomore running back Paul Stanton barreling into the end zone for a score.
The four touchdowns that Stanton tallied, all of which came before halftime, tied the record for the most by any player in The Game.
“This was my first four-touchdown game,” Stanton said. “In high school, I had three a couple of times, but I don’t think four. It was a huge game to play in—the last game with a lot of the seniors that I love, and to be able to go out there and play my best is awesome.”
The sophomore ran the ball seemingly at will in the first half, averaging 6.5 yards per carry. Stanton ended the half with 91 yards rushing and 39 yards receiving. Scrambling out of the pocket one time, junior quarterback Conner Hempel dumped the ball off to Stanton, who ran 25 yards untouched into the end zone to make the lead 14 points.
The following Crimson drive ended nearly identically, with Hempel finding Stanton on a short pass, and this time Stanton sprinted 21 yards for the score.
DON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK
When Yale came out of halftime and scored on its first drive to finally get onto the scoreboard, Murphy might have been thinking to last week’s Penn game. The Crimson was up 38-0 before the Quakers scored 31 unanswered points to nearly pull off the greatest comeback in football history.
But the Harvard defense made sure that this game would not be a repeat performance.
“It all starts with defense,” Murphy said. “Yale’s a really good offensive football team, and it was really one of the outstanding defensive efforts we’ve had in a long, long time. I think that set the stage for the game.”
Down by 24 early in the fourth quarter, Furman and company were driving into Harvard territory when the veteran Crimson defensive corps intervened. Senior Brian Owusu broke up a pass intended for Myles Gaines on third down, and on the following play, senior safety Chris Splinter picked off Furman’s ball, effectively quashing any hope of a Bulldogs comeback.

The prospect of heading home for Thanksgiving is making us all giddy with excitement. The food, the friends, the relaxation, oh my! Here are five stages you may experience during your time at home; hopefully things won’t go any worse.
1. EcstasyYou are ready to do all the things and eat all the food. You can’t believe how amazing your bed feels and how great it is to be back in your old room; but what were you thinking when you bought that old poster? Yikes. Still, you’re so happy to be home, in the fold of sympathetic and pampering parents who coddle you endlessly. Between catching up with your friends and speed-shopping with your mother, you’ve had an exhaustingly great start to the holiday.
2. Quiet & ContentYour day has slowly dissolved to a long lunch with your parents and maybe a power nap after hanging out with too many friends—or none at all depending on your caffeine levels. You’ve realized that you no longer have enough energy, and the cliff of sleep deprivation is becoming menacingly real.
3. Couch PotatoYou’ve happily ensconced yourself in front of the TV after Thanksgiving dinner, catching up on all the shows you’ve missed throughout the semester. Who knew these things still existed? After being quizzed and queried by several of your relatives, including that one well-meaning but incessantly annoying aunt you definitely have, you deserve some brainless wild partying in front of the TV.
4. Sappy SallyYou’ve refused to leave your room for anything but leftovers and have had a tired, possibly sobby heart-to-heart with your mom. Nothing can soothe those emotional and psychological bruises better than some good ol’ mothering.
5. Return of the KingYou’ve slept for more than 12 hours and your parents have finally stopped nagging you to try to recount the events of the past three months in these three days. You’ve reached a happy impasse, where you are almost pre-nostalgic for home again, even though you have one more day left. At the same time, you find yourself longing for the red brick and chaos of campus. Heck, you even find yourself fondly remembering your time on the Quad shuttle!

With classmates leaving campus en masse and holiday cheer leaving you homesick, staying on campus during Thanksgiving break may not seem like the most enticing option. But don’t fret—there are lots of ways to have fun during break that don't involve leaving the Boston area.

On Campus
Except for on Thanksgiving Day, you can go visit any of Harvard’s museums. At the Museum of Natural History, literature buffs can seek out "Thoreau’s Maine Woods: A Journey in Photographs with Scot Miller," featuring photographs of Maine accompanied by excerpts from the seminal American author.
 
You can also check out the Peabody Museum’s "Translating Encounters," which profiles responses of groups across the globe to the Age of Exploration in the early seventeenth century, or for a more modern event, head to a seminar by OEB professor Kaare H. Jensen at Dean Donald H. Pfister’s beloved Herbaria at noon on Nov. 28.
 
In the Square
For students with some extra spending money, several restaurants in the Square are serving Thanksgiving dinner this week. Uno Chicago Grill will be open for at least part of Thanksgiving Day and should provide a respite from the usual Tasty Burger and Noch’s. More upscale dining options include Rialto’s three-course Thanksgiving dinner Thursday evening and UpStairs on the Square, which will feature both vegan and traditional Thanksgiving feasts on Thursday afternoon and evening.
 
Boston and Beyond 
With no classes and little urgent homework, you have zero excuses not to get out of the Harvard bubble. In addition to the usual options like walking the Freedom Trail or visiting museums in the city (any day except Thursday, that is), you could try to get a ticket to one of the Boston Ballet’s annual performances of "The Nutcracker," which opens on Friday, or go ice skating at Frog Pond. Students get half-off admission on Tuesdays from 6 p.m. - 9 p.m., paying only $2 with a college ID.
 
Your best option, however, would be to experience Thanksgiving where it happened in the first place: Plymouth. Plimoth Plantation, a living museum of the original settlement of the Pilgrims, will be open on Thanksgiving Day and is accessible by Commuter Rail or bus.
