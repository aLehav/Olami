After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I wonder if words are ever enough.
After reading and writing religiously for The Crimson for the past two years, I’ve struggled sometimes to remember why I wear this habit like a second skin when it often feels ill-fitted. Why do we—I—continue writing? Why do we insist on preaching the Harvard experience knowing that once the words and passion trickle from our fingertips, they are held by only a handful of eyes, are given perhaps a fleeting consideration before quickly turning to the next hot take? Why write and invite change, only to be swiftly forgotten?
Students have valiantly attempted to pen their opinions and suggestions on these pages for just over a century now. Every day of the academic year, voices from all throughout the University call for changes in regulation and reproach, in culture and in understanding. Our communication with the University and its affiliates is omnipresent; yet, it is often one-sided.
Outpourings of opinions and concern seem to fall on deaf ears, time and time again. Requests for transparency on the selection process and requirements of Institute of Politics fellowships for some such as Ed Gillespie or Corey Lewandowski, for example, were largely ignored. Confusion about the rescinding of Chelsea Manning’s IOP fellowship and the rejection of Michelle Jones, prompting further dialogue from the administration, was never clarified. Demands for an explanation of the role Harvard University Health Services and the Harvard University Police Department play on campus following the tragic beating of a black undergraduate student by the Cambridge Police Department this past April are probably tacked somewhere on the agenda list of yet another committee, pending a response in maybe a couple of months (if we’re lucky).
Even more personal narratives have sparked short-lived conversation but not change. Accusations of racism towards students, even when they are seeking mental health treatment, have blithely slipped by without public University comment. Heart-wrenching accounts of sexual assault pointing to the need for rape kits on campus or for a revamping of the no-contact order process so a victim does not constantly run into their assailant have been insufficiently responded to, for almost 20 years since these issues were first brought to light. Suicide attempts have been painfully recounted within these pages without any real response from the administration.
It’s not that every single piece of opinion writing that this newspaper produces should be met with an immediate agreeance and tangible repercussions. On the contrary: Many of these pieces simply compliment steps in the right direction or call for further nuance in campus considerations. Those articles don’t necessarily call for any response from the University, and absolute compliance to every opinion would be rash and foolhardy at best. But for voices on these pages, laden with pain and fatigue, to echo each other for at times decades without even a mere acknowledgement—that is not only tiring, but unacceptable.
After a while, writing about these experiences seems like shouting into the void.
There are some important victories to note—however far and few between they may be. Students who have been proposing the need for an Ethnic Studies department for the past 45 years (and writing about it here for at least the past 24), for instance, have finally secured a track within another concentration. That’s progress, of some sorts. Moreover, the pre-orientation bridge program for low-income and first-generation students is starting up this fall due in part to opinion writing. After initially being rejected, students took to voicing their concerns, and administrators even wrote their own opinion pieces to respond to these positions. Both perspectives were acknowledged, considered, and given equal thought after being written about. Students continued to work tireless towards realizing these opinions. Today, we have a bridge program.
Rare moments like these remind me we why continue to write. The slight chance that the administration recognizes our opinions and concerns reminds us to continue amplifying campus opinions in thorough, well-thought out articles. It reminds us to keep a thumb on the pulse of campus culture, to weigh each argument carefully, and to cull all the facts together for a sharp critique. It reminds us that sometimes, these words resonate with others, that they call attention to problems plaguing students or the University. That sometimes, these words are remembered, galvanize action, and lead to change.
So here I am. Writing yet another column (hoping I don’t cringe reading it later). Throwing yet another opinion into the void like a tree falling in a forest, hoping the sound reverberates. Hoping you can hear it too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to relieve some of its debt, Harvard Medical School has sold part of its property at 4 Blackfan Circle to Intercontinental Real Estate Firm, a Boston-based company, the school announced in an emailed statement Wednesday.
The building, which is mostly dedicated to research, has been on the market for six months. During the sale process, at least a dozen firms submitted bids, Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said in April.
The school sold eight of the building’s 11 floors, which comprise about 192,140 square feet, mostly of research space.
“The recent sale presents valuable opportunities and funding that will enable us to thoughtfully upgrade and consolidate the campus infrastructure and further invest in our research and education mission,” the statement reads. “Harvard Medical School programs will maintain a presence in the building.”
Manon Palandijan, a spokesperson for Intercontinental, wrote in an email that the building’s location made it an attractive business venture.
“We decided to purchase 4 Blackfan because it presented an extremely rare opportunity to acquire a first-class institutionally occupied life science facility in one of the most highly regarded lab markets, the LMA,” she wrote.
The company is not planning any immediate changes to how the building will be operated or managed, according to Palandijan.
Palandijan declined to comment on the building’s sale price.
The Medical School chose to sell 4 Blackfan Circle as part of an attempt to address its long-standing financial difficulties, some of which stem from the construction of the New Research Building adjacent to 4 Blackfan Circle. The school has run a budget deficit in nine of the last 10 fiscal years.
In a statement last month, Medical School Chief Financial Officer Michael White mentioned the “strategic decision” to sell the building as one of several measures the school’s administration is taking to improve its financial situation.
He also pointed to “position control to better control personnel costs and broad restructuring of major school contracts,” and the school’s successful capital campaign, which has raised $773 million as of May 31, according to the school’s website.

Decorated with furniture the founders built by hand, Black Sheep Bagel Cafe opened in the Square last weekend.
The mom and pop breakfast and lunch cafe, located on 56 John F. Kennedy St., offers 18 bagel varieties, a number of sandwiches and drinks, and a full espresso bar.
Co-founder Manny Ramirez said that he was surprised at the influx of customers during the establishment’s first few days.
“We’ve been busier than we thought we’d be in the beginning,” Ramirez said. “We knew we’d get there eventually, but it happened so fast—we’re wholly on board, and we’re really excited about it.”
Co-founder Shoshanah Garber said Black Sheep Bagel Cafe is offering a student discount, as well as a Harvard Square employees discount.
“Part of our mission is to support our local business community and all of our neighbors, and really be a neighborhood go-to spot,” Garber said.
Garber and Ramirez came up with the idea for a cafe six months ago, after they perceived a lack of options for people who wanted to get bagels in the Square.
After finding a storefront they liked, Garber and Ramirez began painting the walls, constructing tables, and laying out the patio area.
Ramirez said they had envisioned a cafe with a “modern, industrial” design and a “cozy” ambiance, noting the pillows on some of the seats and the plants on a shelf on the wall.
Garber said that remodeling the storefront by hand was “very important” to their vision for Black Sheep Bagels.
“We wanted to be totally unique,” Garber said. “You’re not going to see any other restaurants look like this.”
Ramirez said that another one of the unique aspects of Black Sheep Bagel Cafe was its large menu, noting that other cafes often only offer a limited selection of bagels.
Garber said that they hope the establishment’s large menu will encourage people to stay to eat after they receive their food.
“We don’t want to have people make multiple stops,” Garber said. “We want people to be able to get in here, get their bagel and coffee—anything that they would need—and be able to stay and hang out and enjoy the space, as opposed to grabbing a bagel and going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s internal research office concluded the College’s admissions policies produce “negative effects” for Asian Americans in a series of confidential reports circulated among top administrators in 2013, according to court documents filed early Friday morning in an ongoing lawsuit against the University.
In the reports, which were never made public, Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research also concluded the College’s admissions process advantages legacy students and athletes more than it does low-income students.
In one 2013 report, OIR employees wrote that “Asian high achievers have lower rates of admission.” In others, OIR found that Asian American applicants earned consistently lower "personal" ratings from Harvard admissions officers than did applicants of other races despite earning consistently higher rankings for their academic records and tests scores. 
Both Harvard and advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions  provided accounts of the institutional review—as well as hundreds of pages of other information related to Harvard’s admissions process—in court filings over the course of the day Friday. The University and SFFA filed the documents as part of SFFA’s ongoing lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process.
SFFA pointed to the OIR reports as evidence supporting its discrimination charges—charges Harvard has repeatedly denied. Edward Blum, president of SFFA, wrote in an emailed statement that “today’s court filing exposes the startling magnitude of Harvard’s discrimination against Asian applicants.”
In its own filings, Harvard strongly contested SFFA’s version of events and called the internal review inconclusive and incomplete.
“SFFA will point to documents prepared by individuals in Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research, which in SFFA’s view suggest that Asian-American applicants were disadvantaged in the admissions process,” Harvard lawyers wrote. “But the analysis in those documents was not designed to evaluate whether Harvard was intentionally discriminating and reached no such conclusion.”
The lawyers further wrote the OIR analysis was “incomplete, preliminary, and based on limited inputs.” The analysis did not control for unspecified vital information Harvard uses to evaluate applicants, the lawyers wrote. Models that account for the “full range of observable information” considered during Harvard’s admissions process show “no negative effect” for Asian Americans during the admissions process, the lawyers noted.
The office’s analyses formed part of broader study modeling the roles various factors—including gender and socioeconomic status—play in the College’s admissions procedures.
SFFA in its filings stated that Robert Iuliano, Harvard’s general counsel, requested the OIR review around late 2012 partly in response to allegations made by Harvard alumnus Ron K. Unz ’83 that Harvard displayed “an anti-Asian admissions bias." But Harvard spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that this account of events is untrue.
"Harvard's Office of General Counsel did not request any of the three Office of Institutional Research (OIR) reports referenced in and attached to SFFA's filings," Cowenhoven wrote.
Between Dec. 29, 2012 and Feb. 12, 2013, members of OIR and the Admissions Office exchanged over 100 emails as the office gathered information on the College’s admissions procedures, according to court filings.
High-up Harvard administrators reviewed the OIR findings, according to court filings. On separate occasions, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, and senior members of the Admissions Office all examined the reports.
But the report itself argues against sharing its findings with the public.
“We imagine that sharing any analysis of admission weights will draw attention to the variety of factors that compete with one another in the admission process,” one of the OIR reports reads.“While we find that low income students clearly receive a ‘tip’ in the admissions process, our descriptive analysis and regression models also shows that the tip for legacies and athletes is larger and that there are demographic groups that have negative effects.”
The only demographic group which saw “negative effects” were Asian Americans, according to the OIR analyses.
Following a period of information gathering in late 2012 and early 2013, OIR wrote a report titled “Admissions and Financial at Harvard College.” In addition to examining issues of gender and early action admissions, the report was specifically meant to address the question: “Does the admissions process disadvantage Asians?”
Using 10 years of admissions demographic data and logistic regression models, OIR created a model that estimated the probability of admission for individuals based on certain characteristics.
This model included estimated demographic breakdowns of classes admitted given different weighting of various characteristics used to evaluate applicants. One of the breakdowns considered the demographics of a class that would be admitted if Harvard judged only by rankings and ratings of academics success.
Under this scenario, “the percentage of Asians would more than double to 43 percent,” according to SFFA’s Friday filings. SFFA’s document alleges representatives from OIR met with Fitzsimmons to present its findings and that Fitzsimmons took little—if any—further action to address the report.
“Following this presentation, Dean Fitzsimmons did not request any additional work from OIR into whether Asian-American applicants were being disadvantaged in response to the February 2013 Report,” the document states. “Dean Fitzsimmons did not share or discuss the February 2013 Report with anyone else in the Admissions Office or any senior leaders outside the Admissions Office.”
In early 2013, following the first report, OIR produced a second document titled “Admissions Part II” which specifically focused on differences in admission rates between Asian American and white applicants. The report solely compared admissions rates for “non-legacy, non-athlete” students.
The report found that Asian American applicants performed significantly better in rankings of test scores, academics, and overall scores from alumni interviews. Of 10 characteristics, white students performed significantly better in only one—rankings of personal qualities, which are assigned by the Admissions Office.
The report also found that, for students with comparable academic rankings or SAT scores, white students were generally admitted at higher rates than were Asian American students. The second report was also presented to Fitzsimmons and also spurred little further action, according to the SFFA filings.
A third OIR report—commissioned to gauge how low-income students fare in the admissions process—found a slight negative association between being Asian American and earning a spot at the College.
Ten days after taking office as Dean of the College on July 1, 2014, Rakesh Khurana met with four representatives from the OIR to discuss the three reports, according to the filings.
In previous court testimony reported in the filings, Khurana and other top Harvard officials questioned the validity of the OIR findings.
Khurana recalled thinking about “a lot of limitations to what are called fitted models like this” that led him to believe the analysis was not “done appropriately,” according to court testimony. SFFA filings state Khurana “took no steps to find out why OIR prepared these reports” nor did he “determine how the analysis could be done more ‘appropriately’” or pursue further investigation into the OIR’s findings.
Faust similarly questioned the legitimacy of the OIR reports in court testimony, testifying the documents were “preliminary, for discussion.”
“So I would say this is an exercise,” Faust testified. “I would not give it more credibility than being an exercise.”
Current and former OIR employees who completed analysis for the reports gave widely varying recollections of their involvement in the department’s work during court testimony.
Erin Driver-Linn and Erica Bever, who worked on the reports, said they recalled very little about their involvement producing the reviews “despite numerous emails and drafts documenting” their participation in the process, according to filings.
Bever did not recall ever completing such analysis and drew “a complete blank on this particular topic,” while Driver-Linn said she did not know whether the OIR was asked to complete such an investigation. However, each criticized the validity of the reports’ conclusions, with Bever stating they “oversimplified” Harvard admissions and Driver-Linn calling them “reductive.”
But one former Harvard employee, Mark Hansen, said he recalled working on the OIR’s investigation into potential racial bias and said he believes the reports comprise “evidence that Asians are disadvantaged in the admissions process at Harvard.”
Fitzsimmons recalled “how incomplete the analysis was” because it lacked certain data from the admissions office, according to his testimony. He asserted that Harvard “would always be vigilant about any suggestion of discrimination against any person” and confirmed that he believed his decision to neither discuss the conclusions of these reports with others in his office nor  follow up with the OIR was consistent with this stance.
Update: June 16, 2018
This article has been updated to reflect the fact that Harvard contests Students for Fair Admissions' allegation that the University's Office of General Counsel requested the Office of Institutional Research's examination of the College's admissions process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just as Yale took The Game this year, so too did it take The Race.
In the 153rd racing of the Harvard-Yale regatta, the No. 1 ranked Bulldog heavyweight crew took the first varsity, second varsity, and combination races over the No. 4 ranked Crimson. The wins by Yale served as a victory lap of its national championship victory the previous weekend, in which the Bulldogs finished in 6:01.648. Harvard finished fourth in that race but did manage to take silver in the third varsity of the IRAs.
The regatta has deep roots in American history as the longest standing collegiate competition in the country. The two teams congregated on the Thames River in Connecticut for an exciting weekend of racing. But as Yale would prove, the competition was lopsided.
In the first varsity race, Yale eight, stroked by senior Sholto Carnegie pulled away early and finished seven seconds ahead of Harvard in 18:51.06 compared to the Crimson’s 18:58.10 finish in the four mile race, a distance longer than usual dual season and championships racing.
The story was much the same in the second varsity race, a three mile affair, in which the Bulldogs held off a late Harvard surge to finish five seconds ahead in 13:53.23.
Harvard was able to scavenge a victory in the third varsity, as senior Dominic Glover in the stroke seat helped lead the boat to a three second margin of victory in 9:08.41.
Yale would also take the combination race also in 9:23.2 to Harvard’s 9:27.7, giving the Bulldogs the privilege to paint a “Y” on the rocks near the finish line.
Harvard still maintains a 95-57 advantage in the accumulated iterations of The Race.
