After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rick Santorum is not your average 2012 Republican presidential candidate. In journalist Michael Gerson’s words, “He talks not only of the rights of the individual but also of the health of social institutions, particularly the family.” In a field of candidates who want government out of our lives as much as possible, Santorum alone speaks positively of how he wants to utilize government. For Santorum, who has framed himself as the pro-family candidate, government serves an important role in preserving families because, as he says, “Without strong families, we cannot have a strong and vibrant nation.”
But are Santorum’s policies really pro-family? Let’s take a look.
Santorum opposes same-sex marriage, going so far as to say he would consider all current same-sex marriages invalid if elected. The reason? Santorum says sodomy is “antithetical to a healthy, stable, and traditional family.”
Perhaps Santorum doesn’t understand the consequences of banning same-sex marriage. For all of the conservative doomsday warnings that same-sex marriage will undermine the traditional family, single-sex marriage soldiers onward in New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, and Vermont. False alarm?
Santorum says that “the future of…society” requires “children” and “monogamous relationships.” Apparently, he doesn’t realize that children and monogamous relationships are perfectly compatible with homosexuality and same-sex marriage. In fact, an estimated one quarter of all monogamous gay couples around the nation are raising more than 250,000 healthy, happy, and normal kids right now. How many more stable homosexual relationships, capable of providing a loving home to children who would otherwise lack one, would materialize if Americans allowed gays to seal their relationships with the bonds of marriage?
But Santorum’s opposition to homosexual behavior and marriage and his idea of their consequences were not born of a dispassionate review of the facts. His views flow, instead, from his devout Catholic faith. How do I know this? Well, I went to a Catholic high school myself, and I recognize the Church’s doctrine on homosexuality when I hear it. That’s why I can believe Santorum is being honest when he says, “I have nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who’s homosexual” and then immediately adds, “the question is, do you act on those [homosexual] orientations?”
Sounds a lot like the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which affirms both that homosexuals “must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity” and that “homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.” For Santorum and the Church, homosexuality is a difficult “trial” of the will, in which one must resist sinful temptation. So facts about same-sex marriage don’t really matter here to Santorum; it’s a matter of faith. Kids who need stable families be darned.
Santorum also supports tripling the child tax deduction to $3000. How does a man who spearheaded welfare reform in 1996, an attempt to break the cycle of dependency and poverty, think indiscriminately rewarding people for having children--including the poor, young, and unmarried--is a good way to promote healthy and stable families?
The child tax deduction’s intent to help ease the cost of caring for children and thereby strengthen families is admirable and makes it politically popular, but the method may be counterproductive for poorer Americans because it reduces the perceived cost of pregnancy, and a shaky financial situation is not a stable foundation for a strong family. Obviously the credit isn’t responsible for the structural decline of marriage in America, but it’s nonetheless irresponsible public policy to dangle $3000 as a reward for having a child in front of someone who makes less than $10,000 a year.
A better way to strengthen American families, without the side effect of making children seem less costly to those who aren’t ready for them, is to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, a federal wage subsidy for the working poor. The EITC is one of the most effective weapons for combating poverty. Conservatives (other than those who support indiscriminately gutting discretionary spending) are happy because it is a powerful incentive to work--higher after-tax wages mean working becomes relatively more profitable than staying on the dole--and because, unlike the minimum wage, it doesn’t increase unemployment. Liberals are happy because the EITC lifts the stagnant wages of the working poor. And because it is aimed at workers instead of parents, it stabilizes the budgets of all members of the working poor without incentivizing irresponsible pregnancies.
Liberals are sometimes too quick to dismiss conservatives who praise the family unit. Santorum is right that families are “the fabric of our society.” But if we truly want stable relationships and healthy children, banning same-sex marriage and tripling the child tax credit are exactly the wrong way to go about it. Santorum can call himself a “champion of…families” all he wants, but it doesn’t make him one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an almost surreal turn of events, Harvard is currently being investigated for discrimination by the U.S. Department of Education after a rejected Asian-American applicant alleged last August that his or her race played an undue role in the rejection. Making such a claim in the first place smacks of hubris—it is difficult to argue that any applicant definitely deserved to have gotten into Harvard, no matter how good his or her SAT scores or impressive his or her extracurriculars. Amazingly qualified applicants get rejected from Harvard all the time, making it almost impossible for this student to prove that it was his race, instead of any other factor, which resulted in his not being admitted. But while the student's individual case may be impossible to prove, it is likely that overall, Asians are rarely the beneficiaries of race-based affirmative action. Yet this particular case bears no evidence of undue discrimination and can at the most be considered a necessary consequence of race-based affirmative action, which is ultimately a good admissions policy.
To begin, the Supreme Court has already approved affirmative action systems similar to Harvard's in the case Bakke v. California, wherein the court ruled that holistic approaches to admissions, like Harvard's, which took into account race alongside many other factors was acceptable, while racial quotas were not. In reviewing applications to Harvard, admission officers strive to find applicants who not only contribute their intellectual talents to the University, but also their diverse experiences. One of the ways such diversity of background can be found is in racial diversity.
It is furthermore unclear that affirmative action is unduly harming those of Asian descent at Harvard, and in fact the evidence indicates otherwise. For comparison, the University of California system had no affirmative action policy of any kind in 2008 and 40 percent of the student body was Asian, when Asians made up 12 percent of the population of California as a whole. This statistic means that absent affirmative action Asians were about three times more prevalent in the UC system than they were in California as a whole. The U.S., the country Harvard overwhelmingly relies on for its undergraduate class, is a little under five percent Asian, but Harvard's student body is 17 percent Asian, meaning that the proportion of Asian Americans at Harvard is roughly three times greater than in the U.S. as a whole—indicating that affirmative action is not resulting in far fewer Asians being admitted than there would be otherwise. While the racial makeup of Harvard’s applicant pool is not released, making it impossible to say for sure how race affects admissions, it would certainly appear that Asians are by no means being singled out by affirmative action.
When judging a student's accomplishments, admission officers ought to look not only at what students have done, but also what they have done with the opportunities afforded to them. Achieving despite one's circumstances is better proof of one’s talents than succeeding because of them. A student in a high-powered private high school who has taken four AP tests may look more impressive than another from a public high school who has only taken three, unless one takes into account the fact that the first student took a few of the many AP classes their school offered while the second had to study on his own because no such classes were available to him.
Taking into account individual situations helps admission officers judge a student’s abilities accurately. Along these lines we believe admissions officers ought to recognize that there are many racial groups which are significantly less privileged in America at large, so it makes sense to give them a slight advantage in admissions to make up for this fact. Without such an advantage to cancel out the relative lack of opportunities that they face, well-qualified minority students who only appear less impressive on paper could easily face rejection due to the exigencies of their race. It would be a tragedy if a single misguided lawsuit were allowed to destroy a progressive University policy that is necessary to ensuring true fairness in Harvard's admissions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Considering Mitt Romney’s comparative lack of deference to Donald Trump earlier in the campaign, it may come as a surprise that last week Trump deigned to anoint Romney with his blessing for the Republican nomination. In the 24 hours before the announcement, rumors had surfaced that Trump would throw his weight behind Newt Gingrich.  Yet it was Romney, not Gingrich, who appeared with Trump at a press conference in Las   Vegas. The newfound political relationship between Romney and Trump offers a glimpse into the likely shape of the campaign against incumbent President Barack Obama.   The attacks against the president’s policy agenda will be overshadowed by tacitly racist attempts to undermine the president’s authenticity as an American.
Unfortunately, both Trump and Romney have emphasized Obama’s ethnic and racial background. Trump single-handedly turned himself into a political figure by feeding baseless fears about the President’s supposed Kenyan birth.  Similarly, the Romney campaign has made it a point to stoke the flames of suspicion about the President’s supposed lack of American authenticity. At a rally in Las Vegas last week, Romney accused Obama of not “feeling…this American spirit” that “we share.” He said that Obama is intent on “poisoning the spirit of America” and “replacing ambition with envy.” Such accusations serve as a dog-whistle aimed at those whose xenophobia and, yes, racism, has led them to be suspicious of the President not just for his policies but also for his identity.  The likes of Romney and Trump have sought to both further and benefit from the American right’s vestigial racism.
The right wing of the Republican Party’s reliance on racial fear to excite its base has deep, well-documented roots. In 1968, the Nixon campaign sought to capitalize on the Democrats’ decision to go all-in on civil rights by launching the now-infamous “Southern Strategy.” This strategy consisted of playing to Southern white fears about lawlessness in the wake of integration. It meant providing open arms to racists fleeing a Democratic party overtaken by “negroes and Jews.” As a result of the race-baiting tactics of his campaign, Nixon was the first member of the Republican Party to establish an electoral base in the South since Reconstruction.  In 1981, Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained in not-so-subtle terms that the politicians of his party spoke in “coded” language with regards to “the racial problem.” By the Reagan era, talk of so-called welfare queens and luxurious government handouts evoked racial stereotypes to arouse the fear of bigots.  Atwater went on to lead George H.W. Bush’s 1988 campaign, which included the racially charged Willie Horton Ad.
Certainly racism in America has dissipated significantly, even since the late ‘80’s. However, it is fanciful to imagine that after centuries of explicit racial politics, the specter of bigotry is entirely absent from our discourse.  Indeed, Trump harps on the bizarre notion that President Obama was born in Africa, and Romney asserts that Obama does not “believe in America.” Attacks against the President that rely on the implication that he is un-American do little to end the malignant tradition of racism in politics.
These on the right often offer an ungenerous critique of so-called “political correctness,” opting instead to speak bluntly and plainly.  Well, it’s time we tear down the greatest monument to wrongheaded political correctness in America.  We must end the charade that places a taboo on acknowledging the existence of racial politics.
The Birther movement, entirely bereft of a factual basis, was the offspring of the latent racial animus that still exists in this country.  By last spring, it became widespread enough that denying the President’s natural-born citizenship became de rigueur for all aspiring conservative presidential candidates. I admire the optimism of those who genuinely believe that the tradition of the “Southern Strategy” has been entirely erased in the last forty years, but I do not share it.  It is not a mere coincidence that our first black president is also the first one whose American nationality has been called into question.  It is not a coincidence that our first black president is the only one whose religious identity is the subject of persistent doubt.
In the 2008 campaign, John McCain had the maturity to publicly dismiss claims that Obama was a secret Muslim.  Unfortunately, I expect no such thing from Romney. He has shown himself incapable of connecting meaningfully with voters.  His road to the Republican nomination has been one of sad resignation for the Republican base rather than excitement. Furthermore, his entire narrative will fall apart if unemployment continues to fall. His best chance at capturing the Oval Office rests in rousing deep, unfounded fears about the President’s identity.  I do not think that Mitt Romney is racist, nor do I think he doubts the President’s place of birth.  Yet Romney apparently wants the presidency badly enough to sing any tune, play to any fear, and stand on stage with any would-be demagogue for a few votes.  I, for one, maintain no illusions about the pitch of his dog whistle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of last month’s terrifyingly effective internet lobbying effort by Google, Wikipedia and others to kill proposed anti-piracy legislation, the inevitable backlash has come. Sure, the contrarians say, the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act were terrible bills, but online piracy is a real problem. Jeffrey Rosen, the legal editor at The New Republic, argued for more aggressive enforcement of sites (like the recently shuttered MegaUpload) that host pirated content. Caleb Crain at Slate, channeling Immanuel Kant, insisted that musicians, authors, and other creators of content have a “moral right” to be compensated for it.
The idea that the absolute rights of artists mandate the enforcement of the particular copyright system the United States has adopted as of 2012 is an interesting one, but not particularly persuasive. Indeed, the analogy between digital property and physical property (and thus between digital and physical property rights) breaks down upon even cursory examination. If I go to Armageddon Record Shop and swipe a vinyl copy of the new Cloud Nothings album, no one else gets to use that copy. This is a concrete harm both to the store, which no longer has the copy to sell, as well as to other customers, who no longer have a chance to purchase it. An intervention from the criminal justice system, existing as it does to prevent private citizens from harming each other, is perfectly appropriate.
Pirating content doesn’t work like that. If I go to MediaFire or fire up a BitTorrent client to download the album, I’m not taking anything away from anybody. The MP3 files aren’t a scarce resource. My downloading them doesn’t prevent anyone else from having them. There isn’t a concrete harm the way there is with physical copy. Now, obviously, even though the per-unit cost of producing digital content is $0, there’s a big upfront cost. Cloud Nothings had to buy their instruments, hire producers and engineers, rent a studio, and so forth. If digital content creators never had any cash coming in, the only people making music, movies, software, etc. would be rich dilettantes with the cash and time to engage in those pursuits as a hobby. This may not be a catastrophic state of affairs for indie rock bands, but “The Dark Knight”-scale movies and TV shows aren’t going to be made by hobbyists in their spare time.
So the question is what should be done to encourage the creation of great digital content. The answer of the current policy regime is basically to establish a tax with all proceeds going to content creators (or, more commonly, the corporations that distribute their content), levied on a per-unit consumed (per song, per album, per movie, etc.) basis, with the tax collected by the creators and enforced through criminal and civil penalty. This may sound like a weird way to think about it, but it makes more sense than the analogy with private property. The government is not providing for the redress of harm, as it is when it enforces anti-theft laws; it is making a decision to subsidize a certain class of individuals in a certain way.
The current system has some things to recommend it. The analogy with private property, while conceptually inappropriate, makes the set-up readily understandable to most people, and the direct relationship between the size of the subsidy and the number of times a piece of content is consumed ensures fairness of at least some sort. But as we’re discovering, enforcing a tax of this kind is outrageously difficult. As Julian Sanchez has pointed out, it’s only going to get easier to share content across computers and mobile devices, and barring China-style authoritarian control of the internet by government, real enforcement of the current copyright regime will only grow harder and harder as technology improves.
So what else could we do? Well, we could directly subsidize the production of content by establishing BBC-like public institutions, or paying part of films’ budgets the way some European countries  (and the EU itself) do. We could disperse payments to content creators based on government estimates of their content’s popularity—in effect, keeping the current subsidy but financing it by means other than the de facto tax on consumers enforced through the courts. We could encourage work sharing and paid vacation time, or establish a guaranteed minimum income for all, so that more people have the time and money to create content as a hobby. I’m not sure if one of these is the best regime possible, but they all can be effectively implemented without shutting down the internet. The same can’t really be said for our current system.

With new impending implementation of federal regulations on conflict of interest, each of Harvard’s schools is underway with drafting a respective set of policies to judge conflict of interest that is also in compliance with University policies approved in 2010.
Harvard schools must draft their policies and have them approved by the late August 2012 federal deadline, according to Mark Barnes, a senior associate provost and co-chair of the University Standing Committee on Financial Conflicts of Interest.
“The federal government encourages us—in fact, requires us, through the Bayh-Dole Act—to commercialize faculty inventions that were produced with federal research funds,” Barnes said. “We want to protect faculty by having schools analyze issues related to inventions and external financial interests, upfront, before anyone can say that something went wrong.”
In many cases, faculty members face conflict of interest allegations when they receive funding for academic research that is directly related to their personal financial interests.
But conflict of interest can take on different forms depending upon the discipline—thus necessitating school-specific policies.
The Standing Committee has been meeting every six weeks to vet proposed policies. Each school is expected to define what it considers a “significant financial interest,” and present protocol by which potential conflicts of interest can be resolved, Barnes said.
Thus far, policies at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Law School have received preliminary approval.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will also propose its own implementation policy later this spring.
“I would say FAS is more complex because it’s larger and there’s a greater variety of funding sources,” Barnes added.
The FAS task force is on track to finish on time, according to Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Alexander F Schier, who is chair of the FAS Committee on Research Policy that is working to draft the policy.
Harvard’s re-evaluation of conflict of interest policies has been a two-year process aimed at standardizing disclosure practices across the University.
Revised U.S. Public Health Service regulations affect faculty members who receive grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control among others, mandating annual disclosure of all outside interests. According to Barnes, Harvard receives about 60 percent of its external research funding from PHS.
In a shift from regulations that have been in place since 1995, universities, rather than individual professors, must judge all potential conflicts of interest.
While professors acknowledge that change in a system can yield temporary inconvenience, most agree that a standardized protocol for avoiding conflict of interest situations is necessary.
John Y. Campbell, chair of the Economics department, said that he and other members of the department have always tried to be “conscientious” about disclosure, for example, by displaying outside interests on their websites. But he pointed out that this use of Harvard websites could be seen as a misuse of the Harvard name.
“I think it’s mostly a matter of deciding on a common protocol,” he said. “It’s helpful if norms develop so that people know the appropriate thing to do.”

The Cambridge Police Department received a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to implement a new analytics-based approach to crime prevention as part of the Smart Policing Initiative, the CPD announced Tuesday.
Cambridge was one of sixteen national sites chosen to participate in the program, for which Lieutenant Daniel Wagner will serve as the local project director.
According to the release, the grant will allow the CPD to coordinate with the Everett Police department, the Somerville Police Department, and the research firm Justice & Security Strategies to “prevent cross-jurisdictional violent crime” and improve policing strategies.
The initiative will have a budget of $299,668 to be used over a two-year period, according to the release.
The project will attempt to use new standards to facilitate easier data sharing between the different police departments, Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote in an email.
The departments also hope to make greater use of predictive measures and policing analytics to prevent crime, according to Riviello. Policing analytics enable police departments to predict the areas, time frames, and types of crime—making it easier for officers to control and prevent criminal activity.
The grant allows Cambridge to expand upon current crime predictive measures already in place, including bi-weekly data collection meetings and monthly public reports.
Riviello called the Smart Policing Initiative a “natural progression” from those meetings which highlighted crime patterns.
The grant money will also be used to “train crime analysts, IT staff, officers, and detectives on smart policing practices” as well as updating software data systems and hardware, Riviello wrote.
He emphasized that the program was important for everyone in Cambridge’s jurisdiction and will allow CPD to use its resources most effectively.
“A more agile police department which is better equipped and able to deploy its resources and combat crime will lead to a community which is safer for all who live, work, visit, and study in the City,” Riviello wrote.

After reemerging at the front of the Republican primary race last week, Mitt Romney’s campaign suffered a major setback Tuesday night in the shadow of Sen. Rick Santorum’s sweep in three state primaries—contrary to the predictions of many Harvard experts.
Santorum was met with a flood of support in Minnesota and Missouri, winning 45% and 55% of the vote, respectively. He also eked out a narrow victory in Colorado, a state Romney carried decisively in 2008, leading the former Massachusetts Gov. by five percent.
Romney struggled to garner even a quarter of the vote in Minnesota and Missouri.
Yet as recently as last week, Santorum’s campaign looked to be all but over, having failed to win a single contest since narrowly taking the Iowa caucuses last month.
Santorum’s position as the conservative alternative to Romney appealed to voters in Missouri’s non-binding contest, political experts said, but Romney was expected to carry Minnesota and Colorado.
Romney’s disappointing showings come after two impressive primary contest victories last week, which placed him firmly in the front of the Republican pack. His nomination, Harvard professors said, was all but inevitable.
“He’s clearly winning,” said Harvard Government professor Theda R. Skocpol on Tuesday afternoon. “It’s not like a home run clearing the fences. It’s more a series of dropped balls and singles, but he’s winning.”
Last week’s surge had enabled the Romney campaign to turn its focus towards the general election. In speeches and press releases last week, Romney increasingly called into question President Barack Obama’s record and positioned himself as the logical alternative to the current administration.
Yet despite his losses, Romney continued his attack on Obama in a speech in Colorado following the primary, telling a crowd of supporters that he would still be their nominee.
“Romney people have been assuming that they would run as the people who know how to fix the economy Obama has bungled,” Skocpol said. “I think it’s fair to say that the Republican primary electorate is settling for Romney, but it’s not excited about him.”
Like Skocpol, Harvard Republican Club president Derek J. Bekebrede noted that Romney’s attempt to position himself as the presumptive nominee leaves much to be desired.
“The fact that you’re inevitable doesn’t make you inspiring,” Bekebrede said.
Romney’s trouble on Tuesday underscores the questions that have dogged him as his campaign gained momentum, including scrutiny of his business credentials and personal finances.
According to Harvard professors, that negativity has left Republicans, and particularly Romney, battered and wanting for energy as they emerge into the general election.
“Unlike most of the nominees who have come out of either party in recent memory, he’s pretty messed up,” Kennedy School Lecturer Marty A. Linsky said. “He’s been beaten up pretty badly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives from Harvard, MIT, and Lesley University presented development projects to the Cambridge Planning Board and community members Tuesday evening in Central Square.
Harvard Director of Planning Services Alexadra J. Offiong discussed 13 projects, including seven renovations of existing buildings.
“The type of project Harvard is focusing on is investing in our existing facilities—updating, re-purposing, and reusing,” she said.
Offiong focused on Harvard’s Cambridge-campus projects, but mentioned Allston and Boston developments in passing.
MIT Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz highlighted the university’s recent transformations at University Park and in the radiation laboratory, both part of the “MIT 2030” plan.
“We don’t have 375 years like Harvard has, but 150 is pretty cool,” Ruiz said, noting its accomplishments.
Ruiz glossed over MIT’s controversial Kendall Square rezoning project, which faced criticism from the Cambridge City Council in September.
Following the presentation, City Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 critized MIT’s actions.
“One of our university partners has a very different way of developing and changing,” he said. “Every inch of MIT’s investment portfolio seems to be targeted at making as much money for the institute as they can.”
Lesley University Vice President of Administration Marylou Batt presented a three-year plan and efforts to connect its campuses. The university is currently waiting for court approval to relocate its Art Institute of Boston campus.
Local residents and Planning Board members commented on the university plans following the presentations.
Andrew Farrar, a Central Square resident who is president of the Cambridge Youth Soccer League, welcomed proposals for more public spaces by the universities, but said he was concerned by the lack of written reports on the subject.
“I would like to look at how the students of the college use open spaces that are available to them and think about the ways to improve these spaces,” he said.
Cambridge resident James Williamson questioned the status of Harvard projects, including the Cambridge Street overpass and Lars Anderson Bridge.
“Who from the city is involved in helping to shape whatever so called vision is being promoted there?” Williamson said.
Planning Board member Tom Anninger echoed citizen comments on accountability. MIT’s Kendall Square rezoning project is “the most difficult and most important” challenge for the city in the coming years, he said.
Yet Elaine Fisher, a Cambridge resident of over 50 years, said she didn’t harbor as many reservations.
“Sometimes they can be a little seedy, but I’m proud to have them here,” she said. “We just have to keep our eyes open.”

With protests in Syria escalating in the current wave of civil unrest among Arab states, Harvard professors agreed with the United States’ decision to close the Syrian Embassy in Damascus.
Professors from the History and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations departments said that the precaution to close the embassy and withdraw staff was the right response to the increasing chaos in the country.
“The embassy knows best, and diplomatic security knows the issues on the ground,” Arabic Professor of Practice William Granara said. “Obviously if they see it as a danger to our diplomats, then I think it’s important they close it.”
Violence in Syria reached a high point at the end of January when the Syrian government denounced an Arab League peace proposal that called for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his vice president and begin peace negotiations with his opponents. Assad has been issuing crackdowns since last April, ordering tanks into cities of civil unrest and executing police action on protestors.
“The situation is very serious for diplomats, and the Syrian government is not pledging to safeguard safe passage,” Granara said. “It’s a complicated and horrible situation. I think it’s prudent for them to close the embassy and bring everyone home.”
History professor Erez Manela also agreed with the decision to close the Syrian embassy.
“From what I hear, the decision was based on security considerations,” he said. “They felt that the embassy was vulnerable to attack, that the security situation had deteriorated, and obviously if that’s the case, the embassy needs to be closed. That seems pretty reasonable.”
On Feb. 4, a provisional United Nations Security Council resolution to end violence in Syria collapsed in a double veto by Russia and China. In response, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed that she wants to tighten sanctions and support the transition to democracy in Syria, though officials stress that the U.S. seeks to avoid playing a military role in Syria. Granara agrees with the State Department’s stance.
“I think under the circumstances, the State Department is being prudent. I think they’re right to put pressure on the Russians and the Chinese for not putting the U.N. vote to censure Syria,” he said.
Although the choice was clear to both professors due to the growing security concerns, they recognize the significance of the move to close the embassy.
“It’s a pretty tough decision for the U.S. because every option you choose has very obvious downsides. There are a lot of risks.” Manela said.

Nine-time Grammy Award winner John Legend has been named the Harvard Foundation’s Artist of the Year, according to Harvard Foundation president Dr. S. Allen Counter.
Legend will receive his award during the first of the Cultural Rhythms performances on Saturday, Feb. 25.
Counter said that, in selecting the Artist of the Year, the Harvard Foundation looked beyond musical accomplishments.
“The Artist of the Year has to be more than just an artist, but also a humanitarian,” Counter said.
Cultural Rhythms is an annual, two-part event sponsored by the Harvard Foundation that features over 30 cultural performance groups including Mariachi Veritas, Harvard Bhangra, and the Kuumba Singers.
Students involved in Cultural Rhythms voiced universal excitement at the news that Legend was Artist of the Year.
“I think he’s a great choice,” said Gloria D. Henderson ’12, vice president of the Kuumba Singers, which is performing during the first part of the event. Kuumba also performed for Legend last spring in New York.
Henderson said that her excitement comes from more than just Legend’s performance ability.
“I love his music, but not just his music,” she said. “He’s involved in education and a whole lot of humanitarian projects. For the Harvard Foundation—which is all about race relations and giving back to the community—John Legend is perfect.”
Legend has been involved in several charitable campaigns. He started the “Show Me Campaign,” an initiative to fight poverty and increase access to education in Africa and the United States.
She added that she feels Legend’s music embodies some of the values of Cultural Rhythms.
“His music is universal,” she said.
Gunsagar S. Gulati ’14, a member of Bhangra dance group, said his group was equally excited to hear the news about John Legend, even though they are performing in the second part of Cultural Rhythms and may not have an opportunity to see the artist.
“I think it’s great that he’s coming in,” Gulati said. “Just having him there would be incredible support of all the cultural talents that are going to be performing in cultural rhythms.”
Counter said one of the reasons for founding the Artist of the Year award was to recognize a wider array of individuals who embodied the University’s mission of diversity.
“We created the Harvard Foundation award to represent the whole University, and the new diversity of Harvard,” he said. “The point of those performers are to enlighten students about the different cultures and also celebrate the diversity.”

CLARIFICATION: Feb. 14, 2011.
An earlier version of this article said that the purpose of John Legend's charitable effort, the Show Me Campaign, is to raise money for the Mbola community in Tanzania. While the organization does raise money for the Mbola community, it is also engaged in efforts to fight poverty and increase access to education throughout Africa and in the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted on Monday to adopt a new event calendar website, Eventplease, as its platform for announcing upcoming events.
After a semester offline, Eventplease—a website created by students to centralize Harvard’s events and calendars—recently rebooted with a better interface. UC representatives said that their endorsement was a result of the website’s student-friendly design and easy-to-use system.
“We’ve had calendars in the past that listed a lot of events that students didn’t really care about,” said UC secretary Michael C. George ’14, who is also a Crimson news editor. “Eventplease really focuses on events that undergraduates would be interested in, which is why the UC has chosen to help the website get off the ground with publicity, endorsement, and manpower.”
Together with former UC Vice President Bonnie Cao ’12, George spearheaded the UC’s decision to bring back Eventplease. A message will be sent to the entire student body Friday to introduce the website.
UC representatives are currently in the process of informing student leaders and organizations about Eventplease so that they can begin using the website.
“In ten seconds, you can get your event publicized to over a thousand people,” said George. “There’s no reason students wouldn’t want to use Eventplease.”
With the integration of Facebook, Google calendar, and iCal, Eventplease is the first website at Harvard that allows students to track an event and see how many other people are planning to attend.
Unlike the Harvard Events Calendar and the Harvard Gazette Calendar, Eventplease allows any student registered on Facebook’s Harvard network to create a Facebook event when they post on the website.
“Eventplease has a very sophisticated interface,” co-creator Michael B. Wong ’12 said. “Not only can students navigate through events more easily, but a built-in reputation system can also track your preferences and recommend events that you might like.”
Eventplease, which currently has 1,129 people and 242 organizations registered, is one of several recent attempts to improve communication about ongoing campus events. Previous initiatives include HarvardEvents, a CS50 calendar application created by Computer Science Senior Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, and HarvardTonight, a subreddit for finding parties created by Yasha S. Iravantchi ’13 and Ryan A. Neff ’13.
At the start of the spring semester, Simon M. Thompson ’14 also launched Crimson Events, which sent out an email with the top events every day. Though 300 students signed up for Crimson Events, Thompson chose to discontinue the mailing list and endorse Eventplease, after the website adopted an email feature that was absent before.
“I’m enthusiastic about Eventplease. It does everything that all other initiatives have tried in the past,” he said.
Eventplease first launched last April, when the UC unanimously passed legislation to endorse the website. At the time, Eventplease had around 100 events listed and was getting a maximum of 400 hits per day. Wong took the website offline so that he and his three co-creators could improve the system.
“We got a lot of feedback when students first started using Eventplease,” Wong said. “We wanted to work out all the kinks and figure out how to sustain traffic so that students could use it continuously.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A California federal appeals court declared a law that bans same-sex marriages unconstitutional on Tuesday, a decision that received mixed reactions on Harvard’s campus.
In a 2 to 1 ruling, the divided court upheld the 2010 decision of a lower court that Proposition 8 violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples.
In the opinion from Tuesday’s ruling, Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt wrote that Proposition 8 serves no purpose “other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians in California.”
The ruling is limited to California in scope, and legal scholars—including professors at Harvard Law School—are debating whether the U.S. Supreme Court will review the case and set a national precedent.
“The narrowness of the ruling and its deliberate focus on the quite unique California context...makes it somewhat less likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will take the case,” Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 wrote in an e-mail.
In contrast, Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 said he believes the Supreme Court will find the case important enough to evaluate.
“The Court of Appeals framed it in a way that the decision was California-specific, but it would be possible to use the case as a vehicle for addressing the gay marriage case more generally,” said Tushnet.
In the student community, opinions were similarly divided.
According to Laura V. Herrera ’13, co-chair of the organization Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever, this accomplishment represents a step forward for the gay and lesbian community, but lingering concerns remain.
“I’m hoping this will set up in the final push for gay marriage rights for the country and worldwide,” Herrera said. “But I have to put this into the perspective of what this means for social change more broadly.”
But the law does not resonate well with everyone. True Love Revolution member Jim P. McGlone ’15 said he thinks the court made the wrong decision.
“I don’t think there’s a constitutional statute that necessarily requires states to define marriage,” McGlone said. “And I hope the Supreme Court overturns the Ninth Circuit’s decision soon.”
Duc P. Luu ’12 said he agrees with the court’s ruling but expressed misgivings about the basis of the federal appeals court’s decision.
“I think the court needed a more ethical and moral reasoning beyond merely saying singling out a group of people is unconstitutional,” Luu said.
“You have to address what are the ends, what does marriage really mean, and what is it about marriage that is worth preserving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud of Saudi Arabia—who donated $20 million to create the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard in 2005—discussed the future of the Middle East at a panel on Wednesday.
His donation, one of his six multimillion dollar contributions to fund academic centers at universities around the world, has endowed four professorships and pushed the program to the forefront of the University’s efforts to improve teaching and learning and to promote international engagement at Harvard.
“At Harvard, we’re talking about teaching and learning initiatives, but what this network does is provide us with partners to be able to take this teaching and learning initiative to new heights.” said Director of the Islamic Studies Program Ali S. Asani ’77, referring to the other five institutions—Georgetown University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Cambridge, the American University of Cairo, and the American University of Beirut—that received donations from the Prince and attended the conference.
Asani currently teaches an Extension School course in a “virtual classroom,” where he lectures and holds sections online with students from around the world. He hopes to offer this course to students at the College in the future, he said.
Asani also said he believes that the program will encourage similar efforts in other areas of the University.
“It has become a catalyst,” said Asani. “Fortuitously, it happens at a time when Harvard is rethinking teaching and learning and has new ideas about global education.”
For Alwaleed, the donations were intended to promote an international dialogue between Islamic nations and the West, according to Asani. The initiative began as an effort to combat Islamophobia after September 11.
“The whole idea behind these centers is to bridge gaps and bring people closer together. In the end, it’s about breaking misconceptions,” said Nadia H. Bakhurji, secretary general of the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter how much publicity we do, in the end, there is such an anti-campaign against Islam in general in the world.”
Each center has taken on different roles and specializations, which Georgetown director John L. Esposito said is vital to the overall mission.
“All bases are being hit,” he said. “Our specific focus is on the interaction between religion and international affairs.”
Bakhurji said she particularly admired the outreach initiatives taken by the University of Edinburgh. Hugh P. Goddard, the director, said that his center works within the context of Scotland and the United Kingdom.
“Many [British] people don’t know much about Islam, if at all. Education is really the key. We are helping to address the gap with more accurate information,” he said.
University of Cambridge Director Yasir Suleiman stressed producing credible information as a research center, not a think tank.
“The purpose of our center is not to promote Islam or promote a positive image of Islam. Our image is to create knowledge and produce knowledge about Islam that is balanced, contextualized, and put out into the public sphere,” Suleiman said.
Though the Saudi royal family has been criticized for its repressive policies, Alwaleed is known as an international philanthropist and an advocate for women’s rights and an “evolution” towards democracy, according to Asani.
“I think it’s human nature—freedom, liberty, and deciding your own fate. At the end of the day you have to have some structural political changes,” Alwaleed said during the panel.
Among these changes, he suggested, would be a democratically-elected parliament that has authority.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last minute of the second period on Tuesday night, junior goaltender Laura Bellamy dropped her stick.
When freshman defender Michelle Picard tried to return it, Bellamy fumbled around, and she dropped her precious instrument to the ice again. Eventually, Bellamy was able to grab her teammates’ stick and save her squad from danger, but the sequence summarized the frustration for the Harvard women’s hockey team on a night when very little was working for it.
Those in attendance were treated to an entertaining early game that featured 60 minutes of end-to-end hockey with plenty of chances on both ends.
But defensive lapses on the side of the No. 8 Crimson proved to be crucial in its 4-2 loss against No. 6 Boston College on Tuesday night.
“Their aggression wasn’t met here tonight,” junior defender Josephine Pucci said. “We weren’t getting in shooting lanes and getting rid of the rebounds.”
Thanks to puck movement and positioning, the squad’s offense, which fired 35 shots, saw many opportunities from different angles. Yet throughout most of the game, the team was not able to finish.
“We have some forwards that have some really good hands,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “And as forwards, we should be making those plays to help our team out. That was not there today.”
The first goal from the Eagles came after an uncontrollable puck skirted away from the stick of a Crimson defender.
The puck was scooped up by BC’s Meagan Mangene and passed to teammate Danielle Welch, who scored on a point-blank tap in.
The Eagles continued to hound the net in the middle of the first, but Harvard answered back, generating excitement in the crowd with a hard-hit slapshot that deflected into the netting at 7:25.
Half a minute later, the Crimson evened the score on a breakaway down the right side. With only the goaltender in front of her, sophomore forward Elizabeth Parker sent the puck across the lip of the goal to captain Alisa Baumgartner, who slammed it away to even the score.
Despite outshooting the Eagles, 17-9, in the second period, two more unanswered BC goals put Harvard even further behind.
The first of the pair came with some controversy.
During the goal, a group of hounding Eagles surrounded Bellamy, and the tally was endangered of being discounted due to disorderly conduct. But after the play was reviewed by the referees, the ruling on the ice stood, and the Crimson found itself behind another score.
The next BC goal came at 14:30 in the second off the stick of Blake Bolden. This tally came on a slow-tempo shot from the blue line that squeaked by Bellamy; a goal similar to the Eagles’ final score of the night by Ashley Motherwell in the third frame.
One of Harvard’s best chances of the night came off a pass up the boards that landed perfectly on the stick of the sophomore forward Gina McDonald. But the puck was sent harmlessly into the well-positioned goaltender, Corinne Boyles, and the scoreboard remained the same.
Of the Crimson’s 33 shots on goal, 13 came in the 16 minutes Harvard played in man-up situations.
Only one power-play shot—a Dempsey put-back after the original shot by sophomore defender Marissa Gedman clanged off the boards— actually found the back of the net. The goal, which came in the last seven seconds of the first of Harvard’s four third-period power plays, put the Crimson back in striking distance.
But Harvard was not able to recover or improve on its power play, and it finished the game one-for-eight on its power-play opportunities. The Eagles, on the other hand, went two-for-three.
The contest was a rematch of last year’s second-week Beanpot matchup between Harvard and BC. But, this year, the two teams met in the consolation round, rather than the championship.
“[Playing in a consolation match] shouldn’t be a factor,” Pucci said. “BC is a ranked opponent. We should be ready to go for a team like this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marshall Everson has taken a rather unconventional route to stardom for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
“Nowadays it seems that a lot of guys are going to [a junior hockey league] for a year, maybe two years,” senior line mate Alex Killorn said. “[But] Marshall came straight out of high school.”
Everson captained his local high school in Edina, Minn. to much acclaim; receiving all-state honors his final two seasons. Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 took notice and worked hard to bring Everson, now a junior, into the fold.
“He’s a guy that offensively we knew would develop,” Donato said. “He had some injuries early on that slowed him down a bit, but he’s really had a breakout year so far.”
After an injury-plagued freshman year and an unsteady sophomore campaign, the junior attacker has settled into his role as a bruiser on the first line for the Crimson (7-7-9, 6-4-7 ECAC).Everson, along with Killorn and junior Alex Fallstrom, gelled down the homestretch of the 2010-11 season and have since emerged as one of the most formidable first lines in the ECAC.
“I think they give us the feeling that on any night our first line can go out and beat the other team’s first line,” Donato said. “They’ve battled all year, and I think Marshall deserves a lot of that credit.”
Of the top-six point scorers for Harvard, Everson is the only one who has not been drafted by an NHL franchise. Yet there he is, third on the team with 22 points off of nine goals and 13 assists.
“You know, I think when I was younger, I probably thought about [not being drafted] a lot more,” Everson said. “Now I’m much more focused on doing what I can here, getting better and doing everything I can to help the team.”
That focus has yielded positive results, as Everson showed up for camp in the best shape of his career and has proved instrumental in leading the nation’s most effective power play.
“His job is to screen the goalie and cause a lot of chaos in front of the net,” Killorn explained. “Just doing that opens up a lot of plays for guys around the perimeter. He’s so strong and, as I said, causes so much chaos that it creates a lot of scoring opportunities for us.”
Not only has his renewed focus pushed Everson to new heights, but so, too, has the presence of an old nemesis and friend accelerated his prowess: his brother Max, a freshman defender.
“Absolutely there is competition between us,” the elder Everson said. “Anytime we’re matched up against each other the competition level is a little higher than normal. That sibling rivalry definitely comes through.”
Playing the role of older brother to a “T,” Marshall has also assumed a mentoring role in Max’s development.
“It’s nice, with our family so far away, to have him out here and keep him close,” Max said. “It’s a little like the good old days I guess.”
The good old days included a run in the Minnesota state championship that landed the Everson brothers in Sports Illustrated. Despite falling short in the championship game, those experiences helped forge a strong bond, both on and off the ice.
“He helps me with just about everything,” Max said. “[He is] basically a teacher. My Dad got us both into hockey at first, but growing up and seeing his successes really got me drawn into it.”
Not to seem too soft, Marshall—who is 30 pounds heavier and an inch taller than Max—is sure to remind his brother that he’s still the same guy who would beat him on the neighborhood rink.
“I’ll play a little dirtier on him, whatever I have to do to get by him,” Marshall said. “He’ll do the same to try and stop me. Rules kind of go out the window when it’s me versus him.”
With five conference games left, Everson and the Crimson will try to extend a six-game unbeaten streak in ECAC play that dates back to January 20. As Marshall continues to perform at such a high level, questions about his professional prospects will begin to pop up.
“Oh absolutely [I’d like to pursue a career in hockey],” Marshall said. “It’s definitely what I’m working towards. After the draft is over, if you’re drafted—great—if you’re not, you just got to move on and focus on having a good four years in college.”
Unconventional.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson entered the 34th Annual Women’s Beanpot Tournament searching for its 14th title, which would have left Harvard tied with Northeastern for the most all-time.
Although a tough opening-round loss to Boston University left the Crimson in the consolation game for this year’s Beanpot, a top-ten matchup between No. 6 Boston College and No. 8 Harvard was sure to bring the best out of both teams.
The Crimson (16-8-1, 13-4-1 ECAC) managed to outshoot the Eagles, 35-29, but two second period BC goals ended up being the difference as the Crimson fell, 4-2.
The second frame tallies by BC was a flip on Harvard’s usually-dominating middle period offense.
The Crimson has scored more goals this season in the second frame than in any other period, including seven goals in its NCAA record-tying performance against Princeton on Saturday.
The Eagles (19-8-3, 11-4-2 WHEA) and its goaltender Corinne Boyles, who had 33 saves on the night, managed to stifle the Harvard offense in the middle period, despite the Crimson’s typical success during this time.
NOT-SO-SPECIAL TEAMS
Despite numerous chances, Harvard was not able to take full advantage of the eight BC penalties, with its lone power-play goal coming 9:05 into the third period.
For the tally, junior forward Jillian Dempsey pounced on a loose puck behind the net and took advantage of the out-of-position Boyles, giving Dempsey her team-leading 22nd score of the season.
The goal cut the Eagles’ lead within two, but Dempsey’s finish turned out to be the final tally of the night for the Crimson.
On the flip side, the Boston College power play was extremely efficient.
The Eagles managed to score on two-out-of-three power-play opportunities. Both goals came in the decisive second frame when BC turned a 1-1 first period deadlock into a commanding 3-1 lead.
But Harvard coach Katey Stone remained positive about her squad’s power play.
“We had 14 shots on the power play, which isn’t bad,” Stone said. “Their goalie popped out some rebounds, we just couldn’t take advantage. Their best penalty killer was the goaltender. All we can do is work on it in practice on Thursday, and get right back at it this Friday.”
SLUGGISH STARTS
In its opening Beanpot game against then-unranked BU on Jan. 31, the Crimson fell behind early on its way to a 5-2 loss.
While Harvard seemed to fix that problem in two impressive wins last weekend against Quinnipiac and Princeton, the Crimson, once again, had a problem getting started in its final Beanpot fixture on Tuesday night, allowing the Eagles to find the back of the net first.
But, down 1-0, Harvard was able to battle back from an early deficit.
Captain Alisa Baumgartner scored her second goal of the season at 13:09 into the opening period from an on-point pass by freshman center Hillary Crowe, bringing the Crimson into the lockerroom tied, 1-1, at the first intermission.
Yet Harvard was sluggish again at the beginning of both the second and third frames, too.
Just like the commencement of the opening period, the Crimson allowed a goal within the first five minutes of the two ensuing frames, as well.
“We have to be ready to go at the drop of the puck, have to get going right away,” Dempsey said.
Though, the struggle was not solely the fault of Harvard’s defenders or junior goaltender Laura Bellamy, who kept the puck from entering the goal 25 times on the night.
“Us forwards should have done a better job backtracking, too,” Dempsey added.
DEMPSEY STAYS HOT
Cruising off of a killer weekend where she averaged more than a hat trick in two games, Dempsey continued to lead the Crimson offense.
Her 22nd goal of the season, notched against BC Tuesday night, was her eighth in the last three games.  Her “quintet” against Princeton last Saturday was just one shy of the NCAA record for most goals by a player in a single game, currently held by Harvard alum Nicole Corriero ’05.
Dempsey was a hefty presence for the BC defense to handle, racking up seven shots on net to lead the team.
But the ever-humble Dempsey was quick to credit her teammates.
“I play on a great line, and we all just work together so well,” Dempsey said.
The Winthrop, Mass. native will look to continue her offensive onslaught this Friday, as Harvard travels to Rensselaer.

In this series, Crimson arts writer Brian A. Feldman '13 will describe to you, the reader, some videos he saw on the internet.
 
If you are reading these words, there are pretty good odds that you have heard of The Internet. For those of you who are unaware, The Internet is a complex system of 1s and 0s created almost exclusively for the purpose of sharing hilarious and/or ridiculous videos. Often times, these videos are about cats, but there are exceptions.
 I will describe these videos to you and link to them, and then you can make the choice about whether or not to watch the videos. You are an adult, and I trust you to be responsible.
This Year's MVP | Puppy Bowl VIII
 
If you only watched the Super Bowl this past weekend, then you only witnessed half of the action. Puppy Bowl VIII also took place and it was ruthless. It was a real dog-eat-dog competition (sorry for that one!), although I must say that the Kitten Halftime Show was puuurrrrrrrrrfect (not apologizing for that one). Check out this video if you want to see some highlights and find out who won the coveted Bissell Most Valuable Puppy award.
Timelapse of a Tortoise Eating
 
This particular tortoise just goes to town on the salad he's eating. At first, I wasn't sure if this was sped-up footage of a tortoise eating salad or just footage of most students at Noch's at 1:30 a.m. on any given Saturday night. Right? Riiiiiight?? #college
Devil Cat Is Watching You
"Cats and the 'Inception' soundtrack" is like a 21st-century version of "chocolate and peanut butter": a perfect combination that will almost certainly never get old. This cat needs to chill out, maybe go to Brain Break or something. I dunno. I'm not a cat expert. What do you think is wrong with this cat? Tell us in the comments!
Two-Faced Kitten Born Healthy In Port Charlotte, Florida 
 
Watch out, cats with two faces. There's a new two-faced cat in town. The owners even named this one after Batman's friend-turned-nemesis Harvey Dent, probably because of the two-face thing, but maybe also because Harvey is a great name for a great cat. We'll never know.
He Strikes Again (A cat tries to escape out of a window, but I won't spoil the ending.)
 This video is a pretty good metaphor for the beginning of the semester. You're at a party, Mary J. Blige is bumpin' on the stereo, but then you start thinking about all the work you have to do already, and who even knows what's up with those internship applications you sent to McKinsey, and have you figured out your blocking group yet? And then you're just like, "Screw this, I'm gonna climb out this window."

2012 ski doo summit X close call with cliff fall (A snowmobile comes thiiiis close to falling off a cliff)
 Terrifying. What a nightmare world we live in where people choose to do this stuff like it's no big deal. You might think that it's a bummer that there has been almost no snow in Cambridge this winter, but then you see this video terrorscape and suddenly, the lack of snow is pretty nice.
 
Toronto Zoo polar bear cub 3 months (A three-month-old polar bear cub lives it up at the zoo.)
Some baby polar bears just have it so easy. If I had to sacrifice partial control of my body in exchange for being allowed to just play in the snow and nap all the time, I would seriously consider taking that offer.

Have you ever contemplated the texture of your Marshmallow Mateys? Probably not. However, analyzing those multi-colored 'mallows during tomorrow's breakfast may not be such a bad idea.
A recent New York Times article reveals that the practice of mindful eating, which stems from Buddhist philosophy, might be beneficial to our health.
Dr. Lillian W. Cheung, a nutritionist and Director of Health Promotion & Communication at the School of Public Health, is one of the leading supporters of mindful eating. She encourages us to forget the distractions of smart phones, TV, and newspapers, and to instead focus on our meals.
"We engage all our senses while eating. We appreciate the colors, smell, texture and sound arising from eating, not just taste," Cheung says. She also adds that eating mindfully can help us realize when we are full, which can prevent binge eating.
For those with a packed schedule, Cheung has some tips on how to improve eating and incorporate some solace and peace into the day.  First, put away cell phones and other gadgets, and keep conversations focused on positive topics. Second, eat balanced meals throughout the day—skipping meals has no positive benefits. Third, "Go for the plants," Cheung says. It helps both you and the planet.
