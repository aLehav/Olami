After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The patient sat quietly on his hospital bed, his dark skin contrasting with the sterile white sheets beneath him. Motionless, he slowly relayed how his leukemia had returned over the past few years, words trailing from his mouth like the continuous IV drip attached to his right arm.
Even with one year of medical training, we knew that his outcome was abnormal. Although the treatment for his leukemia was simple and highly effective—most patients experience a complete remission of cancer with a daily tyrosine kinase inhibitor –this patient faced another battle.
"I stopped taking my medications three years ago," he clarifies quietly, his eyes suddenly avoiding ours. "I couldn’t afford them."
Stories like these are not uncommon. In Massachusetts, twenty-four percent of residents report avoiding treatment due to cost. This leads to worse and even more expensive health outcomes, as patients are forced to choose between healthcare and daily necessities. Unfortunately, more than half of all bankruptcies in Massachusetts result from insurmountable medical expenses.
Medical students and physicians want to treat patients based on medical need, not socioeconomic status. However, corporate interests treat healthcare like a commodity, and the market forces exclude those who are unable to pay.
This is why many of us advocate for a single-payer system-- improved Medicare for all--that would cover every Massachusetts resident for medically necessary services. Under a single-payer system, our patient would have received lifesaving leukemia medications with no out-of-pocket costs.
The most important reason to support single-payer reform is because it is the right choice for our patients. However, implementing a single-payer system is also a fiscally responsible decision that would save Massachusetts up to $9.9 billion on administrative expenses. Every year, our state’s healthcare spending rises, while funding for other social programs is consistently slashed. In 2013, healthcare consumed an overwhelming forty-three percent of the state budget. In order to continue investing in social programs, we must restructure our healthcare system and eliminate underlying inefficiencies.
By streamlining healthcare financing into a single public agency like Medicare, we could reduce the administrative waste of multiple for-profit insurers, pool risk across the entire population, and negotiate down the prices of expensive prescription drugs and medical services.
Doctors would still function independently, but instead of billing and seeking approvals from hundreds of different insurers, they would send all bills to one payer. Under single-payer, the burden of billing and paperwork would be dramatically reduced. Doctors would have more time to spend with patients. Patients would also have more freedom to choose their providers, as private insurers would no longer restrict patient autonomy with narrow provider networks.
Right now, Massachusetts is in a unique position to lead on single-payer reform. In 2006, we enacted the reforms that later inspired the Affordable Care Act, resulting in the lowest rate of uninsured individuals in the country. Although we have historically led on healthcare, we currently have the highest healthcare expenditures per capita and the highest premiums in the country. We already know that these reforms are not sustainable. What we need is a leader committed to making healthcare simpler, accessible, and truly universal.
Only one gubernatorial candidate has both the expertise and political will to implement Medicare-for-all in Massachusetts: Don Berwick.
As a Harvard-trained pediatrician, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and the former chief administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Don Berwick understands the intricacies of healthcare reform and is dedicated to bringing Medicare-for-all to the Commonwealth.
"The very idea of having Dr. Don Berwick as governor of our great state gives me hope, as a doctor and as a citizen, for a future in which the notion of the commonwealth – of shared dreams and shared plans to achieve both – comes to replace the fractured and contradictory claims of contemporary politics," says Paul Farmer, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a founder of Partners in Health.  Many other doctors and medical students, including us, are working to ensure that Don Berwick becomes our next governor. Our efforts contributed toward his success at the Massachusetts Democratic Convention, where Berwick electrified the crowd of progressives and won a place on the election ballot for the Democratic primary.
We are deeply inspired by Berwick’s declaration: “Healthcare is a human right, period.” We believe that the private insurance industry’s relentless demand for profits at the expense of patients undermines the ethical standards of the medical profession. We consider health inequality to be a cancer upon society, a disease that affects us all regardless of class, race, gender, or political affiliation.
Let us continue our legacy of leadership in healthcare and social justice in Massachusetts. On September 9, when Democrats go to the polls to select their nominees for the November elections, join us in supporting candidates who place patients above profits. Together, we can lead the nation toward a truly just, single-payer healthcare system and treat the underlying disease of social inequality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time I saw the Kotel–the Western Wall in Jerusalem–was when I went to Israel through Taglit-Birthright in January. My trip leaders wanted to make our first encounter with this holy site special, so they had us all walk blindfolded to an overlook that would afford us a panoramic view of the Wall. When we removed the scarves over our eyes, I was in awe. The only coherent thought I had was, “This is my Wall, this is MY Wall.”
I spent the last six weeks on a Harvard Summer School program at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, so I took full advantage of my proximity to the Kotel. Because it is the last remaining part of the holy Temple, tradition holds that prayers recited there are especially potent. I never went a week without going to the Wall at least once, and there were days where I went for each of the three daily prayer services, just because I could. Even when the US State Department recommended staying away from the Kotel because of the threat of anti-Jewish violence, I went anyway.
Normally I would go to the Kotel on my own or with a friend or two, in order to spend time on self-reflection and quiet prayer. However, during a recent celebration of Rosh Hodesh, I opted to join Women of the Wall (WoW)’s monthly service. WoW is an all-women prayer group that meets in the women’s section of the Kotel, reciting prayers that are usually reserved for a quorum of 10 men and wearing traditionally masculine ritual garments like tefillin, kippot, and tallitot. As the Kotel is maintained by the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which is run by an Orthodox rabbi in a manner that adheres to normative Orthodox halakha (law), WoW’s practices have led to a lot of controversy since the group’s founding in 1988.
Though I am Orthodox and I follow halakha in the same way as the Heritage Foundation does, I do not believe in imposing my religious beliefs on others. Consequently, I believe that the Kotel should be run in a manner that respects Jews from every denomination, so it can be a place where Jews are allowed and encouraged to connect to their Creator in whatever way feels right. Israel is a Jewish state, not an Orthodox one, and the prayers that are said at its holiest site should reflect that.
And so I joined WoW while I was in Jerusalem. It was a truly meaningful experience for me, helping me unlock even more holiness from the Kotel. The sound of one hundred women’s voices rising together was exceptionally powerful. The sense of sisterhood I felt among us – native Israelis, Ethiopian immigrants, American tourists, mothers and daughters praying under the same tallit, Orthodox women in long sleeves and mid-calf skirts – was incredibly strong. Despite our religious and political differences, we all stood beside each other in solidarity, speaking to the same God, affirming each other’s right to pray in the way she feels most comfortable.
I got to the Wall a few minutes after WoW began the service, so I stood at the back and sang along quietly. Barely two minutes later, a woman in a kippah and tallit came over to me. “Come toward the front,” she said, and pulled me into the middle of the group. “We want people like you.” I knew that “people like you” meant “people who are conspicuously Orthodox,” as my mode of dress and choice of prayerbook outed me. But putting the political motivations aside, her desire to include me in the group was incredibly affirming. It was refreshing to know that my presence mattered to her; nobody has ever before gone out of his or her way to make me feel like I belong in any prayer space.
Perhaps this feeling of otherness is the reason why I have always had a hard time speaking up within religious spaces. Whenever I recited the mourners’ prayer, Kaddish, for my father, I chose to say it under my breath as a man said it aloud. I was never comfortable enough to say it too loudly, and certainly not on my own. Praying with WoW showed me that women can speak up within religious spaces, and that’s okay. It’s more than okay. It’s good. It’s desirable. Praying with WoW helped me claim the Wall, and by extension all spaces of prayer, as my own.
One time when I was sitting at the Wall reciting Psalms, I placed my thumb in a depression in the rock. I spread the rest of my hand out onto the Wall, and I realized that all my fingers fit perfectly into other depressions in the stone. It was awing to realize that my ancestors have been sitting in this same spot for thousands of years, pressing their hands into the Wall’s face, praying to the same God that I still pray to today. I had never felt so connected to my history before.
And I am 100 percent positive that WoW is a continuation of that tradition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The issue of wealth inequality in the United States is now, more than ever, dominating public conversation across all sectors.  Many academic economists have been at the forefront of the of the argument (such as Stiglitz and Mankiw, among countless others), though taking there word as absolute truth on the subject would be naive. No one discipline has an academic monopoly on the subject, as it is relevant in economic, political, sociological, psychological and philosophical realms.  What effects does concentrated wealth have on democratic government?  Is the current economic system fair?  What is a fair economic system?  The list of issues and questions goes on and on, criss-crossing multiple subjects as it goes.
There have been many proposed policy prescriptions to fix the current issue, which is reaching levels that have never been seen before.  From admittedly Utopian global wealth taxes to better financial educations, the ideas and possibilities are endless.  Despite the breadth of conversation that is ongoing, I find that most arguments or opinions on the matter neglect the other factors contributing to wealth inequality.  Most importantly, much of the origins and aspects of said inequalities involve a much wider scope of academic disciplines.
Standard economic canon teaches us that a worker’s compensation is perfectly equal to their marginal productivity.  Essentially, perfect markets ensure that people are paid what they deserve.  Theoretically, this means that no matter what your background is, you will be paid what you deserve.  Work harder and more efficiently, and you will be paid more.  Clearly, this theory is very limited in its scope and is unable to explain or justify current trends of extreme divergence in wealth.
Perhaps more than any other institution in our society, higher education epitomizes our most revered values across these broad disciplines in regards to inequality.  Indeed, most Americans view a college degree as a ticket for the American Dream, and most statistics seem to confirm that notion.  From earnings to overall life satisfaction, a college education is a life changing experience.  College doesn't just have private benefits; it is a powerful tool to create a civically engaged, healthy and financially independent society   The American government realized the benefits of college long ago, to the point where the creation of a public university was a requirement to join the country as a state.  When passing his sweeping reforms, President Lyndon B. Johnson remarked that education was the antidote to the "tyranny of ignorance" that was holding down those in poverty.
Despite its noble mission, and clear benefits, college in America is failing its most basic test: accessibility.  Public funding for universities is declining at an alarming rate (as shown in tuition rises at places like Penn State), making it harder for students to afford school.  This creates an immense loan handicap for lower class kids that make it harder for them to truly break free and rise in society.  While overall college enrollment rates are up, this can mostly be explained by more kids from the upper class enrolling rather than an equal rise from all classes, and the difference is quite severe.  The top quintile of society has increased their presence in college by double the amount the bottom quintile has.  Even if kids from the bottom quintile get to college, they are six times less likely to actually complete school and get a degree when compared with their upper class peers.  Current economic conditions have hampered college's ability to help the needy through school.  Reed College in Oregon recently made the decision to decline admission to over 100 qualified students, because they simply could not afford to keep them and did not want to pursue other avenues of letting them in.  Colleges have increasingly been awarding merit scholarships to those who do not need financial aid (the top quintile), leaving those in need behind.  This can be explained by early life disparities, as kids from low income families are much less likely to have good scores, and colleges are failing to adjust to this trend, making the higher education gap only accelerate.
Clearly, a college education leads to immense financial benefits, and can be a catalyst to stop forces of class divergence.  Unfortunately, the ones receiving these benefits appear to be the ones that do not need it the most.  The upper class is dominating the college degree game, and all indicators such as early life success and state budget cuts imply that this divergence will only continue to intensify. Though the economy is recovering from the depths of 2008, the lower classes have not recovered. Despite being a beacon of hope to many Americans, higher education is only adding fuel to the fire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cell phone in hand, I pressed my body against the tiled bathroom floor and peeked through the bottom corner of the window. They were still there. Three trucks, parked in the driveway in such a way that blocked my one route of escape. I was trapped. I was alone, and I was hungry. I had no idea what these vehicles were doing here but one thing was certain: none of them were Bon Me.
This was not the way that things should have gone, in fact, it was the ideal set-up. My parents were away for the weekend, and I had the house to myself. Despite promising my mother that I wouldn’t touch her white wine or ruin the hardwood floors, I was more than prepared to throw a rager with the three people that I still kept in contact with from high school. But the surprise guests outside of my house was making that difficult.
But no. I would not have a party, instead I would stage a low-budget reenactment of Home Alone. Except, unlike Macaulay Culkin, I had neither the patience to set up a complex series of Rube Goldberg booby traps nor the ability to pull off bangs.
What I did have was an assortment of dirty dining utensils that I was supposed to run through the dishwasher, a panic button that my dad told me was linked to the police department, but which I suspected was just the garage door opener, and a half-empty bottle of Chardonnay.
And I had promised not to touch the Chardonnay. Things were looking desperate.
“Were you expecting anyone?” I texted my mother after noticing the trucks parked in the driveway, “a random man is walking around our backyard.”
She did not text back. So I had no explanation for why a man in cargo pants and a white t-shirt was trespassing on my property and barricading my car in the driveway. And as I live in Middle of Nowhere, CA, I was cut off from the rest of civilization, I needed my car: the nearest Starbucks was over four miles away.
Maybe I can escape on foot, I thought to myself, opening the fridge and grabbing the raspberry vinaigrette. I was panicked, but I wasn’t so panicked that I couldn’t eat a salad.
But then, about ten minutes later, the man in cargo pants rang the doorbell, and I’m no Emily Post, but I’m pretty that social norms dictate that you knock first and then case the house.
So this scared me. I was starting to think that this was not “Home Alone” but “The Purge,” where the masked villains ring the doorbell only to later break in and murder all of the supporting characters.
And this thought only increased my alarm, because not only was I certain that I would be killed off first, but also I remembered that a sequel was coming out, and there was nothing that I could do to stop “The Purge: Anarchy” from reaching the public.
So I didn’t open the door. Instead, I relocated to my safe-place and continued to text for help from the comfort of the bathroom floor. I was debating whether or not to text the police when the trucks began to pull away.
And it was only then, as the trucks pulled out of my driveway, that I was able to read what was written on them: ANIMAL CONTROL.
And I suddenly felt very silly. Because in addition to my mother I had texted all of my siblings and extended family for help and guidance. And now I would have to explain to them that what I assumed was a gang of robbers casing my house for a burglary in broad daylight was actually just Animal Control looking for a rampant cow.
And that is what happened: a farm animal was on the loose.
And the worst thing about all of this that it wasn’t my own imagination that had misled me. All of my delusions were taken directly from the delusions of Hollywood screenwriters. And not even good screenwriters, mediocre ones. As all of the movies that had induced my short-lived paranoia probably average one and a half stars. My paranoia was induced by a series of B-movies. My “Home Alone” sequel would have gone straight to DVD.
To think, if I had only been inspired by better movies I might have thought to open the door and assist Animal Control on their cattle hunt, or better, invite them to my house party. Who knows, they might have even brought their own beef.
Or maybe they would have just stolen the TV.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chief of the police department in Ferguson, Missouri made an incredible statement after his community became the focus of national attention. In discussing his work with the Justice Department's "community relations team" to improve his rapport with the citizens of Ferguson, he stated, "I told them, 'Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.'"
Consider that admission. The police chief of an American suburb does not know how to talk to his community; to paraphrase conservative columnist Mark Steyn, who wrote brilliantly on this topic, Chief Thomas Jackson does not know how to do his job. And he apparently needs the federal government to tell him how to do so.
As Steyn points out, this situation could not be more backward. Modern policing traces its roots to the Metropolitan Police created by Sir Robert Peel in 19th-century London. That force's nine principles of policing were intended to differentiate law-enforcement from military action. To this day, the British police do not carry weapons, and do not wish to do so. As Peel put it, "the police are the public, and the public are the police." Even more revolutionarily, the BBC argues that the police should serve the public, not the state.
But not in Ferguson. Andrew O'Hehir wrote in Salon that in Ferguson two trends converge– the militarization of American police and state violence against African-Americans. This argument is undoubtedly true, but too narrow. Ferguson, in fact, combines every facet of American racism with every facet of America's failure to temper the free world's most violent police force.
To take racism first, a number of recent articles have underscored the extent to which the sins of our fathers still define the African-American experience. To quote the subtitle of Ta-Nehisi Coates' incisive piece in the Atlantic on "The Case for Reparations," African-Americans still feel the effects of "two-hundred fifty years of slavery," "ninety years of Jim Crow," "sixty years of separate by equal," and "thirty-five years of racist housing policy."   Another piece in the Atlantic looked at how the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education is being undone in the South. And the statistics bear out the deleterious consequences of such a history.
In Ferguson, this legacy is obvious, or at least should be. The town has a poverty rate of 22 percent. And though its busing program survives, its schools are failing, and black families trying to move their children to better districts face "a backlash with racial undertones." That's why people at Missouri Governor Jay Nixon's press conference demanded that he would do about the suburb's schools. For them, the shooting of Michael Brown underscored just how their community had been forgotten. A child who had to fight through the still-formidable educational hurdles of American racism could just as easily fall victim to its criminal "justice" system, with little apparent concern from the wider world.
Police (and non-police) violence against African-Americans clearly fits into this history. Lynching in the Deep South became "He's got a gun!" in the industrial North, and across the country. O'Kehrir and Steyn name some of this trend's victims: Amadou Diallo (immortalized in Bruce Springsteen's "American Skin (41 shots)"), Rodney King, Sean Bell. But despite the obviousness of this national plague, despite the transparency of the history, despite promises of reform, we still get Ferguson. We still have a police department that is 94 percent white in a city that is 70% black.
Which brings us back to Sir Robert Peel. The police in Ferguson, and in too many American communities, are simply not the public. A history of racism and a national pathology for declaring "war" on non-military phenomenon like drug addiction has ensured that, in the areas most in need of intelligent policing, it does not exist. Why else would the Ferguson police have responded like Tehran P.D. when confronted with legitimate protests over what amounted to a cover-up?
(We shall here also stop to contemplate why trigger-happy black protestors with guns draw the National Guard, while white ranchers and militia threatening federal agents with a full-on firefight can cow the most powerful government on earth. See Brad Friedman in Salon.)
Despite all its negative aspects, Ferguson also points a way forward. Chief Jackson, whether his motives were pure or ill, was woefully under-equipped to deal with the needs of his community. He admitted as much to the Department of Justice. If his actions have demonstrated anything, it is that he knows little about the African-American experience -- with government, with education, and certainly with the police. The black Highway Patrol captain brought in to ameliorate the situation, Ron Johnson, has had mixed results. But he has connected with the community more effectively than any previous law enforcement official.
And little wonder. He grew up in the area. He appreciates the daily racism that still exists in America. And, at least initially, he had his men start "behaving like police." Subsequent events show that the United States has a long road ahead to cull its police forces of violent tendencies and to undo the harm of 400 plus years of racial madness. But, as Captain Johnson put it at a service for Michael Brown, maybe Ferguson is a start of "change...in America."

Leverett House reopened today for its residents after undergoing massive renovations this past year. It wasn’t so long ago, though, that Leverett House underwent changes of a different variety. Back in the fall of 2002, Lev was the first Harvard house to offer its residents wireless internet. (Hey, ‘90s kids, remember when you needed cords and plugs to “surf the net”? Remember when people still called it “surfing the net”?)
Upon moving in, students were surprised to find that wireless Ethernet had been installed in all Lev common spaces. Beat that, Stanford. To get unlimited access to MSN, AOL, and so much more (read: porn) from the comfort of any common area, students needed to pony up a mere $100. Back then, $100 was worth $1,000,000 of today’s dollars, and Wikipedia didn’t exist to help fact-check that math. (We just checked Wikipedia, and one of those two statements is definitely true.)
Not all students were so keen on the wireless deal.
“Buying a wireless card is not really worth it,” said Donald W. Van Valkenburgh ’03, Leverett resident and self-anointed predictor of trends.
Others, however, were more optimistic about “the Internet.”
“Going wireless is one of our highest priorities,” said Kevin S. Davis ’98, Coordinator of Residential Computing at Harvard Arts and Sciences Computer Services (HASCS). And if it hadn’t been for forward-thinking guys like Davis, Mark Zuckerberg might never have been able to invent Facemash from the comfort of his Kirkland dorm room just a little more than a year later. Then again, maybe he was still using dial up.
This #tbt was posted from the land of wireless internet.
