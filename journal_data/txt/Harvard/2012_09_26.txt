After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Romania, the 2007 addition to the European Union along with its neighbor Bulgaria, is still far from being seen as “European.” It began the transition to democracy and a capitalist economy after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and, for a while, experienced such a successful turnaround that it was dubbed the “Tiger or Eastern Europe.” However, in recent years economic conditions have declined and a political crisis and deadlock now have Romania in their grip. More ominous still, its hopes for access to the passport-free Schengen zone may now be dashed.
A wave of political turmoil brought on by corruption washed over Romania this summer, as its second government of the year was plagued by scandal. Early in the summer there seemed to be a breakthrough when former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase was convicted of corruption—the highest ranking politician to face the charge since the fall of communism in 1989. This could have been a turning point for Romania. It usually ranks high on lists of the European Union’s most corrupt countries and has been blocked from the Schengen area as a result. The imprisonment of Nastase seemed to be a big step in the right direction.
However, around the same time, the science magazine Nature accused the current Prime Minister Victor Ponta, member of the Social Democratic Party, of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. Facing a similar situation a few years ago, the Hungarian president resigned to respect the code of ethics, but Ponta, on the other hand, denied the charges and remained in office. These events damaged Romania’s credibility, already unstable over the years, quelling conversation about allowing Romania into the Schengen area.
But Romania’s political issues do not end here. Traian Basescu, the president and member of the Democratic Liberal Party, has the constitutional right to attend the European Council in Brussels. However, Ponta attended, ignoring a ruling by the Romanian Constitutional Court to the contrary and instead accused Basescu of manipulating the court and other public institutions. Furthermore, Ponta started proceedings to suspend Basescu for his own political gain. Court rulings on Ponta’s illegal actions were conveniently not published as the office journal came under parliamentary control—and the court lost power with respect to parliament.
Ponta blatantly undermined the authority of the Constitutional Court, thereby upsetting the respect for rule of law and democratic checks and balances. Although the referendum against Basescu failed because of low voter turnout, the rate at which Ponta and his ruling alliance were able to sweep multiple public institutions under their control is alarming.
Besides Romania’s likely exclusion from the Schengen Zone, Romania’s inability to deal with corruption appears to confirm the thoughts of many—that it was never ready to be an EU member to begin with. It seems to imply that Romania was, and is, a frail democracy at best, and now threatens the rest of Europe with its political turmoil.  What’s more, with the rise of right wing, extremist parties in Europe, this gives is yet another argument that the EU is too weak and divided, and should even be broken apart.
Presently, Romania is dealing with the economic crisis, as is the rest of Europe. In a sense, the clash between Ponta and Basescu also has to do with austerity measures meant to tackle the crisis, set up by Basescu but hated by Ponta. Ponta claims that the president has “lost any legitimacy” and “clings to power” when in fact he ought to be speaking of himself—or Romania as a whole.
Romania’s economy remains fragile, with its own recession on top of the global crisis. It’s Schengen entry remains fragile. The clash between Ponta and Basescu only intensifies and creates a deadlock in government, providing fodder to the extremist parties. The general election in November is expected to favor Ponta staying in power—flabbergasting the rest of Europe, alarmed at his tactics to consolidate power when all factors point to him staying in power anyway.
The European Union motto is “United in diversity.” A beacon of democracy, it stands for spreading prosperity, uniting East and West, and security. Perhaps the European economic crisis is overshadowing the events in Romania. But Romania, for better or worse, is now a EU member. And to keep Europe together, Europe must stand for its core values and oppose those who threaten them. Only then can it uphold true justice.

As the deadlock in our national government becomes more and more entrenched, it is important, now more than ever, that voters favor leaders who have demonstrated a rigorous dedication to solving our country’s problems. In the Senate, this need is especially dire, which is why we feel compelled to endorse Elizabeth Warren’s bid for the Massachusetts seat.
Elizabeth Warren has exhibited a dedication to the wellbeing of her fellow Americans that, on its own, should be reason enough for her receiving our endorsement for Massachusetts’ Senate seat. Given our economy’s lethargic recovery rate, however, we must also point out our overriding concern during this year’s election; namely, that a vote for a Republican is a vote against a healthy economy.
Elizabeth Warren’s background overseeing the Troubled Assets Relief Program and helping to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau speaks to her expertise in wrestling with tough issues of economic stimulus and regulation in order to improve the lives of Americans.
The fact that she pursued these lines of work in tandem with her academic career is proof enough that she is not an out-of-touch academic, as her opponent likes to paint her. Theorizing and philosophizing did not produce the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Rather, Elizabeth Warren had the temerity to put herself in the shoes of all Americans, and ask the right question: “Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible consumer products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?”
Our economy is still hurting from the consequences of that lack of regulation—and a close analysis by the Economic Policy Institute reveals that more than a full percentage point in unemployment could have been mitigated had our Congress provided more aid to state and local governments during the recovery. Such aid was a crucial part of the 2009 stimulus, and was part of many bills put forth by President Obama, including the $450 billion jobs bill proposed in 2011. The Republicans—including Senator Scott Brown—stifled these proposals.
Ultimately, our endorsement comes from considering more than just Warren’s uniquely well-suited qualifications for the job of being a Senator. Senator Scott Brown is extremely likeable, and his sincere attempts at bipartisanship are admirable. However, as long as he and other Republicans insist on voting against the aid our economy needs, they do not deserve our votes.

The conventions have ended, general election season is officially in full swing, and Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have begun the charge toward November 6. As the campaign progresses toward that most important of dates, I have found myself thinking back to 2008. That campaign is what really sparked my interest in American politics. At sixteen I was dazzled by town hall meetings, debates, and the constant analysis on cable news. I was engaged and amazed by the whole new world of politics.
But as I watch the 2012 presidential campaign unfold, I am filled with very different feelings, most notably a deep cynicism. I remain as engaged as I was four years ago, if not more so; I am often glued to CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and the Sunday morning shows. I generally avoid the cable networks’ primetime coverage since it is either generally uninteresting or sickeningly slanted and aggressive. I still find the arguments made by the candidates, their surrogates, and the myriad of analysts intriguing. But overshadowing this is a massive, dark cloud of skepticism. Where did it come from?
I doubt that there is a single answer, but it’s possible that the political atmosphere of the last four years has exacerbated cynicism that I would have felt anyway. In 2008, I was idealistic about the course of the country and the practice of government. As a high school junior, I still believed that the federal government worked the way I had been taught in school: The American people democratically elect officials whose primary action is to govern on their constituents’ behalf and with the country’s best interest in mind. Once the campaign ended, the fact that the United States, with its well-documented history of racial discrimination and division, had finally elected a president who wasn’t a middle-aged or elderly white male gave me hope (with no offense meant to middle-aged or elderly white males). Some of that excitement remains, but I doubt that I am the only one who has had much of their hope chipped away since the last presidential election.
Since the last election, I and many other young Americans have learned the hard way that politicians, even the supposedly transformational figures who come along at time when the country seems to need them most, do not always keep each and every campaign promise. Guantanamo Bay is still open, the national unemployment rate is still above 8 percent, and a balanced budget still seems far beyond the horizon. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is more concerned with stymying any efforts made by the opposing party and the President than he is with coming to the kind of compromise necessary for effective governance in a democratic system, faith in that system and those who lead it is lost.
Many Americans have grown up believing that our government is of, by, and for the people at all times. But the reality is starkly different.  In practice, our system of government is far from ideal. The interests of “the American people” are too often disregarded in favor of political gamesmanship. The altered tone and events of the last four years have only made this clearer. President Obama ran a campaign based on hope for the future and change in Washington, cultivating and riding a wave of optimism into the White House. But that wave crashed into the rocks of a divided government. Difficult congressional battles over stimulus, healthcare, and the debt ceiling have made the discrepancy between expectation and reality all too real.
I still have faith in America and its democracy. I believe that there are a number of politicians who genuinely care about the well-being of their state or district and the country as a whole. I still intend to do my civic duty by voting in November and casting my ballot in favor of the candidate who seems like the wiser choice. But I do so with a tempered sense of hope and a desire for change that far too often feels ultimately hopeless.

It’s been exactly ten months since the Mars Science Laboratory was launched on an Atlas V rocket from Earth, and after landing on Mars last month it is taking the first steps toward the most impressive exploratory science mission in human history. The mission has been an unqualified success so far, having accomplished every objective to date. The mission has also drawn considerably more public following than NASA is accustomed to, with even President Obama suggesting that a more interesting hairstyle, in homage to one of the NASA scientists, might boost his reelection hopes.
A large degree of the publicity that the mission drew was due to the Rube Goldberg-esque landing device that was required. While previous Mars landers and rovers were able to land using a combination of rockets and airbags, the sheer size of the Curiosity rover made it impossible to rely solely on these techniques. The key innovation for the Mars Science Laboratory was the Sky Crane, a flying craft from which Curiosity was suspended gently onto the surface for the last fifty meters of its descent. In retrospect, it’s easy to take for granted that everything worked exactly as expected. In reality, the majority of Martian missions have failed somewhere along the way. To successfully complete a mission of such complexity is, to date, the crowning achievement of planetary science.
Curiosity is the largest planetary lander to date, weighs roughly the same amount as a small vehicle, and has over a dozen research and science instruments. The rover is nuclear-powered, making it the most compact nuclear-powered vehicle ever created, and could potentially last for dozens of years, far outstripping its two-year mission length. The mission is notable for its focus on biological and environmental research, focusing largely on searching for organic compounds, investigating the history of the Martian atmosphere, and looking for clues that may indicate previous life on Mars.
It is unlikely that Curiosity will find any evidence of existing life on Mars, but she may find evidence of past life on Mars and could certainly identify building blocks necessary to support life. There’s growing evidence for the existence of liquid water on Mars, as well as organic compounds and even amino acids. Several of the instruments aboard, including the Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument and ChemCam systems, will give the most accurate readings to date as to whether Mars could support life that we are familiar with. So far the rover has traversed over 300 meters without incident (which, to my knowledge, is a record in the Greater Boston area). Last week, the first contact science mission was performed on a rock named after the late engineer Jake Matijevic by the APXS, a spectrometer used to determine the chemical composition of the rock.
To determine that life either once existed or may exist in the future on Mars would be incredibly significant in its own right. But the real significance lies in the fact that if life could exist on two planets in our own solar system, it’s a much easier bet that, not only are we not alone in the universe, but that the universe is abundant with life. Analysis of the Martian atmosphere and geology will also provide valuable insights into the Earth so that we can better understand and take care of our own planet for future generations.
There are many standing impediments to humans living freely on Mars that will remain, regardless of what Curiosity discovers. The temperature variance is immense, the atmosphere is not conducive to our biology, and, as a result, the radiation at the surface would cause an immense amount of damage. Furthermore, Mars lacks the protective magnetic field Earth has, allowing solar wind to continuously strip the barren planet of any atmosphere, meaning that even if we could give Mars an atmosphere, it would not be sustainable. I have no doubt that humans will someday live on Mars, but turning it into anything resembling home would be a daunting task.
We have the great fortune at living at a tantalizingly interesting junction in history. For the past 3.8 billion years our ancestors have been confined to a single planet, and in the past 50 years, we’ve begun to take our first furtive steps out into the void. Over the next century, we will continue to explore the universe around us and will one day, for the first time, call a place other than Earth home. In launching at the sunset of the space shuttle era, the Mars Science Laboratory is also symbolic of the dawn of a new age of exploration that is only just beginning. The Mars Science Laboratory will expand our knowledge of life in the universe more than any mission to date and is a key leap forward into the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing a lawsuit faulting the University and Lowell House administrators for the death of a 21-year-old man on Harvard’s campus in 2009, Harvard said in a legal filing last week that it cannot be blamed for the death of a non-student drug dealer who was killed during a transaction in Kirkland House.
Three years after the Kirkland shooting, the murder victim’s mother, B. Denise Cosby, filed a wrongful death suit in May claiming that the death of her son, Justin D. C. D. Cosby, was precipitated by Harvard’s negligence in allowing a student’s boyfriend to live in Lowell House for months. The suit was filed against the University and three of its employees—Lowell Co-House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck, and chemistry and chemical biology lecturer Ryan M. Spoering, who was resident dean of Lowell when the shooting occurred in May 2009.
Jabrai Jordan Copney, who was convicted of the murder of Cosby in criminal court last year, had been living with his girlfriend Brittany J. Smith—then a Harvard senior in Lowell—for most of the academic year.
Witnesses in Copney’s trial last year said that the shooting occurred when Copney, joined by two other men from New York, attempted to steal drugs from Cosby, who sold marijuana to Harvard students. Copney and the two other men invited Cosby into the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway, where they planned to steal marijuana from him at gunpoint, according to testimony. Prosecutors and witnesses said Copney shot Cosby when Cosby refused to hand over the drugs and tried to flee the entryway.
When Cosby’s mother filed the suit claiming that Harvard bore some of the responsibility for her son’s death, the University indicated that it would fight the suit, a promise it made good on with a motion to dismiss the case filed on Sept. 17.
Harvard’s motion for dismissal, which will be heard in Middlesex Superior Court at a hearing on Dec. 19, offers a three-pronged rebuttal to the wrongful death suit.
First, it states that the University and the three individual defendants “did not owe a duty of reasonable care to protect Cosby.”
An accompanying memorandum filed by Harvard expanded on this first point, listing many reasons Harvard did not have a responsibility to Cosby: their roles as property owner or employees of the property owner entailed no obligation to protect Cosby from a criminal; they had no “special relationship” with him; the University’s policies did not require them to protect people other than University affiliates; and they could not protect Cosby from “his own voluntary, dangerous conduct.”
In its second line of argument, the motion argues that the University and the individual defendants took no actions that “proximately caused the men to murder Cosby.” The memorandum adds that there is no evidence to suggest that Harvard “proximately caused Copney to plan an armed robbery and then murder Cosby in cold blood.”
Third, the motion says that even if Harvard owed Cosby a duty of reasonable care, the suit still should not stand “because Cosby’s criminal conduct was a direct contributing cause of his own death.” The memorandum adds, “When Cosby came to campus, his sole purpose was to commit a crime, and when he was shot in Kirkland House, he was engaged in a serious felony.”
Isaac H. Peres, one of Denise Cosby’s lawyers, said in a phone interview on Monday that he believes his client’s civil suit has merit and he hopes the judge will deny Harvard’s motion.
“We believe that the violation of Harvard's rules regarding having strangers, non-students, staying in the dorm overnight creates a security risk,” Peres said. “Having someone who's not a student staying overnight creates a foreseeable risk of harm to others to students and non-students alike.”
Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin reiterated the position in an emailed statement that the University bears no responsibility for the shooting.
“We recognize that the Cosby family has suffered a heart-rending loss, but, as we said when the suit was filed, there is no basis in law or fact to hold the University accountable for Justin ­Cosby’s death,” he wrote.
Spoering declined to comment on the suit, and Austin and Eck did not respond to requests for comment.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Sept. 27
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard claimed in a memorandum not to have had a responsibility to protect Copney, referring to Jabrai Jordan Copney. In fact, the memorandum said that Harvard was not responsible for protecting Justin D. C. D. Cosby, a Cambridge resident who was killed by Copney and two associates in Kirkland House in May 2009.

Thanks to the recent findings of a team of Harvard researchers, scientists can now view more than four microspecies at once using fluorescent microscopy—a development which will give scientists a fuller understanding of the samples they are examining.
On Monday, a team led by Peng Yin, William Shih, and George Church, all core faculty members at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, published their work online in the journal “Nature Chemistry.”
Prior to this new research, scientists using fluorescent microscopy, which uses fluorescent light at a certain wavelength to make microspecies visible, could only assign a microspecies one color: either red, blue, or green, and sometimes yellow. Now, researchers will be able to assign multiple colors per sample. Labeled microspecies will look like multi-colored bar codes.
According to Yin, his team found 216 different possibilities of the colored spots’ arrangement, which could identify and locate different cell types, molecular structures, and parts of a cell. These barcodes have significant implications for the imaging community.
The finding will also affect the biomedical technology community as using multiple colors will facilitate DNA origami, a process that allows researchers to bend and bind DNA to other molecules.
“We can essentially use DNA joints to assemble the nanostructures into long rods, and we can modify the rods with fluorescence at different locations. We then use these tiny rods to arrange the fluorescent spots into colorful barcodes. Basically now using three or four colors, we can have hundreds of different barcodes,” said Yin.
DNA origami is an important and “wonderful tool,” said Yin, who began to study and develop the technology in the spring of 2010, shortly after he joined the Wyss Institute.
“We’re moving fast in our ability to manipulate DNA molecules using origami technology,” Wyss Institute Founding Director Don Ingber wrote in a press release.
“The landscape of its potential is tremendous—from helping us to develop targeted drug-delivery mechanisms to improving the scope of cellular and molecular activities we are able to observe at a disease site using the latest medical imaging techniques,” he wrote.
Although the research team published their findings, the fruit of years’ worth of labor, the scientists hope to further develop this technology to make it more compact. They are considering different barcoding structures as well.

If you haven’t seen the food trucks or walked through the Harvard Farmers’ Market this year, you’re not alone. Just a year after food trucks first appeared in front of the Science Center, construction on the plaza has pushed the trucks and the farmers’ market to a less-frequented spot behind the Science Center on Oxford Street.
“In terms of business, it’s lousy. It’s nothing like the old location,” said Dave J. Purpura, who owns Plato’s Harvest, a farm in Middleboro, Mass.
“It’s a huge chunk of my sales for the year,” he said. Purpura attributed the decline in sales to the new location, in front of the Harvard Museum of Natural History, which sees less traffic than the Science Center plaza.
Some students, such as David K. Peprah ’15, used to patronize the food trucks but are less likely to do so now because of the new location.
“I don’t ever see them,” Peprah said.
Purpura said that some of his regular customers—people he said he has come to know by name over the years—no longer frequent the market.
“It doesn’t seem well-promoted,” Purpura said. “It doesn’t really seem like Harvard has a stake in this.”
The farmers’ market at Harvard began as a part of the Harvard University Dining Service’s Food Literacy Project and has been happening annually since 2005. Last year, Harvard Campus Services sought to expand its food options for students by signing contracts with several food trucks. The food truck project also supports the University’s Common Spaces program.
Kickass Cupcakes, a cupcake company based in Somerville, often parked a ood truck at the Science Center location last year but decided to withdraw from participating this year due to the construction.
“We secured a lot of sites in downtown Boston. With just one truck, we didn’t have a lot of availability to be at Harvard, and we were worried about the construction,” said owner Sara Ross.
Other trucks, however, have chosen to stay. Under new ownership, Lefty’s Silver Cart will be stationed at Harvard on Friday afternoons through October. The truck offers vegetarian food only, but expanded their options from last year to include more speciality sandwiches.
The previous owner, Philip Francis, attended the Divinity School and enjoyed participating in the program, according to current owner Erynn O’Neil.
“[O’Neil] had a great relationship to them and a personal tie. The place has a great vibe, and the College is full of younger people and staff that are into vegetarianism. They’re a little more open than a random street corner,” said O’Neil.
Both the food trucks and the farmers’ market will return to the Science Center plaza in the spring of 2013 after construction is completed, according to University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall.

Meredith McPherron ’89 was born to be an entrepreneur--both of her parents started their own companies. Now she is trying to bring the entrepreneurial spirit she is so familiar with to the Harvard Business School.
As the newly appointed director for the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship, McPherron, who also graduated from the Business School in 1993, said there are many opportunities to foster innovation developments throughout the University, in an interview Tuesday.
“Our mission is to serve our community, both as an exceptional resource for entrepreneurship and also as a primary gateway to vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems everywhere,” McPherron said. “We’re really excited collectively…to embark on that journey.”
Before coming to the Rock Center, McPherron was working on her own venture in the education technology space. She also consulted for several startups and held positions in marketing at companies such as General Mills, Guinness Import Company, and Direct Hit Technologies.
Now back at Harvard, McPherron expressed enthusiasm for the Rock Center, which consists of 34 faculty members, offers 26 courses in the Business School’s second-year elective curriculum, and is a source of funding and organization for many entrepreneurial projects.  McPherron assumes her position after the Harvard Innovation Lab opened in November 2011.
“Students can come to us for a very focused gateway to all entrepreneurial activities, both at Harvard and beyond, and understand what’s right for them. They can go over to the i-Lab for specific space and workshops and cross-collaboration experiences,” McPherron said. “We really coexist quite beautifully.”
McPherron sees other opportunities to work closely with the Harvard Business School’s Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development (FIELD) curriculum for first-year students, which launched last year. Under the FIELD curriculum, students are provided seed funding to develop their own startups, during the third phase of the school year.
“Our hope is that as these new businesses are developed in FIELD III, those that have strong interest and potential to continue will be well-supported by the Rock Center,” she said.
Business School professor Thomas R. Eisenmann ’79 said McPherron’s strong Harvard background puts her in a unique position to build partnerships between the Rock Center and the rest of the University.
“I think a big part of our success in entrepreneurship going forward is to get the University working together as we do at the I-Lab,” Eisenmann said. “It helps to have someone who’s an alum of both places to facilitate that.”
McPherron succeeds Business School lecturer Michael J. Roberts ’79 as director of the Rock Center. Roberts served as the first director when the center was founded in 2003.

While most freshman have arranged their futons and plugged in their Harvard-approved microfridges, some are still waiting on their last big item for their rooms.
On Thursday and Friday, 11 freshmen will receive a new Yamaha AvantGrand hybrid piano—valued at $10,000—which will allow the students to practice with headphones in their rooms. The loaned pianos will allow many students who are longtime musicians to continue developing their talents and, in some cases, composing music by just walking a few feet from their beds.
“For the moment, I’ve been going to the basement of Wig B [Wigglesworth B entryway], but it would be super convenient to have one in my room that wouldn’t disturb my roommates,” said Layla Siraj ’16, who has played the piano since she was six. “I can literally roll out of bed and practice without disturbing anyone.”
According to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman '67, the project was initiated when a donor wanted to increase opportunities for students to pursue music. “It’s a pilot, and I hope that people who are the recipients find that it enhances their chance to practice,” Dingman said.
The 11 freshmen were chosen randomly from a pool of 28, which was selected from 32 applicants, said Sheila Coveney, a department administrator at the FDO.
Ethan I. Simon ’16, who likes to compose in the middle of the night, is bringing his own keyboard from home. “I do a lot of my best composing in the middle of the night,” he said, adding that he would have applied to the program, but he mistook the dates.
“I grew up with a piano steps away from where I’ve been living, and I’ve kind of been going crazy without it,” he said.
Carl E. Rogers ’16 and Kevin E. O’Donnell ’16 do not play the piano themselves, but they hope to play music with their other suitemates, who are all musicians and two of whom are pianists. “We would definitely practice here in the room which would be great for them, and we could also use it to all play together,” Rogers said.
“We were going to form a musical quintet when we have all of the musical parts together,” O’Donnell said.
The pianos can be played silently with headphones, allowing students to practice without disturbing others. Dingman said he still has some concerns about noise, but each roommate was required to give their consent in order for the suite members to apply for a piano.
But the problem might not be with suitemates--but with the entrywaymates. Rogers said that he and his roommates have been reprimanded by their proctor for practicing on their own instruments too loudly.
“Hopefully we’ll be able to get away with some [playing],” Rogers said. “Our floormates don’t seem to care if we play.”

Forty-six public service programs received a total of over $150,000 from the College-run President’s Public Service Fund on Tuesday.
After praising the groups’ dedication to service, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds personally presented club leaders with notifications indicating the size of their monetary awards at a reception at the Phillips Brooks House.
“It’s not easy to get on the Red Line and go over to the South End and sit down and tutor kids and make your way back and do all the other things you’ve got to do,” Hammonds said in an interview after the reception. “It takes extra effort, extra commitment, and I really do think we should honor that.”
The College endowment fund awarded 32 programs under the umbrella of the Phillips Brooks House Association, ranging from after-school enrichment programs to student groups dedicated to supporting the elderly. It also awarded funds to 14 independent service groups organized by the Office of the Public Service Network.
Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service, said that most awards range from $200 to $2,000. The Summer Urban Program, which runs ten Boston-area camps each year, received the largest grant of $100,000.
Student leaders said that the money in the grants was critical for the continuation of their organizations.
“For PBHA programs, PPSF is a really crucial funding source for us to continue to do the work we do in the community,” PBHA president Carolyn W. Chou ’13 said. “Specifically, it means after school programs can buy notebooks for the kids they work with... it also means that our summer shelter can continue to provide emergency housing for people over the summer, it means that our mentoring programs can think about how to better do college prep and do other things with their kids.”
Jennifer K. Cloutier ’13, treasurer of the Harvard College Special Olympics, said that her group’s approximately $1200 award would be instrumental in allowing the club to pursue its mission.
“It will mean not only that we get to have another year of full programming,” she said. “We get to take our athletes to places like Gillette Stadium, we get to integrate them with the Harvard community because we bring them here for a basketball game with the Harvard men’s basketball team.”
Other leaders said that the funding would enable their organization to expand and broaden their impact.
“It’ll help us branch out to other nursing homes, nursing homes that we can’t access through the T,” said Connie S. Zhong ’14, co-president of Music in Hospitals and Nursing Homes Using Entertainment as Therapy.
Zhong said that the money would help the organization reach these far-away nursing homes by providing the ability to rent a Zipcar.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might not be the first year of college, but sophomore year certainly has its fair share of changes.
For one, it’s no longer acceptable to wear those colorful freshman dorm shirts.  The phrase “but the rooms are so big” becomes the motto of “quadded” sophomores who are still coping with the harsh realities of Housing Day.  And for a select few, that Mark Zuckerberg movie becomes a reference point to tell friends from home what a final club is.
The second year of college also offers a world of possibilities for sophomore athletes.  After learning the ropes their freshmen year, it’s now time for them to take on a bigger role.
That is, assuming these sophomores can survive the other changes in their lives.  Here are our favorite tweets from some sophomore athletes who seem to be going through a rough time:
1) Apparently, sophomore Nick Hopcroft gets emotional during movies. The squash player gave this cinematic review via Twitter:
"Watching project X actually a makes me sad as Im pretty sure I'll never experience a party like that ‪#bittersweet ‪#oneday"
We’re not sure what admissions video you saw, Nick, but what did you expect? It’s Harvard. You know, the school known for its academic rankings? That movie starring Method Man and Redman is not a documentary. But keep your head up, because most people will never experience classes like these.
2) Water Polo’s Thomas McNulty spends a lot of time in the water, but he’s apparently not too good with other liquids:
"Adding lemonade to chocolate milk did not produce the desired effect"
You don’t need to take Science and Cooking to realize that’s a bad idea. Besides, they already found the perfect complement to lemonade.
3) Earlier this year, we pointed out that Jonah Travis experienced some travel troubles on his way home.  Not surprisingly, it appears the Crimson forward still hasn’t taken our advice:
"Dude is 5 feet and takin ALL the leg room ‪#moveover"
Jonah, you are six feet, six inches tall.  That gives you an 18-inch height advantage. Trust us, the guy’s not going to do anything if you just move your leg. How do you expect to box out Division I basketball players if you can’t fight for legroom on an airplane?
Unfortunately, things just unraveled from there. It appears poor Jonah just can’t catch a break in the airport:
"I knew it would be too much to ask for to try and get my my N64 through security without being stopped"
We applaud the effort, Jonah, but given your airport history, it probably isn’t a good idea to take any chances with TSA.
Those are your tweets of the week.  Hopefully Jonah takes our advice this time and uses his size on the next plane ride home. Once he and his classmates get past the early sophomore slump, there is no telling what’s in store for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a six-game losing streak and two consecutive five-set losses, the Harvard women’s volleyball team looked to get back on track in its final nonconference showdown of the season.
The Crimson (3-9, 0-1 Ivy) achieved that goal at home Tuesday night, putting together a solid team performance and defeating Holy Cross (0-16, 0-2 Patriot) in four sets, 25-17, 25-11, 15-25, 25-19.
“I’m really proud of us for pulling out a win tonight,” senior setter Beth Kinsella said. “We really took control from point one. Losing game three was upsetting, obviously, but I’m really proud of us for mentally maintaining our focus and not letting that loss rattle us.”
In its last two losses at New Hampshire and Dartmouth, the Crimson was unable to win big points late in matches. But even though Holy Cross dominated the third set and appeared to have the momentum on Tuesday, Harvard began the fourth set strong and eventually outlasted the Crusaders.
“Knowing that we can push back when a team is pushing at us is something you can’t really learn in practice,” Kinsella said. “When it comes down to it, it’s about maintaining that composure and confidence, and I think that tonight was really good practice for that.”
Kinsella led the Crimson with 26 assists, while captain Taylor Docter finished with a season-high 20 digs. Harvard passed well all night, notching 67 digs to the Crusaders’ 57. Docter also led the Crimson with 13 kills, while sophomore Erin Cooney and freshman Kathleen Wallace added 11 apiece.
“Anytime I’m setting, I have three huge weapons in the front row, and I also have back-row attack,” Kinsella said. “When the passing is on, which it was tonight, I was able to switch it up and the hitters all delivered.”
The beginning of the match was fairly even, with neither team able to piece together a significant string of points. Although the Crusaders came up with a number of digs to keep rallies going, the Crimson took advantage of great blocking to amass a 20-14 lead, from which it never looked back en route to winning the set by eight points.
Harvard built on the momentum established in the first set and took control of the second game early on.
A series of kills from Docter along with great touches from her teammates allowed the Crimson to build a 14-point lead, the margin by which it ultimately won the set.
Midway through the set, freshman setter Hannah Schmidt produced a highlight when she went careening into the scorer’s table to keep a ball alive and continue a point, which Harvard eventually won. The Crimson closed the set on a 10-2 run.
“I think we dominated sets one and two,” coach Jennifer Weiss said. “I think everybody stepped it up; our team played well.”
Although the Crimson easily took the first two sets, Holy Cross refused to back down and came out ready to compete in the third set. A number of Harvard errors allowed the Crusaders to rack up points and win the set by 10.
“Volleyball is such a game of momentum, so each set is really different and could end really differently,” Weiss said. “Holy Cross’ defense was scrappy. They were digging a lot, and they really picked it up there toward the end.”
After dropping the third set, the Crimson bounced right back at the beginning of the fourth to gain a 6-1 lead. Although the Crusaders fought back to eventually tie it at 15, Harvard put together several clean points to establish a lead that it did not surrender.
A thrilling final point sealed the victory for the Crimson, as Wallace threw down a big spike after a flurry of blocks and digs from both sides of the net.
The rest of the Crimson’s schedule is made up entirely of Ivy League games. Harvard has two big conference matchups later this week, as Princeton and Penn both come to town.
“We want to play tougher out-of-conference competition so we can be better for Ivies,” Weiss said. “We got better, we fought through, so we’re excited for Ivies. I look forward to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, like all weeks in Harvard sports, can and will be distinguished from others by a pun: The Linterim is almost over.
The next six days mark the last before NBA training camps begin, meaning that Jeremy Lin ’10 and his Houston Rockets hold their first practices of the season in the Rio Grande Valley on Monday. That will mark Lin’s first chance to officially play with his new teammates after signing with the Rockets on July 14th. Lin, though, has already expressed his comfort with the new city and organization, tweeting this week: “1) people in texas are SO nice. 2) i got a bed. 3) @ChandlerParsons couch was nice. 4) his pantry was even better.”
Given what happened the last time Lin slept on a teammate’s couch, Linsanity 2.0 may be soon arriving in the Houston area.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, though, made sure that the Lin’s upcoming return to action wasn’t the only news in the Crimson alumni athletic circle. Fitzpatrick and his Buffalo Bills made headlines this weekend as they won their first game outside of Buffalo since game one of the 2011 season.
"We won on the road—we got that monkey off our back," said Fitzpatrick after Sunday’s game. "This is a new year and a new team."
Fitzpatrick completed 22 of 35 passes on the day, totaling 208 yards and three touchdowns. This game also marked the second straight week in which Fitzpatrick did not throw an interception.
Meanwhile, Matt Birk ’98 also had a stake in this weekend’s gridiron affairs. His Baltimore Ravens pulled out a last-second victory, 31-30, over the New England Patriots, thanks to a 27-yard field goal by rookie Justin Tucker. The Ravens are now 2-1 on the season.
The Crimson alums in the hockey world, however, saw less action than their NFL counterparts in the last few days due to the NHL lockout. After not talking for a week and a half, the NHL and the NHLPA met on Monday to attempt negotiations, but neither side walked away having made progress. It’s now Day 10 of the lockout and the stalemate continues.
So, for the likes of Louis LeBlanc, formerly ’13, Craig Adams ’99, and Dominic Moore ’03, and Alex Killorn ’12, along with Michael and Alex Biega, ’10 and ’11, respectively, all there is to do for the moment is sit back and watch “Fitzmagic” heave it to the end zone and Linsanity begin once more.
Here’s to a new season filled with pass completions, three pointers, and puns abound.

This week, The Crimson crosses over state lines to drop in on the club tennis team, which was in New York for the USTA-sponsored ‘Battle of the Sections’ tournament this weekend.
Sophomores Tyler Kugel, Tara Jain, KJ Stime, and Mari Georgiadis made the trip along with junior David Miller and seniors Tunc Kiymaz and Jack Dockterman. The young defending champions had their hopes dashed thanks to a costly loss at the hands of Penn State in group play.
After finishing group play in second, Harvard went on to split its silver bracket matches, losing a closely contested 26-22 match to Brown before beating Northeastern, 28-22, en route to a seventh-place finish.
“It was a special experience for us just to play on US Open courts,” said Jain, referring to the National Tennis Center on which all of the weekend’s matches were played.
While the University of Virginia took home the title this year, the Crimson did add some hardware.  The squad did its gentlemanly sport proud, taking home the Team Sportsmanship award, as voted on by its competitors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The beginning of a new football season brings with it an optimism of things to come. The Crimson lost a number of stars from last year’s Ivy League championship team, but through its first two contests, the team has looked solid, and spirits are high. Meanwhile, Harvard’s rival in New Haven is engaged in what has become a year-long comedy of errors on and off the field.
It all started last year when then-star quarterback Patrick Witt became the poster boy for what is right in college athletics when he was forced to decide between playing in the Harvard-Yale game or attending his final interview for the Rhodes scholarship. Eager to ride the wave, former Bulldog coach Tom Williams spoke at length of his own Rhodes candidacy as a player at Stanford who was faced with the decision of attending an NFL tryout or his own final interview. As Williams told it, he chose football over the prestigious scholarship and his quarterback, Witt, followed suit.
And that’s when the wheels began to come off for Yale football, which in a matter of months devolved from a revered football program to a punch line.
The Wednesday before The Game, The New York Times reported that the Rhodes Trust had no record of Williams ever applying. After initially claiming that he had been encouraged by an academic advisor to apply, Williams eventually resigned shortly after the season’s end following public outcry for his removal as head coach. That season concluded with a 45-7 shellacking by the Crimson in the Yale Bowl that Harvard center Jack Holuba described as “a little boring.”
Adding insult to injury, The Times then reported that shortly before The Game, the Rhodes Trust had learned of sexual assault accusations leveled at Witt and promised to suspend his application if Yale did not re-endorse him. And since it’s unclear whether or not Yale elected to do that, perhaps, The Times said, Witt hadn’t been forced to make a decision at all.
Though things weren’t exactly going well in New Haven at the conclusion of last year’s football season, everything seemed to be looking up after the Bulldogs poached four former Harvard assistant coaches in a rebuilding effort, including current head coach Tony Reno. Heading into the summer, Yale appeared to be finally headed in the right direction to restoring a competitive order to one of the nation’s most famous football rivalries, one in which the Crimson has emerged victorious in nine of the last 10 editions.
But in early August, Bulldog captain Will McHale reportedly stepped down from his position as the 135th captain of the Yale football program following a court date resulting from an altercation at popular New Haven hangout Toad’s. According to the Yale Daily News, McHale exchanged words with former YDN sportswriter Marc Beck before allegedly punching him in the face and fleeing the scene. Beck was left with a laceration that required 14 stitches, according to the YDN.
Though the second-team All-Ivy linebacker remained on the team, Yale entered the season without a captain for the first time in its history.
Meanwhile, even on the field, the Bulldogs have not been immune to disappointment and controversy. Shortly before the season, Reno picked true freshman Eric Williams over junior John Whitelaw to replace Witt at quarterback. Whitelaw then quit.
Finally, after a tumultuous offseason, the Bulldogs opened the year at Georgetown with a 24-21 win, which resulted in a Gatorade bath for Reno in honor of his first victory as a head coach.
But that happiness proved short-lived. The following week, the Bulldogs opened Ivy League play much the way they finished it last season, with an absolute blowout—this time, 45-6—at the hands Cornell. Down 42-0, Yale finally managed to reach the end zone with seven seconds left in the third quarter before botching a two-point conversion attempt.
In isolation, not all of these events would warrant a column. But when strung together in such a short period of time, it becomes more than simply an isolated incident but instead evidence of the decline of a once-proud program. After the events at the end of 2011, we would assume Reno and his staff would emphasize the importance of good conduct in representing not only oneself but one’s football program and university. What has followed has been emblematic of a potentially toxic culture surrounding Yale football that is in fact the exact opposite of the ideal that Witt was once thought to embody.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a last-second loss at Penn on Friday, the Harvard women’s soccer team will attempt to bounce back on Wednesday evening on its home turf. The Crimson (3-3-1, 1-0 Ivy) will face Central Connecticut State University (1-8, 0-2 NEC) at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
Though the loss to the Quakers was Harvard’s first road defeat of the season, it was given greater significance both because it was the first Ivy match-up of the year and because Penn and the Crimson have alternated as Ivy League champions for the past three years.
The team that Harvard will play on Wednesday, however, has not yet shown the offensive power that the Crimson has faced against previous opponents. The Blue Devils have scored only three goals on the year in a total of nine games. Sophomore forward Kerriann Welch has one of these goals, while she also leads the team in shots (15) and shots on goal (6).
Junior Allison Kelley has also been a leader for CCSU’s offense, totaling 12 shots—four on goal—with one score. On the defensive end, junior goalkeeper Nikola Deiter has made 51 saves on the season for a 76 percent save average.
Despite the Blue Devils’ record, Harvard will not look past this opponent, according to senior midfielder Aisha Price.
“We take each game very seriously,” Price said. “This game is especially important to us because we have had some tough losses. We see each game as a chance to improve ourselves as a team.”
Freshman Emily Mosbacher echoed Price’s sentiments, emphasizing the team’s focus on itself rather than its counterparts.
“We are going to come prepared for whomever we’re playing,” Mosbacher said. “We are really focused on improving ourselves and our game throughout the season no matter what. We all really want to win this game and that’s true before every game, no matter who the opponent is.”
The Crimson’s defense has proved consistent all year, largely thanks to sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten. Kanten has racked up 33 saves and allowed 12 goals in seven games, earning a 73 percent save average. The Harvard defense gave up only six goals in the first five games of the season, and, excepting the disappointing 8-1 loss against then-No. 5 Boston College last weekend, has allowed a total of only seven goals this season.
“We feel very confident in our defense this season,” Mosbacher said. “We have a young back line, but I think that’s to our advantage because they’re very talented. We’ve put together a really strong team.”
Among strong defense, however, the Crimson’s offense has had more power thus far this season. Senior Taryn Kurcz has led the team in goals, scoring three, while junior co-captain Peyton Johnson paces the team in assists with four. Several freshmen—forwards Lauren Varela and Mosbacher as well as midfielder Haley Washburn—have netted goals as well.
“From the back line to the very front we have a strong team,” Price said. “And we are young, but all the players are incredibly hard workers.”
Wednesday’s game comes after a brief road trip, and Harvard stated its appreciation of getting to play at home once more.
“It’s so great playing at home,” Mosbacher said. “Being on our own turf, having our own fans there to see us, and playing under our own lights is really special.”
The team, according to Price, is viewing this particular game as a way to move forward and a way to move towards its season goals.
“I think we have so much potential as a team,” Price concluded. “I think our team has so much to accomplish this year. This will definitely help us get to where we want to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many college students are finding it difficult to obtain jobs in the harsh economic climate, four former Crimson football players had as tough a time trying to find a place in the NFL.
Of the Harvard players on the 2011 Crimson squad who attempted to enter the league—quarterback Collier Winters ’11 and defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’11, both of whom were fifth-year seniors, linebacker Alex Gedeon ’12, and left tackle Kevin Murphy ’12—only Murphy, who now plays on the practice squad for the Minnesota Vikings, has successfully gone pro.
"When you play at a school like Harvard, it's hard to get recognized, it's hard to stand out on film because there's an understanding [among NFL scouts] that you're not really playing against schools with scholarship players," Ortiz told Newsday in April. "So it's definitely tough to make a name for yourself. There are a lot of good football players in the Ivy League, but they get pushed to the side and get overlooked."
Currently, three former Crimson football standouts are on active rosters with NFL teams: Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, Oakland Raiders defensive tackle Desmond Bryant ’09, and Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk ’98.
At Harvard, Murphy was awarded the Joseph E. Wolf Award for being Harvard’s top interior offensive lineman, and was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent shortly before graduating in May.
“[San Francisco] is the perfect place for me, the perfect opportunity,” Murphy told The Crimson after being signed.
But Murphy was released from the 49ers less than a month later. Shortly thereafter, the Vikings signed the undrafted free agent—ultimately waiving, resigning, and waiving him once more, according to ESPN—before Murphy landed a practice squad contract with Minnesota on Sept. 3. 
“Obviously, the rosters are very small in the NFL, so the practice squad becomes guys that you think have a real chance to make it, and therefore you’re going to invest in them.... So it’s a good sign,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
Winters, who won the 2011 Manning Passing Academy’s Air It Out” competition over future NFL quarterbacks such as Andrew Luck and Greg McElroy, participated in Harvard’s Pro Day and Boston College’s Pro Day on his quest to the NFL. But due to his height—the quarterback was listed at 5’11”—Winters was considered a long shot and ultimately went unsigned.
“It’s going to take the right team and the right situation for me to get a chance to get into the door, and the height obviously makes that window of opportunity a lot smaller,” Winters said shortly before the NFL draft in April. Winters also expressed interest in playing in the Canadian Football League.
Facing similar struggles, Ortiz, the 2011 Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, was undrafted and unsigned.
“There was a high quantity of players who also have the same skill set that I do,” Ortiz said.
Though he subsequently participated in rookie mini-camps for the New York Jets and the Chicago Bears, neither team elected to sign the former Crimson defensive tackle.
Gedeon, the Crimson’s captain in 2011 who also attended BC’s Pro Day, never signed with an NFL team despite earning first-team All-Ivy Honors.
“I think he was deserving of at least a free agent contract,” Tim Murphy said.
According to the long-time Crimson coach, Gedeon is currently working with the well-known consulting firm Bain & Company in Chicago, while Ortiz, a former economics concentrator, now has his sights set on law school.

It's everyone's favorite time of year again—flu season.
To help guard against winter viruses, Harvard University Health Services offers free flu shots to anyone with a Harvard ID. Until Dec. 18, show up on the second floor of HUHS in the Holyoke Center on a Monday or Tuesday between 12 and 3 p.m. to get your shot.
Want to get yourself vaccinated, but don't feel like making your way to the Holyoke Center? UHS nurses will be coming to a dining hall near you in October. Flu shots will be given in  Annenberg on Sept. 26 and Oct. 2, Currier on Oct. 3, Eliot on Oct. 9, Leverett on Oct. 17, Lowell on Oct. 15 (in the Junior Common Room), and Mather on Oct. 11. They will be there administering shots from 5 to 8 p.m. each night.
Sure, getting your flu shot in a dining hall doesn't sound appealing, but it's better than getting the flu in a dining hall. If you do get sick, stop by the HUHS pharmacy to claim a free cold kit stocked with cough drops, antihistamines, and disposable thermometers.
