Loeb Mainstage
Directed by Stephen C. Squibb
Produced by Bryce J. Gilfillian '12
In 1969, the Italian anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli fell out of a police station’s fourth floor window, triggering much debate as to whether or not the fall was an accident or a crime. The scandal—dubbed the Italian Pizza Fontana bombing of 1969—provided the basis for Nobel laureate Dario Fo’s 1970 political farce “Accidental Death of an Anarchist,” which will be produced by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) at the end of October. The dark comedy, headed by visiting director Stephen C. Squibb, is distinguished by its unconventional treatment: the original script was heavily altered during the course of production.
For Squibb, who has collaborated with installation artists and an avant-garde group called the Woodshed Collective, these alterations were in part necessary because of the obscure nature of Fo’s original text, full of references to Italian politics and leftist movements at the beginning of the 1970s.
“Politics is like football,” Squibb said. “People invest in it so heavily that they develop their own language.”
As a result, heavy revisions of the script bring out the play’s dark humor for modern audiences without the original text hindering their understanding. Cast member Isabel Q. Carey ’12, who plays the lead role of The Maniac, said that Squibb assembled a draft out of pieces from different translations of Fo’s Italian text. According to producer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12, this compilation is not a strict departure from previous incarnations of the play.
“Dario Fo himself would rewrite the script for every production, so this Frankensteinian adaptation is in the spirit of what he usually did,” Gilfillian said.
HRDC’s production also features a set designed by J. Michael Griggs, Technical Director for the Loeb Drama Center. The production team developed ideas for both the set and the script; together, Griggs and Squibb decided that the play will be performed in the round.
“I don’t like to repeat myself,” Griggs said. “so I was hoping to find a different way to use the space.”

Perhaps predictably, Occupy Wall Street has provoked a sibling’s squabble between leftists who embrace the uprising without hesitation and skeptical liberals. Liberals worry that the lack of ideological cohesion in the movement will render it politically inconsequential. “Where the movement falters is in its demands: It doesn’t really have any,” Nick Kristof lameneted as it started to take off earlier this month.
Leftists respond that this focus on near-term policy is foolishly short sighted. Dismissing critics like Kristof, the academic celebrity Judith Butler declared in a speech at Liberty Plaza: “Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands.”
I think the movement’s critics get the better of this one. It’s hard to think of a successful political movement that left its goals politically ambiguous. The Tea Party, envy of which, as Mark Schmitt has argued, seems to be driving many to embrace the Occupy effort, did not become a political force through inchoate rallies. It became important when participants started going to Congressional town hall meetings and making it clear there’d be hell to pay if Congressmen and Senators voted for health care reform. It was a clear demand, and lost the effort a number of votes, forcing House and Senate leaders to water it down for final passage.
Occupy Wall Street could have become similarly relevant through backing Obama’s jobs bill. There’s a lot for Occupiers to like in the bill: It’s put people back to work. According to independent economic forecasters, the package, if implemented, would raise employment by about 1.3 million by the end of next year. And it would pay for it by taxing the hell out of rich people. The Senate version of the bill is financed through a five percent surtax on millionaires. That isn’t my preferred policy (if I were king, I’d replace the income tax with a steeply progressive tax on consumption, perhaps implemented as a payroll tax) but it certainly jibes well with the demands of Occupiers for the rich to start paying their fair share.
So what happened? While demonstrators flooded New York and elsewhere, the jobs bill floundered. First, it was brought for a Senate vote—and failed. Then Obama broke off the sections of the bill focused on preventing layoffs of teachers and other public employees, and put that up for a vote. And it failed. This past Monday, Obama effectively conceded defeat by unveiling a set of executive actions he’s taking to boost jobs, declaring that “we can’t wait” for Congress to act.
This is not to say that the bill would have passed if the Occupiers spent more time lobbying their representatives and less time in tents. The Senate has a de facto 60-vote supermajority requirement due to the filibuster—with Democrats holding 53 seats, and some of those held by moderates who oppose the bill—the chances of it passing were always slim to none. And even if something passed the Senate, the GOP-run House would kill it almost instantly.
But the Occupiers at least should have tried. Their ranks should be clogging Congressmens’ district offices, not converging on big cities whose representatives are already on board. Obama and Democrats in Congress aren’t perfect by any measure, but they are genuinely trying to boost employment and achieve a more progressive tax code. Republicans, by contrast, credit high unemployment to people just being lazy, and are proposing massively regressive tax plans like Herman Cain’s “9-9-9” proposal . That there was no enthusiasm within the Occupy movement for the jobs bill signals an unfortunate tendency to treat these two camps as equivalent.
Equally unfortunate is Occupiers’ turn against the Federal Reserve. Occupy rallies have taken to echoing the “end the Fed” rhetoric of libertarians like Ron Paul, which gives aid to backers of growth-strangling tight money policies. Ironically, it was Goldman Sachs, understandably Enemy Number One of the Occupiers, that proposed last week that the Fed start targeting nominal GDP (NGDP) growth rather than interest rates, a policy that offers perhaps our best shot of shrinking unemployment anytime soon.
Look: Goldman Sachs is straight-up evil. I bow to no one in my hatred of them and their gambling-based business model. But they’re pushing a policy that would do wonders for the 99 percent, as are Obama and his Wall Street-financed Democratic allies in Congress. Sometimes, when the stakes are dire enough, you have to collaborate with people you don’t like against an even greater evil. For leftist Occupiers, this is one of those times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After October 31, Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) will serve only cage free eggs, a long-overdue change we celebrate for its environmental benefits and that came in the wake of a highly effective campaign spearheaded entirely by students. Although the movement toward cage-free eggs began with just a small group, it was ultimately able to enact a significant change to HUDS' policies because its organizers advocated effectively and intelligently, and its remarkable success should be a sign for other activists on campus that success is possible for their causes.
We hardly need to say that cage-free eggs are good for  hens, people, and the environment. After all, the typical method of housing egg-laying hens is in stacked battery cages, each smaller than a piece of paper, which leave the hens no room to move or carry out their typical behaviors. Such confinement often leads hens to harm themselves and others out of frustration. Respiratory diseases from dust, osteoporosis from lack of exercise, and death from being trapped in the cage's wires are common. But such conditions also harm humans, not just hens. Salmonella is far more common in eggs laid by hens in such cages. Waste from hens falls down on those below, and the resulting concentrated manure is frequently disposed of into nearby water supplies, with severe environmental effects. Ensuring that the 1.8 million eggs that HUDS purchases each year are not the result of this system is undoubtedly a good thing.
Just as important, this particular movement provides a blueprint for success to other student movements. It made its goals explicit and specific: a switch to 100 percent cage-free eggs, instead of HUDS' previous policy of using about 19 percent cage-free eggs, with the rest coming from traditional cruel, battery cage farms. This made it clear how the university could acquiesce to student's demands, and gave a clear rallying point for supporters. To support this goal, the campaign’s organizers gathered over 5,000 student and faculty signatures on a petition, gained the support of over a dozen student organizations and the Undergraduate Council, convinced more then twenty alumni to withhold donations until a switch to cage-free eggs was made, and discussed the campaign with President Faust at her semesterly office hour. This spurred outside news coverage and ultimately convinced HUDS to bow to the pressure and use only cage-free eggs.
The necessity of reaching a large number of people through a good PR campaign and targeting the alumni and administration as well as students can be seen through comparison of this campaign with the previous one. In 2007, when the school used no cage-free eggs at all, a similar initiative was launched, but it was less successful at garnering student and alumni support, and thus had comparatively less effect.
While activism at Harvard may be difficult, results are nevertheless achievable. What is more, they are greater than they would be otherwise because of Harvard's position as a well-known, influential university. For better or for worse, Harvard is often seen as a model for other universities, and other administrators often look to Cambridge for inspiration. This ripple effect makes activism at Harvard especially significant. In that sense, while we are proud that the cage-free movement has affirmed that such activism is possible at Harvard, we hope other universities and communities across the country will follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One hundred eighty to one represents the ratio of the highest-paid Harvard employee’s salary to the lowest. For a university with a $32 billion endowment, this wage disparity is ridiculous and embarrassing, and Harvard must amend it not only by ensuring good jobs for Harvard’s lowest-paid workers, but also by significantly reducing top executive compensations.
Harvard’s top compensated employee, Stephen Blyth, is the head of internal investments for Harvard Management Company (HMC). He took home $8.4 million in 2009 (the ratio 180 to 1 is based on his 2008 compensation of $6.4 million).  Other top executives also made seven-figure salaries, and President Drew Faust made $875,000. Meanwhile, Harvard’s lowest-paid employees, our custodians, often must find multiple jobs simply to support their families.
In a recent editorial, the Crimson Staff has argued that Harvard’s enormous pay disparity makes sense—after all, those earning multiple millions a year all work at HMC, managing Harvard’s investments and ensuring the returns that allow Harvard’s now-$32 billion endowment to grow each year. These hedge fund managers earn bonuses tied directly to the endowment’s performance. Between 2009 and 2010, the endowment did well; hence, Blyth earned $8.4 million.
The Crimson suggests that Harvard must pay its hedge fund managers a salary competitive with those on Wall Street. It argues that with no economic incentive to perform well, Harvard could never attract top hedge fund managers and its endowment would do poorly. You get what you pay for, right?
Unfortunately, Harvard is not an investment bank, it is a taxpayer-supported nonprofit. As a subsidiary of Harvard, HMC exists to further the aims of the University, not to generate wealth. In fact, in 2003, when HMC’s CEO made risky bets that paid off well both for Harvard’s endowment and his own salary, Yale’s Chief Investment Officer David Swensen spoke out against disproportionate compensation at the Harvard Management Company. Swensen told the New York Times in 2007: “Paying some people $35 million where others earn $35,000 tears at the fabric of an institution.” Harvard’s continuing 180 to 1 wage disparities continue to rip Harvard’s values to shreds.
Harvard’s administrators repeatedly tell me and other concerned students that the growth of Harvard’s endowment is absolutely necessary for our college experience. The interest earned on the endowment funds our financial aid, our facilities, and our academic resources.
Harvard’s operating budget is $3.7 billion per year, not significantly different from the operating budgets of Yale and other large research and academic institutions in the United States. Grants, tuition, and endowment income all contribute to this budget. Must our endowment really continue to grow larger and larger just to help sustain financial aid and House upkeep? Providing exceptional financial aid should not necessitate continual and exponential growth of Harvard’s endowment.
The Crimson has repeatedly endorsed the principle of socially responsible investment. After all, as a nonprofit educational institution, it simply makes sense for Harvard’s endowment to oppose genocide and unjust land grabs, oppose environmentally degrading practices, and affirm labor rights. If we acknowledge that Harvard’s endowment is not a Wall Street hedge fund—if we are willing to accept a slightly lower rate of return on investment for the sake of social justice—then we must be consistent. Twenty-two percent returns cannot justify $8 million salaries.
Fundamentally, Harvard is prestigious. Our alumni lead in the world of investment banking and hedge fund management. Undoubtedly, Harvard could find an excellent and successful investment manager who would manage the endowment for a salary less than what she would earn on Wall Street—in fact, most of HMC’s current executives probably would make much more working in the private sector. Those who choose to manage nonprofits instead of for-profits regularly accept lower salaries for equivalent work; this principle should extend to endowment management as well. But even barring this possibility, Harvard’s endowment can afford to perform a little less well than it has historically. There is no justification for Harvard’s exorbitant executive salaries.
The huge wage discrepancies between HMC’s top executives and Harvard’s custodians, dining hall workers, and clerical workers are astonishing and alarming.  Of course, ensuring good jobs for Harvard’s lowest-paid workers can help fix this dichotomy: For example, we must ensure that custodians receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work and have time to spend with their families, as requested in their current contract negotiations.
But Harvard must fix the top of the wage scale as well. No one deserves an annual income of $8.4 million dollars. We must cap compensation for Harvard’s hedge fund managers and HMC’s CEO—only then can Harvard end 180 to 1.

Another world is possible. This was the message carried by the thousands of protesters who swelled New York’s Times Square a little over a week ago, participating in a peaceful march from Zucotti Park in Lower Manhattan to this city’s main public square as a part of the Occupy Wall Street movement that has emerged in the last month. This movement, unclear in its demands but clear in its insistence that the status quo cannot continue and that another world is necessary, has spread to nearly 1,500 cities across the country and globe. It has captured the imagination of a generation and challenged us to rethink how we understand politics as usual. One of the more startling aspects to the movement, however, has been the brutal response.
From the beginning, police have made it clear that members of the public with political demands will be treated as criminals, despite all evidence that the protesters in Occupy Wall Street are not. Police have repeatedly entrapped protesters and arrested them at random, letting them off in the subsequent days only to be offered plea bargains that make obvious the hollow nature of the charges levied against them.
On Oct. 2, for example, more than 700 protesters attempted to march peacefully across the Brooklyn Bridge. Despite initial police orders for them to use the pedestrian walkway (which would have been an extremely tight space for such a crowd), some marchers walked on the roadway. The police walked alongside them, guarding them and, after their initial demand, not repeating the orders to leave. At the end of the bridge, 700 people were arrested for having walked across the bridge under police escort. All of them were released in the coming days, many bruised, but none with any serious charges to speak of.
The scenes on Oct. 15 in New York City were an escalation of violence on the part of the police that has little precedent in recent years. In the early afternoon, thousands met in Zucotti Park, renamed by protesters “Liberty Park,” to begin a peaceful march to Times Square. Protesters were forced to stay on sidewalks as they marched north; on an average Manhattan sidewalk this is a tough job but with the number of protesters ranging from between 6,000  to 15,000 this was an absurd restriction.
Once in Times Square, the protesters began to occupy the sidewalks, allowing automobile traffic to pass through while attempting to demonstrate. Police began to block the protest and set up barricades, and soon they had brought out cavalry to intimidate the protesters. From here, the situation fell apart rapidly; video footage documents the descent into madness as police on horseback rode through the crowds, terrifying marchers, and repeatedly charged the crowds, arresting dozens and brutalizing many more, as captured on numerous recordings.
The scenes were reminiscent of the kind of attacks Egyptian protesters in Tahrir Square and their counterparts across the Arab World have been subject to since the Arab Spring began nearly a year ago. There is a difference in magnitude and the kind of opponent Occupy Wall Street is facing. But the response to the protests has revealed very disturbing realities for American protesters.
It has become painfully clear in the last month that many of the civil liberties we take for granted do not in fact exist anymore. Last week for example, 24 people were arrested for entering a Citibank branch to close their accounts. Undercover policemen forcibly locked them into the bank branch and then hauled them off to a police station for the crime of closing their bank accounts en masse. The police, it seems, were there to protect the banks, not the people.
Less than two weeks ago, protesters in Boston were forced out of the Kennedy Greenway, and nearly 150 were arrested after they had been given explicit permission to stay by the park’s owners. Parks across the country have been closed off and protesters cleared out of public spaces they intended to peacefully occupy, including last Monday night in Worcester.
How is it that the U.S. government and many members of the American public could denounce Egypt’s former President Hosni Mubarak for not allowing protesters to peacefully assemble in Tahrir Square, but have only biting words for American protesters seeking to do the same in their own country?
How can Americans of good conscience support the police in this spiral towards a police state? How can we possibly justify the mass arrests of young people calling for change in the most pacifist way possible? Agree or disagree with the protesters’ message and methods, what is happening today in our city and in our country is a betrayal of the American values of freedom of association and freedom of expression we all claim to hold dear.

After spending the last 10 years teaching and conducting research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., economics professor and Nobel laureate Eric S. Maskin ’72 will return to Harvard in the spring.
Maskin, who was the Louis Berkman professor of economics at Harvard from 1985 to 2000, won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007 for laying the foundations of mechanism design theory, a field within game theory.
Maskin will teach Economics 1052: “Game Theory and Economic Applications” in the spring, and he plans to teach a course in social choice theory in the fall of 2012.
According to a number of faculty members in the Economics Department, his presence on campus will be welcomed.
“He’ll be a very forceful intellectual presence,” said economics professor Oliver S. Hart. “I think there’s a lot of happiness in the department about him coming back.”
During his 15-year tenure at Harvard, Maskin co-taught courses with Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya K. Sen and prominent political philosopher Robert Nozick. He was also the head tutor for applied math concentrators specializing in economics and served on the committee responsible for designing the quantitative reasoning component of Harvard’s core curriculum.
According to Maskin, the time-intensive nature of his committee work, combined with his tendency to overcommit, contributed to his decision in 2000 to move to the Institute.
“It wasn’t that Harvard was deliberately trying to overwork me, but I think I had a tendency to take on more things out of enthusiasm than were good for me,” Maskin said.
Maskin was drawn to the Institute for Advanced Study—a theoretical research center with ties to Princeton University—partly because of the Institute’s fewer responsibilities.
“The position at the Institute was very attractive,” Maskin said. “It gave me a lot of freedom to do what I wanted to, and gave me an affiliation with the Princeton Economics Department.” During his time at the Institute, Maskin also served as a visiting lecturer at Princeton.
But 10 years later, Maskin cites “personal, emotional, and intellectual” reasons for returning to Harvard.
Maskin first began his career at Harvard as a math concentrator in the College and then moved on to complete a doctoral degree in applied math.
He said that he was first inspired to pursue economics after taking a course taught by Kenneth J. Arrow, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics the year that Maskin graduated from the College.
After a year of work as a research fellow at the University of Cambridge, and eight years as a professor at MIT, Maskin returned to his alma mater in 1985.
“I have a strong attachment to Harvard,” Maskin said. “I’ve got a lot of strong friends in the department, who I’ve taught with before.”
One such friend, Economics Professor Jerry R. Green, has been in touch with Maskin ever since Green taught a seminar that Maskin enrolled in as a senior at the College.
“He was not only a strong researcher and a dedicated teacher, but a great servant of the University,” Green said of Maskin’s previous tenure at Harvard. “He is everything a faculty member should be.”

CORRECTION: OCTOBER 26, 2011
The Oct. 25 article "Economics Nobel Laureate Eric Maskin Returning to Harvard" incorrectly stated that the Institute for Advanced Study is closely affiliated with Princeton University. In fact, though the Institute "enjoys close, collaborative ties with Princeton," according to its website, the Institute has no formal affiliation with any other educational institution.

At Tuesday’s reception for the newest exhibit in Mather House’s Three Columns Gallery, the several alumni in attendance agreed that the most striking difference between Mather now and the time when they were undergraduates is the addition of the small amount of greenery in the form of the grass and trees that dot the courtyard.
"What a difference the trees make," said Mather House alumna Sally C. Ganzfried ’76. "It’s much more welcoming."
The exhibit, titled "The Creation of Mather," documents the construction and history of Mather House through a mixture of photographs, artist renderings, blueprints, and articles from The Crimson.
John Christensen, one of the original architects who helped design Mather’s famous tower, attended the reception and spoke at the dinner discussion that followed.
Students used Christensen’s presence as a chance to ask questions about Mather’s unique design. According to the architect, one of the most popular questions asked was whether, given the decade in which Mather was constructed, it was built "to defend against the masses."
"No," he said with a chuckle. "That’s not what academic institutions were built for."
The arrangement of the exhibit is a testament to Mather’s unique architecture. The two-story gallery allows art to be displayed on multiple levels. The current exhibit is arranged with pictures of the old Mather at the bottom and of new Mather at the top of the three columns that give the gallery its name.
Shepley Bullfinch, the architecture firm behind Mather’s design, provided the pictures for exhibit, which was designed and produced by Mather House Masters Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten.
According Hannah M. Cardiel ’13, a member of the Mather House Committee, the House is considering either making the exhibition a permanent fixture or bringing it back during the spring semester.
"This kind of exhibit hits closer to home because it’s your House," Cardiel said. "There’s a sense of ownership."
Both students and administrators said that they thought the exhibit was very successful.
"People here have kind of a funny relationship with the architecture here. Some love it and some hate it," said Mather House resident tutor Celeste Moreno Palmero. "[The exhibit] helps people appreciate it more."
Mather House residents, as well as Mather alumni and former Mather House Master Leigh G. Hafrey ’73 attended the event.
Hafrey was responsible for installing the gallery in the House about a decade ago, after a resident tutor suggested that the space was reminiscent of the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
"You have this really harsh environment and he really wanted it to be embellished. He wanted to have art everywhere," Hafrey said of Jean-Paul Carlhian, the architect for Mather.
The exhibit premiered on October 7 and will remain open through November 7.

 The vast majority—93 percent—of external funding spent by the physics department in fiscal year 2011 came from federal sources, including a number of grants from the Department of Defense, according to statistics from the Harvard Office for Sponsored Programs.
"The government is our lifeline to carrying out fundamental research," explained Physics Professor Isaac F. Silvera.
The $20.4 million of federal money spent in fiscal year 2011 represents less than a quarter of the nearly $90 million promised to Harvard physics from fifteen different federal sources over the coming years. More than one-third of that amount comes from the National Science Foundation, with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contributing 13 percent.
Professors whose research is supported by DARPA and other military agencies said that being funded by the Department of Defense does not indicate that research will necessarily be used for warfare.
Physics Professor Gerald Gabrielse, who studies the properties of antimatter using funds from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, said he is not aware of any immediate military implications of his work. Military agencies fund academic research to "keep an eye on" projects with potential applications in the future, he added.
Similarly, Physics Professor Amir Yacoby is working on the development of a quantum computer and sensitive magnetic field sensors for DARPA. Whereas NSF is more flexible when researchers deviate from their original research proposals, defense agencies follow the progress of research more closely, he said.
"They’re interested in the final product," Yacoby said. "They want to make sure that it’s still relevant to [their] goals."
Classified research is sometimes conducted using Defense Department funds, according to Department Chair Melissa Franklin. However, no professors interviewed for this article said they currently knew of any classified projects.
Gabrielse said he would not have accepted government funds if he believed that the research would be used in a way he deemed morally ambiguous.
But he noted that conducting research supported by the government is still a worthy endeavor.
"Defending our country is an honorable and good thing," Gabrielse said. "I regard taking government funds as a sense of trust."
In terms of total dollars spent, Physics was the third most sponsored department in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in fiscal year 2010, after Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Molecular and Cellular Biology.
But federal funding represents a lesser proportion—86 percent—of CCB’s total expenses for the 2011 fiscal year, likely due to greater access to funding from private sources.
Chemical and biological research can have direct applications to medicine that are appealing to industry, according to Eric J. Heller, professor of physics and chemistry.
On the other hand, physics is "not an interesting place for industries to invest" because the research is more "fundamental," said Silvera.
"Physics questions generated all the gorgeous theory and some of the experiments which have made so much progress in biology and chemical biology," Heller said. "They somehow don’t get paid as much for that."

Repairs that will shut down portions of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subway system every weekend for nearly six months will commence on November 5, in an effort to repair damage that the transit agency identified several years ago.
The work, which will last through March, will shut down weekend service Red Line service for the three stations north of Harvard Square: Porter Square, Davis Square, and Alewife, MBTA spokesperson Lydia M. Rivera said.
The riders who normally commute via the T will now be required to take buses—an inconvenience for passengers who must navigate the bus system and make arrangements for delays on the slower routes.
One such passenger is Sarah A. Payne, 22, who said she was unaware of the imminent closings.
Payne said she moved to the Boston area only a few weeks ago and uses the Red Line to travel between her home in Porter Square and her job in Alewife.
"[The closing] affects me dramatically," Payne said. "I have no car, so I rely on public transportation. That is very inconvenient."
However, Paul Regan, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, said that the potential dangers posed by structural damage to the subway line are much greater than any inconveniences caused by the repairs.
"[MBTA officials] have to do it. They don’t have a choice," said Regan. "People mistakenly look at short-term inconvenience as being more serious. This is a repair that has to happen because the track is slowly disintegrating. If they don’t fix it, the implications are that regular Red Line service that everyone depends on will be impacted for a much longer period of time."
The goal of the construction is to repair the concrete slabs that rest under the rails, Rivera said. Infiltration of water into the tunnel over the years has resulted in the deterioration of these slabs. The repairs will cost roughly $80 million.
This project was specifically cited in the 2009 "D’Alessandro Report" on the MBTA, Regan said. The report, commissioned by Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, stated that the Red Line north of Harvard Square posed a safety threat to riders and recommended it as a high priority project.
"It’s a critical project that should have been done years ago," said Regan. "They didn’t do it because they didn’t have the money."
As the MBTA attempts to balance the crucial need for repairs with the convenience of passengers, Regan said that closing the line down only on weekends is "the right way to go."
"The Red Line is the critical component of the morning commute," said Regan. "On the nine to five, Monday to Friday basis, the Red Line has to run, or not only does it affect the hundreds of thousands of people who ride it every day, it also affects every other branch and bus service of the MBTA."
Regan said that he thinks the multiyear delay in repairs to the line is indicative of the MBTA’s broader fiscal problems.
"It’s going to be more expensive to do it now, and it’s going to be more inconvenient to do it now," said Regan. "It’s a microcosm of everything that’s wrong with the MBTA, and most of that is the fact that the MBTA just cannot keep up with its capital needs."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
  The University plans to increase the price of a health care plan for some Harvard retirees, a move objected to by the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers (HUCTW). The University says that the "modest increases" are necessary to defray increasing costs.
Changes to the current retiree health care plan include the introduction of a $250 annual deductible, the introduction of a 20 percent co-insurance rate, and an out-of-pocket maximum of $1,000. The University announced the cuts earlier this month. The University announced the changes in June of this year and initiated special negotiation sessions with HUCTW in September to discuss the proposal.
A letter to HUCTW members from union officials Sunday stated that they are facing a "serious new problem on retiree health."
"In the past week it has become clear that the University is planning to implement changes in the retiree health program to which HUCTW has not agreed," the letter reads. "HUCTW representatives have argued, in the UBC [University Benefits Committee] and in other policy discussions with Harvard administrators, that a $1,000 out-of-pocket maximum is too high for lower- and middle-income retirees with limited income and assets."
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger emphasized the hardships imposed by the new increase in healthcare costs.
"We have some retirees who are living on $20,000 or $30,000 a year for whom the potential of a new $1,000 health care cost could be catastrophic," Jaeger said.
However, according to University spokesperson Kevin Galvin, University data shows that the average retiree would still spend less than $500 on health care per year.
Even with the increases, Harvard still offers one of the top-tier health-care plans among corporations and universities, according to University officials.
Galvin said that about two-thirds of Harvard retirees in Medex—the University’s most popular retiree health care package—currently pay no premium. He added that this group pays only nine cents in average out-of-pocket medical expense, meaning costs incurred after payment of the annual premium.
"The changes to our health care plans represent modest increases in what benchmarking shows are very generous plans when compared to university peers nationally and businesses in the local market," Galvin said.
HUCTW’s letter to the University called for a safety net for the "most vulnerable" retirees—that is, retirees who are sick or require expensive drugs.
"Even if there are only a few people who are going to be hurt by this, we’re deeply concerned about this," Jaeger said. "The University has said it is willing to discuss it, but it hasn’t happened yet and that’s what worries us."
The University said that they are not against instituting a safety net for vulnerable retirees and are pursuing the idea.
"We remain interested in discussing the creation of a hardship fund to help defray medical costs for some of our most vulnerable retirees," Galvin said. He added that while the University is increasing co-payments for medical visits, it is not increasing the payment ceiling, which means that people will actually reach the threshold for co-pay reimbursements after few visits.
Galvin also noted that the University has not adjusted the health care contribution for retirees in over a decade, despite the increasing cost of health care.
"Health care premiums have risen 8 percent for individuals, while Harvard’s plan has only increased by 3 to 5 percent," Galvin said, adding that the cost to the University of medical drugs has increased by approximately 20 percent over the past two years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s unusual for a defender to dribble all the way up the soccer field and score a goal or give an assist, but what’s even more unusual about freshman Lauren Urke is that she’s just as talented with her hands as she is with her feet.
Urke started playing violin in kindergarten, around the same time she started playing soccer, and has been an adept violinist ever since.
“[She’s] one of my best students,” said Steve Stenson, Urke’s private instructor for the last 13 years. “She has a very good work ethic—she works really, really hard.”
Urke took private lessons and was also involved in the Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphony in her Minnesota hometown.
“She’s obviously very passionate about her music, which is awesome,” sophomore goalie Jessica Wright said. “She plays violin as she plays soccer: to the best of her abilities.”
In addition to her private violin lessons twice a week and symphony rehearsal once a week, Urke put in an average of five additional hours of individual practice time.
With two time-demanding activities, conflicts between a practice, game, rehearsal, or concert were inevitable.
Urke’s toughest decisions came when she had to decide whether she was going to let down her soccer teammates or let down her orchestra.
But, when it came down to it, soccer was always her number one priority.
“Violin has always been something that I love to do in my free time,” Urke said. “I treated it as something extra. I never thought of myself as being a performing musician.”
Urke, who was named Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week on Sept. 12, has tallied one goal and two assists so far for the Harvard women’s soccer team.
Urke decided to hold off on joining a Harvard orchestra or music group until the spring when she’s in her offseason.
“I originally didn’t even bring my violin with me to college, which was very bad,” Urke said. “I had my mom bring it up for me over Parents Weekend ... I missed it!”
The Crimson players had only heard Urke’s musical talent through a YouTube video of her playing Édouard Lalo’s fifth movement of “Symphonie Espagnole,” a very complicated piece that took her two months of practicing four hours a day to learn.
When Urke was finally reunited with her violin, she gave a live mini-concert for her teammates in the locker room after practice last week.
“I was really impressed that she could play any pop song—we could tell her a pop song, and she could hear it and then be able to play it,” Wright said. “I was kind of surprised by the Justin Bieber song!”
Urke’s ability to play by ear is in part innate and in part due to the Suzuki training method she received as a youngster, which taught her to discern which notes are being played before reading the sheet music for the song.
Playing the violin might have taught Urke more than she thought.
“You have to pass the ball to where they are going to be, not where they are at,” Stenson said. “That takes planning ahead. Being able to read your teammates, that is very musical, very right brain, very whole picture-like.”
Stenson contends that playing music and playing soccer go hand in hand.
“There are many skills in soccer and violin that require a great deal of repetition and practice,” Stenson added. “Like they say, 10,000 touches on the ball ... the Suzuki teaching method is 10,000 repetitions of the skill, and you can master that skill.”
“In both, dedication and hard work go so far,” Urke said. “How far you can push yourself [goes] intrinsically [with] constantly trying to get better.”
Urke’s strong passion for the violin is one that she has shared with others. Through a mentoring program that provided free classes to economically disadvantaged students in middle school, Urke instilled excitement for playing the violin in many of her students.
“It shows dedication on her part,” freshman forward Erika Garcia said. “Anything she does, she does well.”
Despite her prowess in both activities, Urke never lets one eclipse the other.
“Soccer and violin have always been the things I love to do and the things I fill my time with because they make me happy,” Urke said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a strong showing at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Northeast Regional Championship, the Crimson eventually came up short on both the singles and doubles sides. After losses to fellow Ivy League competitors in the Oct. 21-25 tournament in New Haven, Harvard forfeited its chance to advance to the ITA National Tournament.
The Crimson entered a total of six single players and three pairs of doubles teams in the tournament.
Of those that competed, all six singles competitors advanced to at least the second round in the main draw, and two of the doubles teams made it to the quarterfinals of the main draw before falling to a pair of Yale squads.
Two Harvard singles players—senior Sam Gridley and freshman Sylvia Li—began in the qualifying draw. Gridley downed Penn’s Emma Whitfield and Quinnipiac’s Jackie Raynor, while Li beat out Aleksandra Pavlovic of Long Island University and Jana Luste of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
Gridley’s and Li’s victories in the qualifying round allowed them to advance to the main draw.
In the first round of the main draw, Gridley and Li sustained their winning ways.
The senior downed Jennifer Holtzberg of Rutgers, while the freshman took Stony Brook’s Polina Movcahn in two of three sets.
“Silvia played very well,” said Gridley, “It was a really good win.”
Despite the solid start, Li dropped a close match to ninth-seeded Misia Krasowski of Brown, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, in the round of 32.
Gridley couldn’t handle Penn’s 17th-seeded Aleksandra Ion, falling 6-2, 6-4.
“She didn’t miss a lot, so we had a lot of grueling, grinding points,” Gridley said of Ion. “It was like 30-ball rallies; we were the last people on the court.”
Meanwhile, Crimson juniors Camille Jania and co-captain Kristin Norton were able to advance to the round of sixteen only to have their title hopes dashed before reaching the quarterfinals.
Jania bested both Jessica Linero of Boston University and Penn’s 10th-seeded Augustina Sol Eskenazi before her winning streak came to an end.
Jania’s loss to 7th-seeded Vicky Brook of Yale in a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 decision marked an end to the tournament and her fall season.
Likewise, No.12-seed Norton handily took Adel Arshavskaya of Columbia, 6-0, 6-0, and Abby Liu of Hartford, 6-0, 6-4, before being downed by the No. 5-seed Erina Kikuchi of Boston College 6-1, 6-0.
Harvard entered the main draw of doubles with three teams, all of which advanced after first round victories, crushing their respective opponents.
Junior co-captains Norton and Hideko Tachibana—the top-seeded duo in the tournament—trumped Jamila Paul and Erin Colton of Army, 8-4, while Jania and junior classmate Alexandra Lehman went unanswered in an 8-0 victory over Abby Liu and Katina Zampas of Hartford.
Freshman Kelly Whelan and sophomore Hannah Morrill tallied a third win for the Crimson with an 8-1 match against sisters Della Taylor and Elle Taylor of Army.
Norton and Tachibana breezed through the second round in an 8-3 win against Dartmouth’s Janet Liu and Rachel Decker-Sadowiski.
“[Norton and Tachibana] have been playing doubles together for a long time and there is a lot of chemistry,” Li said. “They really know what they are doing on the court.”
Likewise, Whelen and Morrill also continued on to the round-of-sixteen after a decisive win over Lauren Frazier and Gabby Sullivan of Cornell, 8-1.
But the round-of-sixteen put an end to both doubles teams’ winning streak. The No. 6-seed Vicky Brook and Hanna Yu of Yale ousted Norton and Tachibana in a 9-8 upset.
The Bulldogs also forced Whelen and Morrill out of the tournament, with Yale’s Annie Sullivan and Amber Li defeating the duo in an 8-6 decision.
“Even though we didn’t have anybody extending to the finals of the tournament, we made a strong showing as a team holistically—in singles and in doubles,” Gridley said. “I think that it is really good to ... show other teams that we are going to fight really hard in all of our matches because they will remember that and be a little bit nervous the next time they play us."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s always bothered me when sportswriters liken a team’s season to a roller coaster ride.
The expression is overused and cliché, and I made a promise to myself when I started writing for The Crimson that I would shy away from those kinds of cheesy phrases that don’t actually mean anything.
But now, just eight months after my first article was published, I am going to break my promise and take a trip down Cliché Lane.
I feel forced to do this because following the Harvard men’s cross country team this season has felt like a trip to Magic Mountain.
Allow me to explain—to add meaning to this usually horrendous figure of speech.
At the beginning of the season, many spectators—myself included—thought that this was going to be a rebuilding year for Harvard.
The squad was returning sophomores James Leakos, Kurt Ruegg, and Maksim Korolev, and had picked up a top recruit in freshman Billy Orman. But in a sport that is entirely different at the high school and collegiate levels, I thought that the Crimson’s lack of experience would doom the squad’s chances of making a splash in the Ivy League.
In 2011, these guys would get a few races under their belts, learn how to cope with the increased mileage, and ultimately finish fifth or sixth in the Ancient Eight. It seemed to me that Harvard simply didn’t have the weapons to challenge Princeton and Columbia. Even Brown and Dartmouth would distance themselves from the Crimson’s talented, yet fledgling group of harriers.
Boy, was I wrong.
I headed to Franklin Park in mid-September to cover Harvard’s only home meet of the season: its dual meet against Yale. On that crisp, autumnal Saturday morning, I witnessed the Crimson’s absolute shellacking of the Bulldogs as it cruised to a 34-23 victory.
Leakos emerged as Harvard’s front runner that day. With nine other Crimson runners crossing the finish line within a minute of the first-place sophomore, the squad made one thing clear: this sure as hell wasn’t a rebuilding year.
For good measure, Harvard turned in an even more impressive performance two weeks later at the Paul Short Invitational. In a 45-team field that included some of the top-ranked teams in the country, the Crimson raced to a ninth place finish. Leakos once again was a standout performer, beating all Ivy runners and earning fifth place overall out of the 400-plus competitors.
Though Columbia showed why it is the favorite to challenge perennial power Princeton for the 2011 Ivy League title by finishing in third place, Harvard finished just behind Brown and Dartmouth in the team standings at the Paul Short Invite.
Third place in the Ancient Eight was a definite possibility. A bronze medal for a team whose top finishers had consistently been underclassmen didn’t seem like such a bad thing. I felt that the Crimson was on the up and up, that nothing could derail this team’s headstrong young runners.
Again, I was wrong.
I had neglected the unfortunate prevalence of injuries that mars the sport of cross country. I’d forgotten how frequently I see Harvard’s cross country athletes sporting boots and using crutches as they make their way around campus.
I’d fallen into the trap that catches many casual fans of the sport—the assumption that its competitors rarely get injured because they don’t go toe-to-toe with 230-pound linebackers who want to rip their heads off.
Cross country poses a different threat to those who are talented and dedicated enough to participate in the sport at the collegiate level. Though not as severe as concussions or broken bones, stress fractures and tendonitis have the potential to be equally devastating to a cross country team’s championship aspirations.
The Crimson and I learned this the hard way in 2011.
With the Heptagonal Championship meet this weekend and NCAA Regionals on the horizon, many of the team’s key contributors are suffering from injuries. Harvard’s once-loaded roster now looks a bit less promising.
The Crimson may have reached its “peak” at the Paul Short Invite. It appears as if injuries and the fickle nature of cross country may now be propelling the team down a “drop” in its roller coaster of a season.
Harvard has a chance to prove its mettle against Ivy League competition on Saturday morning. Only then will we truly know the impact of injuries on the squad. On Saturday afternoon, we’ll know if my bleak prediction became a reality.
Because let’s face it, I’ve been wrong before.

President  Barack Obama pledged to bring back 10,000 service members by January of  next year. As a response to Obama's pledge, members of the Harvard College Veterans Engagement Initiative are hosting a thank you letter drive. The organization's goal  is to get 10,000 handwritten letters, one for each returning service  member. Members wrote a template sent over house email lists that students could use in their letters. 
 Dear Service Member,  Welcome  back home! My name is John Smith and I am an undergraduate at Harvard  University in Cambridge, MA. I wanted to write to you to express how  proud I am of your service. I cannot express my gratitude for the  sacrifices you have made on behalf of our country. Countless service  members have valiantly served our country since its founding to defend  the freedoms that we Americans enjoy daily, and it is truly my pleasure  to thank you for all you have done. From the bottom of my heart, thank  you, and welcome home.   
Thank you, John Smith
 Letters can be dropped off in a box under the staircase by Quincy Dining Hall's main entrance.

What if you need to get to Ec 10 in five minutes and you don't have time to make a perfect panini-pressed sandwich? What if you crave Marshmallow Mateys at 3 a.m.?
 
Not a problem for the Annenburglar! From froyo to frankfurters, the Annenburglar's heists are swift, silent, and delicious. One member of this stealthy species of students adept at defying HUDS' ban on taking food outside of Annenberg documents her pilfering online to inspire other petty thieves hungry for a midnight snack.
 
"The no-food-outside of the d-hall policy is abominable," the Annenburglar, who wishes to remain anonymous to avoid trouble with HUDS, wrote in an email. "It encourages eating when one is not truly hungry in anticipation of hunger between meals."
 
The art of swiping food, the Annenburglar insists, is not a difficult craft as long as you have the right tools. "My weapon of choice is the tupperware," she wrote. "I came to school prepared with a wide array of shapes and sizes." Napkins or Ziploc bags will serve the Tupperware-less thief in a pinch, but you can't carry away pesto sauce or New England Clam Chowder in a tissue. After you have secured your loot, the only task that remains is to keep calm, carry on, and walk out. Of course, please aim for moderation. Taking a few slices of bread is understandable, but swiping two bags of bread at once is not cool. 
 
Never fear: your life of crime won't outlast your freshman year. Upperclassman dining halls generally have no such qualms about students taking food outside.

If everything predicted in science fiction came true, by now we'd all be riding around in our personal hovercrafts, vacationing on Mars, and taking a pill instead of eating three meals a day. Biomedical Engineering Professor David A. Edwards' new invention sounds like it's moving us one step closer to the high-tech elimination of food.
It's called the Aeroshot, and it's a caffeine inhaler. To use, you take a puff from the sleek yellow and grey cylinder. An entire tube—6 to 8 puffs' worth—of the lime-flavored breathable powder holds 100 milligrams of caffeine, the equivalent of a large cup of coffee.
Each inhaler's contents contain less than a single calorie. They're easily portable, even compliant with TSA standards. The Aeroshot takes effect faster than your ordinary caffeine sources, since the powder instantly dissolves on the tongue.
Edwards has been working with the idea of aerosolized substances for years now. He started out in in the 1990s with drugs such as inhalable insulin and tuberculosis medication.
Living in Paris and inspired by a new French ban on smoking in public places, Edwards then dreamed up a new idea.
"People really liked the idea of consuming chocolate and coffee as smoke," he said. He soon launched Le Whif, a food-flavored inhaler. Last year, over 400,000 of the novelty product were sold, according to Jon T. Staff V '10, operations manager at Breathable Foods, the company that distributes the existing Le Whif products and the new Aeroshot (and employs a number of former Harvard students).
The Aeroshot will officially launch in January at a price of $2.49 apiece, starting in Boston and New York, Edwards said. If you want to try it now, you can request a free sample at aeroshots.com. The coffee and chocolate flavors sell at Cardullo's for $1.99 each.
If you're concerned about the fate of solid food, don't get too worried. Edwards said that the Aeroshot represents not a replacement for good old coffee and energy drinks, but one more option in a sleep-deprived student's arsenal. He himself still wakes up to three espressos every morning, then uses his inhaler to stay alert the rest of the day.

They're ambitious. Or maybe they're insane. They're each writing a novel in 30 days.
 
Starting  this Tuesday, a group of about ten Harvard freshmen plan to participate  in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), an event that challenges  people nationwide to pen a 50,000-word novel in the month of November  alone.
 
Started  in 1999, the creative writing project that began with just 21  participants attracted more than 200,000 writers last year who  collectively logged more than 2.8 billion words.
 
"I  look forward to this all year," said Kasey A. LeBlanc '15, who has  participated in NaNoWriMo twice before. This year, she said she's  planning on writing a young adult dystopian novel. "That’s about as  specific as I'm getting because that's about as specific as the plot is  right now," she said.
 
Dennis  A. Sun '15, who participated in the project for the first time last  year, is also eager to start writing again. "NaNo gives me an excuse to  write as much as I can," he said. And while the task of writing an  average of 1,667 words a day is daunting, especially on top of a Harvard  schedule, Sun said that NaNoWriMo is the perfect opportunity for "those  one-day novelists" who have always talked about writing a novel but  never found the time or motivation to do so. "It's like boot camp," he  said. "You have to write. You don't have a choice."
 
The freshmen writers plan to meet for writing sessions together four times a week.
 
The  survivors say that while good time management, Facebook avoidance, and  Write or Die (a free word processor which begins screeching and even  deleting words if you stop writing for more than a designated period of  time) are important tools for the 30-day novelist, the real key to  NaNoWriMo success is persistence.
 
"Around  week two, you will inevitability feel like your plot is going to fall  apart," Sun said. "But don't edit. Your inner editor is like the Satan  sitting on your shoulder. You have to ignore it. You have to keep going.  If you can make it to 25,000 words, you'll be fine."
 
For  Sun and LeBlanc, the most rewarding aspect of NaNoWriMo is not the  novel's quality but the accomplishment of writing it. "You don't have to  take this seriously," Sun said. "You can write the most absurd  things—there will be brilliance somewhere."

It's no secret that Harvard's neo-Georgian buildings are home to many hidden architectural quirks: a doorway concealed in the Dunster library's bookshelves; a secret staircase between Kirkland House entryways; and a clandestine extra room in an Adams House suite. But many of Harvard's most interesting architectural oddities can be seen right out in the open.
 
Sever's Whispering Arch: If you stand on one side of the arch at the entrance to this classroom building and a friend stands on the other, you can whisper messages to each other that even those standing right in the middle of the arch can't hear. Although you're positioned back to back and several feet apart, it sounds like your friend is whispering right in your ear!
 
Pforzheimer House Mirrors: Full-length mirrors in dorm rooms can be a hassle: hung too high, hung too low, or getting you termbilled because they're hung at all. In Pforzheimer's Comstock, Holmes, and Moors Halls, however, there is no need for dealing with pesky in-room mirrors, because there is a three-way mirror on every floor. You can have a fashion show in the hallway any time you want, or sneak a glance to check that your hair looks good in back or your salmon pants don't clash with your paisley shirt. With this upper hand, we expect Pfoho residents to be costumed to perfection this Halloween.
 
Warren House: Home from 1891 to 1899 to reclusive Sanskrit scholar Henry Clarke Warren, Class of 1879, Warren House is used today by the Folklore and Mythology and Celtic Languages and Literatures departments. The building now houses offices, classrooms—and a bath?! This vestige of Warren's tenancy in the building is not the only eccentricity he left behind. He also installed aquariums and skylights to brighten his solitary time there.
 
Widener Steps: Ever wondered why each of the steps up to Widener is so short? Standing at five inches tall, the steps were built this way, Professor of Visual and Environmental Studies John R. Stilgoe told the Harvard Gazette, because the construction of the library in the early 20th century coincided with a fleeting trend when skirts that cinched tightly around the ankle were all the rage.

The undergraduate student body at Harvard may be diverse, but most of us like chocolate, and most of us also like saving the world. Sounds like we are the perfect market for a group of students who are selling chocolate bars to help fund medical supplies that they will bring to Honduras on a January trip.
The 26-student group is part of the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum. They plan to set up a dental clinic and provide other medical aid in Honduras.
Edirin E. Sido '14, who said she wants to become a dentist so that she can promote oral hygiene in her parents' native Nigeria, is eagerly selling candy and looking forward to the trip.
"If you don't take care of [a small dental problem], it can get worse and you can have a really big problem," Sido said, noting that there are just 0.57 physicians per 1000 people in Honduras.
To purchase the $1 chocolate bars and contribute to the purchase of medical supplies, email Sido at edirinsido@college.harvard.edu.
This post has been revised to reflect the following the corrections:
CORRECTION: October 27, 2011
An earlier version of the October 26 post "Chocolate That's Actually Good for Teeth" misidentified the number of students going on the trip. Twenty-six students are, in fact, going on the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum-sponsored trip.
