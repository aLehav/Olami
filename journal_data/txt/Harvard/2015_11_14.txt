After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HAMDEN, Conn.—When No. 4/3 Quinnipiac’s Tommy Schutt lit the lamp to break a scoreless tie less than three minutes into the second period Friday night, the No. 7/6 Harvard men’s hockey team found itself in a familiar situation. Schutt’s third goal of the season, the product of a Crimson turnover deep in its own zone, marked the fourth consecutive game in which Harvard had surrendered the first goal.
But when Bobcat junior co-captain Sam Anas went top-shelf 10 minutes later to hand the Crimson its first multi-goal deficit of the season, Harvard entered uncharted territory. And moments later, when the officials issued sophomore forward Seb Lloyd a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct, the Crimson ran itself into a hole it could not escape.
On the ensuing power play, junior center Tim Clifton netted the Bobcats’ third goal of the period, redirecting a Derek Smith drive past rookie goaltender Michael Lackey from just outside the crease, paving the way for a 4-1 Quinnipiac (9-0-0, 3-0-0 ECAC) victory at High Point Solutions Arena.
“I thought we just weren’t ready to play as hard as we needed to play,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 after the Crimson's first loss of the season.
After surrendering the first two goals, Harvard (3-1-1, 3-1-1) had an opportunity to cut the deficit in half when sophomore forward Andrew Taverner was sent to the box for slashing. But up against a penalty-killing unit that has surrendered a power-play goal in just one of its nine games, the Crimson could not muster much of anything. And Harvard quickly paid the price.
A minute after the Bobcat penalty’s expiration, Lloyd sent sophomore defenseman Kevin McKernan flying into the boards next to the Crimson bench, drawing a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct. After Lloyd departed to the Harvard locker room, Clifton produced the first of his two goals on the night to send his side into the second intermission with a three-goal lead.
“Even though they were putting the pressure on us a little bit, we were still a shot away from making it a game,” Donato said. “To take a bad penalty to put a good team on a power play for five minutes [and] give up a power play goal, now the game’s a little bit more of an uphill chase.”
After failing to convert on the man advantage before the major penalty, the Crimson nearly found a breakthrough courtesy of freshman forward Michael Floodstrand. Positioned deep in the right corner, junior forward Luke Esposito fed the rookie as he darted towards the goalmouth. But as the freshman lifted the puck on his backhand from the left post, senior goaltender Michael Garteig sprawled out on all fours to make the stop.
Floodstrand and junior forward Sean Malone, who nearly beat Garteig with a wrister from the slot in the first period, produced Harvard's best scoring opportunities, which were few and far between on the night. The Crimson's top line of Jimmy Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and Alex Kerfoot—which produced 18 points through the first four games—generated just two shots through the first two periods as Harvard struggled to create offensive opportunities.
Quinnipiac’s scoring opportunities arose with much more regularity. After a slow start, Schutt put the Bobcats on the board early in the second period after junior K.J. Tiefenwerth fanned on a shot in close, allowing the puck to trickle over to the 6’0” center on the doorstep. Anas followed suit with the 50th goal of his career 10 minutes later, picking top corner against Lackey from the right circle after receiving a pass from linemate Landon Smith deep in the corner.
“I thought our first period, we were a little bit nervous,” Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold said. “I thought we were a little panicky. I thought Harvard maybe was a little bit too…. But I thought we both settled a down a little bit in the second, and that’s where our depth really came in.”
The Bobcats finished with 28 shots to the Crimson’s 20, controlling the bulk of the action over the final two periods. Garteig saved 19 of the 20 shots that came his way to earn his ninth consecutive win in net.
The only shot to make its way past Garteig came on a Harvard 6-on-3 off the stick of sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman, who poked the puck by the senior in the middle of a crowded crease in the game’s final minute. But off the ensuing faceoff, Clifton immediately found the empty net to return the hosts’ lead back to three.
“Our overall compete level needs to be better, and our ability to persevere and stay with what we’re trying to do needs to be better,” Donato said. “When it’s all said and done, we beat ourselves.”

New faces, same result.
Returning just under 30 percent of its minutes from a year before, the Harvard men’s basketball team (1-0) returned to business in its season opener Friday night, a 59-39 victory over MIT. The Crimson held MIT to just 11 points in the first 13 minutes of the second half, turning a six-point halftime lead into a 24-point advantage. After MIT drew within two early in the second half, Harvard scored on 10 straight possessions to push the lead to 20 and secure its 14th consecutive victory over the Engineers.
“We didn’t play perfectly offensively and obviously our shooting percentage, especially in the first half, wasn’t great, but I liked how we bounced back in the second half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
After losing seven seniors to graduation and senior Siyani Chambers to an offseason injury, the focus to start the season was on the Crimson’s youth. Amaker started an all-freshman backcourt, pairing Tommy McCarthy alongside Corey Johnson. McCarthy saw the bulk of the meaningful minutes at point guard for the Crimson, leading the team in both points (12) and assists (three) in his college debut.
The freshman’s buckets came at opportunistic moments for the Crimson. After the Crimson fell behind by four early on a three-pointer by MIT’s Tim Butala, McCarthy sprinted up the floor, drawing contact and banking in a layup for a three-point play.
In the second half, McCarthy jump-started the Crimson surge with a three-pointer that pushed the lead to five. Three possessions later, he got fouled taking another trey. After sinking all three free throws, he poked the ball away from Jomard Bradley and hit a fast-break layup that pushed the lead to 13. His assist to senior Agunwa Okolie two minutes later put the Crimson up by 17, and the lead was double digits the rest of the way.
“At halftime, I think the lead was six, we talked about those first four minutes, it can go to 12 or it can go to two,” captain Evan Cummins said. “We wanted to make sure that we really were more aggressive and that it was going up and not tighter.”
For the first 13 minutes of the game, however, the Crimson struggled to gain separation. Harvard made just nine shots in the first half against six turnovers, benefitting from five Engineer miscues and three missed free throws.
McCarthy and Johnson were not spared from the offensive slog, missing nine of 12 shots in the opening period. Junior Zena Edosomwan, who had 21 points and 12 rebounds in the team’s public scrimmage against McGill a week prior, was visibly frustrated on the interior and went without a field goal for the first 20 minutes.
Edosomwan continue to post aggressively, however, drawing fouls repeatedly throughout the first half. The Engineers had 10 fouls in the first 20 minutes and 22 for the game, with the team’s top three big men all fouling out in under 25 minutes of play. The junior finished with just six points but had six rebounds in his 17 minutes, includes two of the team’s 14 offensive rebounds.
“They were in real trouble with fouls and with Zena, the way he was posting so hard, it is almost impossible to keep him out of there without fouling,” Cummins said. “Their big guys picked up fouls and it got to the point where they couldn’t guard him because they have four fouls and he was making plays.”
On the defensive end, the team locked down from the opening tip. Wing Justin Pedley, MIT’s leading scorer and three-point shooter last year, went without a single made field goal on the night. Guard Bradley Jomard led MIT with 10 points, but just four came after halftime.
“I was pleased with our defense,” Amaker said. “I think it’s been our calling card in our program and it is part our identity. It’s important for us to feel like we have lived up to that defensively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 14, 2015, at 5:02 p.m.
It was 2012 when the Harvard and Penn football teams last met with an Ivy League title on the line for both sides. When the game ended, it was the Quakers celebrating the championship on Franklin Field.
The location was different on Saturday, and the Ivy title remained up for grabs when the clock expired. But it was still the navy and white jerseys rejoicing at the game’s end.
A number of costly Harvard (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) missteps and a big day from Penn quarterback Alek Torgersen allowed the Quakers (6-3, 5-1) to do what no other opponent has done against Harvard over the last 22 weeks of play—win.
“Penn’s an outstanding team. They did a great job and they deserved to win,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “The bottom line is we made too many mistakes.”
The 35-25 loss at Harvard Stadium marks the Crimson’s first defeat since Oct. 26, 2013, and creates a three-way tie at the top of the Ivy League between Dartmouth, Harvard, and Penn entering the final week of the 2015 season. A win on Saturday would have clinched a share of the conference title for the Crimson.
Trailing by 10 points with less than four minutes remaining, Harvard found itself driving downfield in an attempt to claw its way back in the game. But a bruising tackle on sophomore running back Semar Smith caused the ball to pop out at the Penn 18-yard line, effectively ending the Crimson’s hopes for a comeback.
The turnover was the latest in a series of miscues by Harvard, which included a blocked field goal, a pair of failed two-point conversions, a missed extra point, and a second-quarter fumble by senior running back Paul Stanton at Penn’s 11-yard line.
“In the end, they just made a few more plays,” Murphy said. “Specifically, in a tough game like that you have to come out on the good side of the turnover margin…. It’s just very difficult to beat a really, really good team doing those things.”
Playing without three-year starting offensive lineman Anthony Fabiano, the Crimson offensive line allowed five sacks on the day, the same number Harvard had surrendered through the previous eight games combined.
“Our guys upfront do a great job with pass rush,” Penn linebacker Donald Panciello said. “I think once [senior quarterback Scott Hosch] scrambled and felt the pressure, he didn’t want a part of it.”
Hosch suffered his first loss as starting quarterback as the Crimson failed to register points in the second half for the first time all season. Hosch totaled 246 passing yards and two touchdowns.
The Crimson scored 19 unanswered points in the second quarter to take a 25-21 lead heading into halftime, but the advantage was short-lived. Penn’s Lonnie Tuff returned the opening kickoff of the third quarter all the way to the Harvard 39-yard line. Four plays later, Torgersen hit a wide-open tight end Ryan Kelly with a 28-yard strike for the go-ahead touchdown.
Three drives later, the Crimson faced a fourth-and-one at the Penn 10-yard line. Murphy elected to attempt a 27-yard field goal to tie the game, but the kick was blocked. On Penn’s ensuing possession, a 79-yard end-around dash by receiver Justin Watson gave the visitors a 35-25 advantage early in the fourth quarter.
“It was really just a standard outside run…but that was the best I’ve ever seen it blocked,” Watson said. “I’ve never seen a hole that big, and those guys opened it up.”
Torgersen ended the day with 245 yards and two touchdowns through the air, as well as two more on the ground. Watson registered 249 all-purpose yards and a pair of touchdowns.
A week after struggling to stop Columbia’s up-tempo offense late in the game, the Harvard defense seemed caught off guard by Penn’s early no-huddle strategy. While the Crimson offense stalled in the first quarter, Torgersen picked apart the secondary with three passes over 25 yards, including a 68-yard strike to Watson. Penn scored on its opening three possessions of the game.
Costly penalties against the Crimson—including an unnecessary roughness on the first Quakers drive and pass interference on the second—allowed Penn to open up a 15-point lead heading into the second quarter. An 81-yard kickoff return by freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley set up a quick touchdown to put the Crimson on the board, though the missed extra point kept the deficit at 21-6.
The momentum shifted to the Crimson in the second quarter, when it became Harvard’s turn to open a scoring barrage, and the Quakers’ to stall on offense.
The Crimson defense held Penn to three consecutive three-and-outs while the offense put together a pair of scoring drives, each under two minutes, to close the gap to 21-19. The Quakers failed to move the chains again on their ensuing possession, and senior defensive back Sean Ahern blocked the punt to give Harvard possession at Penn’s 28-yard line.
Just eight seconds later, Shelton-Mosley took the reverse handoff from Stanton and lobbed a perfectly placed 28-yard ball to junior tight end Anthony Firkser in the end zone. The two-point conversion pass from Hosch sailed out of the end zone, but the score nevertheless gave Harvard its first and only lead of the game.
Senior tight end Ben Braunecker led Harvard with 134 receiving yards, and Shelton-Mosley totaled 186 all-purpose yards. But their efforts were not enough on Saturday, and Harvard will have to wait until next week for a second chance to clinch its third straight Ivy title in as many years.
