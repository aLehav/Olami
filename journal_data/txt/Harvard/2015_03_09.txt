After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”—The Matrix
I hope I would take the red pill.
The red pill means the spirit of adventure, the exploration of the unknown, freedom. The blue pill means parochial, timid adherence to the same old thing, a slave in the “prison for your mind”—and the story ends.
The red pill means danger, a rabbit hole who knows how deep, and many a sleepless night before you get to the bottom of it. The blue pill means safety, or at least whatever safety and control the familiar structures of this familiar world have to offer. It means the comfort of your own feather pillow.
The red pill means the truth. “Remember, all I’m offering is the truth, nothing more,” remarks Morpheus.
The scientific method is a red pill. Christian belief, let's be honest, is often presented as a blue pill.
The scientific method involves questioning everything, gathering hard data, and making inferences from evidence to conclusions only in strict obedience to the p-values, however disheartening that may prove to be. The ideal scientist is passionate enough to devote her life to the pursuit of a truth unknown; cautious enough to remain at the mercy of her data; and stoical enough to shelve her own ego and say “hypotheses non fingo” whenever she doesn’t understand something.
Richard Feynman epitomizes this vision of the scientist hero, someone who was never content with easy answers or superficial explanations, who was willing to hold many things in doubt, out of respect for the mysteriousness of the universe.
Christian belief, on the other hand, is commonly perceived as requiring a voluntary narrowing of the mind that only very uninquisitive people could enjoy. The imposition of a particular creed appears to be an arbitrary restriction on the possibilities of exploration and the full knowledge of the reality of the universe.
It seems to me that this perception is what’s really responsible for the “problem of science and faith.”
Of course Christians can be scientists and do worthwhile scientific research and hold ordinary scientific beliefs. The Catholic Catechism §159 rightly points out that the truths of Christian faith should never contradict truths established by natural reason. (I should like to studiously ignore Darwin-gate.) The question is whether two particular worldviews, which I call the “scientific-reductionist worldview” and the Christian worldview, are logically compatible.
The scientific-reductionist worldview is not the same thing as scientific method. The use of scientific method is no problem at all for faith. Scientific method can neither prove nor disprove the existence of the Christian God. God, the creator and continual sustainer of all physical reality, the source upon which spacetime and matter and the physical laws all depend for their existence, is not an object of scientific study. God cannot be discovered by looking down some very powerful telescope, nor can the possibility of His existence be excluded by any double-blind trials.
The problems all arise from the additional assumptions of the “scientific-reductionist worldview”: That scientific knowledge is the only credible kind of knowledge, that the objects of scientific study are the only kind of objects there are, that the universe as a whole is necessarily a closed system, one great big laboratory bench, with all its variables accounted for and with no forces acting on it from the “outside.”
Theological knowledge does not have any place in a world like that. Scientific and theological methodology are different. Christian belief is not established by scientific method.
Of course, our beliefs about mathematics, ethics, or the Battle of Waterloo, or other persons like Brian, are not established by scientific method either. Even our beliefs that other conscious minds exist at all or that the principle of induction is sound are not scientific beliefs any more than my belief that things are made out of atoms is a religious belief.
Scientific reductionism is rather, well, reductionist.
Let's now reconsider the question: Is Christian belief the blue pill to scientific method's red pill?
True science and true faith spring from the same source: Our primitive wonder at the mysteries of being and knowing.
This world is a remarkable gift. It is wonderfully strange that anything exists at all, and that what does exist is beautiful, and that it obeys elegant laws, and that humans have minds capable of understanding those laws. It is with this spirit of wonder that the psalmist looks up at the wheeling Keplerian orbits overhead and writes, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork” (Psalm 19:1). This is no “God of the gaps,” but a God whose artistry is found in the regular workings of this miraculous universe.
Christianity is a wholehearted attempt to give expression to the wonder at the bottom of everything, both things known and unknown. There is room enough for a world full of wonder in a humble, personal, existential commitment to the creed.
Scientific beliefs like “ordinary things are made up of atoms” have been put to the test in some of the most creative and rigorous ways that human minds have ever devised, and that ought to be respected.
Christian belief is also put to the test: Not in the scientific way, but in historical, philosophical, textual-critical ways—and, like any personal relationship, in “a lifetime's death in love.”
There is a deep commonality between science and faith. True scientists are scientists because they are committed to taking the red pill. True Christians are Christians for the same reason.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s say I’m a government concentrator, and let’s say I have some goals and dreams. Let's say those goals and dreams aren’t finance, consulting, public office, law, journalism, academia, or activism.
What does that leave me with?
Flooring.
Stick with me: I’m talking hardwood, laminate, tiling, vinyl, carpeting, and stone. Not standing up for the rights of others, not yielding the floor to the prosecution in a court room, and not generating a party platform, but rather, building a place where people can literally stand, mixing and constructing materials that will yield a floor, and creating a physical platform where others will later host parties.
Sure, flooring is probably not on most government concentrators’ minds when they think about where their studies may lead. But, oddly enough, there seems to be a precedent for it.
I was on a plane going back to school at the end of winter break when I decided to talk to the guy next to me. Since he wasn’t a girl, I was able to strike up a conversation. I learned that he had spent over a decade in the flooring business, running a company.
It turns out he attended Harvard as an undergrad as well, concentrating in government. He then went to business school, eventually entering the flooring business.
It all seemed kind of strange to me. The study of government leads to all sorts of fascinating and powerful avenues of work, which deal with the intricate questions of how to run a society and protect people’s basic rights. And business graduates often get to be on the cutting edge of industry, driving us into new ways of living and interacting with others.
But flooring! Floors have been around forever. Or, at least, since three days after the creation of light. They’re not new. I don’t see how they could be incredibly innovative. If someone doesn’t buy a floor from you, he or she could surely buy one from someone else.
Of course, I didn’t say any of that. Instead, I asked a simple question: “If you could go back, would you change anything?”
After reflecting on his education and where it led, he didn’t hesitate: “No. I wouldn’t do anything differently.”
No regrets.
That may be a good definition of success. But is it enough? Once I got back to school, the answer to that question seemed to be a resolute “no”. Here, there’s a different ethic of success: Go out into the world and change people’s lives. Make a difference. Shake things up, a lot. And shake them up for the better.
In this frame, flooring probably doesn’t do enough. It’s not innovative. It’s too much of the same. This Harvard ethic—the ethic of change and progress, of honoring those who use their education to not just be “another cog in the machine”—is pretty widely accepted. We honor the changers of the world.
But I think the zeal for that honor has some negative consequences.
Let’s assume this guy’s flooring company was basically modeled the same way as most other flooring companies, except it did things a little better, giving it an advantage in the market. Is that a less successful use of a Harvard education than something that produces broader “change” in the world, like founding Facebook?
We first have to look at the ways we evaluate the merits of change. We prefer big positive changes to small positive changes. Yet, not all changes are positive. Technological changes have produced great sources of energy as well as dangerous weapons of mass destruction. Sociopolitical changes are often lauded by one political party but criticized by another.
Let’s go back to our comparison. Assuming the flooring company provided better services and was run ethically, leading to its success, we could say it produced a small but positive change. On the other hand, Facebook’s invention was a much larger but more controversial change. The site is either connecting people like never before, or ruining social interaction, depending on who you ask. So which venture is more “successful?”
Honestly, I lean towards the latter (I like Facebook). But we must recognize that there’s no single answer. And I fear, in general, that our reverence for grand changes—the unchecked cult of worship surrounding those like Zuckerberg—can blind us to the merits of more modest, but surely good, change. We must always aim high, taking advantage of opportunities for great, positive change. But we must also remember that small, good steps can be just as honorable as large, ambiguous leaps.
As I departed from the plane, my conversation partner caught up with me and said, “You know, when I was in college, I had as much hair as you.” He’s bald. I laughed as we exited.
I hope that when I’m older and established in a career, I’ll feel successful. But for now, I’ll take my head, full of hair, with dreams up in the clouds, knowing I’ll be happy as long as I do something good with my life—even if that good ends up being closer to the floor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As most Harvard students by now know, early last Wednesday The Spee Club sent out an invitation for a “pajama party.” The email, sent from the account of Vince T. Cooper ‘15, a member of the all-male final club, included a link to a YouTube video featuring female models in lingerie and an illustration of a “Playbear” dressed in Hugh Hefner-like garb alongside a scantily clad woman. The invitation generated tremendous controversy and campus-wide uproar. On Thursday night, Cooper issued an apology on behalf of the club “for a genuine lapse in judgment,” before Dean Rakesh Khurana condemned the invitation the following day in an email to all undergraduates, calling the group’s email “offensive, crude, and sexist.”
The original invitation itself was exactly as Dean Khurana characterized it, and we commend him for speaking out on the hypersexualization of women on Harvard’s campus. But it would be naive to suggest that this kind of insensitivity is unique to either the Spee Club or this invitation. This type of objectification is present not only in invitations from many final clubs on a weekly basis, but also in dining hall conversations, on final club dance floors, and around many facets of Harvard’s campus.
Moreover, the Spee’s apology was truly novel and reflected even more poorly on the club. Their suggestions in the aftermath of this controversy on to how best to address broader concerns about gender issues on this campus—namely “work[ing] with the female final clubs”—perpetuate the issues of exclusivity that already exist in many of these social spaces. Indeed, Cooper’s more detailed apology in his email to The Crimson, which called for the creation of an “open forum for [women] to voice their concerns,” seemed to suggest that the Spee’s invitation will be responsible for creating a dialogue on gender at Harvard.
Is the Spee simply unaware that Harvard students are already talking about gender issues on a daily basis? Has the Spee neither seen nor participated in Side By Side, the UC’s new gender solidarity campaign? Is it possible that they genuinely believe, as they claim in their apology, that this pajama party controversy made these "issues… more salient”?
What makes this incident particularly concerning is that the Spee seemed on some level unable to grasp that they were not the first group interested in starting a conversation about gender equality on this campus, and that their suggestions were not particularly revolutionary. In fact, if members of the Spee genuinely want to become more engaged in issues of gender, they should closely reexamine both their invitation and the very structure of their organization. Behind this incident is something far more concerning: a culture of parties in which women are objectified and men, often tacitly, are made to be their so-called playbears.
This is the real problem, and the Spee’s invitation was just the tip of the iceberg.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Benjamin C. Barnett ’17 was the first and only student from his public high school in rural Kentucky to apply to Harvard. He did not tell his college counselors or friends, he said, because they knew little about the Ivy League—or any school outside the state. “I just had to take it upon myself,” he said.
Now a sophomore at the College, Barnett studies chemistry, and, around campus, he sings with the Harvard Glee Club, tutors for Harvard Student Agencies, and works at the Quincy Grille. But when he arrived at Harvard more than a year ago, he felt unprepared academically, he said, even with some Advanced Placement courses from high school under his belt.
“I took four or five AP classes junior and senior year, but that didn’t mean anything,” Barnett said. “Academically, in terms of time management, I wasn’t prepared.”
Barnett wasn’t alone. Although Harvard admits students from around the world and offers generous financial aid to help them get here, some students who matriculate from under-resourced high schools struggle to find their footing on a campus with an overall wealthy student body that disproportionately draws from a small number of private and magnet schools. Harvard offers programming to mitigate inequities that challenge these students, but both undergraduates and administrators acknowledge that the College could do more.
“For some students, depending on classes they took in high school, they have a little bit of…work to catch up on, but that’s not an insurmountable problem,” said Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard.
THE LEARNING CURVE
Back home in the city of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, India, Varsha Varman ’18 attended a high school where the courses were geared toward students who decide their vocational paths early and pursue their chosen careers at local universities accordingly. Varman’s school did not offer the same International Baccalaureate or A-level courses that other international high schools provide, she said.
In addition to the social and cultural transition predicated on her international background, Varman attributes her difficulty in Harvard’s classrooms to poor high school instruction. She had trouble structuring papers at first, as well as with math and science.
“In the math or science part, I feel like I am inferior because I hadn’t had exposure to that higher level of education,” Varman said. “I had to do a lot of extra work outside of school.”
Administrators acknowledge that taking classes at Harvard can be challenging, even for students from elite high schools. For students from under-resourced schools, there is the added stress of fulfilling requirements that some peers have already completed before they step on campus, such as the College’s language requirement, for which Harvard accepts AP credit.
Jonathan Iyandemye ’18 did not have internet access at his high school in Rwanda, and although it had a library, he said few people used it. More than the lack of resources, however, Iyandemye attributes his challenges transitioning to college to the nature of his high school education, which he said differed significantly from Harvard. He had never written a 10-page paper before college, and he at first had difficulty managing his time outside the classroom.
“In terms of the dynamics of studying, my high school was based on memorizing things, not on thinking about things,” Iyandemye said. “I went through a high school education system that was binding.”
Students who come from under-resourced high schools work alongside a large number of peers who hail from selective public schools like Boston Latin School, boarding schools like Phillips Academy, and private day and specialized public schools in New York City. Students who attended those college preparatory schools often had access to specialized classes from an early age, in addition to strong advising programs and other resources for academic support.
“When you see your peers are in Math 25 and don’t have to take a language, that’s just part of it. If you persevere, you can catch up,” said Jason B. Munster ’07, a first generation alumnus who now serves as Mather House’s designated tutor for first generation college students. “Catching up just means that you fulfill your concentration requirements, and you may have a few less electives,” he added.
Social factors, too, can have an impact on low-income students’ adjustment to the College; some activities have dues, for example, that can limit their participation. Mather House tutor Anthony A. Jack said social factors are almost more important than academic preparation in helping students find their footing freshman year.
“I believe that it’s the social hurdles that can turn a 3.93 into a 3.39,” Jack said.
‘CATCHING UP’
Harvard tries to help students who struggle academically catch up in a variety of ways, both before they come to campus and once they arrive. Specifically, in the summer after students are admitted, the College runs placement exams in several subjects, including math, writing, and foreign languages, in an effort to identify which courses match students’ preparation levels.
Some undergraduates place into introductory writing course Expository Writing 10, for example, and take it freshman fall before enrolling in the more specialized Expository Writing 20, required of all freshmen, in the spring. Expos 10 is designed to make the transition to college academics easier for students, according to administrators and faculty members. Sections of Expos 10 are capped at 10 students, and the preceptors, who teach the course, meet with students in frequent one-on-one conferences.
According to Karen L. Heath, the senior Expos preceptor, Expos 10 aims to introduce students to writing fundamentals, through small assignments and full essays. “For those who come from secondary schools where not much writing was assigned, or whose writing assignments tended to be something other than analytical essays, it can be a challenge to get used to the expectations for academic writing here,” Heath wrote in an email.
New levels of introductory courses, like Expos 10, have been developed across the disciplines when the original courses proved too sophisticated for some students, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. Mathematics Ma: “Introduction to Functions and Calculus I” and Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology,” for example, enroll students without much experience in those subject areas.
Still, despite those options, not all students feel that they are appropriately placed into their freshman courses.
Benjamin J. Betik ’17 came to Harvard from a Texas high school that had never before sent a student to the College. Although his school offered AP courses, Betik said it was rated “academically unacceptable” annually by the Texas Education Agency.
Despite his high school’s shortcomings, Betik placed into Expos 20 and experienced unanticipated classroom challenges. “In high school I never really studied at all, so I didn’t even know how to study when I first got here,” Betik said. “My first semester at Harvard was pretty rough.”
“When I got back my first midterm, I was absolutely destroyed,” he added.
Varman, who followed her placement results to take Expos 20 freshman fall, also struggled because of it. The assignments were challenging, she said, because she did not have a strong background in academic writing.
“I had one class where we had to write a term paper, and I absolutely had no idea [where to start],” Varman said. Although on her own time she researched how to structure academic essays, Varman oftentimes felt like she had hit a brick wall.
“I do find it hard to write academic essays; I feel I am disadvantaged in that manner,” she said. “I do feel that there is an assumption that everyone has an exposure…[to] that kind of writing.”
Dingman nevertheless maintains that “placement results, while not foolproof, provide good guidelines” for students. He acknowledges, though, that issues also arise when students ignore their placement results and opt to start at higher levels than recommended (the placement results are not binding). Historically, students who ignore their suggested course placements have reported more academic challenges freshman year, Dingman said.
BRIDGING THE GAP
Still, while the College’s programming aims to mitigate any disadvantages students from under-resourced high schools have after matriculating, both administrators and students say the College could do more to offer support.
Many students who enroll in Expos 10, for example, praise the program, such as Kristina R. Li ’18, who said she had not been “very confident" with her writing skills beforehand.
Not all students, however, experience the same benefits: Barnett did not think the course made him more prepared to tackle writing assignments at the College.
“I don’t really think Expos 10 was helpful in the transition in any sort of way, to be honest,” he said.
In Expos 10, Barnett and his classmates were told “explicitly” how to structure their papers, he said, but subsequent classes had different organizational expectations for which Expos 10 did not prepare him. “Professors want different things in their papers,” he said.
Betik, who cites the Bureau of Study Counsel’s programs on study habits as the reason he was able to restore his academic performance, added that more students should use them. “I think that [going to] the Bureau of Study Counsel should be almost mandatory,” he said.
Asking for help, however, is often difficult for students. Varman said she could not take advantage of these programs because she could not prepare for a meeting when she did not know where to start. “I feel apprehensive about it because I felt I was not ready,” she said. “I need to work and then go and explain my problem.”
College administrators, meanwhile, are debating whether offering an academic bridge program over the summer would help make freshman year easier for students from under-resourced high schools. Some peer schools, such as Yale, already offer summer transition programs.
A summer bridge program would enable incoming freshmen to hit the ground running in the fall, Dingman said, but he added that such a program could target students with similar backgrounds with a potential negative impact.
“There are people who would argue against that, saying that it’s potentially stigmatizing, and that if you’re coming early...you’re meeting other people who are maybe inadequately prepared, and then they become the reeds you’re leaning on, and that’s not very good,” he said.
To address the potential stigma of participating in a summer bridge program, the Freshman Dean’s Office is discussing the creation of a program open to the entire freshman class or enrolling all students from certain kinds of high schools, such as those with free lunch programs or those with a small percentage of students who are accepted to four-year colleges. Another option, according to Dingman, may be to revamp Wintersession programming to offer extra academic help to students who performed poorly in the fall.
Iyandemye, for his part, attributes the ease of his college transition to a gap year bridge program called Bridge2Rwanda, which trains strong high school students in the country to attend colleges abroad. Inclusive of SAT prep and English classes, Bridge2Rwanda helped him with reading and writing skills as well as applying to colleges during his gap year, Iyandemye said.
Ultimately, Iyandemye said a Harvard education happens on students’ own terms, from the help they seek to the programs in which they participate.
“It’s a learning experience,” Iyandemye said. “You have to embrace another perspective than your own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week’s oral arguments in King v. Burwell suggest that the United States Supreme Court will uphold the Affordable Care Act, according to several Harvard Law School professors.
The case calls into question the tax subsidies for health insurance provided by the federal government to citizens in roughly three dozen states which have not established the health insurance marketplaces known as exchanges. If the law’s challengers are right, the federal government would no longer be allowed to provide subsidies to anyone purchasing healthcare coverage through these exchanges.
Last week, the Court heard oral arguments on the questions, and Law School professors say that based on the justices’ questions and lawyers’ responses, the challenge would likely fall short.
“I would say for people who hoped that the Court would permit the subsidies to be paid, it was a very encouraging oral argument,” said Richard H. Fallon, a law school professor.
Fallon said the four justices considered to be liberal—including former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg—will most likely vote to uphold the ACA. He also predicted that Antonin Scalia, Samuel A. Alito, and Clarence Thomas—the three justices usually considered conservative—will most likely vote in favor of the challengers.
Several professors identified Justice Anthony M. Kennedy—often the “swing vote” on the Court—and Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76, who voted to uphold the healthcare law in 2012, as the votes that could decide the fate of the law.
In particular, professors said Kennedy’s line of questioning suggests that he could vote to uphold the ACA. Einer R. Elhauge, a professor at the Law School, said it seemed “very likely” that Kennedy would vote to uphold the law as it exists now, providing the required fifth vote.
“I thought the biggest surprise out of the oral argument was just how clear it was,” Elhauge said, adding that he does not usually make predictions about how the Court will vote.
Noah R. Feldman ’92, another professor at the Law School, also identified Kennedy as a potential vote in favor of the Obama Administration.
“The clear news was that Justice Kennedy is thinking seriously about a problem with the challengers’ interpretation,” he said.
Although professors also speculated that Roberts may also vote to uphold the law, they are less sure because he was mostly silent during the oral arguments.
For his part, University Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 predicted a 6-3 decision in favor of upholding the ACA.
The Court is expected to issue a ruling on the case early this summer.

University President Drew G. Faust traveled to Alabama this weekend for the 50th Anniversary of the Voting Rights March at Selma.
In Friday’s morning prayer service at Memorial Church, Faust, a civil war historian, discussed her own personal involvement in the Civil Rights movement.
“I had felt the burden of that responsibility from the time I was small—growing up with the privileges of whiteness in the racial hierarchy of 1950s Virginia,” Faust said at the prayer service, adding that as a college freshman, she skipped her midterms to attend the 1965 march.
Invoking the poet Seamus J. Heaney, Faust talked about her previous experience at Selma as an opportunity to make “hope and history rhyme,” and said she planned to return to honor civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King Jr., Hosea L. Williams, James L. Bevel, Diane J. Nash, Andrew J. Young, Jimmie Lee Jackson, and John Lewis.
“No victory is absolute; we have to keep our eyes on the prize to hold on—even to the Voting Rights Act [of 1965] itself, which is being threatened and eroded at the same time we are celebrating its passage,” Faust said.

With plans for T-shirts, signs, videos, dinner receptions, and activities currently underway, House Committees and administrators and students have been working together to rally House pride and prepare to welcome the new members on Housing Day this Thursday.
House Committees have started to release their student-produced Housing Day videos—a tradition intended to highlight the qualities of the College’s 12 residential Houses. According to Leverett HoCo Co-Chair Chad J. Benoit ’16, House Committees typically open up the process to the entire House, soliciting ideas for the video and voting for the best one.
Quincy House Master Deborah J. Gehrke hinted at the content of the Quincy House video. “Let’s just say drones are involved,” she said.
The Pforzheimer, Cabot, and Currier House Committees have joined together to develop a Quad video, named “Quadweiser 2015 #BestBuds,” inspired by this year’s Budweiser Superbowl commercial. Pforzheimer House Master Anne Harrington ’82 applauded the special sense of community among the three Houses.
“There is a tremendous esprit de corps at the Quad,” she said.
Gehrke said many House masters have opened their residences for students to make signs with slogans demonstrating House pride and gather noisemakers in preparation for storming Harvard Yard on Housing Day. She added that some upperclassmen will participate in the Housing Day festivities Thursday morning by donning mascot costumes and creative gear, carrying signs and the all-important Housing assignment letters to deliver to the waiting freshmen.
According to Benoit, each House will organize activities outside Annenberg to instill House spirit in their newest residents. Benoit noted that Leverett House will run their annual “bunny petting zoo” in a nod to their House mascot, the rabbit.
“The ‘Lev Army’ will definitely be out in full force on Thursday,” he said.
Gehrke added that, at the end of the day, freshmen will be invited to dine in their new House dining halls, where House administrators and students will welcome them.

As hundreds of students filed through the revolving doors of the Science Center Sunday afternoon, they were greeted by a familiar space transformed into a tropical haven, surrounded by the sights and sounds of simply warmer times.
From tiki bars to shuffleboard to cotton candy machines, "#HarvardOasis" was an all-out effort, funded by an anonymous donation, to tackle the cabin fever that has blanketed the morale of students just as the snow has blanketed campus over the last several weeks.
The event was hosted by a joint team of organizations including the Undergraduate Council, the College Events Board, the Office of Student Life, and the Office of the Dean of the College and initiated in a short timeframe, with lead organizers having just two weeks to help plan and execute the event.
“This is really the definition of collaboration between student organizations on campus,” said Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, vice president of the UC. “This is good energy that we want to carry on in the future.”
The party was fully funded by an anonymous donor, who Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich would only describe as a “generous friend of the College.” Friedrich said the earmarked gift was made directly in response to articles in The Crimson and the Harvard Gazette on the winter dampening moods.
“It’s great to see everyone coming together to this open, inclusive, fun event,” UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 said.
OSL Student Life Fellow Emily S. Rutter ’13, who is also a former Crimson sports editor, and Friedrich both declined to comment on the cost of the event, but according to Daniel V. Banks ’17—student initiatives chair on the UC and one of the event's lead organizers—a price tag of $15,000 for the party would be a “significant underestimation.”
Banks said it was especially challenging to figure out how to publicize this event, given that it was requested by the anonymous donor that the details of the party be withheld until the day before the party. Despite this, more than 600 people signed up for the event on Facebook and Banks estimated that in all, roughly 1,500 students attended.
“It would be great if we can make this something we can do every year,” said Ramtin Talebi ’18, a member of the CEB. “If [the donor] has the funds to do this in the first place I would imagine [the donor] would have the funds to do it next year as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted down a proposed position paper that was sharply critical of Harvard’s all-male, unrecognized final clubs on Sunday night. The proposal was particularly critical of the Spee Club, which apologized last week for circulating a controversial party invitation that many people—including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—called sexist.
The meeting ran 30 minutes longer than originally scheduled—at least in part because of a lengthy debate about parliamentary procedure—and came after controversy erupted over invitations to the Spee’s planned “pajama party.” The emailed invitations included an image of a drawing depicting a bear with its arm around a woman dressed in tights and a sleeveless top and linked to a video that showed multiple clips of women wearing underwear and male and female models walking a runway.
The Spee ultimately canceled the party, which had been scheduled for Saturday night, and apologized “for a genuine lapse in judgement.”
The proposed position paper, which was attached to legislation that failed to pass the Council with 24 votes against and seven in support, denounced both the Spee and Harvard’s other male final clubs. Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, who is a Crimson news editor, was the sole author of the paper and the chief advocate of the legislation.
“Whether or not it is the reality, many students view final clubs as a thinly-veiled mechanism for elite, male students to exploit power dynamics and get laid,” Levine wrote in the paper. “We are told that final clubs host wild parties full [of] attractive, half-clothed women…. We are told that freshmen and girls from other schools are targeted because they are seen as more naive. We are told that alcohol is used to expedite consent. We are told these things, and they are not difficult to believe.”
During a question-and-answer period, Levine clarified that his position paper referred only to all-male final clubs.
Some members of the Council who voted against the legislation said they thought the paper was too strongly worded against the clubs or argued that it did not propose enough “tangible” courses of action to prevent acts of discrimination from occurring in the future.
Council Parliamentarian and Cabot House representative Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 argued that the Council should wait until it has further conversations with the Spee before considering publishing the paper.
Other Council members said they feared the legislation might hinder subsequent efforts to engage in dialogue with final club leadership on the issues raised.
“It is not going to get done with a piece of paper. [If the legislation passes] we are going to exclude [final clubs] from the conversation, when they have the power to make the most change,” Dunster House representative Daniel V. Banks ’17 said.
UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 was one of the 24 votes against the legislation. She said after the meeting that she opposed the paper’s description of “attractive, half-clothed women” as the majority of attendees at final club parties, an objection raised by at least one other Council member during the meeting.
“[Our goal] is to make productive steps forward,” Nasrollahzadeh said at the meeting. “As leaders on campus, it’s our responsibility to show them how to move forward, rather than to just say again that we don’t approve of this.”
“I don’t see anywhere, in this piece of legislation, action items,” she added.
During a public question-and-answer period in the final minutes of the meeting, Nasrollahzadeh declined to confirm to a Crimson reporter that she is a member of the Bee, an all-female final club.
“At this moment, I don’t think our conversations are focused on me being in a final club or not in a final club,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “I don’t think that question is relevant to this meeting.”
Nasrollahzadeh later confirmed that she is a member of the Bee Club.
The meeting's proceedings were at times dominated by members' discussion of parliamentary procedure, the set of rules that govern how the Council debates and votes on legislation. Throughout the meeting, UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 deferred frequently to Steinberg-Otter, the parliamentarian, even as multiple members expressed their frustration with the rules.
The meeting ended with members creating a list of “action items” to deliver to final clubs, including asking for pledges for the UC’s "Side By Side" gender equity campaign, hosting a town hall forum with final club leadership, and contacting alumni boards responsible for funding the clubs.
Earlier in the meeting, the Council unanimously approved $51,000 in funding for club sports teams. The meeting was held in Harvard Hall instead of in Ticknor Lounge, where the Council usually convenes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may have been a season of ups and downs for the Harvard women’s basketball team, but it certainly ended on a high note.
The Crimson capped off a four-game win streak in its final contest of the season Saturday night as Harvard (14-14, 7-7 Ivy) defeated Brown (10-18, 4-10) by a score of 76-69.
The game had a much different ending than the last time the two teams faced off on Feb. 6. Then, the Bears defeated the Crimson, 83-80. Despite the additional 11 points, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was very disappointed following that contest.
“We played our hearts out, but we played badly,” Delaney-Smith said after the first matchup.
But Saturday was a different story. After struggling to string together even two wins in a row all season, Harvard was able to move up to .500 on the year with four wins in two weeks, including two wins against teams that it had lost to the first time around.
“One of the words that I can use is fun. It was our last game, so we were really focused on bringing home a 'W' for our seniors,” sophomore forward Destiny Nunley said. “But I don’t think we’ve had that much fun on the court this whole season.”
It took a full team effort for the Crimson to defeat Brown on Saturday night, as nine out of 10 players who stepped onto the court scored in the contest. But it was perennial powerhouse Temi Fagbenle who led the team in the victory.
In her last game in a Harvard uniform, the senior forward continued the dominance she has exuded all season.  The forward had 16 points and 18 rebounds in her 13th double-double of the season. It was the 22nd time the London, England, native scored in double figures this season as well. She finishes 15th on the Harvard all-time scoring list.
Fagbenle’s rebounding was key in the matchup as the Crimson scored 25 of its 76 points on second chances, compared to only 12 second-chance points for Brown. As a team, Harvard out-rebounded Brown, 52-37, a narrative the Crimson has seen all year. The women have had a height advantage over many of the teams they have faced this season, with the core group of Fagbenle, junior AnnMarie Healy, and senior Erin McDonnell controlling the paint with the help of Nunley and freshman center Anna Lachenauer off the bench.
“Brown really didn’t want us to score inside, so they would double us, triple us, whatever,” Fagbenle said. “So we really took whatever they gave us and made it our own game.”
Lachenauer was a defensive force in the contest, contributing six blocks in 12 minutes on the court. Her previous season-high was just three.
The first half was back and forth between the two teams, but the Bears pulled away as the clock wound down, heading into the locker room up by five.
But Harvard kept fighting. Though the team suffered a bit of a set back as Brown increased its lead to nine, the Crimson went on a 9-2 run to make it a one-possession game. A put-back from Fagbenle then put Harvard in front with 9:55 to go in the conest, giving her side a lead that the team would hold on to for the remainder of the game.
“[This game] means so, so much for the team and for the seniors," Fagbenle said. "We had a disappointing season in general and we didn’t ever think we would be able to be where we are right now. When it came down the stretch, we had to realign our goals…and take one game at a time for us to be able to pull out the four-game win streak at the end of the season…. We are very proud of ourselves and each other for fighting through to the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another game, another career night for junior forward AnnMarie Healy, who finished with 24 points on just 11 shots, shooting a blistering 91 percent from the field. Healy’s offensive performance paced Harvard (14-14, 7-7 Ivy) to a 68-63 victory over Yale (13-15, 7-7) Friday night in New Haven.
The 24 points on Friday marked a new career best for Healy, besting the total of 21 she set in last Saturday’s 82-81 home victory over Columbia.
The Crimson game out of the gates strong against the Bulldogs, taking an 8-2 lead off a layup by Healy three minutes into the game.  Yale responded quickly, hitting two straight shots from deep and tying the game at 10.
The three-point shot kept the Bulldogs close throughout the first half as the host hit six shots from behind the arc in an eight-minute stretch that culminated with a three from sophomore guard Meghan McIntyre to give Yale a 22-19 lead.
“One of the reasons that we won was our ability to stick together as they made runs as our shot wasn’t falling,” sophomore guard Destiny Nunley said.
The Crimson responded to the Yale charge with five points from Healy and four points from senior forward Temi Fagbenle as part of a 13-2 run. Yale cut the lead back to five going in to the locker room for halftime with four points in the final 30 seconds to make it 39-34 after 20 minutes of play.
“It was a fight from start to finish,” Nunley said. “The Yale players were feeding off of each others’ energy, so we really had to generate our own.”
Yale rattled off three straight buckets to start the second half, taking a 40-39 lead.  Much of the second frame saw the teams trade buckets, with no team gaining more than a four-point advantage until less than a minute was left in the game.
When the Bulldogs pushed its lead to 54-50 with eight minutes left, Healy took over, putting in six points in under a minute to give Harvard the lead.
The biggest shot of the night belonged to junior guard Shilpa Tummala, who knocked down a contested three from the wing to give the Crimson a 62-59 lead with two minutes remaining. A jumper by Fagbenle, who finished the game with 15 points and 10 rebounds for her 12th double-double of the season, was the nail in the coffin a minute later.
Harvard’s defense held down the stretch, and the visiting squad was able to seal the game at the free throw line.  The Crimson overcame 22 turnovers on the night thanks to hot shooting from the frontline, as Fagbenle and Healy combined to make 17 of 21 shots.
“[Healy] has been consistent for us all season, and against Yale she was amazing,” Fagbenle said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s wrestling team (3-8, 1-7 EIWA), this weekend at the EIWA Championships at Lehigh could be summed up in one word: redemption.
Senior David Ng went 4-2 in the tournament, capturing fifth place in the heavyweight bracket, securing the final guaranteed spot in his weight class for the NCAA Championships on March 19th in St. Louis, Mo.
Ng defeated Columbia’s Garrett Ryan 2-0 in the fifth place match, just one day after losing to Ryan on Friday in the quarterfinal of the championship bracket by a score of 3-1. The Massapequa, N.Y. native, who entered the tournament as the fifth seed in the 285 division, won his first match of the tournament by blanking Army’s David Farr.
In wrestlebacks, Ng caught fire and first edged Brown’s Sebastien Levin 10-2 for his final match on Friday. On Saturday, the senior went on to defeat Princeton's Ray O’Donnell, who was the tournament’s eighth seed, by pin at 2:16.
Following two consecutive victories, Ng just missed a spot in the third place match after a loss to No. 17 Doug Vollaro of Lehigh. Coming off a tie in regulation periods, Vollaro took the match in the first tiebreaker, 3-1.
A loss by Ryan on the other side of the wrestlebacks bracket ensured a rematch of the longtime rivals. This was the fourth meeting of the two in just this season alone, having split the first two regular season contests, both by a score of 3-1.
“I wrestled him when I was sophomore and he was a junior in high school in junior nationals in Las Vegas,” Ng said. “He actually beat me up pretty good.”
The senior responded by defeating Ryan after leading for most of the match by just one point. The victory clinched the fifth and final bid for the NCAA Championships in the heavyweight division.
“[Ryan's] tough,” Ng said. “He’s quick on his feet, he’s big and strong, and it’s very hard to get him moving and get to his legs.”
The fifth place finish was the best of Ng’s career at the EIWA Championships, following eighth and seventh place finishes in his sophomore and junior years, respectively.
While Ng provided a bright spot for the Crimson this weekend, the rest of the team struggled to fight through injuries that have plagued Harvard all season long.
Junior co-captain Todd Preston, who entered the tournament as the defending EIWA champion and number one seed at the 141 division, suffered a broken wrist in just his second match of the weekend.
The junior had little trouble defeating Kyle Brady of Sacred Heart in the first round, with a final score of 13-3. In his second round matchup against Drexel’s David Pearce, Preston had to forfeit the match on injury default, ending his tournament run.
The Crimson was already without its captain and top ranked wrestler in James Fox, who suffered a concussion prior to this weekend’s matches. Fox, who has qualified for the NCAA Championships in each of his previous three years as a Harvard wrestler, was ranked ninth in the country at the 197 weight class before being sidelined for the weekend.
“It was a difficult tournament going into it knowing we didn’t have James,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “[Todd Preston’s injury] happened early in the tournament, and when you have your leaders go down like that…it’s a lesson to all the guys that you’re never guaranteed next year, or tomorrow.”
In other weight classes, junior Devon Gobbo pulled off a first round upset at 165 with a pin at 2:24 of seventh seeded Zack Zupan of Binghamton. Gobbo lost in the second round of wrestlebacks to eighth seeded Tyrel White of Columbia.
At 174, number seven seed freshman Josef Johnson, who finished the season with a 16-13 record, pinned Hofstra’s Frank Affronti at 6:13 in the opening round of the tournament. Johnson failed to advance any further, losing two straight matches following the victory.
Harvard, with 24 team points, finished the tournament in 14th place as they watched Ivy League rival Cornell take home the team championship with 176 points on the weekend.
“Some of our guys had to go through this tournament for the first time to see what it’s like,” Weiss said. “This is what we train for, everything we do is for these few days in March. We’ve got some work to do when we get back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After heading into halftime down a single goal, Harvard (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) capitalized on a second period momentum swing to edge Columbia (0-4, 0-1) by four goals, 13-9, and notched its first Ivy League win.
“It’s nice to get an Ivy win,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “They’re all tough–they’re chippy. It gets a little more physical in the Ivy games with the competition, and the rivalries start to build up, so it’s nice to win. I don’t think we played as well as we could have, but you still have to be happy to win.”
Harvard allowed the Lions to increase its lead to 7-5 at the beginning of the second frame, but junior co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd buried an unassisted goal a few minutes later to narrow the gap with a little under 19 minutes remaining.
“You’re in a tight game on Tuesday, flew down, flew back, lots of exams—the team’s tired,” Miller said. “I knew we would get off to a bit of a slow start, but you hope that pride will kick in and that the competitive nature of the kids will kick in, and that’s what you saw.”
Moments after Todd’s score, sophomore attack Marisa Romeo leveled the scoreboard, 7-7, with the first of her four goals for the game. On the day, Romeo and Todd led the team on offense, tallying six and four points, respectively.
“I think we just have been working really hard at practice, always trying to make space for each other as well as take our own opportunities,” Todd said. “We’re just trying to talk to each other when we see space and work through it, and it’s worked out.”
Going on to outscore Columbia 8-3 in the second frame, the Crimson made up for time lost in the opening period when, after holding a 5-2 lead, the team allowed a four-goal scoring streak that gave the Lions a one-goal advantage into halftime.  A failed stick check on the Crimson erased a goal that would have extended the Harvard lead.
“It’s just one of those games,” Miller said. “If we had gone to 6-2, we would have sort of gone from there and built, but the stick check and the goal being pulled back—it was a momentum swing. It’s a game of momentum.”
Five consecutive unassisted goals catapulted the Crimson into a 10-7 lead heading into the 18th minute of the second period. Freshman midfield Eliza Guild and sophomore attack Megan Hennessey both contributed to the five-goal streak, with Guild chipping in her second goal and Hennessey notching her first point of the game. Hennessey went on to tally an assist to Romeo with less than two minutes remaining and record Harvard’s penultimate goal of the match.
“We started to pump each other up on the field and get really excited because I think we started out a little slow,” Todd said. “We came out ready in the second half, and we pulled it out, which is great.”
Junior co-captain and goalkeeper Kelly Weis record eight saves for the Crimson, and the Harvard defense successfully executed 14-of-15 clears.
“Every Ivy game is always really competitive,” Todd said. “Everyone comes in wanting to win every game. Everyone wants to make the Ivy League tournament. Obviously this is one of those leagues where not everyone in the league gets to play at the end of the season, so it’s always great to pull out a win early.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 9, 2015, at 1:06 a.m.
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team had been there before.
Last year, the team met Cornell in the ECAC semifinals at Cheel Arena in Potsdam, N.Y., looking to earn a chance to play for an uncontested bid to the NCAA tournament. But the Big Red came away with a 6-4 victory in a hard-fought battle, leaving the Crimson’s tournament fate in the balance.
The stage was set with even higher stakes Sunday afternoon, as No. 4/4 Harvard (25-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) and No. 9/9 Cornell (19-11-3, 14-6-2) met up to decide which ECAC team would receive the outright bid to this year's tournament.  This time the result came out in favor of the Crimson, who rode a six-goal third period to a 7-3 victory.
“I think today’s game was good,” junior forward Mary Parker said. “We were really happy with the outcome. The first period started off a little slow, but as the game went on, we were able to come out and play well when the game was on the line, which was really awesome.”
Entering Sunday having beaten the Big Red twice already during the regular season, Harvard earned its first conference tournament championship since 2008 in its third matchup of the season against its Ivy League foe.
In the first period, each team took advantage of the other’s mistakes, as two early power play goals left the score even at one.
The game then remained quiet until the third period, when the Crimson broke the scoring open.
Nonetheless, initially it appeared as if Cornell would have the advantage in the frame, as the Big Red took a 2-1 lead just over a minute into the third on a shot that bounced off of junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer’s pads and was rebounded into the back of the net by Cornell senior forward Jillian Saulnier.
Harvard had an answer less than a minute later when freshman forward Dani Krzyszczyk found classmate Karly Heffernan off the left wing. The rookie hardly hesitated, taking an uncontested shot that hit the top right corner of the twine.
The Crimson continued to roll. Less than a minute after Heffernan’s goal, senior defenseman Sarah Edney came through with her second score of the game, taking a slapshot out in front of the net that made it past the Big Red defense, giving Harvard its first lead of the game.
With momentum swinging the Crimson’s way, Parker tacked on an insurance goal to increase the lead during a power play opportunity.
“We played our game and made the plays that were there,” Edney said. “We didn’t try to make any plays that were too big for us, and I think that’s part of the reason we were able to spring back so well.”
Back to back goals by freshman forward Lexie Laing and Parker would extend the team’s lead even further, bringing it up to four goals.
Cornell made a comeback effort late in the third period after adding a power play goal, but the Crimson was able to answer almost immediately when junior forward Miye D’Oench found the back of the Big Red’s empty net.
Despite the flurry of late goals, the game did not boast the same level of offensive intensity at the start as it ended with, as Harvard went down 1-0 early after Cornell capitalized on a man-advantage.
The Crimson answered the Big Red’s call to action with a power play goal of its own. Coming off of a transition, Edney was fed by Parker out in front of the Cornell net, and the senior launched a shot that got past Big Red goaltender Paula Voorheis at 18:07 in the first period.
The remainder of the first period and the entire second period remained scoreless, but Harvard's late offensive explosion carried the Crimson to the win.
A few hours after the game, Harvard was granted the third seed in the eight-team NCAA Tournament. The Crimson will play one final game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this Saturday against sixth-seeded Quinnipiac, whom Harvard beat in the ECAC semifinals, with a trip to the Frozen Four on the line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 13/16 Harvard men’s lacrosse team jumped on Penn State early, scoring four straight goals to open Saturday’s matchup at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium. The Crimson (3-1) never trailed at any point en route to a 12-9 victory over the visiting Nittany Lions (2-3).
After killing off an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty assessed on the opening face-off, the Harvard offense capitalized on its possession advantage by sprinting to a 4-0 lead just six minutes into the contest. Junior midfielder Sean McDonagh, who finished with a goal and three assists, opened the scoring by converting off a dodge from the wing.
“If [the Nittany Lions] get rolling, they’re a tough team to beat,” junior tri-captain Stephen Jahelka said. “Everyone was just concentrating on...[how] this game’s really about us, and if we come out fast, it doesn’t matter what they’ll do. If we play our game plan, we’ll be able to compete with them everywhere.”
On a quiet day for junior attackman Devin Dwyer, a pair of midfielders stepped up to lead the offense for the Crimson. McDonagh played the role of facilitator from up top, while freshman midfielder Joe Lang continued an impressive start to his collegiate career.
Coming off a break-out performance against Quinnipiac, Lang turned in another stellar effort on Saturday, notching four goals and helping to put the game away late in the second half. In the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, Lang beat his defender from behind the goal to cap off a 5-1 Harvard run and extend the lead to five scores. When sophomore midfielder Drake Kreinz scored to pull Penn State within three, Lang answered less than a minute later, ending any hope of a comeback.
“When you combine his speed, his ability to make plays with both hands, and...a really high lacrosse IQ...he’s just a really productive player that teams really have to account for,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik '96 said. “I’m most impressed that he plays like an upperclassman. He doesn’t look like a freshman out there.”
The Crimson offense has been clicking on all cylinders this season, and Saturday’s game was no different. Harvard now ranks sixth in the country in scoring at 14.25 goals per game after scoring less than 11 per game a year ago.
On the other end of the field, injuries have kept the Crimson from realizing its potential thus far this year. However, Harvard welcomed Jahelka back into the fold at close defense against the Nittany Lions. The captain was one of the anchors of the Crimson defense a year ago, and his presence was immediately felt on Saturday, as Harvard allowed fewer than ten goals for the first time this season.
Junior Bryan Moore was solid in goal, making a number of key saves, especially early on, to help solidify the Crimson defense. The Baltimore, Md., native had five first-quarter stops, including two that stymied Penn State’s game-opening man advantage. Moore has established himself this season after playing sparingly in his first two years. As a result, Harvard is now spoiled for choice in the cage, as Moore and tri-captain Jake Gambitsky, the longtime starter, have both shown the ability to lead the defense and make key plays.
Going forward, the Crimson will continue to make adjustments as significant contributors such as juniors Jack Breit and Bobby Duvjnak return from injury and the coaches determine how to allocate playing time in goal. In the meantime, Saturday’s game offered an encouraging sign to a unit laden with talent when at full strength.
“We have had different lineups most games.... In that regard I think we’re still trying to build chemistry with our unit.” Wojcik said. “But I feel like we’re on an upward trajectory in terms of our defensive play, and that was our best defensive performance of the year so far.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team traveled to Macon, Ga. for a four-game weekend set with Mercer. The Crimson (5-3) was able to take three of the four games from the host Bears (9-8). This was the first three-game win streak for Harvard since April of 2012, when it took three out of four games from Ivy foe Brown.
“Getting into the warmer weather, we were definitely able to increase our offense this weekend,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “In the first three games [of the series], we scored 24 runs, which says a lot about how much our offense has improved.”
MERCER 7, HARVARD 1
The Bears were able to salvage the last game of the four-game set by holding the Crimson to only four hits on the day. Kyle Lewis and Devin Bonin hit back-to-back home runs in the bottom of the first for Mercer, and the Bears jumped on Crimson junior starting pitcher Nick Scahill for five runs in three and a third innings of work.
Harvard’s only run of the day came on senior leftfielder Jack Colton’s single in the fifth. Sophomore Kevin Rex provided his second strong relief appearance of the weekend, hurling three and two-thirds scoreless innings and recording two strikeouts.
Senior Eric Nyquist threw a complete game for the Bears to pick up his second victory of the season.
HARVARD 8, MERCER 7
Harvard won a wild one in the second game of its Saturday doubleheader. The Crimson took 1-0 and 3-1 leads, but the Bears answered back to tie it both times. After a four-run fourth inning gave Harvard a 7-3 lead, the Bears stormed back with a three-run fifth. Both teams added a run in the seventh, but senior closer Tanner Anderson slammed the door for the Crimson, striking out two in two innings of work to pick up his third save of the season. The Crimson offense had 12 hits on the day, highlighted by senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan’s double, home run, and three runs batted in.
“We knew especially that every run was going to matter and just [tried] to manufacture one at a time,” McGuiggan said. “I was fortunate enough to be in a couple situations where I was able to drive in a couple runs. I’m really glad we were able to hold on there.”
Starter Matt Timoney picked up the win for Harvard despite giving up six runs (three earned) in four and two-thirds innings.
HARVARD 6, MERCER 1
Propelled by a dominant performance from sophomore right-hander Nick Gruener, Harvard took the second game of the series. Gruener threw seven and a third innings, striking out four and surrendering just three hits and one run, which came on a Danny Edgeworth long ball.
“Their offense is probably one of the best lineups we’re going to face all year,” Gruener said. “I knew I had to, for the most part, get guys inside. I had to make sure I was locating [low and inside] as well as mixing up the off-speed [pitches]. I had to keep them off-balance the whole time because I knew if I left one over the middle, it [was] going over the fence.”
Sophomore Kevin Rex recorded the final five outs for the Crimson, and the offense gave Gruener two runs in the fourth and one in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth. Senior center fielder Mike Martin hit the team’s first home run of the season in the seventh—a solo shot over the left field fence. Junior third baseman Mitch Klug had three hits, including a double, and drove in a run.
HARVARD 10, MERCER 6
The Crimson kicked off its weekend on the right foot, taking an early lead Friday afternoon and never looking back. The Harvard offense tagged Bears starter Ryan Askew for five hits and four runs, ending his day after he recorded just two outs. Junior right-hander Sean Poppen threw five innings for the Crimson, surrendering two runs while striking out nine.
Harvard was also active on the base paths, swiping six bags on eight attempts. Klug led the way for a balanced offensive attack hitting out of the five-hole, with pairs of hits, runs, RBIs, and stolen bases on the day. Martin reached base three times, scored twice, and had a triple.
“This was a really important weekend for us,” McGuiggan said. “We’re going into the spring break trip with a 5-3 record and it’s a great start for us. We’re already just about at half the amount of wins we had all last season. That just says a lot about how much we’ve improved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend at the Frostbite sevens tournament, the Harvard women’s rugby team came out hot, totaling a combined 4-2 record between the two Crimson squads that entered the field. Despite not having any previous experience with the sevens style of play this year, the hosts defeated teams from MIT and Beantown RFC beneath the bubble of Harvard Stadium.
“Overall our goal was to have the team have a very positive sevens experience since most of the players on the team have never played sevens rugby before,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “I think that on the day, it was a huge success.”
CRIMSON
Two games, two blowouts, one loss and one victory. That’s how the Crimson squad began Saturday’s slate of action.
But at the beginning of Harvard’s third contest, a matchup against Beantown RFC, the squad encountered their first tight game. Two scoreless minutes had passed to open the 14-minute game, and neither team had gained a clear upper hand.
It was then that Crimson sophomore Taciana Pereira struck. After breaking out of a scrum at Beantown’s own 40, the Brazilian national team member sprinted ahead of all players to score a try and give her Harvard side a 5-0 lead.
After Pereira’s score, the floodgates opened. The next Harvard tally, which came after a long run by freshman Maya Learned, put the hosts up 10-0. Despite conceding a Beantown score, the Crimson would never relinquish the lead and walked off the field with a 15-5 victory.
“We had three brand new rookies who started on Monday,” Learned said. “[They all] scored their first tries. I think our work rate was just incredibly high, which is a necessity for sevens.”
Earlier in the day, the Crimson team experienced less drama in racking up a win over MIT. Against the Engineers, Harvard scored early and often en route to a 25-5 win in their first match of the day.
The formula would not hold true against the Black team however, as the Crimson squad would fall to their Black counterparts by a score of 30-5.
BLACK
The Black squad matched their Harvard counterparts, finishing the day at 2-1, while beating their Crimson opponents.
In the first match of competition, the Black team lost 15-5 to Beantown RFC. In their next game, a scrimmage against the other Harvard team, the Black side picked up their first win of the day, defeating the Crimson squad by a score of 30-5.
“We had some ups and downs throughout the day because we were not really familiar with the sevens structure,” junior Ann-Marie Barrett said. “In the end, I think we’re really proud of the team and the hard effort we put in.”
The day ended on a high moment, as the Black squad dispatched MIT handily with a 30-5 loss.
Coming at the beginning of the spring season, the Frostbite Sevens represented Harvard’s first official competition since beating Princeton last November in the third-place match of the Ivy League tournament. Since then, the team has held unofficial practices and added several team members.
In the next two months, the Crimson will take part in two other sevens tournaments, one of which will take place on the Harvard campus. This event, known as the Crimson Sevens tournament, will kick off at the end of March.
“We’re such a different team right now,” Parker said. “We have a lot of new player…. Sevens is a faster more wide open game that exposes our skill level when we don’t execute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With spots at the upcoming NCAA Championships up for grabs at the NCAA Northeast Regional, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing squads walked away with a handful of top-10 finishes and some guaranteed qualifiers for the next round of action to be held at Columbus, Ohio beginning on March 19.
On the women’s side, sophomore sabré fencer Adrienne Jarocki notched her second straight regional gold medal, while co-captain Aliya Itzkowitz earned the bronze to also clinch a berth at the championships. The two will be looking to repeat their one-two finish at the NCAA Championships last year, where Jarocki pulled away for the 15-10 victory over her teammate in the final.
Junior co-captain and sabré fencer Duncan O’Brien and junior épéeist Nicolas Simko took gold medals in their respective divisions to pace the field. While medalists on both the men’s and women’s side are guaranteed NCAA Championship bids, some of the other Crimson fencers on the bubble will have to wait for the final announcement of qualifiers later in the week for official word of their qualification status.
HARVARD WOMEN’S FENCING
The Crimson women—namely, Jarocki and Itzkowitz—made their presence felt on the podium in the sabré division on Sunday. Jarocki dominated the rest of the field throughout the day, finishing at the top of each of the three rounds of pool play she competed in after a first round bye. The Middle Village, N.Y. native recorded a plus-26 indicator en route to a 9-2 record in the final set of bouts to claim gold.
Itzkowitz had a solid day of her own on the strip, recording an 8-3 mark in the final round with a plus-9 indicator that put her in position for bronze.
And in perhaps a small preview of a possible bout to come at the upcoming NCAA Championships, Jarocki defeated Itzkowitz twice on the day, 5-1 in the third round and 5-0 in the fourth.
Co-captain Kara Lee finished 15th in the same division out of 49 fencers in what could be her final bouts wearing the lamé for Harvard.
The Crimson also saw success with the other two weapon classes, headed by freshman foilist MacKenzie Lawrence’s fourth place finish after she tallied seven wins in her first regional. The rest of the Harvard foil squad was not far behind, with sophomores Liana Yamin and Hali Nelson finishing sixth and seventh, respectively.
Representing the épéeists for the Crimson, Emma Vaggo finished seventh with a plus-4 indicator in the final round of pool play. The effort will likely earn the senior a bid to late-March’s championships.
HARVARD MEN’S FENCING
After running the tables in it’s third-straight Ivy League title in early February, the Crimson men continued its momentum into the individual-oriented portion of its schedule, with O’Brien and Simko eking out closely contested gold medals.
Though Simko’s plus-8 indicator was only fourth-best in the 12-person final pool, his eight wins were the most among the group and put the junior on top. O’Brien had a similarly tight finish despite his 9-2 record in the third and final pool round; his plus-17 indicator was just one touch better than that of St. Johns’ Ferenc Valkai. Regardless, both fencers punched their tickets to the NCAA Championships.
Harvard’s foil group of co-captain Brian Kaneshige, junior Jerry Chang, and sophomore Stephen Mageras each finished in the top-10 of their division in a solid showing for the group, which was missing sophomore Michael Woo due to injury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The awards just keep on coming for the Harvard men’s and women’s track teams.
Just one week after the women took home their third consecutive Indoor Heps title, while the men finished fifth, various individuals were recognized for their hard work.
The recognition began from the Ancient Eight, as head coach Jason Saretsky was named the Co-Women’s Head Coach of the Year, sharing the award with his Columbia counterpart, Dan Ireland.
The honors continued for Saretsky, as the USTFCCCA named him the women’s Head Coach of the Year for the Northwest Region, with assistant coach Kebba Tolbert, who works with the sprinters, hurdlers, long jumpers, and triple jumpers, tabbed as the women’s Assistant Coach of the Year.
Saretsky and Tolbert wouldn’t be the only one recognized, as a total of seven Crimson individuals, and one relay team, garnered First-Team All-Ivy League Honors after taking home the title in their events.
Senior Danielle Barbian led the pack with two selection, picking up her second straight first team nod in the 60 meter dash, while obtaining another first team honor in the 200 meter race. The senior is the first Harvard athlete to garner two first team nods since Helena Ronner ’03 did it in 2002.
Barbian was joined by sophomore Nikki Okwelogu and junior Autumne Franklin, who earned their selections in the shot put and 60-meter hurdles, respectively.
The good news didn’t stop there for Okwelogu, as the Fresno, Calif, native was announced as one of 16 participants in the shot put for the 2015 NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships, the only Crimson athlete to qualify. The sophomore was also recognized as the Northeast Region Field Athlete of the Year by the USTFCCCA
The 4x880 yard relay squad consisting of junior Paige Kouba, senior Molly Renfer, co-captain Erika Veidis, and junior Gabrielle Scott, which clinched the women’s Heps victory, was also honored with a first team All-Ivy selection.
Veidis, co-captain Ashley Collinsworth, and junior Taylor DuPont were awarded second team honors for their performances in the 800 meter run, 60-meter dash, and weight throw, respectively.
On the men’s side, captain Jarvis Harris earned first team honors in the 60-meter hurdles for his championship performance in the event. Harris was joined by rookie Malcolm Johnson, who took home the first team nod in the 60-meter dash and was the only Harvard freshman to make it on to the top squad.
Sophomore Efe Uwaifo joined the sprinters, garnering the first team selection for his performance in the triple jump. Freshman Matthew Hurst was named to the second team for his runner-up performance in the 200 meters.
With the indoor season now behind them, the Crimson squads look forward to the outdoor portion of the season, where the women will once again try to defend their Ivy League title, while the men look to improve on their performance from the indoor season.
