After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the red carpet rolled out in Northwest Labs mere hours before the 2015 Identities Fashion Show, The Crimson stopped backstage to hear from the students who helped in the making of the event. We profiled four of the many individuals who made this year’s Identities possible.
Susannah L. R. Maybank ’15, co-executive producer and creative director
Maybank leads a busy double life as co-executive producer and creative director of Identities 2015. A designer herself and a past participant in both Identities and Harvard’s Eleganza Show, Maybank is certainly familiar with the fashion scene at Harvard. This year, as she stands at the helm of Identities, she aims to push the envelope, setting new precedents for the way that fashion is presented on campus.
The theme of this year’s show as conceptualized by Maybank and her creative team is “aspirational fashion”: Maybank says that the event includes more younger designers than it has in the past. In keeping with this theme, Identities will, for the first time, feature a student designer in addition to a roster of professionals. “I think it’s about showing that students here can be involved in fashion,” she says. “We have really established designers and people who are just starting out, so…student designers get to see their work on the runway and then get to see [what] they could one day design with proper training and enough time in the industry.”
Isabella Tonchi, designer
After breaking into the fashion industry by working for Milan-based label Elio Fiorucci and subsequently designing collections for world-renowned brands Miu Miu and Gianni Versace, Isabella Tonchi decided to create her own eponymous brand in 2002. Since founding the line, she has shown her work at major fashion events, such as the New York and Milan Fashion Weeks.
“I like people very much, actually. I look at people; I’m a big watcher,” Tonchi says of her sources of inspiration. This year, Identities worked closely with Tonchi to select which pieces from her collection would be featured. “I said, ‘I would like to choose...what I think is more representative of what I do,’ and they said… ‘[We] also would like to have some architectural pieces,’” Tonchi says. “So I tried to do a mix of myself and the request from Harvard.”
The collection, which featured graphic, black-and-white prints made to look like puzzle pieces, was distinctive and youthful. “I like my clothes on young people, so I said, ‘Yes!’ A university is the best place to show it, actually,” Tonchi says.
Lilian Zhu ’17, designer and model
For the past two years, Zhu has modeled for Identities; this year, she will take on an additional role as a student designer in the show. “It’s really great to be involved on another level and hopefully see my pieces out there tonight for the first time in a walking exhibition,” she says.
Her swimwear and clothing line, Made by Dalloway, debuted at Identities but was actually conceived several years ago. “I made [these pieces] as my graduate collection in high school,” Zhu says. “To date, they’ve been the biggest collection that I’ve made.”
The set features swimwear in funky flower prints, lacy tops, and gender-bending silhouettes. “My inspiration for this set is androgynous,” Zhu says. “It’s a 12-piece set which can be worn at one time but can also be split up.” In the design of her work, which allows for individuals to wear pieces in an endless variety of combinations, form fits function. “I think one of the most important things is identity—fashion as a vehicle for identity—and having these pieces be really mix-and-match and really versatile,” she says.
Max Mondelli ’18, model
A full four hours before the show, Mondelli is already sporting all-black Identities attire and a slicked, spiky hair-do, made possible by the creative vision of estheticians Nikky Atkinson and Elicia Hostetter-Soltesz and a significant amount of hair gel. “The executives take this seriously and treat us like we’re professional models,” he says. “All of the models have been here since noon, getting ready, mingling.” Indeed, similarly made-up Harvard students drift down the hallways of the Northwest Labs at every turn, and the vibe is excited and friendly.
But despite the 8-hour lead up to the performance, Mondelli doesn’t seem nervous. “It’s really chill,” he says of Identities. “[The executives] are very organized, so everything is under control.” According to Mondelli, the general experience of being a model is stress-free. The application consisted only of submitting a headshot and participating in a short audition, and even the time commitment was reasonable. “It’s really the board members who put in the most work. My job is just to represent them on the runway and try to look as sexy as possible,” he says.

“What would happen if I put a play in a gallery? What would happen if I put a performance art piece on a stage in a theater?” These were the questions that motivated Mark J. Mauriello ’15 and that shaped his show “OSCAR at The Crown and the love that dare not speak its name.” Set to run from April 15 to 17 at the Oberon, the production is the culmination of Mauriello’s special concentration in Theater Arts and Performance. But despite being his creation,“OSCAR...” is ultimately a collaborative effort among cast, crew, and space.
The show traces the life of Oscar Wilde (played by Mauriello himself) during the height of his fame, depicting his affair with Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas and his conviction for gross indecency. According to Mauriello, who also wrote and directed the piece, the production begins as a high-energy, pop musical that deteriorates as Wilde’s world crumbles around him. “It deals a lot with...that rise and fall. How do we deal with the hardships that happen to us?” says Garrett C. Allen ’16, the show’s assistant director.
Due to the visibility of Wilde’s fall from grace, the show employs Wilde to examine wider issues of public and private image.  “It’s certainly a play that deals with the nature of celebrity, because Oscar Wilde was sort of the ultimate celebrity at this time,” says Thomas W. Peterson ’18, who plays Edward Shelley.
To advance these ideas, “OSCAR...” employs an experimental approach to tell the story: Mauriello gave the show a modern flair to suggest the themes’ universality across eras. “The [production’s] music is contemporary...[and] the dialogue and the language, throughout the evening get to be more and more like the ways we speak,” he says. “There’s a kind of timelessness...that makes Oscar Wilde feel like he belongs in our world today.”
For the actors, this modernity brought to the forefront the challenge of adapting their characters to match the play’s contemporary atmosphere. Tackling the issue involved a collective rehearsal and creation process in which the actors brought aspects of their own personalities into their roles. “A lot of the process [of getting in character] has consisted of group discussion and how we think that the [character] would function in this world,” says Michelle Geosits, a Boston Conservatory student who is one of three actresses playing Wilde’s close friend Lillie.
In keeping with this cooperative method of working, even the production’s script evolved during rehearsals. According to Mauriello, while he had a story outline before rehearsals started in January, the final show resulted from workshops and conversations with his fellow actors. “It’s not my show,” he says. “I’m leading the charge, but we’re all making this together.”
Executive producer Sara K. Rosenburg ’16 echoes Mauriello’s sentiment. “There’s something really special that happens in the Harvard theater community where people of all types and talents can bring together all of those things to support each other in making original art,” she says.
The collaboration extends beyond the cast and crew into the venue itself, as the physical space of the Oberon serves to facilitate the production’s symbolic nature. According to Boston Conservatory student Charles J. Mantione, who plays Douglas, the production borders on performance art. He describes one scene in which the characters run around the space to represent the ups-and-downs of Wilde and Douglas’ relationship. “We’re expressing the plot in a very physical and metaphoric way,” he says.
Such performances might not be standard at traditional theater venues, but according to Ariane Barbanell, director of special projects at the American Repertory Theater, the Oberon’s stage is far from the usual black box theater. Instead it resembles a club, allowing for interactions between performers and audience. “It is a social experience,” she says. “There is always something that is going on that is engaging the audience as well as the performers.”
It’s a fitting locale for a play that examines persona, theater, and storytelling in unexpected ways. “In many ways, this is an experiment,” Mauriello says. “Every day in rehearsal and in the grand scheme of the whole thing, we’re taking a leap. It’s terrifying...but it’s really fulfilling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Raymond Carver’s short story “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” two couples sit around a dinner table, drinking gin and talking about the nature of true love. As the gin continues to flow, the conversation becomes swifter, less rational. The young lovers continue to disagree about what love is until one of them, Mel, offers a heartwarming story: An old couple nearly die in a car accident but are kept alive by their love. The two live through the crash, and the old man’s only regret after the accident is that, due to his full body cast, he cannot see his wife’s face. This, Mel argues, is what true love looks like.
Nicholas Sparks has created a quite lucrative career predicated on this idea of true love. One of his most common tropes involves an elderly couple, not unlike the one Mel describes in  Carver’s story, though in Spark’s work it is often a widowed octogenarian rather than a pair. This latest film, “The Longest Ride,” adapted from the novel of the same name, features an elderly man named Ira (Alan Alda), whom two young lovers, the film’s protagonists, encounter when they save him from a car accident. Inside the car is a box he insists he needs. As it turns out, the box is full of letters—another Sparks trope—he sent to his wife before she died. Through the letters, the story of Ira (whose young iteration is played by Jack Huston) and his late wife Ruth (Oona Chaplin) is played out in parallel to the love story of Ira’s two saviors, Luke (Scott Eastwood) and Sophia (Britt Robertson).
The scenes in which Ira remembers his wife are shot in rose-tinted sepia, as if to openly admit to the audience that the memories are warped by the bias of retrospection. Sparks’s argument is that true love is something that exists only in the norms of the past. The film’s modern love story backs this reading. Luke is a classic, Southern good ol’ boy. When Sophia asks to buy him a drink, he refuses, saying, “That’s not how we do it where I come from.” Traditional gender norms in Sparks’s film are passed off as good manners while the rose-tinted view of these bygone practices is portrayed without the inherent injustice that accompanies them.
Luke’s cowboy life has also been passed through a filter so that the life portrayed on screen has no aspiration to reflect reality and instead presents a whitewashed utopian ideal—a farmhouse fairytale. In fact, one must drive across a wooden bridge over a river to reach Luke’s home, a sort of rural moat without the alligators. All of the rough edges of country life have been made to look beautiful. Despite wearing a hat for much of the film, Luke’s hair always sits deliberately in a James Dean-esque swoosh. His chest hairs are meticulously trimmed.
Perhaps the most bizarre motif in the film is the presence of art. Ruth was an art collector, and Sophia aspires to work in a gallery. The characters often talk about the meaning and value of art. Early on, the vacillations seem to be mere vapid musings, but late in the film, Sparks’s cards are revealed. In the film’s final act, after one of the characters has died (this would merit a spoiler alert if there were not a death in every one of Sparks’s films), his will is being read aloud to a room full of people. In the will, the fallen character writes, “Never forget the true work of art—this thing called life.” Here, Sparks defends the shameless lack of meaning in his films. Unfortunately for Sparks, and his loyal audience, he has created in “The Longest Ride” neither art or anything resembling real life.
This film is much like Mel’s story in “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” excepting the fact that, presumably, Sparks was not drunk when he wrote this screenplay. While Carver includes Mel’s love story as an ironic depiction of people’s profound lack of understanding of this crazy little thing called love, Sparks passes his films off as truth. Instead of asking viewers to think, his film instead offers them an airbrushed view of simpler times and simpler places, its flimsy improbability glued together by a reprehensible lack of cultural awareness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matzah does not taste good. But still, in the past week, it conquered social media. It took over Snapchat Stories, Facebook walls, and even my Twitter feed.
A couple of days later, friends began posting statuses containing bible verses—thanking Jesus for dying for their sins, making pledges to be more pious in the coming year, and lauding the Marshmallow Peep. I will admit: Peeps do taste better than matzah.
Meanwhile, I spent a few hours last weekend watching HBO’s new documentary, “Going Clear,” and learning the inner-workings of the unfathomably corrupt, money-making “religion” that is Scientology. I have yet to taste Tom Cruise.
And you know what’s weird? Despite my desire to be an accepting, sympathetic, all-loving member of society, I was equally horrified by all of the above—the toffee and chocolate covered cardboard, the resurrection, and the Tom Cruise.
Why? Because, simply put, while I respect many religious people—and I don’t think faith somehow prohibits intelligence—I remain confident that religion is the world’s most destructive force.
Before going any further, I want to make clear that I am not just talking about religious extremists in this piece. If I were, I wouldn’t have started with matzah and Peeps; instead, I would have led with a condemnation of the zealots responsible for massacring 147 Kenyans in the name of radical Islam, a denunciation of the treatment of women in the Hasidic community, an impassioned defense of gay marriage, etc. (not to create a false equivalency between any of the above).
I’m also not here to say whether or not a god exists. If you believe in a god (that is, any of the thousands who have been worshipped throughout human history), mazel tov. If you don’t, that’s also more than okay—but we can talk about Hitchens another time.
No, this piece isn’t about people who take religion to the extreme, and it’s not meant to mock or deride people’s faith. Again, thousands of articles and books have done that, and I am genuinely not interested in being incendiary or offending anybody.
Rather, the purpose of this column is to identify how America’s culture of religious acceptance has adverse effects—how an overemphasis on religious tolerance cripples intellectual, social, and environmental progress.
Of course, every American should be allowed to practice whatever religion she chooses, and her legal right to do so should never be compromised under any circumstances. However, Americans at Harvard and elsewhere, myself included, have a tendency to stop themselves from making logical, intellectually-driven arguments for fear of offending religious people. And this is problematic.
Here’s a micro-example of this phenomenon: When I stopped eating carbs last week to try to get six-pack abs (an admittedly failed attempt), I was made fun of by all of my friends: “Why would you deprive yourself of the pleasure of pizza?” But when several of my most religious peers swore off leavened bread this week in solidarity with Israelites from a story that takes place thousands of years ago, nobody questioned their decision—in fact, dining halls and other eating establishments changed their menus to accommodate these people’s needs.
After all, no matter how ridiculous people’s actions get, if they are making decisions based on religious beliefs, we, as a society, will not criticize them.
On a bigger scale, this trend has far more detrimental effects. When religious students at Harvard make arguments against abortion in day-to-day conversation, admit that they don’t believe in evolution, or embrace a second-class role for women in society, we tend not to question them and not to push back. In turn, we sacrifice our intellectual rigor.
When people say they can’t believe in climate change for religious reasons—or, worse, argue that atrocities like climate change or natural disasters are God’s form of retribution for leading secular lives—we do not confront them head on. Sure, we might mock these beliefs behind their backs, but without directly questioning and forcing them to defend their ideas, we are letting our political correctness prevent us from engaging in an honest debate.
Which is to say: While I would and could never actually stop you from eating matzah, abstaining from sex until marriage, or conducting Derrida-level deconstruction of L. Ron Hubbard’s prose, I should feel just as safe to criticize any and all of your beliefs as you feel making fun of me for trying to get a six-pack in time for the summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a recent news article published in The Crimson detailed, a group of students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has begun an effort to unionize. Graduate student Elaine F. Stranahan, a leader of the effort, told The Crimson that the movement is focusing on issues like health care, dental care, housing, and the experience of working as a teaching fellow. A recent scrutiny published in The Crimson’s Fifteen Minutes Magazine focused on the TF experience at Harvard, and highlighted concerns about the stressful uncertainty of finding classes to teach when enrollment varies wildly during shopping week, and delays in receiving paychecks. An op-ed published in The Crimson last week by Frauke Hoss, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Belfer Center for International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, expressed further concerns about the affordability of housing and childcare in Cambridge. Although Hoss is addressing the concerns of postdocs in her piece, her points are applicable to graduate students who serve as TFs as well. As a university that prides itself on the quality of its teaching and research, Harvard must not overlook the graduate students who make that teaching and research possible.
We believe a push for unionization is the most viable recourse for graduate students looking to address these issues. At the moment, Harvard has little incentive, beyond occasional pressure from academic departments, to respond to requests from graduate students seeking better teaching and working conditions. This movement has the potential to change that dynamic. Graduate students who are literally stressed to the point of breaking teeth are not as effective at conducting their own research or serving as TFs in undergraduate classes, and the threat of unionization offers a way for these vital members of Harvard’s community to advocate effectively for their unique set of concerns.
This campaign is not without precedent. Last year, an unrecognized union of graduate students at Yale organized a protest in favor of a more formal unionization process. At New York University, graduate assistants joined the United Automobile Workers union, becoming the only such union recognized by a private university. Graduate students at NYU achieved this success in spite of roadblocks like a 2004 decision from the National Labor Relations Board that held that graduate students and teaching assistants at Brown are legally students, not employees.
It is important to remember exactly which students are seeking to unionize. This effort is to improve the living and working conditions of students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who serve as TFs for classes at the College, who are paid $20,520 a year to teach two sections per semester, most in the hopes of eventually having a career in academia. Harvard must offer more support for these critical members of the community, whose teaching and research is crucial to undergraduates and faculty alike. Practically speaking, a movement for unionization is the first step toward achieving that support.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot in his motorcade in Dallas, Texas. 1963 was also the year The Beatles released their first album, “Please Please Me,” which they recorded in a single day just a couple of months before its debut. And from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., told an audience of a quarter million about a dream that would soon seize many more.
But in the least likely of ways, the least likely of people—a weatherman from Washington, DC, who acted on children’s TV on weekends—changed the fundamental nature of American existence in 1963 with a more subtle magnitude than any of the events that happened that year. This man was Willard Scott, better known as an icon so widely celebrated that he gives even Santa Claus a run for his money, Ronald McDonald.
Ronald was born out of a crucial conclusion that McDonald’s executives made based on Scott’s gig as Bozo the Clown in the popular children’s show, “Bozo’s Circus”: Clowns sell.
McDonald’s made their understanding of this consumer habit painfully clear in their first stab at creating Ronald, who, wearing a paper cup on his nose and tray for a hat, was quite literally the product they were trying to sell. If a Happy Meal could have eyes and a mouth, it would be this early version of Ronald. Sales went up by 30 percent after the mascot was introduced, and it became clear that the key to selling hamburgers was selling the clown-man who looked like he was made up of them.
Once Ronald gained traction, McDonald’s could focus its advertising efforts on children, a market segment that is much more easily manipulated than that of rational adult consumers. Before they reach the age of eight, children cannot discern advertisements from regular programming. They are unable to grasp the concept that companies are trying to market their products. Selling hamburgers to babies is like taking candy from them, and Ronald became McDonald’s means to exploit this phenomenon.
McDonald’s early Ronald-centered ad campaigns trivialized the judgment of parents in the eyes of children and licensed them to make their own dietary decisions—with input from everyone’s favorite hamburger-happy clown, of course! Ronald asked a child in one especially disturbing ad in 1963, “Aren’t hamburgers delicious?” to which the child replied, “Mom told me never to talk to strangers.” But after the clown revealed his identity and made three hamburgers materialize on a tray near his crotch, the child exclaimed in revelation, “You’re no stranger; you really are Ronald McDonald!” and then proceeded to dance with the adult clown in a scene wrought with pedophilic undertones. Ad campaigns like this had a nontrivial effect on the trust children have historically invested in Ronald McDonald. In a study asking children, “Who would you like to take you out for a treat?” the clown was even more popular than their parents.
The scariest part of all this is that we have not outgrown Ronald. When dancing, hamburger-eating children became moms and dads immutably normalized to fast food, Ronald moved his prospects to a new generation of the impressible. He got a makeover, but that’s only because the universally recognized Ronald didn’t have to wear his food in order to sell it anymore. Ronald’s ads were still exclusively targeted at children, and by 1998, 89 percent of kids under the age of eight—the crucial age when they could first start understanding the concept of marketing—ate at McDonalds at least once a month.
If I need to make the case about how problematic that is, then I should note that childhood obesity rates have more than doubled since 1963. Willard Scott got fired as Ronald because he was too fat to play the “extremely active” character, but the laughable irony of this incident is washed out by the reality that McDonald’s didn’t need a person behind Ronald, anyway. By this point, Ronald was not a human as much as a virus—mutilating the American DNA to make it look like our own consumption habits prey on our bodies. His empire thrives on this misapplied First Amendment rhetoric. Ronald McDonald would shove hamburgers down children’s throats if he could get away with it.
And while the country is immunizing itself against the fast food industry, Ronald is growing more infectious. He’s taking selfies at music festivals and hashtagging on Twitter, increasing his relevance among the first generation in a long time that doesn’t (yet) spend its afternoons at the Mickey D’s around the corner. And in his most intelligent move of all, Ronald has leveraged the uncriticizable nature of charity to sell his products. Making the clown the face and namesake of the Ronald McDonald House Charities, McDonald’s takes every opportunity to positively reinforce its branding. An appeal to make McDonald’s retire Ronald has become perceived as an uprising against an ambassador for empathy and active lifestyles (who pumps cholesterol through your arteries on the side).
A McDonalds without Ronald will still perpetuate health problems among our most susceptible populations. And when a critical mass of students and health professionals from Harvard and other schools held a Retire Ronald McDonald rally last Wednesday, I’m sure that’s what they were thinking. But retiring Ronald is a tangible step towards a food system with enfranchised, conscious eaters. It’s a goal Americans can digest—hopefully in the place of burgers and fries.

Scientist and public health advocate Arlene D. Blum discussed her research and advocacy work surrounding “harmful” chemicals found in consumer products and how that work relates to campus sustainability in an event hosted by the Harvard Office for Sustainability Thursday afternoon.
Blum, founder and executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute and a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, spoke about six classes of chemicals commonly used by manufacturers and the harmful effects she said they can have on consumers.
Blum reviewed each category of chemicals separately, asking whether using each class was worth its risk and if safer, greener alternatives exist.
Blum also discussed her efforts to reduce what she called harmful flame retardant chemicals in consumer products. In an interview after the talk, she highlighted the Office for Sustainability’s initiative to provide the campus with furniture free of these chemicals.
“They are actively trying to switch to furniture without flame retardants when they buy new furniture,” Blum said. “[That] is something that I have seen other campuses start trying to do, but it’s only recently possible.”
Blum described Harvard’s leadership in the higher education community, and the unique role of college campuses in spreading the discussion about more sustainable consumer products.
“Harvard is really taking a leadership role with their sustainability plan and moving to help clear their most toxic products,” Blum said. “College campuses are a great place to take leadership in new sustainable products reducing toxics. It’s educational for the students, and it sets a good example for the community.”
After the talk, Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office for Sustainability, said that Blum’s research fits into the office’s initiative to better the health and well-being of the Harvard community, one of five aspects of its sustainability plan for Harvard.
“The way that Arlene Blum’s research comes into play is to better educate us about these classes of chemicals that have an impact on public health,” Henriksen said. “[With Blum’s research] we understand what those chemicals are and then cross reference that with manufactures who are putting materials into our buildings.”
The event was part of Harvard University Climate Week, which aims to expose the Harvard community and interested members of the public to “some of the best scholarship and thinking related to climate change,” according to its website.

As Harvard prepares to launch a sexual conduct climate survey on April 12, administrators are emphasizing the confidentiality of the poll and are executing an aggressive publicity push to draw respondents.
The survey, which is a Harvard-specific version of an Association of American Universities poll being conducted at 28 schools this month, will be released through individualized links to all students at Harvard on April 12 and will be open until May 3.
According to Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, a member of the University’s sexual assault task force who helped spearhead the design of the national survey, the poll will ask questions on topics ranging from sexual misconduct to affirmative consent to the investigatory and support resources Harvard offers. Laibson said the survey will stay away from certain catchall words such as “sexual assault” and “rape,” and will instead describe specific acts of sexual misconduct, such as penetration or sexual touching.
Those who participate will receive a $5 Amazon gift card for taking the survey, which Laibson estimates will take around 20 minutes.
The survey release comes almost year after a committee formed by University President Drew G. Faust and chaired by former Provost Steven E. Hyman requested funds for such a poll. In the 11 months since the survey was announced, Harvard has also rolled out a centralized approach to dealing with alleged cases of sexual harassment and increased funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Administrators appear to see the climate survey as another significant step. On Friday, students will receive an email from Faust urging them to participate. On April 12, they will see an email from the research company Westat with a link to the poll.
“I very much want it to come from the highest levels of Harvard and to emphasize how important it is that people participate,” Faust said last month.
Administrators have been working behind the scenes for months on how to best publicize the climate survey because similar surveys across different universities have historically drawn low response rates.
The Faust message will be followed by similar emails sent to every student from other Harvard administrators and leaders. Many students will also be reminded of the survey around campus; Harvard has planned a coordinated publicity campaign including posters, ads atop dining hall tables and projected onto screens in common areas, and messages emblazoned on shuttle buses driving the Cambridge streets, according to Leah Rosovsky ’78, a University vice president for strategy and programs.
Harvard has also purchased advertisements in The Crimson’s online and print platforms, according to Rosovsky. For a month, the University will illuminate the dome of Memorial Church in teal—the official color of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, which is April.
As they promote the survey, administrators are emphasizing that all responses will be confidential. Once students click through to the Westat site, Laibson said, “anything that could re-identify them is severed from the record,” including IP addresses and email addresses.
The second priority, Laibson said, is transparency. When the results are tabulated and released—Laibson said the University is aiming for a September announcement date—administrators hope to release detailed breakdowns, if the response rate is high enough that the figures do not risk re-identification.
“The more school-specific data we can make public, the more the community will be informed, and we’ll have thoughts about what we should do to put the data at work in the service of prevention,” Laibson said.
After the results are released, the same task force that proposed the survey will make recommendations for how to decrease the incidents of sexual assault, encourage reporting, and ensure reporting bodies are effective, according to Hyman, the body’s chair. Hyman added that he thinks the survey forces the task force to address the sources of misconduct it identifies.
“Clearly the task force will make recommendations that, within the capacity of the University and the law, we address those things,” Hyman said. “By doing this survey, we’ve made it impossible to look away from these problems, even if they are difficult to take on.”
Next fall, Harvard will be able to compare its results to aggregate data from all 28 schools compiled by Westat. Laibson said he hopes all schools scrutinize the data and learn from each other’s practices.
“That variation is where a lot of the learning will come from: different schools with different prevalence rates,” Laibson said. “That’s a clue to where problems arise and where solutions exist.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With House rooming lotteries underway, some upperclassmen said they find the process of room selection to be both a source of stress and an exciting opportunity to improve their housing prospects for the coming year.
In many Houses, upperclassman rooming groups are randomly assigned lottery numbers from their House administrators, dictating the order in which they choose their future rooms. Juniors generally complete the lottery process first, followed by sophomores, and the remaining rooms are distributed among the freshmen who will live in the House next year as sophomores.
The details of this process differ greatly from House to House. Some Houses, such as Adams, turn the lottery into a pseudo game show, complete with desserts, a full-screen projection of the available housing options, and cheering and jeering as desirable rooms are taken by competing blocking groups.
While other Houses utilize computer programs to assign the order of room selection, Adams House administrators instead picked the numbers out of a bingo ball machine, with each subsequent announcement of a number followed by screams of both excitement and jealousy from the crowded dining hall.
At a similar Eliot House room selection event, students pulled numbers out of a battered leather hat, some muttering under their breath after receiving unsatisfactory results.
Other Houses employ less flashy processes. Cabot House resident Tyler W. Creamer ’16, a former Crimson business editor, said his House’s process was “pretty low-key,” adding that each group was simply assigned a time to meet one-on-one with the House administrator to choose a room.
Still, other Cabot residents note that certain suites are often a point of particular interest during the lottery.
Cabot resident Jefferson E. Seidl ’16 described two especially desirable suites in Cabot—the Library Suite and the “Junior Party Suite”—which he said are “better than the other suites.” Seidl added that residents of those suites are expected to throw some Cabot-wide parties each year to strengthen the House’s social scene.
Occasionally, controversy ensues when students call into question the random nature of the selection process. Creamer recalled an incident a few years ago when participants in the Cabot lottery claimed that the computer program used to generate the order was biased. In 1981, some residents of Adams argued that the tutor in charge of the rooming process invited his friends to pick their numbers first and signaled towards the numbers he wanted them to choose.
Students are not the only ones who find the rooming lottery process to be a stressful time. Several House administrators contacted by The Crimson declined to comment on the process, citing the high volume of work in their offices between the current lotteries and preparations for the upcoming Commencement season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just weeks after many departments' deadlines for submitting senior theses, some concentrations are encouraging potential thesis writers to begin thinking of ideas or requiring them to submit proposals in the spring of their junior years.
According to faculty and staff from several departments, these early steps help in developing thesis topics and planning summer research. Students rarely make significant changes to their thesis topics between junior and senior year, they added.
The History of Science department requires students planning to write senior theses to submit preliminary proposals in the spring of their junior years and revised proposals the next fall, according to Nadine M. Weidman, the leader of the History of Science senior thesis tutorial.
“I’ve done this job for two years, and I don’t think anyone has really changed the thesis topic to something radically different,” she said, adding that some students have made shifts within their broader topic area.
According to Laura G. Thomas, undergraduate advising and program administrator in the Sociology Department, students interested in writing theses submit statements of intent in the spring of their junior years, but she added that students can begin the process in the fall of their senior year.
Thomas said she has noticed that as students do research over the summer or flesh out their ideas with advisers, their original ideas become more focused and concrete. Like Weidman, however, Thomas said thesis writers in her department do not typically make drastic changes in their topics between their junior and senior years.
According to Economics lecturer and adviser Kiran Gajwani, the Economics Department does not have a “formal policy for juniors” interested in writing theses. Gajwani said the deadline to decide to write a thesis is the beginning of senior fall, when thesis writers need to enroll in an Economics 985 senior thesis research seminar and have a topic and advisor.
Gajwani said the department offers optional junior seminars, research-oriented courses that can help students develop ideas for their theses. In addition, Gajwani said the department holds meetings and offers advising for juniors who are interested in writing senior theses.
According to Economics concentrator Bianca Mulaney ’16, who said she plans to write a senior thesis on the economic impact of antibiotic resistance, the department asks thesis writers to submit a pre-registration form by May 1 of their junior years, but not submitting the form does not prohibit concentrators from writing theses.
“I think it’s good to start thinking about your thesis before you leave campus…especially because during the summer, you have more time to reflect on thesis writing,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When administrators first promised in 2010 to distill and publish a database with more detailed information about case decisions made by the College’s primary disciplinary board, they said they wanted to increase transparency of a body that students often perceive as opaque.
Quickly, however, the fate of the project became unclear, as the Administrative Board has repeatedly pushed the database’s target release date back, amid concerns that the summaries could compromise the privacy of individual students; administrators also cited the backlog of work created by Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory as a reason for its continued delay.
Now, more than four years after it was promised to be released, administrators have indicated that the project has stalled indefinitely. There are no immediate plans to release the database, according to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
“At present we are not planning any changes,” Khurana, who chairs the Ad Board, said of the information the Ad Board currently releases.
For years, the College has published statistics summarizing the Ad Board’s caseload in the aggregate, which includes petitions to withdraw from a course and disciplinary cases involving alleged academic integrity or “social behavior” policy violations. While those statistics tally what sanctions the Board hands down each academic year in broad categories, they do not offer qualitative details about individual cases.
As described by former Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison in 2010, the planned database, in contrast, was slated to include brief summaries of some cases. Megan R. Mitrovich, then a management fellow hired to organize the data, said at the time that the goal was to create a “pretty comprehensive database” that would detail the different sanctions and outcomes so that students could determine whether they would have grounds to appeal an Ad Board decision.
Since 2010, both the Ad Board and its staff have undergone significant changes. In 2014, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved the College’s first-ever honor code, which will roll out in the fall with the formation of a student-faculty body, separate from the Ad Board, to hear cheating cases. And beginning in July, the College will house both the Ad Board and the new Honor Council under a single office.
The database project’s progress has stalled during this transition period, with no publicly stated timeframe for its potential release, and its future uncertain.
“I don't know whether it’s going to be released,” Brett Flehinger, the Ad Board’s current secretary, said in February. “I think right now we’re committed to making sure that the stats are updated.”
Khurana said it is challenging to manage the competing interests of transparency and student privacy.
“We are trying to balance the needs of basically having a community understand how the Honor Council and the Administrative Board works, while respecting the privacy of individual students,” Khurana said.
Lauren E. Brandt, who will serve as Ad Board secretary next fall, said her office will broadly reevaluate how to make the body more transparent  in conjunction with Khurana and Flehinger, who will be the Honor Council’s secretary next fall.

UPDATED: April 11, 2015, at 8:57 p.m.
The names of the 24 juniors elected to the Harvard chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest undergraduate honors society in the United States, were released on Thursday. The Mathematics Department was most heavily represented with three concentrators among the elected.
Selected students were notified Monday. Jeffrey Berg, assistant director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, released the list on Thursday.
“It’s such an honor to be eligible for it,” said Aaron Z. Roper ’16, a Government concentrator in Leverett House, “but to actually get it—you have to temper your expectations a bit when the pool is so impressive. I was really happy to receive it.”
Roper said he has taken a wide range of courses throughout college, ranging from large introductory classes to more focused concentration classes as well as math classes for his secondary.
“I was definitely not expecting to get in. I was only hoping,” said Melody Y. Guan ’16, a concentrator in Chemistry and Physics and an inactive Crimson news editor. “I had this faint hope in my heart that maybe I could be so lucky to speak for this honor one day. It was really, really exciting.”
Guan is working towards a joint masters degree in statistics, and said she is very interested in biology. Guan attributed her selection in part to the breadth of her academic career.
Two other students in Guan’s blocking group were also selected as members of the Junior 24.
Ryan D. Chow ’16, a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator in Pforzheimer House, said his courses have been primarily science-related, though he has taken several music classes. He, too, mentioned the importance of breadth.
Roper and Chow both attributed a significant portion of their success to faculty and mentors, and pointed out the importance of finding good mentors early on.
“I don’t think anyone really expected it to happen, so it was very humbling,” said Chow. “Everyday I’m walking around and there’s all these brilliant people and I do wonder if I’m supposed to be here or not, so it was great.”
The complete list of the 24 juniors elected to Phi Beta Kappa is as follows:
Emma R. Adler, English (Quincy)*
Neil M. Alacha, Social Studies (Quincy)
Taylor L. Benninger, Sociology (Eliot)
Henry Burnam, Music (Kirkland)
Ryan D. Chow, Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (Pforzheimer)
Antonio Coppola, Applied Mathematics (Currier)*
Michelle R. Deng, Computer Science (Eliot)*
Rebekka E.M. DePew, Engineering Sciences for Bachelors (Quincy)
David Ding, Mathematics (Adams)
Erica X Eisen, History of Art and Architecture (Mather)*
Melody Y. Guan, Chemistry and Physics (Eliot)*
Kirin Gupta, Social Studies (Winthrop)
Andrew D. Kim, Psychology (Dudley)*
Spencer Kwon, Mathematics (Eliot)
Garrett M. Lam, Neurobiology (Lowell)*
Aaron Landesman, Mathematics (Eliot)
Kevin B. Li, Economics (Adams)
Fred S. Lu, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (Pforzheimer)
Shirley S. Mo, Applied Mathematics (Currier)
Andrew P. Mollerus, Economics (Cabot)
Aaron Z. Roper, Government (Leverett)
Carter L.W. Stratton, History (Leverett)
Colton A. Valentine, Literature (Lowell)*
Ava L. Zhang, Psychology (Eliot)

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 11, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Erica X Eisen's concentration due to erroneous information provided by Harvard's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. In fact, Eisten concentrates in the History of Art and Architecture, not Literature.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-three student startup finalists gathered Thursday night to present their projects at the showcase of the i3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge. The showcase was followed by an awards ceremony announcing the prize winners.
Award recipients included Senju and Elfakhani, who won the Public Sector Innovation Award for $10,000 from Accenture, a multinational management consulting company.
Adrian W. Jones ’16, Aaron Perez ’15, Michael Perez, and Rishav Mukherji ’15 won $10,000 through the McKinley Family Grant for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Social Enterprise. The group’s startup, NutraRide, aims to provide data visualization for the origin and production of food.
Francis K. Masuda ’15, Conner R. Dalton ’15, and Ryan D. Grossman ’15 also won $10,000 through the McKinley Family Grant for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Commercial Enterprise. The group designed an app called Ivory, which provides digital tools to help learn sheet music.
Jason D. D. Smith ’15 and Trevor R. Nash ’15 built Rayger Lights, a startup that creates consumer lights for lightshows that respond to music frequencies. They built their first prototype lightshow as a class project for an introduction to electrical engineering course.
Smith and Nash’s project Rayger Lights won the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard Prize for $5,000.
Participants also pointed to the educational value of doing the challenge, even if they did not secure funding.
Florencia Leyson, co-founder of Meri Library and a student at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said that the competition gave her experience in entrepreneurship.
“We felt it was a great opportunity to receive some feedback for our idea,” she said. “This is something new to us; we’re not entrepreneurs.”
Leyson’s startup was originally a class project at the Kennedy School. Leyson and her classmate Kate W. Sturla decided to turn their class project into a potential startup.
Smith also pointed out the value of the process.
“Pitching to investors is a critical skill for startups, and it is something you will have to continually do, so being able to do that in a kind of lower-risk environment is really advantageous,” he said.
Other projects ranged from mobile phone applications for finding tutors to vegan baked goods.
Hikari Senju ’15 and Mazen Elfakhani, a teaching fellow in the Sociology Department, designed an app called QuickHelp, which enables students and tutors to find each other and arrange one-on-one tutoring sessions.
Nina Hooper ’16 and Alice Han ’16 worked on a projected called Feel Good Cake, a series of vegan baked goods produced using nutrient-rich ingredients that are both gluten and refined sugar-free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team (16-8, 5-1 CWPA) nears the end of its season looking toward the CWPA Eastern Championships.
The Crimson will travel to Princeton’s DeNunzio pool this weekend to face three CWPA Western teams, including No. 16 Indiana (13-11, 1-1) on Saturday and No. 15 Michigan (12-10, 3-0 CWPA) on Sunday.
Harvard’s eight losses are 12 fewer than last year’s campaign. Faced with a disappointing 6-5 loss against Brown in the Ivy League tournament on Feb. 22, the Crimson regained its confidence by sweeping a trio of contests over a weekend at Bucknell before winning five of eight against talented California teams during spring break.
“We had every opportunity to win [the Brown game],” junior attacker Yoshi Andersen said. “But we missed shot after shot, ultimately losing the game. Our highest point was our weekend at Bucknell when we finally stopped feeling sorry for ourselves and decided we would take control of our games.”
Notably, Harvard scored a big upset against then-No. 19 Santa Clara over spring break. The Crimson defense stood strong in the game, limiting the Broncos to only one goal each quarter. Harvard, on the other hand, had no trouble scoring, netting at least three goals in each quarter en route to a 14-4 win.
The Crimson nearly pulled off another upset against No. 11 UC Davis. Harvard took the Mustangs to overtime, but UC Davis managed to clinch the victory in the waning seconds of the extra frame.
“I felt hungry going into that game because each time we have played them in the past, we have had close wins and losses,” said Andersen, who leads the Crimson in goals this season with 49. “We shut them down and implemented our game plan that used many different things we learned about ourselves over the California trip.”
The overtime tension against UC Davis was reminiscent of Harvard’s pivotal Senior Day game against Marist on March 7. After a goalless first overtime and key saves from captain goalkeeper Ariel Dukes, the Crimson won that match, 9-7.
“It was really special to send our seniors out on such a high note,” said sophomore attacker Alexis Del Toro. “I hadn’t experienced that amount of intensity and heart in a game at Harvard quite like that…. It’s one of my favorite games I’ve ever played.”
The Crimson owes some of its newfound success to its four rookies, who have improved Harvard’s depth and flexibility on both offense and defense. Freshman goaltender Cleo Harrington—who has notched CWPA Division I/II Rookie of the Week honors—has stepped in to share the net with the graduating Dukes, posting a team-best 124 saves in 16 games.
“It has made a huge difference that we can sub six for six and not lose our momentum,” Andersen said. “Each of [the freshmen] brought a new strength to our team that I didn’t even realize we lacked until they filled the role.”
Harvard continues on its road to the CWPA Eastern Championship. At Princeton, Harvard will face Notre Dame College of Ohio (1-8, 0-3) and the Hoosiers on Saturday before lining up against the Wolverines on Sunday.
Harvard is 0-5 all-time against Michigan, which will enter the weekend ranked second only to Princeton in the CWPA polls. On Monday, junior Wolverine goaltender Julia Campbell claimed her second CWPA Defensive Player of the Week award in three weeks after making five saves in a 13-12 overtime win against Indiana last weekend.
The Hoosiers rank third in the conference, just ahead of Harvard, which ranks fourth.
The action in New Jersey will preview Ivy rematches with Princeton and Brown on April 16 and 18, respectively, as well as the CWPA Eastern Championships, which will be hosted at DeNunzio Pool.
The last CWPA Eastern Championships saw Harvard entering the tournament as the seventh seed and placing seventh overall. However, this year’s Crimson has taken down multiple teams this year that it struggled against last year. Del Toro feels ready to compete for a conference title.
“We’ve grown immensely since we started, and I’ve loved battling with this team every second we jump in the pool,” Del Toro said. “I think we’re in a really good pace for Easterns this year. It definitely won’t be easy, but we are so ready for the challenge.”

On April 6th, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris emailed Harvard undergraduates about the “Bureau of Study Counsel Oversight.” If you were anything like me, you might’ve thought that meant that the Bureau of Study Counsel had messed something up and Dean Harris was apologizing for it. But wait! On April 8th, there was a town hall meeting discussing the changes to the Bureau in the PBHA parlor room. Here’s what’s actually going on:


The Bureau of Study Counsel provides a much-needed service to Harvard College Students, from helping freshmen adjust to the college workload to helping seniors who are struggling in their first science class since high school by providing peer tutors. With its new changes, Flyby is happy to see the BSC so concerned with bettering the way they engage with students and soliciting student feedback along the way.
