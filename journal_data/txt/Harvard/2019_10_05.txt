After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Students for Fair Admissions filed a notice of appeal to the United States First Circuit Court of Appeals Friday afternoon in its longtime suit against Harvard alleging that the College’s admissions process unlawfully discriminates against Asian American applicants.
A notice of appeal instructs the lower court to “assemble the record” of case materials amassed throughout the trial and send a “notice of assembly” to the Appeals Court.
The notice comes just three days after judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard in federal district court Tuesday. She cleared the University of all four counts of alleged wrongdoing — including intentional discrimination against Asian Americans and inadequate exploration of race-neutral alternatives — and affirmed the value of diversity in higher education under Supreme Court precedent.
The high-profile lawsuit has attracted national media attention since SFFA filed its complaint in 2014. Experts have speculated that the case could eventually go to the Supreme Court and decide the fate of affirmative action policies at private colleges and universities nationwide. The additional litigation could take years.
SFFA President Edward J. Blum wrote in an emailed statement that the organization is “looking forward” to the appeals process.
“Students for Fair Admissions looks forward to making our appeal to the US First Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, to the US Supreme Court,” Blum wrote.
William F. Lee ’72 — the lead trial lawyer for Harvard and the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — said that Harvard will “vigorously” defend Burrough’s decision.
“The Court’s ruling that Harvard does not discriminate on the basis of race in its admissions process, and that Harvard’s pursuit of the diverse student body central to its educational mission is lawful, was very gratifying and provides a clear path forward to resolve this important case,” Lee said in a statement Friday. “Harvard will vigorously defend the Court’s decision in this case.”
Though Burroughs ruled in Harvard's favor, she wrote in her decision that the College could take additional steps to ensure its admissions process is fair. She suggested providing admissions officers implicit bias training, maintaining clear guidelines on the use of race in the admissions process, and monitoring race-related statistical disparities
The lawsuit has already given outsiders a glimpse into the College's famously secretive admissions process. During the high-profile, three-week trial last October, top administrators, expert witnesses, and current students testified about the College’s admissions policies and its diverse student population.
In the months leading up to the trial, thousands of pages of documents — including internal communications, depositions, and admissions scoring criteria — also became public, placing Harvard under further scrutiny.
Havard still faces a separate investigation by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division into the College's admissions policies. The DOJ opened its investigation at least as early as 2017 and filed a statement of interest in the SFFA lawsuit in August 2018 alleging that Harvard practices “unlawful racial discrimination” against Asian American applicants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard shuttered Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr.’s research lab, the Education Innovation Laboratory, on Monday after more than a decade of operation, according to its website.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced EdLabs would close in a July email to the Economics department that also detailed other sanctions against Fryer, who was the subject of three Harvard-led Title IX investigations and one financial investigation. Though Gay did not announce the results of individual investigations, she wrote at the time that the University found Fryer had “engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct” toward multiple individuals and had violated the FAS Professional Conduct Policy.
Fryer founded EdLabs in 2008 to examine the economic roots of racial inequality in educational achievement. The lab occupied the third floor of 1280 Massachusetts Ave. and counted the Pritzker Foundation, Edythe and Eli Broad, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation among its funders. Fryer and the researchers he employed pursued projects to assess charter schools’ effectiveness and explore the use of incentives in public education. His 2016 paper tracking racial disparities in the use of force by police officers attracted significant attention and controversy.
A lab employee first filed a Title IX complaint against Fryer nearly two years ago, alleging he created a hostile environment in EdLabs and had committed “egregious” acts of verbal sexual harassment. In the next several months, two more Title IX complaints, a financial investigation, and a now-closed investigation by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination followed. The New York Times reported that, at the close of the first Title IX investigation, Harvard found Fryer engaged in six of 32 counts of “unwelcome conduct.”
Gay announced the sanctions to the Economics department only after reviewing the results of all four Harvard-led inquiries. In addition to closing EdLabs, she placed Fryer on a two-year administrative leave, during which he cannot teach or conduct research using Harvard resources.
Fryer has repeatedly denied the allegations of sexual misconduct. He did not respond to a request for comment on EdLabs’s closure or his current employment. The venture capital firm Equal Opportunity Ventures currently lists Fryer as a founder and board member on its website.
Dennis R. Berounsky, who served as EdLabs’s finance associate before its closure, wrote in an email that the lab was in a state of flux well before Monday.
“For the past eighteen months, EdLabs has been a place of uncertainty and anxiety. Uncertainty over the ability to continue significant research connecting education and inequality. Anxiety over the always imminent loss of a job,” Berounsky wrote. “Harvard and the Faculties of Arts & Sciences have reached their conclusions, and while I don’t completely agree with their processes or outcomes, I do accept and respect their final decisions.”
In March 2018, several months after the first Title IX complaint was filed, Harvard barred Fryer and his chief of staff Bradley M. Allan from setting foot in the lab as part of a set of “interim measures.” The University also installed an interim director and required Fryer and Allan to copy the interim director on all emails sent to EdLabs staff.
If Fryer returns after his two-year leave, he will spend an additional two years unable to advise or supervise students, and will teach undergraduate classes “subject to monitoring by a Title IX-trained individual,” according to Gay’s July email.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email Friday that the University remains committed to the kind of work EdLabs pursued.
“Although the program will no longer continue, FAS remains steadfastly committed to fostering its important mission of eliminating educational inequality,” she wrote. “EdLabs staff members have been supported in a number of ways, including an extended notice period to wind down work and explore other job opportunities, as well as transitional assistance, including help with job searches.”
Dane declined to comment on whether the University has been in contact with the lab’s funders or how the University plans to use the space it occupied.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and 18 other colleges and universities jointly filed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Thursday as part of an ongoing lawsuit over the Trump administration’s attempt to end the Obama-era program.
The University of California originally filed the suit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2017, arguing that ending DACA — a program that allows undocumented youth brought to the U.S. as children to live and work in the U.S. — violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The Court is scheduled to hear arguments Nov. 12.
The amicus brief warns that if DACA is dismissed, “remarkable students” enrolled at the institutions would not obtain the “full benefit” of their education. The schools also wrote that the end of DACA would hurt recruitment and retention of talented international students.
“Indeed, ending DACA would force future scholars, innovators, and leaders to choose between withdrawing to the margins of our society and national economy or returning to countries that they have never called home,” the brief reads. “Whatever they choose, their gifts and education will be lost to this nation.”
Other schools joining Harvard in the brief include Yale, MIT, and Brown. The brief states each school has admitted DACA recipients.
Harvard has long lobbied for federal protections for its undocumented students and staff.
In July, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote a letter to United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan to convey his “deep concern” about uncertain immigration policies enacted by the Trump administration.
Later that summer, Bacow also worked to bring Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, a Palestinian resident of Lebanon who was denied entry into the U.S. by Custom and Border Protection agents in August, to campus to begin his freshman year.
Thursday’s brief quoted from a letter former University President Drew G. Faust wrote in August 2017 to President Donald Trump urging him to preserve DACA. The brief also noted that depriving DACA recipients of access to higher education would strip their hometowns of the resources they can provide after graduation.
“The DACA students at amici institutions—and the many thousands more enrolled at other colleges and universities—are by definition the product of this nation’s education system and the communities that support it,” the institutions wrote. “Through the opportunities provided by American institutions of higher education all over this country, including amici’s, these young people now have the skills to give back—in ways big and small—to the country that raised them.”
The brief includes information about Jin K. Park ’18-’19, a recent Harvard graduate and the first DACA beneficiary to become a Rhodes Scholar in United States history. Park — who was born in South Korea and moved to New York at age 7 — has lobbied for DACA protections since his graduation, testifying before Congress in March about his experiences as an undocumented immigrant.
Two other Harvard affiliates — Harvard Medical School graduate Dalia G. Larios and current Medical School student Blanca E. Morales — were also mentioned in the brief. The brief states Larios, now a doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was the first DACA recipient accepted to the Medical School.
