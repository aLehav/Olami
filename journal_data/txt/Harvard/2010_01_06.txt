After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two major Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals implemented caps on outside pay for senior officials who also sit on boards of pharmaceutical or medical device-making firms effective Jan. 1.
Medical experts have hailed the revised policy at Partners Healthcare—which owns Harvard-affiliates Mass. General and Brigham and Women's Hospitals—as one of the most stringent caps on pharmaceutical companies. The policy, initially released last April, comes as medical school faculty ties to industry have faced national scrutiny and growing criticism in the past couple of years.
Under the revised policy, senior officials at Partners Healthcare hospitals must limit compensation while serving as outside directors of pharmaceutical companies to no more than $5,000 a day. The policy also bans faculty—some who had been receiving more than $200,000 annually—from receiving stock options and accepting speaking engagements.
Partners implemented part of the revised policy in early October, according to Harvard Medical School professor Thomas P. Stossel, who has written extensively about the benefits of industry ties to medicine.
Stossel said that several departments at the two hospitals had brought in lawyers to explain the new Partners policy—as well as the Massachusetts state law passed in Aug. 2008 requiring pharmaceutical and medical device-making firms to publicly disclose gifts worth more than $50.
Following implementation of the new regulations, Stossel said, there has been "some outcry” but no "unified movement" from the near 8,000 physicians affiliated with Harvard.
“There has been no concerted effort on the part of the faculty to turn this around, and there is no evidence that the administration would respond to that,” he said.
“It is a serious case of taxation without representation,” Stossel added.
Others who denounce industry in medicine—like former New England Journal of Medicine editor Arnold S. Relman—have said that these restrictions are long overdue and do not go far enough.
“Transparency and disclosure helps, but it isn’t sufficient,” Relman said in June.
Harvard Medical School embarked on a review of its own conflict of interest policy in Jan. 2009 in conjunction with Harvard’s ongoing efforts to develop University-wide recommendations and guidelines. The school plans to release revised regulations later this year.
The move followed reports in June 2008 from Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, that psychiatrist Joseph Biederman of Harvard-affiliated Mass. General Hospital received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs that he used to treat children for bipolar disorders
At the Medical School, students have been pushing for more comprehensive disclosure policies across the school and its affiliated hospitals. The teaching hospitals are independent and operate under their own charters, and each has its own conflict of interest policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School professor Mary Tripsas will no longer be writing for The New York Times after violating a policy prohibiting writers from accepting anything of value from sources.
Tripsas—a business innovation expert who wrote for The Times' monthly column "Prototype" since August—was accused of accepting travel and lodging from a source. The day after her Dec. 26 column lauding 3M Company's customer innovation center was published, anonymous Times watchdog blog NYTPicker reported that 3M had paid for Tripsas' trip to a day-long briefing at the center on Nov. 12.
Clark Hoyt, the Times' public editor, announced Tripsas' dismissal in his column Saturday.
In her column, "Seeing Customers as Partners in Invention," Tripsas wrote that 3M was "at the forefront of a movement" in which companies better tailored products to clients by engaging with them in person and soliciting customer input during product development. 3M paid $820 in airfare and accommodation expenses for Tripsas' visit to the company's St. Paul headquarters.
An editor's note was appended to the column on Sunday, stating that the article "would not have been published in that form" if editors had known of the payment.
"Although I didn't realize it at the time, I did clearly violate The Times' policy, so it was perfectly fair for them to end our affiliation," Tripsas wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
"If I had carefully read the freelancer contract, the 54-page ethics booklet, and the conflict of interest questionnaire, the specific rule I violated would have been clear," she wrote, adding that editors had never discussed the rules with her. "I should have read them carefully, and I take full responsibility for what was clearly my mistake."
She maintained that she would not have written her column any differently had the expenses been charged to her faculty research account at Harvard Business  School instead.
Holt's Jan. 2 ombudsman column noted that Tripsas' trip was arranged before she started writing for The Times in August.
He added that Tripsas should not have been allowed to write about business from the start, as she teaches Harvard executive education classes customized for and paid by companies—a violation of the Times' policy banning commissions and assignments from news sources.
"Since the company pays Harvard and Harvard pays me, I would not have considered this a violation," Tripsas wrote, "but as one of the editors said to me in an e-mail, 'It was also news to me that executives were paying Harvard to have you train them. That—had it been disclosed to us in the beginning—would have precluded you doing the type of column for us that you are doing.'"
Todd A. Gitlin '63, a journalism and sociology professor at Columbia University, agreed it was unethical for Tripsas to write the column after being paid by its principal subject. He added that The Times should take more preventative measures by requiring its writers to disclose potential conflicts of interest.
"The scrutiny is too often on the relatively trivial and obvious conflict and less on the matter of disclosure," he said. "The Times should have some way of being able to certify to its readers that [writers] have no other obligation."
Tripsas' violation follows a string of ethics violations involving freelance writers. According to Hoyt's Jan. 2 column, Joshua Robinson is no longer working for the organization after allegedly presenting himself as a Times reporter to obtain free plane tickets. Mike Albo was also let go after accepting a free trip to Jamaica. Hoyt's Dec. 12 column indicated that freelancer Suzy Buckley's Nov. 22 review of Miami destinations included a restaurant co-owned by a former boyfriend.
Times guidelines state that freelancers are held to the same ethical standards as staff reporters.
"Just because money is tight in the industry doesn't mean that these kinds of arrangements should be more lax than they ever were," said Barry Sussman, editor of the Nieman Watchdog, a Web site associated with the Harvard-affiliated Nieman Foundation that monitors the press.
"If I were a reporter and I did these things, I'd be fired," Sussman added.

We “whiny, entitled Harvarders”  are accustomed to hearing our athletic department mocked—it seems  impossible to mention our school’s name without hearing some quip. Recently, Seth Kolloen of The SunBreak, a Seattle-based  blog, decided to join in on the fun—but little did he know that the Crimson  would have the last laugh.
In a season preview of Seattle University’s  basketball team, the Redhawks, Kolloen said that their star player Charles Garcia  “will be the most talented player on the floor in many of SU's  games this year (especially against Harvard).”
But when the two schools met on Jan.  2, it was Harvard who had the best player on the court: Jeremy S. Lin '10, whom Kolloen apparently hadn't heard of. “Had  I been a better blogger,” he conceded, “I would’ve noticed that  Harvard has a player named Jeremy Lin who is a pretty talented basketball  player—and at this moment a better one than Garcia.”
Kolloen then apologized for having “underestimated the talent of  the one decent player you’ve had since the Truman Admistation.” We think that Lin, who was named a Midseason Top 30 Candidate for the John R. Wooden Award (the highest national honor for college basketball) and a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award (which recognizes the nation's top point guard), is a bit more than just a "decent" player. In the Seattle  game, he put up 21 points, 4 steals, 2 rebounds, and 3 assists.
Although Lin’s teammates might be offended by Kolloer’s suggestion that Lin is the Crimson’s  only decent player, they seem to be letting their play do the talking. After all, Kyle D. Casey '13 put up 19 points—just as many as Garcia did—coming off the bench.
The game, of course, is now over, but it looks like the war over Kolleon's words is still in progress. Many of the (sometimes inflammatory) comments on his post seem to find his "apology" unsatisfactory. While it remains to be seen who will win the last word in that battle, the Crimson, with its 92-71 victory over the Redhawks, has already had the final say on the court.
